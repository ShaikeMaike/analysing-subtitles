I'm telling you, Arnold, your ball is flat.
It's not flat.
It's just a little low on air.
Like I said, your ball is flat.
I can't believe we let those fifth graders beat us.
- The thing is we tried our best.
- We got our buns whupped.
Come on, we had fun.
And we almost beat 'em.
Why do you always have to look on the bright side?
Somebody has to.
- Mr Green, what's going on?
- It's Scheck.
He wants to knock down the whole neighborhood and put up a fancy mall.
Who's Scheck?
The plan, approved
by the mayor moments ago,
would allow Future Tech Industries
to redevelop
a six-square-block area
between 33rd and 39th Streets.
I understand the president and CEO of Future Tech Industries,
Mr Scheck, is about to make a statement.
I'm delighted at the mayor's support of our renewal plan.
- Nice suit.
- Sh!
I am behind
Mr Scheck's project 100%.
Although some of you may have concerns about how this plan will impact your homes and businesses,
I assure you, change is good.
This plan represents the end of urban decay, the end of your broken-down shops and apartment buildings, the end of antiquated and dilapidated storefronts.
It's time for a new world.
Out with the old, in with the new.
What's wrong with old things?
Some are great.
- Yeah, like Mrs Vitello.
- Whippersnapper.
The city council are against it, but the mayor's lettin' him do it.
- I never figured he'd pull it off.
- What does it mean?
They want us to move away so Scheck's corporation can move in.
- No!
- No way!
It's time to put the past behind us.
I have seen the future, and it's Future Tech Industries.
- But this is our neighborhood.
- They can't just tear it down.
This is our neighborhood
How can they tear it down
How can they turn our smile
Into a frown
We may be just a few
But if me and you and you
- No. No singing, Eugene.
- I thought the occasion called for it.
- We may be just a few...
- No. This is serious.
Oh, my...
We can't take this lying down.
We should do something.
- Yeah, but what can we do?
- We can refuse to sell our houses.
Sign a petition!
This is our neighborhood and we're not giving it up without a fight!
Arnold! What an annoying little goody two-shoes.
What a dopey little dreamer.
What a corny little cornball.
Always trying to get everyone to look on the bright side.
How I despise him. And yet...
I love him! I love his unerring sense of right and wrong.
I love his insistence on the needs of the many over the needs of the few.
I love most how his hair smells up close, then he looks at me and
I make an excuse for being so close.
Then I insult him to cover up the secret, adoring feelings which I have so long and painfully harbored. Oh, Arnold!
- Mr Green can write the petition.
- Say no more. I'm already on it.
If only I had the guts to tell you.
If only I weren't such a coward and had your strength.
We'll get everybody to sign.
What if you lose and the neighborhood is torn down, you move away and we never see each other again and I never tell you how I really feel about you?
Oh, Arnold, how I love you.
Dad!
- How's it going, Miriam?
- Molasses, it's you.
- Great, but where does the store go?
- Here. Big Bob's Beeper Emporium.
Big sign, can't miss it, and the overpass drops you right in the parkin' lot.
- That's good. Right in the stinkin' lot.
- Dad?
- What, Olga?
- It's Helga, Dad.
- That's what I said.
- Could we talk?
- We gotta split. We'll talk.
- Right.
Send me the paperwork.
I can't wait to start.
- Can I keep this pop-up thing?
- You got it.
Know what this is? It's our future.
Here's where my new Super
Beeper Emporium is gonna go up, right after we rip down the flower shop,
Green Meats and the rest.
Yeah, about all that... Lots of people will have to sell up and move.
What's your point?
I was just wondering if this whole tear-down-the-neighborhood
Future Tech thing is really necessary.
It's more than necessary.
It's progress.
You can't have progress without pain.
No pain, no gain.
What's wrong with leaving things the way they are?
Leave things the way they are and
Big Bob's Emporium doesn't happen.
But, Dad...
I'll say this once, and I want you to hear it. Change is good.
When the new Big Bob's
Super Beeper Emporium goes up, the cash will roll in and you'll forget the old neighborhood.
And do you know why?
Because we'll be rich.
That means you'll be rich.
You can have that pony.
- I wanted a pony when I was five.
- What do you want now?
- I don't know.
- Make up your mind,
'cause once my store goes up, you can have anything you want.
- Anything?
- That's what I said.
We're gonna be stinkin' rich, girl. Rich.
What's more important than that, huh?
- Grandpa?
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.
- Grandpa, I'm worried.
- Oh, don't worry, Arnold.
We won't sell up.
We're right behind you. Right, pookie?
Home team, home team, woo!
What if Scheck makes everyone else sell?
Then I guess they'll bulldoze down the neighborhood.
We'll have to move to an old folks' home and who knows what'll happen to you.
You'll probably be sent to a foster home in some Midwestern state like Manitoba or...
Wait. No, that's not a state, that's a province.
Oh, no, Arnold!
You'll be a Canadian!
- Grandpa, I'm serious.
- I know, but we're not cooked yet.
Whatever happens, we'll all be OK, even if we have to become Canadians.
They have very good bacon there.
Canadian. Bacon. This thing on?
Come on, Arnold. Work with me.
Goodnight, Grandpa.
- Goodnight, Grandma.
- Go, team!
Awesome!
Release.
- What's going on?
- You must be a sound sleeper.
They've been hammering on it all morning.
- Look!
- Willikers!
- It's so wicked awesome.
- It's not awesome.
It's terrible. Read it. We've got
30 days to save the neighborhood.
Look, it's that Scheck fella.
It's time for a new world.
Out with the old, in with the new.
I have seen the future
and it's Future Tech Industries.
He sure gives me the willies.
But he looks good in a suit.
- Gerald.
- I know. I'm just saying.
Come on!
Monkeyman!
Yeah, six days to go, and then sayonara, suckers!
Six days. Enough time to try maybe one last big thing.
- But what?
- How about a party?
You always throw the most
outr√© parties, Arnold.
Yeah, a party. A block party.
With music and food.
- And finger sandwiches.
- And food!
We'll have a concert so loud we'll get on the news.
Then people would get excited and the mayor will have to change her mind.
And she'll stop the bulldozers.
What do we call it?
Save the Neighborhood
Debutante Ball.
Block Power, baby.
- Blockenanny.
- Block Till You Drop.
It's a Block Thing.
Y'all wouldn't know.
A Block Party... Party?
- How about Blockapalooza?
- Yeah!
- Blockapalooza.
- This Saturday is the day.
- Blockapalooza!
- Get your tickets while they're hot!
"Save the neighborhood"?
"Blockapalooza"? This we don't need.
It's Nick. I think we got a problem.
Blockapalooza, hah! Please.
It's called Blockapalooza, a last-ditch effort to save a forgotten neighborhood from the wrecking ball.
A classic story of the little guy pitted against the corporate giant.
- They'll mess up the deal!
- Forget it. It's all taken care of.
This is our last chance to stand up
and tell Future Tech Industries
we won't sell.
We won't let 'em tear down
our neighborhood.
We intercepted their permit, making the whole assemblage illegal.
Go, go, go.
- What's going on?
- This whole assemblage is illegal.
- But we filed a permit.
- We never got any permit.
Disperse from this area at once.
- Grandma?
- Bring on your worst.
- We shall not be moved.
- Come on. Nice and easy.
Stop! That's a frail old lady.
Never give up. Never give in.
Save the neighborhood.
One if by land, two if by sea.
Put the lime in the coconut.
Mix it all up.
Well, that's it.
This place belongs to Scheck now.
They've got the cops on their side. I give up.
Me too. I'm selling my place.
Goodbye, old neighborhood.
I'll miss you.
Selling?
I'll go try and get Grandma out of jail.
- Then we'd better get packing.
- We can't give up. It's not over.
That Scheck character has us covered from every angle, short man.
Wait! Where are you all going?
Come back. Come back.
Out with the old, in with the new.
I've seen the future. Change is good.
Only two more days.
There's gotta be some way to stop the bulldozers.
There's nothing more we can do.
Face it. In two days, this neighborhood is coming down and we'll just have to move on.
I just want to do something.
Baby carriage!
I see it. Saving the neighborhood isn't a game.
It's real life. And in real life, you can't always win.
I can win Runaway Bus every time but that's because it's a game.
- I guess.
- You did your best, buddy.
What are you guys doing?
Just looking at a piece of history.
Four years ago, we made these handprints in the cement.
"Sid and Stink."
- Sid and Stink?
- It only says Stink because just when
I was fixing to write the Y,
Sid's old man came along, and we had to hightail it.
I always thought that made it even cooler.
We thought it'd be there forever, but after they tear down the neighborhood,
I reckon nobody'll even remember.
Yeah.
- Hi, Mr Green.
- Look, that was me, aged four.
My grandfather did it.
He was proud of me.
He used to say, "One day,
Green Meats will be your shop."
Sure enough, my father took it over
and then he passed it on to me.
That was the proudest day of my life.
I always knew one day I'd pass
the shop on to my own son.
I guess now that's never gonna happen.
Because they're tearing down the neighborhood?
No. Because my son hates meat.
He's a vegetarian.
We haven't spoken in years.
Still, I never thought I'd be the last Green to run Green Meats.
Another couple of days, it's all gonna be just a pile of bricks.
Excuse me, Arnold.
- Grandma?
- Still in jail.
- I thought it was just one night.
- She keeps trying to escape.
Thinks it's a game.
Fourth time they put her back.
Hi. Have you seen Grandpa?
Oh, Arnold. We may never see each other again.
Mr Hyunh, can I help you clean out your refrigiterator?
- Grandpa, what are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.
You haven't sold the house yet.
It's only a matter of time.
Everyone else has sold.
Scheck owns the whole block now, except for us. I have to sell.
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither.
I was born in this house.
My dad got it in the 1890s, over a hundred years ago.
Won it in a card game from a man his dad had fought in the Tomato Incident.
- The Tomato Incident?
- Yes, the Tomato Incident.
Now, that was a good story.
The Yanks won rights
to this land after the Pig War.
But we still paid
taxes to the British
on all sorts of goods, including
tobacco, meats and vegetables.
The whole town was in a snit
over a new tomato tax.
The Brits were adding a nickel
on every tomato.
People were spoiling for a fight.
- What happened?
- The Tomato Incident.
My grandpa and his neighbors overturned a cart of British tomatoes on this very street.
Soldiers were sent to arrest him by order of the colonial governor,
Archibald Von Scheck.
- Von Scheck?
- I wonder if he's any relation.
Von Scheck's men attacked the neighborhood but the locals used guerrilla warfare.
They made a barricade of vegetable carts and fought with whatever they had.
They had lots of tomatoes.
They were British tomatoes,
which were small and hard
and really hurt
if you got hit with one.
Let her rip.
That did it. The redcoats were
in full, ignominious retreat.
That's why we eat
American tomatoes, Arnold.
Although I had one recently from Chile. Very juicy.
- Did that actually happen?
- Of course.
- I sliced it up and put it in a sandwich.
- No. Don't you see?
- This is our answer.
- Yes!
Juicy tomatoes from Chile.
Why didn't I think of that?
No, the Tomato Incident.
If that battle happened right here, this whole neighborhood should be a national landmark.
There probably was a document that declared this block a historic site once.
Maybe I can find it. I show it to the mayor, and she'll stop the bulldozers.
They couldn't tear down these buildings ever!
Mr Green and Mrs Vitello could keep their shops,
Sid and Stinky's handprints would stay, and you, Grandma, and me could keep living like before.
Nothing would change. Grandpa, don't sell the boarding house.
I'll find that document and save the neighborhood.
You're a bold kid. I'm with you!
But you better hurry before the bulldozers knock down the whole thing.
Change is good. I've seen the future
and the future is FTI.
My Emporium goes here where we're knocking down these old shops?
- Right.
- That's in the contract?
- Absolutely.
- There's no funny business?
Am I a rat fink? It's all on the up-and-up.
Trust me. All you gotta do is sign.
Big... Bob... Pataki!
Beautiful. It's all settled.
In two days, we'll tear down the old and make way for the new.
Then all we gotta do is sit back and watch the moolah roll in.
- You've got a way with words.
- Can I keep the pen?
Oh, Arnold, another moral dilemma...
Stick with Big Bob and get rich or find some way to help you, my beloved, noble Arnold, whom I have so long adored.
If only I knew what to do.
If only I had a sign.
Perfect.
OK, Arnold, you convinced me.
We find that document, show the mayor, prove that the neighborhood is a legal national landmark and stop the bulldozers.
And we're gonna do it all in the next 46 hours and 19 minutes.
- Right.
- Should be plenty of time.
Arnold! I mean, watch where you're going, football head.
Sorry. We're in a hurry.
We've gotta find a document to save the neighborhood.
If you think you're gonna save it you're dopier than I thought.
All the papers are signed.
In two days, this place is gonna be a parking lot.
End of story. Any questions?
Yeah. Do you think you could lend us bus fare?
- We're a little short, Helga.
- It's like I'm living in Loser City.
Since my dad's Super Emporium is gonna be built on the ashes of your old lives, and I'm gonna get rich,
I guess I can give you change for the bus.
Thanks.
Good luck.
You're gonna need it, losers.
Where are we going?
To the one person that can help us: Mr Bailey.
- At the Federal Office of Information?
- Right. I know he can help us.
I can't help you.
C-A-N, apostrophe, T. Can't.
But this is important.
So is my job.
Look at all this work I got.
I have no time to check on a document that was probably lost 50 years ago.
Leave me alone. I don't know how you got in here anyway.
But if we don't find that document, everything's gonna be torn down:
Mr Green's butcher shop,
Mrs Vitello's flower shop.
The video store, the arcade.
How many ways can I say it?
I can't help you.
Bowling alley. Slausen's ice cream.
- I don't want to lose my patience.
- Dolly's Donuts.
- Dolly's Donuts?
- Yeah. That great donut shop.
- What did you say?
- Just that it's a shame they're gonna tear down
Dolly's Donuts.
Yeah. Dolly's Donuts.
Two days from now, they're history.
No more Dolly's Donuts, Mr Bailey.
But I love those donuts.
Nobody makes a cruller like Dolly.
I've been going to Dolly's every day for
30 years. I couldn't survive without 'em.
How can they tear down an institution like Dolly's? That's just savage.
- I know. But, hey, what can you do?
- Right. See you, Mr Bailey.
Where are you going?
You want to save your neighborhood?
Come on, then.
We've got a document to find.
This is it. When the computer stops, it'll spit out a card telling us everything the system knows about where your tomato document is.
"The location of your document is unknown."
I'm sorry, boys.
- It's all right. Thanks for your help.
- You did your best.
What do we do now?
It's probably not worth mentioning, but I know a guy, the city coroner...
He's kind of, well, a nut.
But he's a well-known history buff and keeps all kinds of records on old historical papers.
- Maybe he could help you.
- Where is he?
They look like they're closed.
Let's come back later.
- We don't have time. Come on.
- You first.
Hello?
Hello! I was just taking a nap.
Did I scare you?
I scare most people.
Not intentionally, you understand.
Just the nature of the job.
Anyhoo, what can I do for you?
The Tomato Incident did indeed happen.
In fact, it was a major historical turning point in the birth of the country.
What about the document?
There was, as I recall, a document stating that your neighborhood was officially declared a national landmark.
Not an especially well-known document, but official nonetheless.
And I just may have a file on it.
I keep my historical records in here.
Wrong drawer.
Here we go. Tomato Incident...
Tomato Incident, Tomato Incident,
Tomato, Tomato, Tomato.
Tomato Incident! Here it is.
According to my records, there was a document detailing the official status of your neighborhood as a national landmark.
- What happened to it?
- Let's see.
It was contained in a collection of local historical papers which were sold at auction five years ago to a private corporation.
There's no record of a name, but there is an address.
66613 Riverside Highway.
It's out on the peninsula.
Going to the peninsula?
Don't talk to the driver while the bus is in motion.
- But the bus isn't in motion.
- Now it is. Get behind the yellow line.
We're close, Gerald.
Future Tech Industries.
- Future Tech Industries?
- They've got the document?
Future Tech has the document that could save the neighborhood.
- Now what?
- We'll talk to Mr Scheck.
You can't talk to Mr Scheck without an appointment.
- Then we'll make one.
- He doesn't make appointments.
All righty, then. Have a nice day.
Right. Goodbye.
- There's cameras everywhere.
- I think they're watching us.
Man, this is creepy.
Let's get away from here.
- Security?
- Yes, Mr Scheck?
There are two boys in the hallway,
40 feet from your security desk.
- What? Sir, I...
- Apprehend them and bring them to my office.
Life is just a bowl of cherries
We found these boys wandering the halls unescorted.
- Without security clearance?
- That's right, sir.
This is serious, isn't it?
We can't have young boys wandering around Future Tech Industries unescorted without security clearance, now, can we?
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
And these small boys just snuck past security and wandered about the building unescorted. Right?
- Yes, sir.
- Who's responsible for that?
Aren't you head of security?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- "Sir. Yes, sir."
- Is that all you can say?
- No, sir. I mean, yes, sir.
There he goes again.
Why don't you just go now.
Go back to being head of security.
How many others are wandering around Future Tech unescorted while you stand here like a big, dumb stiff repeating "Sir, yes, sir."
Yes, sir!
What can you do with him?
He's like a wind-up doll.
"Yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir."
I'll tell you, it's hard to get good help nowadays.
It must be upsetting to be dragged unceremoniously into my office like this, but I can't have boys wandering the halls of my company unescorted. You understand?
My name is Scheck.
Who are you?
We live in the neighborhood you want to tear down.
- That I'm going to tear down.
- We heard there's a document saying it's a national landmark and can't be torn down by anybody.
I've heard about that, too.
I had my people investigate.
You know what they found?
The document doesn't exist.
The whole thing's just a rumor, bogus.
If there were such a document,
I'd never go through with my plan.
But it must exist. It was part of a historical paper collection.
Look, as much as I admire your thoroughness and direct approach, the fact remains, neither you nor I have the document.
So the neighborhood's coming down.
Any questions?
What if we said we don't buy your story?
Security.
That went well.
Scheck is not a good man.
But he's a natty dresser.
- What's wrong?
- I just had an interesting conversation with two young boys:
One had a weird stack of hair, the other was a football-headed kid.
Bob, know anything about a football-headed kid?
I don't know nothing about no football-headed kid.
Are you sure? Because there was one nosing around here asking about that document.
You know the one I mean.
The document that could mess up our whole operation?
It's locked in the records room.
Nobody has a key except us.
I haven't seen a kid like that around, but I will keep my eyes open.
I'm not ready to give up yet.
You're gonna have to face the facts:
There's nothing we can do.
- There's gotta be something.
- It would take a miracle.
- Hello?
- The document you seek exists.
- They're hiding it from you.
- Who is this?
- Call me Deep Voice.
- Who are you?
I can't say, but I can tell you
that Scheck is up to no good.
The only thing
that can stop him is that document.
- How do you know about it?
- Let's just say I know.
- Where is the document?
- At FTI in a safe deposit box.
- Nick Vermicelli has the key.
- But how?
Follow Nick and you'll find the key.
I'll be in touch.
But wait! Who are you?
That is too freaky. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. I'm in. What's the plan?
We find Nick Vermicelli.
Then we spy on him, until we find out where he's hiding the key to the safe deposit box.
We steal the key, sneak in to FTI and get the document.
We evade the security guards, then all we have to do is deliver the document to the mayor, who declares the neighborhood a landmark and stops the bulldozers.
Arnold, that's a long plan.
I know. But we gotta do it.
We'll need some special equipment.
This may sound crazy, but I've heard of this girl, Bridget, who lives across town, kind of an equipment specialist.
- Is this right?
- It's the address Fuzzy Slippers gave.
- How do you know she'll help?
- Because Bridget helps people.
That's how the legend goes.
- Maybe she's not home.
- What's this button?
- You shouldn't touch that.
- What could happen?
- Which one of you touched my button?
- Me.
If you're gonna save the neighborhood, you're gonna need some equipment.
State of the art.
Mini condenser microphone for the ultimate concealed surveillance.
Headphones and micro-radar tracking dish.
400:1 zoom lens binoculars with infrared capability for night vision.
High tension, plastic wire, anodized steel pulleys and nylon straps for maneuvering in vertically-challenging situations.
A two-way secure walkie-talkie for maintaining communication.
And a synchronized, programmable, glow-in-the-dark watch set to Greenwich time and accurate within 1/10,000th of a second.
It all fits into this cool
AS-47 Junior Secret Agent utility belt.
How much does this cost?
Since it's for a good cause, it's on the house.
- I figure it's my contribution.
- Great. We'll take two.
- Do they come in other colors?
- Black or pink.
- We'll take black.
- What about this?
- Why do we need a remote-control car?
- You never know.
Whatever you say.
The neighborhood is counting on you.
Good luck, boys.
- What are you doing here?
- Walking, until you knocked me down.
Sorry. We were just...
Out playing your dumb secret agent game. Aren't you a little old for that?
Come on. We got things to do.
What, some new plan to save the neighborhood?
- That's right.
- Let's roll.
Take off those lame shades so you can see where you're walking.
Good luck, Hardy Boys.
You're gonna need it.
Oh, my brave little football-headed hero on yet another absurd quest, to save the only home you've ever known, armed with nothing but your best friend and your sporty utility belt.
Godspeed, my steed, my only, my love.
This is the place.
Could you open the door?
We need to get out really bad.
- We gotta follow him. He's got a key.
- The bus stops at the corner of 43rd.
Juvenile delinquents.
- We're way under 21.
- Maybe we can get in around back.
Ain't this a great old block
Don't you wish we could
roll back the clock
Oh, the windows we busted
The hubcaps we stole
The apples we boosted
The bums that we rolled
The fun that we had
violating parole
- Ain't this a great old block, Doc
- Got her.
- What are they saying?
- So, is the key safe?
Course it's safe. I got it right here.
Good. We wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands.
They're talking about a key.
Maybe it's the key
Deep Voice mentioned.
Don't worry about the key.
- What key?
- What's goin' on?
- What happened? Did I do that?
- Who's doing that?
This thing on?
Sorry about that, folks.
- Hit it, Tony.
- Get a busboy over here.
Clean this up. Get us more drinks.
Yo, busboys! What are you, deaf?
Clean up this mess or I'll make you wear it.
Look. The key. It's around his neck.
And get us two more Bartletts.
No ice this time. And no lipstick.
- We'll get those for you right away.
- Right away.
Football-headed kid!
Here's the deal.
The boys are risking their life with some crazy plan to get a rare historic document from Scheck and they don't stand a chance.
We must think of a back-up scheme that'll bail us out when their crazy, lamebrained plan fizzles.
So come on. Think of a plan.
It's got to be smart, logical and feasible.
We could paint the house with vanishing cream.
- Then it would be invisible.
- That is the stupidest idea ever.
What if it rains? Ding-dong.
You ever think about that?
It'll wash the vanishing cream off, and then everyone'll see us.
What we gotta do is build a dummy neighborhood one block over.
You're the dummy.
That will never work!
Yeah? I don't see you coming up with anything.
Dig a little deeper into the caverns of your puny mind.
Digging? Caverns?
Hey, wait a minute.
- That reminds me! The secret tunnels!
- What secret tunnels?
Pretty impressive, eh? A network of tunnels that honeycomb the block and possibly lead to the rest of the neighborhood.
I hate it. It's dark, and it smells.
- It's very creepy.
- Let's go back.
Wait, wait. Listen.
One tunnel goes under the street from our house to the one opposite.
If we wire it with explosives, we'll blow a hole in the street that the bulldozers can't cross.
Yeah? Just one little detail.
Where you gonna get the explosives?
From you, of course.
Just go down to your job site and lift a couple hundred pounds of explosives when no one's looking.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard, especially considering
I got twice that much under my bed.
What? We all got our little peccadilloes.
- Finally.
- Let's hope he's ready for bed.
He should be. It's midnight.
As soon as he's asleep, we can get the key off him.
As soon as he falls asleep? What if he keeps watching TV for hours?
Maybe there's nothing good on.
Someone's calling him. Quick!
Last time we nearly got killed using that thing.
We gotta find out who's calling him.
- It might be a clue.
- All right.
- That's Big Bob.
- Yeah, Bob. You're a full partner.
What're you calling for?
What about your contract?
You got a problem with the contract?
Quit reading it and get some rest.
- Stinkin' pain in the...
- That no-good runt!
"Party of the first part, party of the second part..."
Yada, yada, yada, yada.
Wait a minute. What the heck!
I think he's finally asleep, Gerald.
Give me that key!
I was just resting my eye.
- Time to go in.
- Wait.
You're not gonna hang from that?
- Not unless you want to.
- It's not my size.
No problem. I'll fix it.
Come on.
Almost there. You can do it.
What is that? Who's going?
It's an angel.
- Good job getting the key.
- Deep Voice. Where are you?
Never mind.
I'm watching all your movements.
I'm everywhere and nowhere, but mostly I'm everywhere.
Come on, cut the voodoo dolly mumbo jumbo.
Why must you be so mysterious?
You seem confused about who's calling the shots. I am.
Without me,
you'll never get the document.
You must get into Scheck's office.
His safe deposits are behind his desk.
- We have to get back into his office?
- Only this time, don't get caught.
Find a way to distract security
away from the main entrance.
Now, it's exactly two a.m.
The bulldozers roll at seven.
What are you waiting for?
Man, that Deep Voice is a pain in the...
Come on.
It's us. How you been?
So it's the two juvenile delinquents who busted my door.
Think you can make up your own rules, come and go as you please?
Couple of renaissance men.
- Sorry about that.
- But we're kinda in a hurry... Murray.
Don't talk to the driver while the vehicle's in motion.
The stinkin' bus is fallin' apart.
I know we're not supposed to talk to you, but could you drive a little faster?
I drive 25 miles an hour, no exceptions, no discussion.
- I wonder what bee got in his boxers.
- You'd have one too if you were in my moccasins.
My girlfriend left me two weeks ago.
Her name is Mona.
- She said she wanted a whole man.
- What's that mean?
I lost the real one in the war.
She thought it was cool at first.
In walks Johnny Come Lately and I'm out the doggie door.
You meet a girl. You think it's forever, then the whole thing goes kablooey.
She broke my heart, and although I still love her,
I made up my mind that from now on,
I ain't gonna care about nothin' or stick my neck out for nobody.
- I'm only looking out for number one.
- That was an inspiring story.
Isn't there another bus we can take to FTI?
Those cameras detect any motion.
If we move, they'll see us.
This is no time for playing with toy cars.
I'm not playing, Gerald.
What was that?
We can get to Scheck's office this way. Come on.
Deep Voice said to look in the room behind his desk.
What are you waiting for?
We'd better get started.
That's the last of it, Gramps.
Now all we do is run this wire up to the street and wait for the bulldozers to come.
Then we blow a huge hole, and they fall right in.
Sounds great.
Now, let's get out of here.
Yes, it is still very creepy.
Wake up!
I've just read the fine print.
So it's Scheck's Beeper Emporium, is it?
You're trying to double-cross me.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I read the contract!
I get a new Beeper Emporium, but Scheck gets 51% of my company!
It's true, but you signed a contract.
There's nothing you can do.
- The ink's dry.
- You were in on it!
- You knew he was gonna shaft me!
- So what? It's a free country.
If it's a free country, I guess I'm free to beat the living snot out of ya!
- Bob, don't get crazy.
- Too late!
The key. What happened?
Oh, no. That dream I had, that angel...
That wasn't no angel.
It was that football-headed kid!
It was really happening!
He must've stole the stinkin' key!
Yeah, Mr Scheck, it's me, Nick.
Bad news. I think I lost the key.
Yeah, the key. I think that football-headed kid took it.
I was asleep.
I think he snuck in and stole it.
Yeah, I know.
I'm stupid, stupid.
- Empty?
- Where's the document?
Looking for something?
Here you are, back again.
After I'd patiently explained that your mission is hopeless.
It still is, though I'm less inclined to entertain you after you broke into my building again.
You thought you could get away with this?
There are cameras everywhere.
I record everything that goes on.
Did you think I'd let you save your little neighborhood?
Don't you realize who I am?
Alphonse Perrier De Von Scheck.
I can trace my ancestry to the founding fathers.
Do you know when we lost control of this city?
When that ridiculous Tomato Incident took place in your neighborhood.
Tearing it down and putting my name in its place will be the sweetest revenge.
But the document.
Where's the document?
Unfortunately, like your little plan, it's about to go up in smoke.
My guards will now lock you away where you won't cause more trouble.
Run!
Get them, for heaven's sake.
They went thataway. Come on.
There they are!
I'll lose them on the stairway.
Head for the garage.
Find a way out.
Call me on the walkie.
Arnold, what happened?
- Where are you?
- Where's the document?
- Scheck burned it.
- Burned it?
Right in front of us.
He laughed at us.
He said we never had a chance.
He's gonna win.
- Don't give up.
- Why not? It's over.
It's not. There must be something.
- Aren't there any other copies?
- No. He wouldn't make a copy.
There were video cameras all over the place.
They record everything that goes on in Scheck's building.
- Scheck said so himself.
- The document must be on videotape.
Get to the room with the video recorders, find the tape and catch him burning the document.
We can show the tape to the police and it'll be as good as the document itself.
We can win, Deep Voice.
We can save the neighborhood.
Down here.
What the?
Warning: Intruder, level five.
Warning: Intruder, level five.
- I got it!
- I thought he burned it.
And I got it all on videotape for the police. It's just as good, maybe better.
I am moved by your greatness.
Get out of there!
I'll wait till the guards are gone.
I'm on the street.
I'll get a cab and meet you out front.
We've got 24 minutes before the bulldozers roll.
We can make it.
See you in two, Gerald.
Don't go out yet.
It's swarming with guards.
How do you know I'm here?
Don't worry.
You've got the evidence you need.
We've got to get you out of the building.
- If you're caught now, all is lost.
- How can I get out of here?
Wait until the guards go to the other side of the building.
I'll distract them, but it'll only buy you a few minutes.
They're covering the elevators and the stairs.
Don't come any closer.
Ignore that man with the voice box.
- Who are you?
- No one.
No more games. I'm not doing anything until I know who you are.
You? You're Deep Voice?
- Looks like it.
- But I don't get it.
Why couldn't you just tell me?
- Why the secret identity?
- No reason.
You just risked everything to help me.
- So? What's your point?
- Pretty amazing thing to do.
- I'm a pretty amazing person.
- I thought you were on your dad's side.
- You were gonna get rich.
- Money isn't everything.
- Why'd you do it?
- It's my civic duty.
- 'Cause I love a good mystery.
- Come on. Why?
I don't know. Maybe I just took pity on you and your stupid friends.
- Why?
- 'Cause...
...maybe I don't hate you as much as I thought.
Maybe I even like you a little.
You might even say I like you a lot.
You did this for me?
That's right. What do you do when someone you love is in trouble?
- Love?
- You heard me. I love you.
Who else has been stalking you, building shrines to you, filling books with poems about you?
I love you.
I've always loved you since I first saw your stupid football head.
From that moment,
I've lived and breathed for you, dreamed of telling you my secret feelings, and grabbing you and kissing you!
Come here, you big lug!
I'm confused.
Did you just say you loved me?
Are you deaf?
- Not now!
- Not now?
Oh, Arnold, just hold me.
- I need to think.
- Do the thinking for both of us now.
This is all happening too fast.
I feel dizzy. I need to lie down.
- Wonderful. I'll go with you.
- No.
There's no time. We've got
20 minutes before the bulldozers roll.
- Bulldozers?
- The neighborhood.
We have to save the neighborhood.
Come on. Let's roll.
Oh no.
I couldn't find a cab. Come on.
- What's she doing here?
- No time to explain.
We got exactly 16 minutes to stop the bulldozers.
Behind the yellow line.
That football-headed kid and his little pals have the document on videotape and they're headed uptown on city bus number 13.
- Get 'em!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
All right, everybody, listen.
There's a bus headed uptown.
Your job is to stop it.
- Couldn't you go a little faster?
- 25 mph. No exceptions, no discussion.
- But lives are at stake.
- Not my problem.
The thing is, Murray, we're in a hurry.
A neighborhood's about to be torn down and we can stop 'em.
We have to get there in 14 minutes.
I'll get you there when I get you there, which, according to my schedule, will be in about 44 minutes.
- That'll be too late.
- We have to get there in 14 minutes.
Then you're gonna have to sprout wings and fly.
- Don't you wanna save people's homes?
- Not my problem.
Don't you care that every building from 33rd to 39th Street will be demolished?
- 33rd to 39th Street?
- Right.
That's where Mona lives.
Hang on to your goodies.
We got a neighborhood to save.
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.
Pray this hunk of junk holds together long enough to get us uptown in one piece.
- Where's Arnold?
- Look!
- In position.
- Do it.
Roger that.
- I didn't know you were religious.
- Neither did I.
His fake leg's stuck. I can't budge it.
Gerald, you'll have to drive.
- Him?
- Are you crazy?
You're the top-scoring Runaway Bus player at the arcade.
That's a game. This is real life.
I know you can do it.
Why do you always have to look on the bright side?
"We can save the neighborhood and find the document."
- "You can drive the bus."
- Somebody has to.
Get on the floor. You too, Helga.
- Why?
- Because I'm driving the bus, OK?
And because I'm nine, and I can't reach the pedals.
Arnold, you work the clutch.
Helga, you work the brakes.
And try to get Murray's fake leg off the stinking gas pedal!
Brake!
My cans!
Clutch!
You take the high road
and I'll take the low road
What are those guys up to?
- Is the overpass wired?
- Yes.
- Blow it.
- Boss, this is pretty serious.
- Serious?
- As in 15 to life.
Just do it, you incompetent moron!
All right. It's seven o'clock.
Time to take it all down.
- Why'd I eat chilli for breakfast?
- Easy, Gramps. Don't blow yet.
As soon as I push down this plunger, we'll commence
Operation Stop the Bulldozer.
What's goin' on? 286-DX plunger, high-gauge wire, C-47 tubing.
I know, you're planning to blow the street up, make a hole big enough to stop the bulldozers.
- You could do serious jail time.
- Well, I...
You need any help?
- We can't make it!
- Let's jump out.
No. Use the truck.
We can jump the hole!
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard! Let's do it!
- What happened?
- It's OK. We're jumping the ramp.
What ramp?
- What smells so rank?
- Get out.
- Now what?
- Grandma!
- What about her? She's in jail.
- She was.
Yea, Grandma!
- She's going back to jail.
- I know.
Hang on!
- I got it! I got the tape!
- That's wonderful. What tape?
The tape that'll prove this neighborhood is a historic landmark and can never be destroyed.
All I need is a VCR, and I can show you.
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Bridget?
Up here.
Tape her.
Wow.
Who does she think she is?
Catwoman?
Oh, my word! That's enough for me.
As your mayor, I reclaim this entire neighborhood as a national historic landmark never to be torn down.
It's after seven o'clock. What are you idiots waiting for? Knock it down!
It's that lying crook, Scheck!
Come on! Let's get the car!
I got the hubcap!
I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for that meddling football head, the kid with the weird hair and that one-eyebrowed brat.
Tell it to the judge, you big donut-hole!
Tell it to your cell mate in Folsom.
- Where are you going?
- I'll make it up to you.
I'll buy you breakfast.
We'll talk. They have a special.
Willikers, what a day!
Fistfights, car chases and political intrigue.
Don't forget about the overpass blowin' up!
And it's only 7.30 in the morning!
I wanna go back to bed.
I'm exhausted.
Change is good.
Change is good.
I thought we set the explosion down the middle of the street.
You didn't see nothing. Scatter.
What happened? We made it!
Mona?
You saved the neighborhood!
You're my hero.
I'm so sorry I made fun of your leg.
- I don't care. I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Murray.
I love you just the way you are.
- Pretty crazy day.
- Yeah, we said a lot of nutty things.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
About all that stuff I said, Arnold, I...
- It was crazy back there...
- With all the excitement we just...
- Got carried away?
- You didn't really mean all that?
You don't really love me?
- Right.
- You were caught up in the moment.
- Right.
- You actually hate me, don't you?
Of course I hate you, you stupid football head, and don't ever forget it!
Yes!
I guess we did it, Arnold.
- We saved the neighborhood.
- Yep. Everything's back to normal.
Shall we go shoot some hoops?
Gerald, our ball's flat, remember?
- No. Just a little low on air.
- Wait.
- You're looking on the bright side?
- Somebody has to.
We saved our neighborhood
They could not tear it down
They could not turn our smile
- Into a frown
- The show's over, Eugene.
Aah!
Wee-be-be-bee.
Will you take a look at that?
Pretty pathetic, huh?
Well, you'll never believe this, but that llama you're looking at was once a human being
And not just any human being
That guy was an emperor
A rich, powerful ball of charisma
Oh, yeah!
This is his story
Well, actually my story
That's right--
I'm that llama
The name is Kuzco
Emperor Kuzco
I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason
Oh, is that hard to believe?
Look, I tell you what
You go back away-- you know, before
I was a llama, and this will all make sense
All right, now see, that's a little too far back
Oh, ho! Look at me!
That's me as a baby
Waah!
Ahem! All right, let' smove ahead
Oh, yeah.
Theme song guy: There are despots and dictators
Political manipulators
There are blue bloods with the intellects of fleas
There are kings and catty tyrants
Who are so lacking in refinements
They'd be better suited swinging from the trees
He was born and raised to rule
No one has ever been as cool
In a thousand years of aristocracy
An enigma and a mystery
In Mesoamerican history
The quintessence of perfection that is he
Ok, this is the real me
Not this
- This
- Not this.
- Winner!
- Loser.
Ok, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command
Check this out
Butler.
Chef.
Theme song guy.
Oh, yeah!
He's the sovereign lord of the nation
He's the hippest cat in creation
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z
And this perfect world will spin
Around his every little whim
'Cause this perfect world begins and ends with
Me.
What's his name?
Kuzco
That's his name
Kuzco
He's the king of the world
Kuzco
Is he hip or what?
Kuzco
Yeah
Gow!
You threw off my groove!
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove.
Sorry!
You were saying?
What's his name?
Kuzco
Kuzco
That's his name
Is he hip or what?
Don't you know he's the king of the world?
Whoa, yeah
Oww!
Ha!
Boom, baby!
Aah! Your Highness, it is time for you to choose your bride.
Allrighty
Trot out the ladies
Let's take a look-see.
Hate your hair.
Not likely.
Yikes, yikes, yikes, and let me guess.
You have a great personality.
Is this really the best you could do?
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--
What is he babbling about?
He's like the thing that wouldn't shut up
Anyway, still wondering about that llama in the opening?
Well, let me show you the people responsible for ruining my life
First, there's Pacha
Uh, excuse me.
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.
You see,
I got this summons--
Inside, up the stairs, and to the left
Just follow the signs
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.
Uh, and don't be fooled by the folksy peasant look
Oh!
Pardon me
That's mine
Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?
Here. Let me, uh--
Oh, you're so very kind.
What happened?
Well, I...
I threw off the emperor's groove.
- What?
- His groove!
The rhythm in which he lives his life, his pattern of behavior.
I threw it off, and the emperor had me thrown out the window.
Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.
Don't throw off his groove!
Oh, ok.
Beware the groove.
Hey, are you gonna be all right?
Groove.
Kuzco: You see what I mean?
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is, he is nothing compared to what's coming up next
And why have you come here today?
Well
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor-- living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man
Every decade or so she gets a new one
This year's model is called Kronk
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.
Unh!
Yep, that's Kronk
Now lately, Yzma's gotten into this bad habit of trying to run the country behind my back, and I‚Äôm thinkin' that's got to stop
It is no concern of mine whether your family has...
What was it again?
Um, food.
Ha! You really should have thought of that before you became peasants.
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!
But l--
Oh, ok.
Ugh.
The nerve of some of those peasants, huh?
Tell me about it.
Aah!
Hi there.
Ooh, Your Highness.
Ahem.
Oh, oh, oh, ha ha ha. Um...
Uh, you were doing it again.
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?
Doing my job.
I'm the emperor, and you're the emperor's advisor.
Remember that?
But, Your Highness,
I was only dealing with meaningless peasant matters.
Whoa
Look at these wrinkles
What is holding this woman together?
What the--
How long has that been there?
Good thinkin', Yzma
What do you say,
Kuzco?
Whoa! No touchy!
No touchy.
No touch.
Excuse me,
Your Highness
The village leader is here to see you.
Oh, great.
Send him in.
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.
Fired?
W-W-What do you mean, fired?
Um, how else can I say it?
You're being let go, your department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick.
I got more.
But l-- You--uh--
Uhh.
But--
But, Your Highness,
I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire for--for--for many, many years.
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.
You just hit yours
50 years ago.
So...who's in my chair?
Oh, oh! I know!
Yzma.
Yzma's in your chair, right?
Very good, Kronk.
Here. Get the snack.
Got it!
Unh! Oof!.
Ok, you heard the man.
Up, up, up.
I‚Äôm ok
I'm fine
Ah. ok. Show him in.
Ahem.
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.
I'm here because
I received a summons--
Hey, there he is!
My main village man.
Um, Pacha.
Anyway, I got this summons--
Pacha.
That's right.
You are just the man
I wanted to see.
I am?
Word on the street is you can fix my problem.
You can fix my problem, can't you?
Sure.
I'll do what I can.
Good, good. That's just what I wanted to hear.
Are you aware of just how important your village is to the empire?
Well, I know we grow the crops that you use here at the palace.
We also herd the llamas that you--
My village?
Oh, yeah.
You got a pretty sweet little setup there on top of that hill, don't you? Ha ha ha!
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop for the last
6 generations.
Uh-huh.
So tell me, where do you find you get the most sun?
Oh, I'd say just on the other side of those trees.
When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, that settles it.
Really?
Yep. Problem solved.
Thanks for coming.
That's it?
That's all you wanted me for?
I just needed an insider's opinion before I ok'd this spot for my pool.
Uh...your pool?
Boo-yah!
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia, my ultimate summer getaway complete with water slide.
What?
Isn't it great?
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!
I'm so happy.
Uh...uh... um...l don't understand how this could happen.
Well, let me clear it up for you.
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this...
So, if I were you,
I'd pick up some change-of-address forms on the way home.
But, um, where will we live?
Hmm...
Don't know, don't care.
How's that?
Oh, but wait.
You can't--
When I give the word, your little town thingy will be bye-bye.
Bye-bye!
Oh, w--wait. No--
Heh heh. Boohoo.
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way
Or so I thought
He can't get rid of me that easily.
Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is?
Does he...
A little to the left.
...have any idea of who he's dealing with?
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.
Yeah, you think he would've turned out better.
Yeah, go figure.
Well, it's better you're takin' out your anger on these things instead of the real Kuzco, huh?
That's it, Kronk!
- That's it!
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
The real Kuzco?
Of course the real Kuzco.
Don't you see?
It's perfect.
With him out of the way and no heir to the throne,
I'll take over and rule the empire.
Brilliant!
So how does that work with you bein' fired and all?
The only ones who know about that are the three of us, soon to be the two of us.
And I'm one of those two, right?
To the secret lab!
Pull the lever, Kronk.
Wrong lever!
Huh?
Why do we even have that lever?
Get out of my way!
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Whee!
Faster, faster!
Yzma, put your hands in the air!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.
I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives,
Ah ha ha ha!
I'll smash it with a hammer!
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!
Genius, I say!
Or, to save on postage,
I'll just poison him with this.
Take it, Kronk.
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.
Oh...
I can feel it.
Our moment of triumph approaches.
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
It's dinner time.
So...is everything ready for tonight?
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off with soup and a light salad and then see how we feel after that.
Not the dinner...
The you know.
Oh, right.
The poison--
The poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco,
Kuzco's poison.
That poison?
Yes! That poison.
Got you covered.
Excellent.
A few drops in his drink, then I'll propose a toast, and he will be dead before dessert.
Which is a real shame, because it's gonna be delicious.
Boom, bam, baby!
Let's get to the grub
I am one hungry king of the world.
So...no hard feelings about being let go?
None whatsoever.
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.
Drink. Right.
Your Highness.
Is something burning?
My spinach puffs!
Ahem.
So... he seems... nice.
Heh. He is.
He's what, in his late twenties?
Heh heh. I'm not sure.
Saved 'em!
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!
- Good job.
- Very good job.
Watch it.
They're still hot.
Ahem.
Ahem!
Heh heh heh.
Kronk.
The emperor needs his... drink.
Right. Oh. Right.
Hey, Kronky, everything ok back there?
Well, heh.
Oh, uh...
Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the... hmm... oh...ugh...warm side.
Heh heh.
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.
Riveting.
A toast to the emperor!
Long live Kuzco!
Don't drink the wine.
Poison.
Ah! Tasty.
Finally!
Ha ha ha!
Good work,
Kronk.
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.
Now to get rid of the body.
Ok! What were we saying?
Uh...we were just making a toast
Yzma: to your long and healthy rule
Right. So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you've been around here a long time, and I really mean a long time. Um...
Ahem.
It might be difficult for someone of your age adjusting to life in the private sector.
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend? Heh heh.
Now, about you finding new work
Hit him on the head. that's--that's gonna be tough
More broccoli?
Because you're you know
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken, and I mean that in the best possible way.
What? A llama?
He's supposed to be dead!
Yeah, weird.
Let me see that vial.
This isn't poison.
This is extract of llama. Ugh!
You know, in my defense, your poisons all look alike.
You might think about re labeling some of them.
Take him out of town and finish the job now!
What about dinner?
Kronk, this is kind of important.
How about dessert?
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.
And coffee?
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.
Then take him out of town and finish the job!
Cha cha cha cha
Guess where I am right now
Uh-huh. In the bag
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.
Hey! Ba-da ba-da ba-da-da
Ugh, he's doing his own theme music?
Ba-da ba-da ba-da ba
Ba-da-ba
Gig, dumb, and tone deaf
I am so glad I was unconscious for all of this
Huhh!
Mission accomplished.
You're not just gonna let him die like that, are you?
My shoulder angel.
Don't listen to that guy
He's trying to lead you down the path of righteousness.
I'm gonna lead you down the path that rocks.
Oh, come off it.
You come off it!
- You.
- You.
- You.
- You infinity.
Uhh!
Listen up, big guy.
I got 3 good reasons why you should just walk away.
" Number one..."
Look at that guy!
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.
Oh, right.
That's a harp... and that's a dress.
Robe!
Reason number 2.
Look what
I can do.
Ha ha ha!
But... what does that have to do with anything?
No, no.
He's got a point.
Listen, you guys.
You're sort of confusing me, so be gone!
Uh, or, uh, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.
That'll work.
Um, what's with the chimp and the bug?
Can we get back tome?
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?
What am I gonna tell the village?
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.
What do I do? What do I do?
- Aah!
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!
- Unh!
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!
Uh-oh
This is not good.
Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back to haunt me.
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!
Measure me again!
Ha!
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.
Mom, you and I both know that it's impossible for him to have grown in the last 5 minutes.
Mmm! Mmm!
Isn't it?
Look how much you've grown!
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again.
Measure me.
Dad's home!
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come here
Ha ha ha!
Dad! I ate a bug today!
Oh! Was Mom baking again?
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.
I heard that.
Ok, everybody, move aside
Lady with a baby comin' through.
Dad, Dad, Dad!
Look at how big I am!
We were all measured today.
Oh.
I'm going through a growth spurt.
I'm as big as you were when you were me.
Mm-hmm. Sure are.
That's not as impressive as my loose tooth. See?
Ok, ok, you two.
Our deal was that you could stay awake until Daddy came home.
Now say good night.
Dad, do we have to?
No, you two can stay up.
We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin' each other how much we love each other.
Right, honey?
- Ew!
- Blecch!
Good night.
So what did the emperor want?
Ahem.
You know what?
He couldn't see me.
Couldn't see you?
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Well, that's just rude.
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.
No, no, no, no. No.
Emperor or no emperor, it's called common courtesy.
Honey...
If that were me,
I'd march right back there and demand to see him, and you know I would.
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while, but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.
That kind of behavior just--just--
Uhh!
I gotta go wash something.
Pacha?
You ok?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip.
Um...I‚Äôm gonna go put Misty away.
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.
2 seconds here.
Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember?
This story's about me, not him. ok. You got it?
All right.
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.
Heh heh heh.
Huh?
Whoa.
Uhh. Oh.
Where'd you come from, little guy?
No touchy.
Aah! Demon llama!
Demon llama? Where?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Ow! Ow, my head.
Ok, demon llama.
Just take it easy.
I mean you no harm.
What are you talking about--
Oh, wait. I know you.
You're that whiny peasant.
Emperor Kuzco?
Yeah. Who do you think you were talkin' to?
Uh...how did--
Um... you don't... look like the emperor.
What do you mean I don't look like the emperor?
Uh...oh... do this...
What is this, some kind of little game you country folk like to--
Aah! It can't be! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
My face! Aah! My beautiful, beautiful face!
Ok, ok, ok.
I'm an ugly, stinky llama!
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.
- Llama face!
- Shh!
What happened?
I'm tryin' to figure that out, ok?
Ohh-ho!
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.
Wait a minute.
I remember you.
I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was, and then you got mad at me.
Ohh!
And you turned me into a llama!
What? No, I did not.
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.
Why would I kidnap a llama?
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.
What?
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit. ok. I have to get back to the palace.
Yzma's got that "secret lab."
I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change me back.
Hey, you.
No time to waste.
Let's go.
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.
Build your summerhouse somewhere else.
You want to run that by me again?
I can't let you go back unless you change your mind and build your summer home somewhere else.
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here.
No, closer.
I don't make deals with peasants!
Then I guess I can't take you back.
Fine.
I don't need you.
I can find my own way back.
I wouldn't recommend it.
It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way.
Nice try, pal.
No, really.
I'm telling you,
There are jaguars and snakes and quicksand
I'm not listening.
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.
La la la la
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.
Aw, you...
Fine. Fine.
Go ahead!
If there's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia.
Takes care of my problem.
Hmm.
Scary jungle.
Right.
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.
Oh, it's a scary tree.
I'm afraid. Ha ha.
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,
I'm born with an innate sense of direction.
Ok, where am I?
Wha--
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Uhh.
Too late.
Ok, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.
Aah!
Hmm.
What do you want?
Oh, for me?
Why, I don't know what to say.
Ow!
Hit the road, bucky.
Aah! Ow!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Uh-oh.
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No, don't.
Ha!
Aah!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
You killer jaguars...
Whoa!
Aah-eee!
Aah!
Aah!
Yee-aah!
Aah!
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.
Maybe I'm just new to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say?
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.
This--This is all right.
We can figure this out.
I hate you.
- No!
- Yaah!
Aah! Ow!
Whoo hoo hoo!
Aah!
Ow!
Ow!
Uhh!
I don't know about you, but I'm getting all funned out.
Uh-oh.
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?
Most likely.
Bring it on.
Boo-yah!
Whoo!
Your Highness.
Your Highness, can you hear me?
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.
Breathe!
Ohh. Why me?
Ooh!
All right.
- Ohh!
- Aah!
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
For the last time, it was not a kiss.
Well, whatever you call it... it was disgusting.
And if you would've done what I ordered you to do in the first place, we all could've been spared your little kiss of life.
Aw!
But now that you're here, you will take me back to the palace.
I'll have Yzma change me back, and then I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia.
Oh, yeah.
Ok, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.
Mm-hmm.
I just think if you really thought about it, you'd decide to build your home on a different hilltop.
And why would I do that?
Because... deep down,
I think you'll realize that you're forcing an entire village out of their homes just for you.
And that's... bad?
Well, yeah.
Nobody's that heartless.
Mmm.
Now take me back.
What?
Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?
All you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you.
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.
You're the only one that doesn't seem to be with the program, eh, Pacha?
You know what?
Someday, you're going to wind up all alone, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.
Now, for the final time,
I order you to take me back to the palace.
Looks to me like you're stuck out here, because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--
Somebody's throwing stuff.
You going to build a fire or what? What's going on?
He's never going to change his mind.
Ohh. How am I ever going to get out of here?
And so, it is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince... taken from us so tragically on the very eve of his 18th birthday.
Poor little guy.
His legacy will live on in our hearts...
He never had a chance. for all eternity.
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.
Back to work.
Kronk, darlin',
I must admit you had me worried when you mixed up those poisons, but now that
Kuzco is dead, all is forgiven.
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...
Heh. He's dead, all right. Heh heh.
I mean, you can't get much deader than he-- than he is right now.
Unless, of course, we killed him again.
I suppose.
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.
Kronk...
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.
Kronk...
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.
Kuzco is dead, right?
Tell me Kuzco's dead.
I need to hear these words.
Do you need to hear all those words exactly?
He's still alive?
Well, he's not as dead as we would've hoped.
Kronk...
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back.
He can't come back!
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward-- especially after that lovely eulogy.
You think?
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!
Now let's move!
Dad, look out!
Tipo, what is it?
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control down a raging river of death!
All right, all right, it's ok.
- It was awful!
- Shh!
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.
It was just a dream.
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.
Oh. Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.
That's right.
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.
Yeah, like that would ever happen.
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
Yeah-huh.
Good night, you two.
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.
Ooh!
B-B-Brr!
Uh, hey
Thanks.
Oh.
No problem.
Feels like wool.
Yeah.
Alpaca?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.
It's nice.
My wife made it.
Oh, she knits?
Crochets.
Crochets?
Nice.
Thanks.
So...
So, I was thinking that when I got back to the city, we'd, uh...
I mean, there's lots of hilltops, and maybe I might, you know...
I--I might...
Are you saying... you've changed your mind?
Oh, well, l--I...
Because you know that means you're doing something nice for someone else.
No, I know that.
I know.
And you're all right with that?
Yes.
What?
Don't shake unless you mean it.
All right.
Let's get you back to the palace.
Oh, by the way, thanks.
No... thank you ok.
Once we cross this bridge, it's only an hour to the palace.
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.
I believe it.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Ohh!
Whoa!
Kuzco!
Kuzco!
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!
No. I don't think
I will.
You're going to leave me here?
Well, I was going to have you imprisoned for life, but I kind of like this better.
I thought you were a changed man.
Oh, come on.
I had to say something to get you to take me back to the city.
So all of it was a lie?
Well, yeah.
No, wait.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.
Toodles.
We shook hands on it!
You know, the funny thing about shaking hands is... you need hands.
Ha! ok.
Buh-bye.
Aah!
Are you ok?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.
Good!
That's for going back on your promise!
Yii!
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me and taking me to your village... which I'm still gonna destroy, by the way.
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.
Ooh!
Why did I risk my life for a selfish brat like you?
I was always taught that there was some good in everyone, but, ooh, you proved me wrong.
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.
Bad llama.
I could've let you die out there in that jungle, and then all my problems would be over.
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.
Let's end this.
Ladies first.
- Aah! - Yaah!
Ohh!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!
- Whoa!
- Ohh!
What are we gonna do?
Aah!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!
No, we're not
Calm down.
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.
Ok, now the other one.
When I say go, push against my back, and we'll walk up the hill.
Ready?
Go.
Ow!
You did that on purpose.
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!
Now, we're gonna have to work together to get out of this, so follow my lead.
Ready?
- Right foot.
- Whose right?
Your right or mine?
I don't care.
Mine.
Well, why yours?
Ok, your right!
Ready?
Ok, got it.
Ok, right.
Left. Right.
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!
Aah!
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right!
Now what, genius?
Working on it.
Ok, here's the deal.
Stretch out your neck, and I'll grab the rope.
How do I know you won't let me fall after you grab the rope?
You're just gonna have to trust me!
You know, it's a good thing you're not a big, fat guy, or this would be really difficult.
Aah! Aah!
Almost.
Got it!
It's stuck.
Take your time.
No hurry here.
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh, no!
Uhh!
Aah!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Huh?
Aah!
Aah!
Whoa!
- Huh?
Look out!
Ohh!
Pacha: Ohh
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Ooh, look at me and my bad self.
I snatched you right out of the air.
"Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall, and I'm taking you with me."
Well, not today, pal.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh
You just saved my life.
Huh?
So?
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
That there is some good in you after all.
Oh, no
- Admit it.
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.
Right. Sure.
Well, we better get going.
With that bridge out, it's a 4-daywalk to the palace.
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?
I shook on it, didn't I?
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize that doesn't change a thing.
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia when I get back.
Well, 4 days is a long time.
Who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.
Uh-huh.
4 days.
What are the chances of you carrying me?
Not good.
No, no, no!
We've searched every village surrounding the palace and still no sign of Kuzco.
Where is he?
Kronk!
Kronk here.
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.
Sure thing.
Kronk out.
Ooh! Aah!
Aah! Ohh!
Perfect.
These are my best shoes.
I hate this jungle.
Oh, look.
A golden-throated small-winged warbler.
Just one more for exotic bird bingo.
Aah!
I am loving this.
Get away from me!
Uhh
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
No, no, it's not you.
She's not the easiest person to get close to.
There's a wall there.
Trust me.
Are you talking to that squirrel?
I was a junior chipmunk.
I had to be versed in all the woodland creatures.
Please continue.
Aah!
Why me?
Why me?
Hey, it doesn't always have to be about you.
This poor little guy has had it rough.
Seems a talking llama
Kronk: gave him a hard time the other day
Oh, a talking llama?
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.
Heh heh heh heh!
Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you.
Well, then you ask him.
I hate being in the middle.
Squeaky, uh... squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.
Aah!
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.
Uh, could you give us a little room here?
Uh, sorry.
Uh-uh.
A little bit more, please.
How is this?
- Yeah, that's good.
Now ask him which way the talking llama went!
Uh, squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.
Low blood sugar, huh?
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.
Well, as soon as we get something to eat, you're walking the rest of the way.
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut, home of the mug...
...of meat.
What'll it be?
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.
Is that all right, dear?
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.
Hee hee hee. We're on our honeymoon.
Bless you for coming out in public.
So that's 2 specials.
And an onion log.
To split.
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns and a deep-fried doorstop on table 1 2!
Ok, so I'll admit this was a good idea.
When will you learn that all my ideas are good ones?
That's funny, because I thought you going into the jungle by yourself, being chased by jaguars, lying to me to take you back to the palace were all really bad ideas.
Anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude.
Hot and crispy pill bug for the happy couple.
Mazeltov
Oh, boy.
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.
Urp!
Oh, here
Let me get that for you
Bleaggh! Uck!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen and have a word with the chef.
You're gonna get us thrown out.
Please.
With this disguise,
I'm invisible.
Heh heh!
We've been walking around in circles for who knows how long.
That is the last time we take directions from a squirrel.
I should have done away with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.
Oh, you really gotta stop beating yourself up about that.
Uh-oh I'll get you another one there, Yzma
You using that fork there, pal?
Hey, don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Wrestled you in high school?
Don't remember that.
Metal shop? I got it!
Miss Narca's interpretive dance--2 semesters.
I was usually in the back because of my weak ankles.
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.
I don't think we've ever met, but I gotta go.
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.
I'm not the only one that thinks that, I'm sure.
Psst! Hey!
So I'm just checking to make sure you're going to take the main course up a notch.
Is there anything on this menu that is not swimming in gravy?
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.
It's a simple question.
Is there or is there not anything edible...
- on this menu?
- Gah!
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!
Hey, pal, what's your policy on making special orders?
All right, buster, that's it!
You want a special order, then you make it!
I quit!
Yeah, but l--
I try and I try, but there's no respect for anyone with vision.
That's it!
There's just nothing
I can do about it!
Please don't go.
3 pork combos, extra bacon on the side,
2 chili cheese samplers, a basket of liver and onion rings, a catch of the day, and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.
You got all that, honey?
3 oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of grandma's breakfast, and change the bull to a gill, got it.
What's going on?
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.
What is he doing in there?
Unh! Come on!
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.
No, Kuzco!
Ok, I'll make it simple for you.
I'll have a spinach omelet with wheat toast.
- You got it?
- Can do.
What's taking so long?
Pickup!
Kronk!
What are you doing?
Kinda busy here.
Why am I not surprised?
Your order's up!
Ohh!
Oh, well, while you're at it, make me the special.
And hold the gravy!
Check. Pickup!
You know what?
On second thought, make my omelet a meat pie.
Meat pie Check
Kronk!
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?
I'll have to charge you full price.
Ooh!
Hey, how about a side of potatoes, my buddy?
You got it. Want cheese on those potatoes?
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.
Cheddar spuds coming up.
Spuds yes, cheese no.
Hold the cheese.
No, I want the cheese
Cheese me no like.
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!
Come on, make up your mind!
Ok, ok, on second thought...
Make my potatoes a salad.
Excuse me. You see that woman over there?
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?
What are you doing?
Look, there's 2 people in there looking for you.
What?
A big guy and a skinny old woman.
Wait. Was this woman scary beyond all reason?
Oh, yeah.
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!
Trust me, they're not here to save you.
They'll take me back to the palace.
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.
I can take it from here.
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.
Kill me? Their whole world revolves around me.
No. I can't let you!
What? Wha--
Oh, I get it!
What?
You don't want to take me back to the palace.
You want to keep me stranded out here forever.
No!
This has all been an act, and I almost fell for it.
Will you just listen to me--
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!
What?
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.
- Go!
- But--
Go on! Get outta here!
Fine! Hmph!
Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
What'd I do?
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!
There'll be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him!
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.
Not even on your birthday.
Kuzco must be eliminated
The empire will finally be rid of that useless slug
You got a point
Nobody really seems to care that he's gone, do they?
Pacha!
Pacha?
So this is where you came in
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here
I didn't do anything, and they ruined my life and took everything I had
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?
What? I‚Äôm just telling them what happened
Who you kidding, pal?
They saw the whole thing, they know what happened.
Well, yeah, but
Just leave me alone.
The peasant at the diner!
He didn't pay his check.
He's the peasant who I saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with Kuzco on the back of his cart.
He must have taken him back to his village, so if we find the village, we find him, and if we find him, we find Kuzco.
Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.
Yzma!
What?!
Aah!
This had better be good!
Yeech.
So, there we were standing on the cliff, and the ground started to rumble
And just as it started to go, he grabbed me before I fell
Do you believe that?
You know, call me crazy for following this guy all the way out here, but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him
Besides, I couldn't just leave him out here all alone.
He's a lousy llama.
I mean, a really lousy llama.
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know, what I said to you back at the diner, that--that--
I--I didn't really...
So...you tired of being a llama?
Ye-ee-ee-es!
Ok, we're just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies.
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.
My relatives?
We just sent them up to your house.
What did they look like?
See, there was this big guy and this older woman who was...
How would you describe her?
Scary beyond all reason.
Yeah, that's it.
So, remind me again how you're related to Pacha?
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's wife's step-niece's great-aunt. Heh heh.
Twice removed.
Uh-huh.
Isn't that right, Kronk?
99 monkeys jumpin' on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
You know, I am so sorry that you had to come all this way, but as I said to you before, you may recall,
Pacha is not here.
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.
Oops. Silly me.
No, no. Allow me.
She's hiding something.
When I give the word, we search the house.
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.
Grr!
So, while we're waiting for Paca--
Pacha.
Oh, yes.
Perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home.
You know, why don't you just come back when Pacha gets home?
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...
Excuse me, won't you?
I think I left something in the oven.
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.
Kronk, it's time! ok!
Ohh!
So, we have to get back to the palace, find the lab, and change him back.
Hi there!
Aah!
- That was him.
- Whoops.
You know what?
I don't believe you're really my great-aunt.
You're more like my great-great-great...
Go. I'll stall them long enough for you two to get a head start.
Thanks, honey.
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.
Great-great- great...
Grr! All right!
Are you through?
...great-great-aunt.
So, where were we?
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until--
I show you the house.
Of course.
Was it a good idea to leave your family with those two?
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.
There is no handle in here.
There's not?
Are you sure?
All right, I've had enough of this.
Tell us where the talking llama is and we'll burn your house to the ground.
Uh, don't you mean "or"?
Tell us where the talking llama is or we'll burn your house to the ground.
Well, which is it?
That seems like a pretty crucial conjunction.
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.
I'll break it down myself.
A-one
Ok, kids, you know what to do.
Right, Mom!
Aah!
Ok, children, on your mark, get set, go!
Ow! Ow! Stop it, you little brats! Huh?
Ow!
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.
Let's not wait until the next family reunion to get together.
Kronk!
I, uh, I gotta run.
Ok, why does she even have that lever?
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Aah!
Huh?
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Just keep looking.
Over here!
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...
Oh, my
Looking for this?
No! It can't be!
How did you get back here before us?
Uh...how did we, Kronk?
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.
Oh, well, back to business.
Ok, I admit it.
Maybe I wasn't as nice as I should have been, but, Yzma, do you really want to kill me?
Just think of it as you're being let go, that your life's going in a different direction, that your body's part of a permanent outplacement.
Hey, that's kind of like what he said to you when you got fired.
I know. It's called a cruel irony-- like my dependence on you.
I can't believe this is happening!
Then I bet you weren't expecting this
- No!
- Aah!
Aha!
Oh, ok.
Ha ha!
Finish them off.
Hey, you're not backing down now, are you, big guy?
Uh, where's the other guy?
Yo!
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and asked me to, you know, take them out.
Then this guy popped up and we waited for you, and quite honestly--
Kronk! Why did I think you could do this?
This one simple thing.
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.
Whoa now.
A really, really big stupid monkey named Kronk!
Ouch.
And do you want to know something else?
I've never liked your spinach puffs.
Never!
That's it.
She's going down.
Now, now, remember, guys.
From above, the wicked shall receive their just reward.
That'll work.
Strange.
That usually works.
And so does this!
Ah. Should have seen that coming.
Whoa!
Aah!
Give me that vial!
Oof!.
Ah! Ha ha!
Aah!
Oops. Clumsy me.
Which one? Which one?
Better hurry
I'm expecting company
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!
They're not listening to me!
Just take 'em all!
- Yaah!
- Yaah!
Get them!
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?
You're excused.
Anyone else?
All: No, we're good.
Get them!
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!
Come on!
Come on!
Aah!
Oh, please be something with wings.
Yeah! We're flyin'!
Uh-oh!
We're not getting anywhere with you picking the vials.
I'm picking the next one!
Fine by me!
Give me that one!
Don't you say a word.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Quick!
Drain the canals!
Pacha: Open up!
Yay! I'm a llama again!
Wait...
- Aah!
- Aah!
There they go!
After them!
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!
Aah!
Grr!
Aah!
Ok, only 2 left. It's gotta be one of these.
No!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Meow.
I'll take that.
This is the one. This'll change you back to a human.
Ow! Hey, get her off!.
Whoa!
Get her off me!
Aah! Ow!
Drink the potion!
Ok, ok! Aah!
Where did it go?
Where is it?
Looking for this?
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?
Oh, well.
No! Don't drop it!
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!
I'm going to drink it!
And once I turn back into my beautiful self,
I'm going to kill you!
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Aah! Uh-oh.
Yzma: Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Uhh! Whoa!
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!
Kuzco!
Be right there!
Give me a minute!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Kuzco! Whoa!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh.
The vial!
Aah!
For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline.
You know, pal, you could have told me that before I set it up.
Aah!
Aah! Uhh--
Huh? Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hoo hoo hee hee ha ha ha--
The vial!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
I win.
Whoa.
Got it!
What are the odds of that trapdoor leading me out here?
Yeah!
Uhh.
Here, uh, let me get this for you.
Well, see ya on the other side.
Old man: Oh, now, you--you you stop being so hard on yourself.
All is forgiven.
You're sure?
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window, and it won't be the last.
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.
Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later.
Ok, buddy, take care.
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.
So, you lied to me
I did?
Yeah. You said when the sun hits this ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, pal, I was dragged all over those hills, and I did not hear any singing.
So
I'll be building my summer home on a more magical hill.
Thank you.
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, huh?
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.
Looks like you and your family are stuck on that tuneless hill top forever, pal.
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing on the hill next to us.
In case you're interested.
Ha! Boom, baby!
Ha! Boom, baby!
You'd be the coolest dude
In the nation
Or the hippest cat in creation
But if you ain't got friends, then nothing's worth the fuss
A perfect world will come to be
When everybody here can see
That a perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends with us
" My acorn is missing."
Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity.
" Did you eat the acorn?"
Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'?
"You owe me a new acorn."
Squeak squeak squeak squeak squeaker--
Squeakin'.
I'm so proud of you guys.

{447}{549}{Y:i}As far back as I can remember,|it has been raining.
{604}{750}{Y:i}Legends tell of vast continents and|great cities before the catastrophe.
{786}{845}{Y:i}But it's all just faded glory of the past.
{916}{1017}{Y:i}Our ancestors foresaw the catastrophe,|escaped to Sisil Island in the Pacific...
{1041}{1141}{Y:i}...and built another Noah's Arc,|a self-growing city...
{1194}{1295}{Y:i}...that feeds of pollution, called ECOBAN.
{1367}{1452}{Y:i}Refugee ships flooded in by the thousands.
{1480}{1547}{Y:i}But ECOBAN didn't allow...
{1577}{1691}{Y:i}...the contaminated refugees into the city.
{3295}{3341}The workers' safety is at risk down there.
{3343}{3382}I request you stop work at once.
{3383}{3468}Who cares? They're just animals|to be worked, not coddled!
{4087}{4115}God damn it.
{4118}{4168}They're not even worth the food they eat!
{4679}{4719}This is a waste of time.
{4720}{4772}We should burn it all to hell!
{4792}{4864}Sir! Please, help us, quick!
{4866}{4914}They're all going to be killed!
{4916}{4987}You're ruining the equipment!
{4989}{5021}Disconnect the deck!
{5023}{5083}What? No!
{5088}{5145}People are still down there!
{5283}{5334}Don't remember asking for your opinion.
{5337}{5379}Flip the switch!
{5380}{5417}Over my dead body!
{5422}{5465}Your dead body, eh?
{5469}{5539}Jay, give him what he wants.
{5565}{5620}- That's not my job, sir.|- What?
{5860}{5905}Disconnect, hurry!
{6509}{6607}Your first duty is to obey my orders!
{6619}{6664}Return to ECOBAN immediately!
{11450}{11603}Director: Kim, Moon-syang.
{11757}{11803}What is the Adjutant thinking?
{11855}{11918}Is he trying to provoke riots?
{11923}{12041}Or is he really trying to slaughter the Marrians?
{12067}{12131}He's just doing what he can to increase...
{12140}{12195}...pollution for our DELOS system.
{12227}{12303}But, it is true his methods are dangerous.
{12320}{12388}I'll ask the Governor to intercede.
{12394}{12428}It won't do any good.
{12430}{12538}To them, Marrians are little more then insects.
{12559}{12618}You've gone so soft, Jay!
{12638}{12694}ECOBAN is in a crisis situation.
{12719}{12814}You know that mercy is forbidden...
{12837}{12887}...so as to preserve our pure ECOBAN.
{12915}{13003}Just relax! Let's go down and|enjoy the centennial celebration.
{13792}{13837}Still brooding over that?
{13862}{13910}I'm just tired.
{13962}{14032}Then I'll transfer you to domestic patrol.
{14041}{14109}Nothing is hard here on the inside.
{15831}{15863}What is it?
{15865}{15907}Intruder alert in the Control Center!
{15909}{15957}- What?|- The security sensor was triggered.
{15971}{16027}Send a patrol to the Center.
{16029}{16071}I'm on my way.
{16219}{16277}Patrol 1 to the DELOS Center!
{17112}{17143}There you are!
{17145}{17191}The plate has been hacked, sir.
{17192}{17249}- No other plate?|- No, sir.
{17262}{17305}He'll run for the side.
{17310}{17361}Turn the fans on in Area 3!
{17412}{17463}Yes, that's right.
{17500}{17562}Alpha to 330, Bravo to 348!
{17565}{17607}Charlie to 353!
{18173}{18203}There!
{18338}{18431}Target sighted in Zone 3. Alpha, move to 33!
{20295}{20360}We lost his trail, sir.
{20364}{20413}Nothing here either, sir.
{20760}{20828}Control room, stop fan 31!
{20881}{20942}Dr. Noah's work!
{21040}{21114}Control, it's Jay.|Show me the Time-Capsule Room.
{22273}{22363}What, now this rat's got wings?
{23528}{23569}Jay, report your position.
{23571}{23643}I'm in the Time-Capsule Room.|I think he's here.
{24827}{24874}Jay, acknowledge!
{26027}{26066}Jay, are you okay?
{26069}{26099}Yes.
{26106}{26144}What happened?
{26151}{26217}Sorry, I almost got him.
{26225}{26274}How could he have got this far?
{26331}{26409}We assumed our security impenetrable.
{26432}{26476}But today the DELOS Center,|of all places, was infiltrated...
{26479}{26571}...and the man responsible escaped unscathed.
{26595}{26676}He knew the DELOS system|like the back of his hand.
{26691}{26788}A few more minutes, and he'd|have connected to the mainframe,...
{26801}{26862}...allowing him to cause|a DELOS energy release.
{26887}{26935}A DELOS energy release?
{26937}{26973}That's correct.
{26977}{27049}Like the breach 10 years ago.
{27062}{27189}You mean he's alive? Dr. Noah?
{27197}{27249}There's no reason to doubt otherwise.
{27262}{27358}The Marrian idiots could|never puzzle out the system,...
{27363}{27413}...even if we gave them the blueprints.
{27434}{27502}Dr. Noah knows of our situation.
{27511}{27585}DELOS energy levels are running so low...
{27598}{27691}...that ECOBAN has stopped its growth.
{27727}{27801}If we leave him alive,...
{27805}{27851}...he'll just keep destroying our system.
{27874}{27941}We can no longer afford to|postpone on a decision.
{27970}{28073}We must torch the oil fields...
{28080}{28137}...and enlarge the polluted area.
{28163}{28270}That alone would give us enough|energy for another 50 years.
{28299}{28379}We decided on this matter 10 years ago.
{28388}{28480}There is no reason to hold back our|plans for Operation Marr any longer.
{28512}{28619}Torch the whole field to catch a few rats?
{28635}{28694}One rat made it in, but he failed.
{28695}{28746}Our security is reliable.
{28765}{28815}They may be no more than animals,...
{28819}{28875}...but animals we need for work.
{28883}{28945}Too much oppression will prompt a revolt.
{28967}{29015}More pollution for energy!
{29017}{29083}That is our ultimate priority.
{29097}{29155}Yes, to get more energy,...
{29161}{29246}...we must expand the polluted area...
{29264}{29321}...but if we kill the Marrians|then who'll do the work?
{29334}{29380}And though it's unlikely,...
{29383}{29434}...what if they were to revolt?
{29453}{29546}The Marrians outnumber ECOBAN 10 to 1.
{29559}{29659}You're as weak and|undependable as your security.
{29663}{29730}With the pollution increased,...
{29731}{29782}...we won't need oil fields or workers...
{29824}{29931}First, reinforce security|in Marr and ECOBAN.
{29938}{29999}Then search for the intruder|and find out his background.
{30003}{30075}The matter is important to us.
{30313}{30343}Adjutant.
{30362}{30427}Prepare for the operation. Just in case.
{30721}{30815}You can't do a simple thing|without stirring up trouble?
{30818}{30906}Then go do it yourself, old man.
{30915}{30981}By setting off the alarm today,...
{30983}{31027}...you doubled the security by now!
{31037}{31094}Now it's impossible to get in...
{31097}{31139}...and stop the DELOS system.
{31155}{31192}Just hand me the data!
{31240}{31306}So, let's see...
{31318}{31397}...what's new in that ol' mountain of a city?
{31589}{31662}The DELOS systems running low on fuel, I see.
{31667}{31726}The pollution is disappearing.
{31738}{31813}The system's on the verge of dying.
{31859}{31938}If DELOS system stops,|what happens to ECOBAN?
{31955}{32000}We'll see a blue sky.
{32002}{32091}Not the sky, I mean ECOBAN.
{32127}{32190}Well, they won't like it,...
{32192}{32271}...but they'll have to use solar|energy like in the 21 century.
{32279}{32338}ECOBAN will be a huge crap.
{32341}{32411}Then they'll have to work out in the sun,...
{32414}{32464}...shoulder to shoulder with the Marrians.
{32467}{32503}Shoulder to shoulder?
{32548}{32627}They'd kill us first.
{32630}{32670}Where the hell's Woody?
{32691}{32776}Oh yeah, I met her there.
{32784}{32820}Who?
{32835}{32874}An old friend.
{32883}{32976}Old friends are for living people.
{32982}{33027}You're a dead man! Forget about it!
{33037}{33110}Just think on how to get in again...
{33112}{33186}...to shut down the DELOS system.
{33197}{33254}And forget about your glider...
{33259}{33311}...way too dangerous.
{33416}{33466}Let him pass.
{33674}{33724}Pass it along!
{33780}{33855}Cut the funeral music!
{33857}{33895}How 'bout some party tunes!
{34121}{34176}Woody, wanna drag?
{34180}{34224}It's precious.
{34389}{34421}Too hot!
{34973}{35018}Shua!
{35046}{35103}What's the occasion?
{35182}{35226}Woody, let's go.
{35264}{35311}Shua!
{35496}{35558}I don't like him, that ECOBAN outcast!
{35560}{35644}If not for Woody, I'd smash his head in.
{35714}{35788}Moe, you seen my propeller?
{35811}{35843}This?
{35845}{35927}Are you kidding? Nah, the small one.
{35951}{36011}You said you needed this?
{36075}{36170}First you hang around with them|and now you steal things?
{36175}{36274}I didn't steal it. I found it.
{36276}{36349}You said you needed it for the glider.
{36399}{36450}Don't hang around with them.
{36453}{36513}It's too dangerous, got it?
{36642}{36685}Give me the harmonica.
{36780}{36815}Shua!
{36835}{36888}That's cool. What is it?
{36889}{36933}A bracelet.
{36935}{36981}Where did you get it?
{36984}{37027}None of your business, boy.
{37030}{37079}Who is it?
{37567}{37652}Dr. Noah says the sky is blue.
{37655}{37723}That people used to say "sky blue".
{37739}{37831}And in Gibraltar, the sky and...
{37832}{37906}...ocean are blue. Imagine!
{38206}{38251}Come with me.
{38252}{38286}Where?
{38645}{38694}It's off limits here.
{38697}{38748}Let's go back.
{38750}{38784}I'm scared.
{38787}{38854}Don't worry!
{38855}{38926}Just close your eyes and hold my hand.
{38931}{38989}I'll show you something wonderful.
{39313}{39363}Go ahead, open your eyes.
{39471}{39550}This is wonderful!
{39589}{39651}But how'd you know about this?
{39655}{39706}Dr. Noah told me!
{39709}{39802}He said in Gibraltar,|you can see this every day.
{39826}{39896}Jay, promise we'll go there together.
{40290}{40344}{Y:i}It was so beautiful it blinded your eyes.
{40355}{40424}{Y:i}We called it our Wonderful Day.
{40441}{40511}{Y:i}But it didn't last long.
{40529}{40583}{Y:i}That night it disappeared behind the clouds.
{40591}{40647}{Y:i}And I never saw him after that day.
{40732}{40820}Who's land is this?
{40821}{40947}Who cultivated the land and built the town?
{40950}{41079}Whose blood and sweat made our Marr?
{41081}{41152}Was it Ecoban's? No!
{41154}{41187}It was ours!
{41189}{41236}Hey, it's getting rough!
{41239}{41283}There's going to be riot.
{41287}{41373}Nuh-uh. Shua would have known,...
{41375}{41430}...but my brother didn't say anything.
{41432}{41495}He's from ECOBAN,...
{41499}{41582}...he can't be your brother?
{41585}{41641}He's just some crazy mofo!
{41643}{41687}He is too my brother! Wh-why's he crazy?
{41690}{41766}Always rambling on about Gibraltar.
{41767}{41803}No such thing in the world.
{41807}{41878}You have to live here.
{41881}{41939}And I'll teach you to be a fighter.
{41988}{42031}Woody! Where you...?
{42144}{42200}- Woody!|- Hurry up!
{42377}{42440}Now they're rioting in the morning.
{42444}{42506}Guess that means no business today.
{42510}{42559}Did you see Woody by any chance?
{42563}{42666}Woody? Yeah, I thought|I saw him with that dwarf.
{42667}{42724}What is his name?
{42735}{42799}Bring me that will you?
{42877}{42942}One's coming! Get it at the crossroad!
{43844}{43923}Woody, you crazy?
{43926}{43972}What the hell are you doing?
{43974}{44024}- Are you crazy?|- W-Wait a sec.
{44037}{44079}What in the world...
{44115}{44149}Hey! Hey!
{44663}{44763}If you see Woody, tell him to go home.
{44939}{45050}Jay, there're riots in the plaza.|Let's turn back.
{45079}{45123}Fuck you!
{45572}{45622}Jay! Are you okay?
{45624}{45672}Answer me!
{49780}{49821}Shua?
{49839}{49875}You're Shua, aren't you?
{49951}{50018}Listen. Outside ECOBAN is dangerous!
{50065}{50122}I thought you were dead.
{50189}{50267}The Shua you know is dead.
{50305}{50373}You and I are enemies.
{50392}{50482}I don't think Marrians are my enemy.
{50484}{50554}Too bad the Marrians don't see it that way.
{50610}{50664}Damn it!
{50720}{50766}Those pains in the ass!
{50776}{50815}Hide in there.
{50867}{50960}Stairs should be wide and convenient!
{50961}{51025}This is slope climbing!
{51027}{51106}Oh hey, Shua! There you are.
{51167}{51207}The boss wants you.
{51211}{51320}Let's plan out our strategy|for the big mission tomorrow.
{51390}{51469}This job's hot!|We're gonna hit ECOBAN's post.
{51645}{51764}I'm so glad you're alive, Shua!
{51811}{51855}You don't know...
{51876}{51950}...but I've missed you as much as you miss...
{51971}{52018}...that blue sky of yours.
{52439}{52533}Go back, Jay. Don't come back.
{53403}{53458}Kill me now, Helen.
{53473}{53538}I'm about to explode.
{53541}{53582}Get real!
{53584}{53627}She's twice your size!
{53631}{53684}- Don't make me kick your ass!|- What the...?
{53706}{53766}Shut the hell up and listen!
{53768}{53882}The ECOBANs are bringing in|shipments by trucks every day.
{53894}{53949}They're some presents|meant for us, I'm sure.
{53951}{54013}I just want Helen, that's all.
{54037}{54115}We should accept these gifts.
{54124}{54185}And show them our gratitude.
{54188}{54226}What're you talking about?
{54227}{54307}Tomorrow, we'll hit the Ecoban post,...
{54319}{54379}...take our presents...
{54383}{54441}...and give them our thanks.
{54443}{54476}So?
{54503}{54579}What kind of friends would we be not...
{54582}{54634}...to invite you along|for something as big as this?
{54645}{54697}Friends?
{54706}{54786}Friends of resistance!
{54800}{54882}You're using resistance to justify...
{54886}{54936}...what's little more then theft?
{54943}{55031}Keep low if you know what's good for you.
{55057}{55111}Son of a--!
{55183}{55248}If you could stop thinking|with your muscles...
{55250}{55302}...you'd know what really needs doing.
{55316}{55377}Acting stupid and getting yourself|killed is your business.
{55387}{55437}But don't drag Woody into it!
{55439}{55522}If anything happens to him,|I'll be sending you home in pieces!
{55637}{55707}Hey! Who saved Woody today?
{55711}{55757}You ungrateful little twat!
{55759}{55815}I'm telling you, he's an ECOBAN at heart!
{55818}{55860}Self-righteous prick!
{55863}{55914}C'mon, hit the music!
{56090}{56165}You want to live with them?
{56183}{56263}Why? Are you m-mad at me?
{56283}{56337}Yes. You ignored my warnings.
{56366}{56423}So you're leaving me behind?
{56447}{56488}I'll follow you.
{56491}{56535}Who's going where?
{56539}{56638}I know you'll fix the glider and...
{56668}{56739}...leave me behind. Then I'll kill myself!
{56806}{56839}Stop it!
{56879}{56930}What kind of shit are they|cramming into that head of yours.
{56935}{56991}And don't joke about dying.
{57000}{57031}Here.
{57060}{57098}Take it.
{57107}{57151}I don't need it.
{57155}{57226}But, it's from your girlfriend.
{57235}{57274}She's not.
{57277}{57363}And I'm not going anywhere.
{57366}{57435}Really? You're staying with me?
{57444}{57511}Shua, don't leave me behind no matter what.
{57515}{57553}I'll think about it.
{57676}{57734}You're sure Jay did that?
{57739}{57812}Yes, sir. Positive.
{57815}{57866}All right, that's be all.
{57940}{58036}Etha, let's keep this between us for now.
{58053}{58087}Yes, sir.
{59643}{59732}Our target is the suspect|who infiltrated the DELOS system.
{59734}{59815}He's hiding in a wrecked tanker|in Bay area no. 5.
{59845}{59918}If he resists... then shoot to kill.
{61485}{61538}Alpha 1, no one here!
{61546}{61598}Alpha 2, not a thing!
{62478}{62524}Why didn't you tell me?
{62801}{62871}He committed murder and ran from ECOBAN!
{62873}{62953}Don't let memories weaken|you into sympathy!
{63436}{63491}There! That's it.
{63515}{63554}Where?
{63614}{63674}Ah, I see it!
{63951}{64026}Afternoon, officer. Sorry I'm late.
{64029}{64079}Who the hell are you?
{64082}{64128}Show me your pass.
{64137}{64226}Oh, the pass? I must've dropped it.
{64234}{64316}No pass?
{64319}{64360}Out of the truck.
{64400}{64466}Oh, yes, that is... Where'd I put it?
{64469}{64531}What are you doing? Get out!
{64534}{64581}Right! The pass.
{64687}{64746}I'm out! Whatcha gonna do about it?
{65059}{65097}Son of a bitch!
{65196}{65239}Get on!
{65760}{65801}Hurry!
{65908}{65965}Wait! Stop your pursuit!
{66063}{66128}Let's party!
{66451}{66504}I'm told there was a robbery.
{66527}{66572}And what were you doing?
{66575}{66657}While these vermin broke in and stole things?
{66680}{66770}How could I protect something that...
{66771}{66814}...I had no knowledge even existed?
{66815}{66877}You are full of excuses and no results.
{66882}{66952}If I trusted you, I wouldn't be here.
{66959}{67029}The target changed course towards Bay Area 2.
{67033}{67073}As soon as the destination is confirmed,...
{67075}{67155}...I want you to clean out the whole place.
{67295}{67359}What's with the ruckus?
{67361}{67401}I thought I told those Hot Dogs to keep quiet.
{67403}{67462}Perhaps they scored big today.
{67488}{67559}You're not thinking about the glider, are you?
{67571}{67630}I'm just fixing it, that's all.
{67642}{67748}Flying that into ECOBAN|is asking to get killed.
{67750}{67817}Don't worry. I like living.
{67831}{67923}ECOBAN is up to something.
{67927}{67957}They keep trucking something into Marr.
{67959}{68015}They're probably trying to torch all of Marr.
{68017}{68065}The DELOS system needs resources,...
{68070}{68157}...so they'll burn and pollute the whole area.
{68175}{68251}You're sure you're not|planning anything stupid?
{68263}{68335}Are you saying there's another way?
{68337}{68389}We need someone who can get to...
{68391}{68443}...the DELOS center without raising suspicion.
{68447}{68495}You want to use Jay?
{68499}{68603}Might as well wait until they|torch Marr to the ground.
{68607}{68657}Then forget about it!
{69557}{69618}There're more where it came from.
{69620}{69699}So you got something this time.
{69701}{69748}Wow, what is it?
{69928}{69972}What the hell is it?
{70043}{70090}What's this blinking?
{70092}{70138}You idiots!
{70332}{70387}- Freeze!|- Throw down your weapons!
{70391}{70450}- On the floor!|- Hands on the back!
{71380}{71415}Move.
{71546}{71589}Get away!
{71699}{71750}Don't make a sound!
{71751}{71826}No matter what, don't come out!
{72527}{72602}Perfect time to run out of ammo!
{72606}{72661}I'll cross first.
{72663}{72702}Watch and learn!
{72704}{72755}Check this out!
{72865}{72894}Moe!
{72896}{72951}Easier said than done!
{72955}{73022}Sons of bitches! Moe, I'm coming!
{73444}{73491}Zed!
{73495}{73570}Zed!
{73764}{73828}W-Woody, it's freezing.
{73921}{73968}I'll go and get Shua.
{73970}{74050}Don't leave me. I'm scared.
{74054}{74094}Don't be scared.
{74099}{74199}- I'm cold.|- I'll be back soon.
{74231}{74274}Don't leave me.
{74275}{74335}Don't worry. I'll come back.
{74342}{74388}And don't sing, okay?
{74889}{74942}Hush!
{74973}{75024}Hands on the wall!
{75025}{75064}One step back!
{75067}{75138}Take them out, and comb the building!
{75139}{75178}Yes, sir.
{76241}{76299}Where's Karen?
{76784}{76820}Woody?
{76823}{76856}Oh my...
{76869}{76916}Let's go out.
{76963}{77028}I can't.
{77075}{77131}Woody told me to wait.
{79403}{79451}Why won't you die...
{79481}{79542}...you little cockroach!
{79550}{79607}Get up! I'll finish you off this time!
{79610}{79702}You should be thanking me|for taking the fall for you.
{79706}{79766}You should have died then...
{79778}{79828}...for the sake of ECOBAN!
{79831}{79921}You mean, so Jay won't know the truth.
{79924}{79986}That's right! Good for you.
{79989}{80075}Now you'll have to die again|for Jay's sake, and mine!
{80364}{80413}Shua...
{80623}{80675}Woody!
{80721}{80775}Woody!
{80951}{81030}Move! Get out of the way!
{82826}{82951}I thought it was me looking after him,...
{82983}{83100}...but it was the other way around.
{83211}{83278}I wanted to show him the blue sky.
{83483}{83541}I'm Sorry, Zed.
{83635}{83699}I'm going to ECOBAN.
{83707}{83758}You don't have to come if you don't want to.
{83880}{83950}Thank you everyone.
{83977}{84052}First, we need Noah's help.
{84107}{84186}The Hot Dogs are now crushed,...
{84195}{84291}...but, Dr. Noah and his agent remain at large.
{84307}{84423}They're conspiring to bring|about ECOBAN's downfall.
{84439}{84488}Let's not blame security...
{84490}{84550}...and waste any more time.
{84583}{84652}Operation Marr is ready.
{84661}{84757}With your approval, it can proceed immediately.
{84780}{84839}Expediency would be prudent.
{84847}{84906}We can no longer coexist with the Marrians.
{84935}{84986}And if energy levels fall any further,...
{84987}{85047}...many ECOBAN systems will malfunction.
{85051}{85140}Making it much harder to|suppress the Marrian riots.
{85150}{85255}Moreover, Dr. Noah and his agent are|probably already preparing something.
{85262}{85338}We must eliminate the root of the problem.
{85733}{85806}It's our duty to protect ECOBAN.
{85818}{85902}The only thing endangering|ECOBAN is ECOBAN itself.
{85936}{86015}I don't care anymore.
{86031}{86093}By tomorrow all of Marr will be gone,...
{86099}{86164}...including Shua.
{86233}{86309}Even they have a right to protect themselves.
{86353}{86400}Where are you going?
{86407}{86445}Jay!
{86453}{86492}Jay!
{86507}{86561}As long as we don't give up,...
{86572}{86625}...he won't give up either.
{91211}{91291}{Y:i}I'm sick of this bleak desolate future.
{91304}{91382}{Y:i}I just want a sky filled with light.
{91402}{91490}{Y:i}Like that day so long ago.
{91517}{91566}{Y:i}Which is why I have to go.
{91576}{91656}{Y:i}I don't know where I'll be.
{91677}{91750}{Y:i}But know you're with me in my heart.
{91780}{91847}{Y:i}Take care of Woody.
{93059}{93128}All troops are assembled!
{93138}{93197}All troops are to enforce internal security.
{93202}{93259}Man your posts, stay alert, and report...
{93261}{93290}...any suspicious activity immediately!
{93293}{93374}Who diverted the troops from Operation Marr?
{93402}{93447}Commander Cade, sir.
{93450}{93507}I was ordered to reinforce security.
{93509}{93552}Where is he?
{93554}{93613}He went to the DELOS Tower, sir.
{93623}{93655}What?
{93657}{93740}Send the troops to Marr. That's an order!
{93743}{93780}Yes, sir.
{93783}{93828}Battalion, on the truck!
{94227}{94332}This war won't end until|we shut down the DELOS system.
{94350}{94422}You must disconnect the power supply...
{94432}{94510}...before Shua puts the spics in the system.
{94515}{94565}That's your job.
{95156}{95213}There! See it?
{95263}{95297}Ready!
{95303}{95344}Fire!
{95881}{95941}Governor, Operation Marr is now underway.
{95943}{95990}I wish you luck.
{95992}{96048}I'll do my best, sir.
{99143}{99187}That way!
{99252}{99305}Hey, hey, aren't we going too fast?
{99307}{99366}All the sooner that we get to pay them back!
{99827}{99894}What's the? What happened?
{99896}{99949}There's a gap! Shit!
{99959}{100007}That old man...
{100010}{100061}Hey! Stop!
{100063}{100118}He said go full speed!
{101342}{101439}Damn! I must be invincible|to have survived that!
{101455}{101542}I must have a guardian angel|and the devil's own luck!
{101567}{101618}Shua! Want a lift?
{102507}{102546}Hurry!
{105276}{105372}You guys are screwed once I cut the power!
{107777}{107872}So you finally made it.
{108042}{108101}You deserve what you'll get.
{108117}{108222}This is for the good of both Marr and ECOBAN.
{108223}{108259}ECOBAN?
{108261}{108334}You're ruining everyone's future!
{108337}{108403}You're ruining my future with Jay!
{108427}{108512}Why you? Why should only you have her?
{108898}{108928}No!
{109010}{109046}Jay, no!
{109127}{109206}Don't make me do this to you.
{109310}{109353}Jay!
{118246}{118329}Grandpa, I see something bright!
{118347}{118434}That's right. That's right.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
First off, I'd like to thank this board for taking the time to hear my proposal.
Now, we've all heard of the legend of Atlantis, a continent somewhere in the mid-Atlantic that was home to an advanced civilization, possessing technology far beyond our own, that, according to our friend Plato here, was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event that sank it beneath the sea.
Now, some of you may ask, why Atlantis?
It's just a myth, isn't it?
Pure fantasy.
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.
10,000 years before the Egyptians built the pyramids,
Atlantis had electricity, advanced medicine, even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?
Well, no. No, not for them.
Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind more powerful than steam, than coal.
More powerful than our modern internal combustion engines.
Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis, find that power source, and bring it back to the surface.
Now, this is a page from an illuminated text that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal, said to have been a firsthand account of Atlantis and its exact whereabouts.
Now, based on a centuries-old translation of a Norse text, historians have believed the Journal resides in Ireland.
But after comparing the text to the runes on this Viking shield,
I found that one of the letters had been mistranslated.
So, by changing this letter and inserting the correct one, we find that The Shepherd's Journal, the key to Atlantis, lies not in Ireland, gentlemen, but in Iceland.
Pause for effect.
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.
Would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment?
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.
Yeah. Just a second.
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.
How's that? Is that better?
Yeah. You're welcome.
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.
Now, as you can see by the...
By this map...
Map that...
That I've drawn, I plotted the route that will take myself and a crew to the southern coast of Iceland to retrieve the Journal.
Showtime.
Well, this is it.
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you"
"that your meeting today has been moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."
What?
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,"
"the board has voted to reject your proposal."
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."
They can't do this to me!
I swear, that young Thatch gets crazier every year.
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,
I'll step in front of a bus.
I'll push you.
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!
Head for the hills!
Where is a guard when you need him?
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!
Sir?
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...
Thank you very much. Look at...
This museum funds scientific expeditions based on facts, not legends and folklore.
Besides, we need you here.
- We depend on you.
- You do?
Yes. What with winter coming, that boiler's going to need a lot of attention.
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!
But there... There's a journal!
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!
Sir, I really hoped it wouldn't come to this, but this is a letter of resignation.
If you reject my proposal, I'll...
I'll quit!
I mean it, sir.
If you refuse to fund my proposal...
You'll what?
Flush your career down the toilet, just like your grandfather?
You have a lot of potential, Milo.
Don't throw it all away chasing fairy tales.
But I can prove Atlantis exists!
You want to go on an expedition?
Here. Take a trolley to the Potomac and jump in!
Maybe the cold water will clear your head. Heinz!
I'm home.
Fluffy? Here, kitty.
Milo James Thatch?
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?
I came down the chimney.
My name is Helga Sinclair.
I'm acting on behalf of my employer, who has a most intriguing proposition for you.
Are you interested?
Your employer?
Who is your employer?
This way, please.
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.
Step lively.
Mr. Whitmore does not like to be kept waiting.
You will address him as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."
You will stand unless asked to be seated.
Keep your sentences short and to the point.
Are we clear?
And relax.
He doesn't bite... often.
Grandpa?
Finest explorer I ever met.
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.
Join me in a little yoga?
No, no. Thank you.
Did you really know my grandfather?
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown.
Class of '66. We stayed close friends till the end of his days.
Even dragged me along on some of his danged fool expeditions.
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.
He spoke of you often.
Funny. He never mentioned you.
He wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.
I keep a low profile.
Mr. Whitmore, should I be wondering why I'm here?
Look on that table.
It's for you.
It's from my grandfather.
He brought that package to me years ago.
He said if anything were to happen to him,
I should give it to you when you were ready.
Whatever that means.
It...
It can't be.
It's The Shepherd's Journal.
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!
Atlantis.
I wasn't born yesterday, son.
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.
That's because it's been written in a dialect that no longer exists.
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.
I've spent my whole life studying dead languages.
It's not gibberish to me.
It's probably a fake.
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known if this were a fake. I would know.
I will stake everything I own, everything that I believe in, that this is the genuine Shepherd's Journal.
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?
Well, I'll get funding.
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.
I'll show them! I will make them believe.
Like you did today?
Yes! Well, no. How did you...
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!
I will find Atlantis on my own.
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!
Congratulations, Milo.
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.
But forget the rowboat, son.
We'll travel in style.
It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax.
Why?
For years, your granddad bent my ear with stories about that old book.
I didn't buy it for a minute.
So, finally, I got fed up and I made a bet with the old coot.
I said, "Thatch, if you ever actually find that so-called journal",
"not only will I finance the expedition,"
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."
Imagine my embarrassment when he found the darn thing.
Now, I know your grandfather's gone, Milo,
God rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore is a man who keeps his word.
You hear that, Thatch?
I'm going to the afterlife with a clear conscience, by thunder!
Your grandpa was a great man.
You probably don't realize how great.
Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down, made a laughing stock of him.
He died a broken man.
If I could bring back just one shred of proof, that'd be enough for me.
Thatch.
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know, in order to do what you're proposing, you're gonna need a crew.
Taken care of.
You'll need engineers and geologists.
Got 'em all. The best of the best.
Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation.
The man has a nose for dirt.
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.
She's forgotten more about engines than you and I will ever know.
They're the same crew that brought the Journal back.
- Where was it?
- Iceland.
I knew it! I knew it!
All we need now is an expert in gibberish.
So, it's decision time.
You can build on the foundation your grandfather left you or you can go back to your boiler room.
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?
- Packed.
- My books?
- In storage.
- My cat?
My gosh.
Your granddad had a saying.
"Our lives are remembered, by the gifts we leave our children."
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.
You will not regret this.
Boy, I am so excited,
I can't even hold it in.
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?
I didn't even eat carrots.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
To whoever took the "L" from the Motor Pool sign, we are all very amused.
Excuse me? I need to report in?
Yes, Mr. Thatch?
It's you!
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.
Hold that thought.
What is it this time, Cookie?
You done stuffed my wagon full to busting with non-essentials.
Look at all this.
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?
And what is this?
That would be lettuce.
Lettuce? Lettuce?
It's a vegetable, Cookie.
The men need the four basic food groups.
I got your four basic food groups!
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
Final loading in progress.
Hey, Junior.
If you're looking for the pony rides, they're back there.
Excuse me. Excuse me?
You dropped your dynamite.
What else have you got in there?
Gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads, fuses, wicks, glue, and...
Paper clips. Big ones.
You know, just office supplies.
Milo! Where you been?
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.
He led the Iceland team that brought the Journal back.
Milo Thatch.
Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus.
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures, but I prefer a good western myself.
Pretty impressive?
Boy, when you settle a bet, you settle a bet.
Well, your granddad always believed you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge.
Well, believe me, this'll be small change compared to the value of what we're gonna learn on this trip.
Yes, this should be enriching for all of us.
Attention, all personnel.
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.
It's time.
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!
Rig ship for dive!
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.
Lieutenant, take her down.
Diving officer, submerge the ship.
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.
- Take us down.
- Take us down!
Attention.
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.
Musical program to follow.
Who wrote this?
You have disturbed the dirt.
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!
Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries!
What have you done?
England must never merge with France!
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.
There you are.
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.
Parchment fiber from the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.
Lead pencil, number 2.
Paint flecks of a type used in government buildings.
You have a cat, shorthaired Persian, two years old, third in a litter of seven.
There are all the microscopic fingerprints of the mapmaker.
And linguist.
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?
Moliere, now what have I told you about playing nice with the other kids?
Get back. I've got soap, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!
The name's Sweet.
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.
Yeah, Milo Thatch.
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.
Well, no time like the present.
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?
The catalog says that this little beauty can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.
Now, stick out your tongue and say, "Ah."
Oh, no, really. I have a...
So, where you from?
Really? I have family up that way.
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.
Hate the taste, hate the smell, and hate all them little bones.
Here, I'm gonna need you to fill these up.
With what?
Will Milo Thatch please report to the bridge?
Thank you.
I mean, nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you, too.
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"
And he says to me...
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...
All right, let's have a look around.
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.
Aye, aye, sir.
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes.
Come right two-four-zero.
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.
Okay, everybody,
I want you to give Mr. Thatch your undivided attention.
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?
Okay, how about some slides?
The first slide is a depiction of a creature.
A creature so frightening that sailors were said to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.
I'm sorry. That's wrong.
Geez, I used to take lunch money from guys like this.
Anyway, this... Okay.
This is an illustration of the Leviathan, the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis.
With something like that,
I would have white wine, I think.
It's a mythical sea serpent.
He's described in The Book of Job.
The Bible says,
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,"
"sparks of fire shoot out."
But more likely, it's a carving or a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?
When do we dig?
Actually, we don't have to dig.
You see, according to the Journal, the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel at the bottom of the ocean, and we'll come up a curve into an air pocket right here, where we'll find the remnants of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis.
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.
Hard to believe he's still single.
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.
Captain, you'd better come look at this, sir.
Okay, class dismissed.
Give me exterior lights.
Look at that.
There are ships here from every era.
Commander, I think you should hear this.
Commander? Commander?
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."
Commander?
"There you will find the path to the gateway."
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?
I'm picking up something on the hydrophone.
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.
What is it? A pod of whales?
Bigger.
It sounds metallic.
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.
Helmsman! Bring us about.
Tighten our search pattern and slow us to...
Out of the way!
Tell Cookie to melt the butter and break out the bibs.
I want this lobster served up on a silver platter.
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!
Battle stations!
Steady, boys. Don't panic.
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!
Wait, wait!
Launch subpods!
Subpods away!
Fire!
We're free. All ahead full.
Fire torpedoes!
Get me the bridge!
Sir, it's Engineering on four.
Rourke! We took a big hit down here, and we're taking on water fast.
I don't want to be around when it hits the boilers.
How much time do we have?
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.
You better make that five.
You heard the lady. Let's move!
Move! Where? Move where?
Packard, sound the alarm!
He took his suitcase?
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.
No, no, I'll call you.
All hands, abandon ship.
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!
Come on! Everybody grab a seat and buckle in.
Lieutenant, get us out of here!
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!
Hang on.
Where to, Mr. Thatch?
We're looking for a big crevice of some kind.
There! Up ahead.
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.
Right behind you!
- Sacr√© bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!
Look out!
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!
Seven hours ago, we started this expedition with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.
We're all that's left.
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.
We have a crisis on our hands.
But we've been up this particular creek before, and we've always come through, paddle or no paddle.
I see no reason to change that policy now.
From here on in, everyone pulls double duty.
Everyone drives, everyone works.
Looks like all our chances for survival rest with you, Mr. Thatch.
You and that little book.
We're all gonna die.
Okay, people. Saddle up.
Lieutenant, I want this convoy moving five minutes ago.
Moliere, you're on point.
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards behind that truck at all times.
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.
Are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle?
Can you drive a truck?
Of course I can drive a truck.
I mean, sure, you got your steering, and your gas, and your brake, and of course, this metal-looking thing.
Okay, so it was a bumper car at Coney Island, but it's the same basic principle!
Come on! Move it!
Sorry about... Sorry about that.
Come on, civilian!
You didn't just drink that, did you?
That's not good.
That's nitroglycerin.
Don't move.
Don't breathe.
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.
Boom!
Yeah.
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.
It must have taken hundred...
No, thousands of years to carve this thing.
Hey, look, I made a bridge.
It only took me, like, what?
10 seconds, 11, tops.
Looks like we have a little roadblock.
Vinny, what do you think?
I could un-roadblock that if I had about 200 of these.
Problem is, I only got about 10.
Plus, you know, five of my own, and a couple of cherry bombs, a road flare.
Hey, too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin, Milo?
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.
It will be my pleasure.
Stupid...
Stupid!
I don't understand it.
I just tuned this thing up this morning.
It looks like the rotor's shot!
I'm gonna have to pull a spare from one of the trucks.
- Can I...
- No toques nada!
I'll be right back.
She lives!
Hey, what'd you do?
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.
Now, we got the 814 back at the museum.
The heating cores on the whole Humac line have always been a little, you know, temperamental, so sometimes you gotta... Boom!
Persuade 'em a little.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.
Shut up.
Two for flinching.
This is it. It's gotta be.
All right, we'll make camp here.
Why is it glowing?
It is a natural phosphorescence.
That thing is going to keep me up all night, I know it.
Come and get it!
For the appetizer, Caesar salad, escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.
Knock yourself out.
There you go, Milo.
Put some meat on them bones.
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.
You like it? Well, have some more.
You're so skinny, if you turned sideways and stuck out your tongue, you'd look like a zipper.
You know, we've been pretty tough on the kid.
What do you say we cut him some slack?
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?
Really? You don't mind?
Nah. Park it here.
Gee, this is great.
I mean, you know, it's an honor to be included in your...
- Mole!
- Forgive me.
I could not resist.
Hey, Milo, don't you ever close that book?
Yeah, you must've read it a dozen times by now.
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.
See, in this passage here, the shepherd seems to be leading up to something.
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.
It could be the power source the legends refer to.
But then, it just... It cuts off.
It's almost like there's a missing page.
Kid, relax.
We don't get paid overtime.
I know, I know.
Sometimes I get a little carried away.
But hey, you know, that's what this is all about, right?
I mean, discovery, teamwork, adventure.
Unless, maybe...
You're just in it for the money.
- Money.
- Money.
I'm gonna say... Money.
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.
What, is something wrong with your neck?
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...
Better?
Yeah!
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.
- No kidding.
- Nope.
I got a sheepskin from Howard U, and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.
One day I'm studying gross anatomy in the classroom, the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders on San Juan Hill.
Main course.
I couldn't eat another bite.
I'm watching my weight.
Don't you worry.
It'll keep and keep and keep.
Thank God I lost my sense of taste years ago.
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?
I did.
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.
I haven't gone camping since...
Well, since the last time my grandpa took me.
I never got to meet your grandfather.
What was he like?
Where do you start?
He was like a father to me, really.
My parents died when I was a little kid, and he took me in.
What?
Well, I was just thinking.
One time, when I was eight, we were hiking along this stream, and I saw something shining in the water.
It was a genuine arrowhead.
Well, you'd think I'd found a lost civilization the way Grandpa carried on about it.
It wasn't until I was older that I realized that the arrowhead was just some compressed shale mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured into an isosceletic triangulate.
That is so cute!
Say, Audrey, no offense, but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic of a multimillion dollar expedition?
Well, I took this job when my dad retired.
But the funny thing was he always wanted sons, right?
One to run his machine shop and the other to be middleweight boxing champion.
But he got my sister and me instead.
So, what happened to your sister?
She's 24-0 with a shot at the title next month.
Anyway, I'm saving up so my papi and I can open another shop.
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?
I sleep in the nude.
You're gonna want a pair of these.
She sleepwalks.
Well, as far as me goes,
I just like to blow things up.
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.
My family owned a flower shop.
We would sell roses, carnations, baby's breath, you name it.
One day, I'm making about three dozen corsages for this prom.
You know, the one they put on their wrist.
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"
It's a nightmare.
Anyway, I guess there was this leak next door of gas or what. Boom!
No more Chinese laundry.
Blew me right through the front window.
It was like a sign from God.
I found myself that boom.
What's Mole's story?
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't have told me, but you did.
And now, I'm telling you, you don't wanna know.
The redhead's got a gun.
Holy...
Fire.
Fire!
I'm gonna kill him.
Thatch, go back to bed.
Get some water on that fire!
No time!
Get us into those caves!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Gertie, pull!
Milo, jump! Right now!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.
Danged lightning bugs done bit me on my sit upon.
Somebody's gonna have to suck out that poison.
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.
Audrey, give me a damage report.
Not as bad as it could have been.
We totaled rigs two and seven, but the digger looks like it'll still run.
Lucky for us we landed in something soft.
Pumice ash.
We are standing at the base of a dormant volcano.
It just keeps going.
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.
Maybe not.
The magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano, effectively blocking the exit.
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.
Hold on. Back up.
Are you saying this whole volcano can blow at any time?
No, no, no, no.
That would take an explosive force of great magnitude.
Maybe I should do this later?
If we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface.
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?
Mr. Thatch?
Thatch?
Hey, wait!
Who are you? Where are you going?
Come back!
Hey, wait a minute!
Who are you?
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!
It's beautiful.
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.
You really came through.
I take that back.
Holy cats! Who are these guys?
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!
I seen this back in the Dakota.
They can smell fear just by looking at ya.
So, keep quiet.
I think it's talking to you.
Parlez-vous fran√ßais?
Oui, monsieur!
They speak my language!
Pardon, mademoiselle.
Voulez-vous...
I like her.
'Bout time someone hit him.
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.
How do they know all these languages?
Their language must be based on a root dialect.
It's just like the Tower of Babel.
Well, maybe English is in there somewhere.
We are explorers from the surface world.
We come in peace.
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.
Come. You must speak with my father now.
Squad "B," head back to the shaft and salvage what you can.
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.
Let's move it. You heard him.
I'm so excited!
Now, what's really amazing is that if you deconstructed Latin, you overlaid it with a little Sumerian, throw in a dash of Thessalonian, you'd be getting close to their basic grammatical structure.
Or at least you'd be in the same ballpark...
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.
Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here.
This changes everything.
This changes nothing.
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!
Your Majesty?
On behalf of my crew, may I say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.
Excuse me? Commander?
You presume much to think you are welcome here.
Oh, sir, we have come a long way looking for...
I know what you seek, and you will not find it here.
Your journey has been in vain.
But we are peaceful explorers, men of science.
And yet you bring weapons.
Our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter.
Some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force.
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.
- Sir...
- Not now, son.
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.
May I respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
That would give us time to rest, resupply, and be ready to travel by morning.
Very well. One night.
That is all.
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.
Your heart has softened, Kida.
A thousand years ago, you would have slain them on sight.
A thousand years ago, the streets were lit, and our people did not have to scavenge for food at the edge of a crumbling city!
The people are content.
They do not know any better!
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.
The kings of our past would weep if they could see how far we have fallen.
- Kida.
- If these outsiders can unlock the secrets of our past, perhaps we can save our future.
What they have to teach us we have already learned.
Our way of life is dying.
Our way of life is preserved.
Kida, when you take the throne, you will understand.
- So, how'd it go?
- Well, the King and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye.
She seems to like us okay, but the King...
I don't know. I think he's hiding something.
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!
Someone who can speak the language.
For the good of the mission, I will go!
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.
"Look, I have some questions for you,
"and I'm not leaving this city until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.
That's good, that's good.
I have some questions for you, and you are not leaving this city until they are answered.
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.
Oh, there is so much to ask about your world.
You are a scholar, are you not?
Judging from your diminished physique and large forehead, you are suited for nothing else.
What is your country of origin?
When did the flood waters recede?
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.
I got a few questions for you, too.
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one, then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.
Very well. What is your first question?
Well, okay, how did you get here?
Well, I mean, not you, personally, but your culture.
I mean, how did all of this end up down here?
It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis.
They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here.
All I can remember is the sky going dark and people shouting and running.
Then, a bright light, like a star floating above the city.
My father said it called my mother to it.
I never saw her again.
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,
I know how you feel, because I lost my...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Back up!
What are you telling me?
That you remember because you were there?
No, that's... That's impossible...
Because, I mean, that would make you...
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.
Yes.
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.
Just...
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.
How is it you found your way to this place?
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.
If it weren't for this book, we never would have made it.
Okay, second question. Legend has it that your people possessed a power source of some kind that enabled them...
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.
That's what I do, that's my job.
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here, you can read this?
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.
You can't, can you?
No one can.
Such knowledge has been lost to us since the time of the mehbehlmoak.
Oh, the Great Flood.
- Show me.
- Okay...
"Follow the narrow passage for another league."
"There, you will find the fifth marker."
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?
Boorish, provincial...
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.
Here, let me show you something.
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.
Yes. But no matter what I try, it will not respond.
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."
Yes, yes, I have done that!
"Gently place your hand on the inscription pad."
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!
While your hand was on the inscription pad?
No.
Well. See, there's your problem right there.
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit for even getting this far.
Okay, give it a try.
Yeah, you got that right.
This is great! With this thing,
I could see the whole city in no time at all.
Wonder how fast it goes.
So, who's hungry?
By the way, we were never properly introduced.
My name's Milo.
My name is Kidagakash.
Kidamaschnaga.
Hey, you got a nickname?
Kida.
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.
What is wrong?
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.
You know, my grandpa used to tell me stories about this place as far back as I can remember.
I just wish he could be standing here with me.
Tell me more about your companions.
Your physician, he is called Cookie?
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?
The doctor. He's Sweet.
Oh, he is kindly.
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.
So all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
No. Well, I'm sure some are.
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.
Look at all those tattoos.
Shoot. That ain't nothing.
Look here what I got.
All 38 United States.
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.
There you go.
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.
Sweet is kindly, but that is not his name.
Audrey is sweet, but she is not your doctor.
And the little digging animal called Mole...
He is your pet?
Close enough.
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.
That's where all the nutrients are.
You know, Kida, the most we ever hoped to find was some crumbling buildings, maybe some broken pottery.
Instead, we find a living, thriving society.
These guys are kinda cute when they're not, you know, formed into a fiery column of death.
We are not thriving.
True, our people live, but our culture is dying.
We are like a stone the ocean beats against.
With each passing year, a little more of us is worn away.
I wish there was something I could do.
I have brought you to this place to ask you for your help.
There is a mural here with writing all around the pictures.
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.
Well, this... Kida?
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.
Pretty good! Pretty good.
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.
Good. It is a fair distance to where we are going.
Hey, you are talking to the belly flop champ at Camp Runamuck.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Why don't you lead the way, because
I have no idea where we're going.
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...
Good. Follow me.
This is amazing!
A complete history of Atlantis!
It's just like Plato described it.
Well, he was off on a few details, but...
The light I saw.
The star in the middle of the city.
What does the writing say about that?
I don't know yet.
But we're gonna find out.
Come on.
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's what the shepherd was talking about.
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.
Like these! Don't you get it?
The power source I've been looking for, the bright light you remember.
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.
It's what's keeping all these things...
You, all of Atlantis alive.
Then where is it now?
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something this important would have been in the Journal, but...
Unless... The missing page.
You have a nice swim?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
What's... What's with all the guns?
Guys?
I am such an idiot.
This is just another treasure hunt for you.
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?
The heart of Atlantis.
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner, but it was strictly on a need-to-know basis.
And, well, now you know.
I had to be sure you were one of us.
Welcome to the club, son.
I'm no mercenary.
Mercenary?
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."
Besides, you're the one who got us here.
You led us right to the treasure chest.
You don't know what you're tampering with, Rourke.
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.
It's going to make us all rich.
You think it's some kind of a diamond,
I thought it was some kind of a battery, but we're both wrong.
It's their life force.
That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive.
You take that away, and they'll die.
Well, that changes things.
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.
I was thinking triple.
Rourke, don't do this.
Academics. You never want to get your hands dirty.
Think about it.
If you gave back every stolen artifact from a museum, you'd be left with an empty building.
We're just providing a necessary service to the archeological community.
Not interested.
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.
You're an idealist, just like your grandfather.
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.
For once, do the smart thing.
I really hate it when negotiations go sour.
Let's try this again.
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!
Spread out! Search everywhere!
You're not applying yourself, son.
There's got to be something else.
Well, there isn't. It just says,
"The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king."
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here can help us fill in the blanks.
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?
You will destroy yourselves.
Maybe I'm not being clear.
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.
Plan's changed, doc.
I'd suggest you put a bandage on that bleeding heart of yours.
It doesn't suit a mercenary.
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.
Now, I'm going to count to 10.
And you're going to tell me where the crystal is.
One...
Two...
Nine...
T...
The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king.
This is it. We're in.
Rourke, for the last time, you've got to listen to me.
You don't have the slightest idea what this power is capable of.
True, but I can think of a few countries who'd pay anything to find out.
Hurry. Get on.
Jackpot.
The kings of our past.
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.
We got a schedule to meet.
Kida...
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's get this over with.
I don't like this place.
All right, Thatch, what's next?
Okay, there's a giant crystal hovering 150 feet above our heads over a bottomless pit of water.
Doesn't anything surprise you?
The only thing that surprises me is you're still talking and that thing's not on the truck yet.
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.
I don't even know what's holding it up there.
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?
Look, all it says here is that the crystal is alive, somehow.
I don't know how to explain it.
It's their deity. It's their power source.
Speak English, professor.
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.
I'm doing the best I can here.
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.
Why don't you translate, and I'll wave the gun around?
What did she say?
I don't know. I didn't catch it.
Hold your horses, lover boy.
Kida.
No, don't. Don't touch her.
All right, step back.
Sergeant, keep those people back.
You heard him. Step back.
I'm warning you.
So...
I guess this is how it ends?
Fine. You win.
You're wiping out an entire civilization, but hey... You'll be rich.
Congratulations, Audrey.
Guess you and your dad will be able to open up that second garage after all.
And, Vinny, you can start a whole chain of flower shops.
I'm sure your family's going to be very proud.
But that's what it's all about, right?
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.
We're just helping it along.
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.
I know I'm forgetting something.
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...
Oh, yeah.
Look at it this way, son.
You were the man who discovered Atlantis, and now, you're part of the exhibit.
Let's move, people.
That was an order, not a suggestion. Let's go!
We're all going to die.
Oh, you can't be serious.
This is wrong, and you know it.
We're this close to our biggest payday ever, and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience.
We've done a lot of things we're not proud of, robbing graves, plundering tombs, double parking, but nobody got hurt.
Well, maybe somebody got hurt, but nobody we knew.
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.
More for me.
P.T. Barnum was right.
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.
Okay, now you can go.
Milo, you better get up here.
How's he doing?
Not good, I'm afraid.
Internal bleeding.
There's nothing more I can do.
What a nightmare.
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.
He's been after that crystal since Iceland.
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.
These... These crystals, they have some sort of healing energy.
I've seen it work.
No.
Where is my daughter?
Well, she...
She has been chosen, like her mother before her.
What?
In times of danger, the crystal will choose a host, one of royal blood, to protect itself and its people.
It will accept no other.
Wait a minute. Choose?
So this thing is alive?
In a way.
The crystal thrives on the collective emotions of all who came before us.
In return, it provides power, longevity, protection.
As it grew, it developed a consciousness of its own.
In my arrogance,
I sought to use it as a weapon of war, but it's power proved too great to control.
It overwhelmed us and led to our destruction.
That's why you hid it beneath the city.
To keep history from repeating itself.
And to prevent Kida from suffering the same fate as my beloved wife.
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?
If she remains bonded to the crystal, she could be lost to it forever.
The love of my daughter is all I have left.
My burden would have become hers when the time was right, but now, it falls to you.
Me?
Return the crystal.
Save Atlantis.
Save my daughter.
So, what's it going to be?
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?
Well, I think we've seen how effective my decisions have been.
Let's recap.
I lead a band of plundering vandals to the greatest archeological find in recorded history, thus enabling the kidnap and/or murder of the royal family.
Not to mention personally delivering the most powerful force known to man into the hands of a mercenary nutcase who's probably going to sell it to the Kaiser!
Have I left anything out?
Well, you did set the camp on fire
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Of course, it's been my experience when you hit bottom, the only place left to go is up.
Who told you that?
A fella by the name of Thaddeus Thatch.
Where are you going?
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.
Come on. We better make sure he doesn't hurt himself.
Milo, what do you think you are doing?
Just follow my lead.
I'm impressed.
It's simple. All you got to do...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?
No, no, wait!
Gently. Just gently.
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?
You know, like a tuna?
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.
Kida showed me.
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.
I'm so excited.
All right, this is it!
We're going to rescue the princess.
We're going to save Atlantis.
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!
I love it when I win.
Okay, here's the plan.
We're going to come in low and fast and take them by surprise.
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.
Rourke is never surprised, and he's got a lot of guns.
Great. Well, do you have any suggestions?
Yeah. Don't get shot.
There they are!
We've got company!
Take off!
Take her up!
Holy smokes!
You told me he only had guns.
What I said was, he's never surprised.
Okay, now things are getting good.
Vinny! Heads up!
We can't let them reach the top of that shaft!
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath that thing and cut her loose.
We're on it.
Lieutenant!
I thought you said this thing could cut through a femur in 28 seconds!
Less talk, more saw.
Looks like somebody's working overtime.
Come on, girl. Time's up.
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?
Yeah. I really wish I had a better idea than this!
We're losing altitude.
Lighten the load.
That's it, unless someone wants to jump.
Ladies first.
You said we were in this together!
You promised me a percentage!
Next time, get it in writing.
Nothing personal.
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck than I would have ever thought possible.
I consider myself an even-tempered man.
It takes a lot to get under my skin.
But congratulations, you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.
Nothing personal.
Tired, Mr. Thatch?
That's a darn shame because I'm just getting warmed up.
Thank heaven.
Oh, great!
The volcano... She awakes!
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
This here would be a good place not to be.
No, wait. We got to get her back or the whole city will die.
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.
It's the only way to reverse this.
Just do it!
Milo, no!
Go!
The fissure, it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!
Milo?
Atlantis will honor your names forever.
I only wish there was more we could do for you.
You know, thanks anyway, but I think we're good.
They'll take you as far as the surface.
We are really going to miss you, Milo.
You know, I'm going to reopen the flower shop, and I'm going to think of you guys every single day,
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,
Saturday until 2:00.
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off, probably, and...
Maybe I'll go in for a couple of hours, you know.
But August... I'm going to take August.
I ain't so good at speechifying, but I wanted you to have this.
It's the bacon grease from the whole trip.
Cookie, I...
Two for flinching.
See you, Milo.
Hey, Milo!
Mole.
Mole. Hey, well...
Good-bye, Mole.
Now, you sure you want to stay?
There's a hero's welcome waiting for the man who discovered Atlantis.
I don't think the world needs another hero.
Besides, I hear there's an opening down here for an expert in gibberish.
You take good care of yourself, Milo Thatch.
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.
Come here.
Sweet, before you go, could you...
No problem.
Thanks.
Oh, you're getting a bill.
Can we go home now?
Come on, y'all. Let's get one last shot in front of the fish.
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!
Now, let's go over it again, just so we got it straight.
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...
And fish, little fish.
Sponges.
What happened to Helga?
Well, we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her.
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.
In fact, you could say he was transamorgafied and then busted into a zillion...
He's missing, too.
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.
Lord, give me strength.
I'm going to miss that boy.
At least he's in a better place now.
Dear Mr. Whitmore,
I hope this piece of proof is enough for you.
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.
They'll try to hold you back
And they will say you're wrong
But they will never understand
The journey that you're on
They'll try to change your mind
They'll try to change your heart
Oh, yeah
But they will never understand
Who you are
And you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
And you know
You must go
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where you can take your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Oh, yeah
There's something in your soul
Something in your soul
That won't be denied
It's the faith to dream that keeps
The dream alive
So you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where your dream takes your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Go where your heart is meant to be
And you may find
Somebody there
Someone to share your dream
All right, all right
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream leads you
Your dream will lead you on
Far as your heart can see
Your dream will lead you on
Oh, yes
There's a world that waits for you
You're not alone
You'll find your home
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your mind
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your heart
Where the dream takes you
But you must go
- Blue.
- B-L-U-E. Pick a number.
- Eight.
Pick one more number.
- Fifteen.
Pick another number.
- Six.
- Okay.
"Dream is destiny."
Rock out.
Rock 'n' roll.
Low strings. Begin!
Sara, try that thing you asked me about.
- Will you try it more subdued?
- Okay.
- Try it, see what you think.
- That one?
But I want it to sound rich and almost a little wavy...
...due to being a bit out of tune.
- You want it...
- Slightly detached.
That's what I was wondering.
We're going:
- Yeah. You got it.
- Okay.
Snazzy, people!
Okay, pickup to 20, please.
- This is the pickup to 20.
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Hey, it's me.
I just got back into town.
I thought I'd bum a ride, but that's cool.
I can just take a cab, something like that.
I guess I'll hang out with you later or something.
Ahoy there, matey!
You in for the long haul?
Do you need a lift on down the line?
I was waiting for a cab, but...
All right. Don't miss the boat.
- Hey, thanks.
- Not a problem.
Anchors aweigh!
What do you think of my vessel?
She's "see-worthy." S-E-E.
See with your eyes.
My transport should be an extension of my personality. Voila!
And this is my window to the world.
Every minute's a different show.
I may not understand it or agree with it...
...but I accept it and just sort of glide along.
Keep things on an even keel, I say.
Go with the flow.
The sea refuses no river.
The idea is to remain in a state of departure, while always arriving.
It saves on introductions and goodbyes.
The ride requires no explanation, just occupants.
That's where you come in.
It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon box.
You may get the eight-pack or the 16-pack...
...but it's all in what you do with the crayons, the colors you're given.
Don't worry about coloring within the lines.
Color outside the lines and off the page! Don't box me in!
We're in motion to the ocean.
We are not landlocked!
So where do you want out?
Who, me? Am I first? I don't know.
Really, anywhere is fine.
- Just give me an address, okay?
- Uh...
Tell you what.
Go up three more streets.
Take a right. Go two more blocks.
Drop him off on the next corner.
Where's that?
I don't know, but it's somewhere.
And it'll determine the course of the rest of your life.
All ashore that's going ashore!
Toot, toot.
I refuse to take existentialism as just another fashion...
...or historical curiosity...
...because it has something important to offer for the new century.
I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life passionately...
...taking responsibility for who you are...
...making something of yourself and feeling good about life.
Existentialism is often discussed as a philosophy of despair...
...but I think it's the opposite.
Sartre once said he never really felt a day of despair in his life.
One thing that comes from these guys...
...is not a sense of anguish so much as...
...an exuberance of feeling on top of it.
It's like your life is yours to create.
I've read the postmodernists with interest.
But I always have this awful, nagging feeling...
...that something essential is left out.
The more you talk about a person...
...as a social construction or a confluence of forces...
...or as fragmented or marginalized...
...then you open up a whole new world of excuses.
When Sartre talks about responsibility, it's not abstract.
It's not the kind of self or soul that theologians argue about.
It's something concrete.
It's us talking...
...making decisions and taking the consequences.
There are six billion people in the world.
Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.
It makes a difference in material terms and to other people.
It sets an example.
The message is, we should never write ourselves off...
...and see ourselves as victims of various forces.
It's always our decision who we are.
Creation comes out of imperfection.
It seems to come out of a striving and a frustration.
This is where, I think, language came from.
I mean, it came from our desire to transcend our isolation...
...and have some connection with one another.
It had to be easy when it was just simple survival.
"Water." We came up with a sound for that.
"Tiger behind you!"
We made a sound for that.
But when it gets really interesting, I think...
...is when we use that same system of symbols...
...to communicate all the abstract and intangible things we're experiencing.
What is "frustration"?
Or what is "anger" or "love"?
When I say "love"...
...the sound comes out of my mouth and hits the other person's ear...
...travels through this byzantine conduit in their brain...
...through their memories of love or lack of love.
They say they understand, but how do I know? Because words are inert.
They're just symbols. They're dead.
You know?
And so much of our experience is intangible.
So much of what we perceive cannot be expressed. It's unspeakable.
And yet, you know, when we communicate with one another...
...and we feel we have connected and think we're understood...
...I think we have a feeling of almost spiritual communion.
That feeling may be transient, but it's what we live for.
To look at human development, look at the organism's evolution...
...and his environmental interaction.
Evolution of the organism begins with evolution through the hominid...
...coming to the evolution of man.
Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon.
Now, what you're looking at here are three strings:
Biological, anthropological, development of cultures...
...and cultural, which is human expression.
What you've seen is the evolution of populations, not individuals.
Then look at the time scale involved.
Two billion years for life, six million for the hominid...
...100,000 years for mankind as we know it.
You see how the evolutionary paradigm telescopes.
Then when you get to agriculture, scientific and industrial revolution...
...you're looking at 10,000 years,
400 years, 150 years.
You see a further telescoping of evolutionary time.
As we go through the new evolution...
...it will telescope to the point where we see it within our lifetime.
The new evolution stems from two types of information:
Digital and analog.
Digital is artificial intelligence.
Analog results from molecular biology and cloning.
You knit the two with neurobiology.
Under the old paradigm, one would die, the other would dominate.
Under the new paradigm, they exist as a supportive...
...non-competitive grouping, independent from the external.
So evolution now becomes an individually centered process...
...emanating from the individual...
...not a passive process with the individual at the collective's whim.
So you produce a neo-human...
...with a new individuality, a new consciousness.
That's only the beginning of the cycle.
As it proceeds, the input is this new intelligence.
As intelligence piles on intelligence, ability on ability...
...the speed changes until you reach a crescendo.
Imagine it as an instant fulfillment of human and neo-human potential.
It could be the amplification of the individual...
...the multiplication of individual, parallel existences...
...with the individual no longer restricted by time and space.
And the manifestations of this neo-human evolution...
...could be dramatically counterintuitive.
The old evolution is cold, it's sterile. It's efficient.
Its manifestations are those of social adaption.
You're talking about parasitism, dominance, morality...
...war, predation.
These will be subject to de-emphasis and de-evolution.
The new paradigm would give us the traits...
...of truth, loyalty, justice and freedom.
These would be manifestations of this evolution. That's what we hope.
Self-destructive man feels completely alienated. Utterly alone.
He's an outsider to the community.
He thinks to himself,
"I must be insane."
What he fails to realize is that society has, as he does...
...an interest in considerable losses, in catastrophes.
Wars, famines, floods and quakes meet well-defined needs.
Man wants chaos.
In fact, he's gotta have it.
Depression, strife, riots, murder.
All this dread.
We're drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of destruction.
It's in all of us. We revel in it.
The media puts a sad face on things, painting them as human tragedies.
But the media's function is not to eliminate the evils of the world.
They persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them.
The powers that be want us to be passive observers.
Have you got a match?
They haven't given us any other options, outside the occasional...
...purely symbolic, participatory act of "voting."
Do you want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?
The time has come to project my inadequacies and dissatisfactions...
...into the sociopolitical and scientific schemes.
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.
I keep thinking about something you said.
- Something I said?
- Yeah.
About feeling like you observe your life...
...from the perspective of an old woman about to die. Remember?
Yeah. I still feel that way sometimes.
Like I'm looking back on my life.
Like my waking life is her memories.
Exactly.
I heard that Tim Leary said as he was dying...
...he looked forward to when his body was dead but his brain was alive.
Those six to 12 minutes of brain activity after everything shuts down.
And a second of dream consciousness is infinitely longer than a waking one.
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.
Like, I wake up at 10:12.
Then I go back to sleep...
...and have long, intricate dreams that seem hours long. Then I wake up and...
...it's 10:13.
Exactly. So in that six to 12 minutes of brain activity...
...that could be your life.
You are that woman, looking back over everything.
If I am? What would you be in that?
Whatever I am now.
I mean, maybe I only exist in your mind.
I'm still just as real as anything else.
Yeah.
I've been thinking about something you said.
What's that?
About reincarnation, and where all the new souls come from over time.
Everybody always...
...says they're the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great.
You know they were a dumb fuck like everyone else.
I mean, it's impossible.
The world population has doubled in the past 40 years.
- So if you believe in one eternal soul...
- Uh-huh.
...you have a 50% chance of your soul being over 40.
For it to be over 150 years old, it's only one out of six.
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't exist? Or we're all young souls?
- Half of us are first-round humans?
- No, no.
- What I'm saying...
- What's your point?
I believe reincarnation is a poetic expression...
...of what collective memory is.
- I read an article by a biochemist.
- Right.
He said when a member of a species is born...
...it has a billion years of memory to draw on.
This is where we inherit our instincts.
I like that. Like there's...
...this telepathic thing going on that we're a part of...
...whether we're conscious of it or not. That would explain these...
...seemingly spontaneous, worldwide, innovative leaps in science and art.
Like the same results popping up everywhere, independent of each other.
A guy on a computer figures something out and simultaneously...
...a bunch of people figure out the same thing.
They did this study.
They isolated a group over time...
...and they monitored their abilities at crossword puzzles...
- Uh-huh.
...in relation to the population.
Then they secretly gave them a day-old crossword. One already done by people.
Their scores went up dramatically.
Like 20%.
It's like once the answers are out there, people can pick up on them.
It's like we're all telepathically sharing our experiences.
I'll get you fuckers if it's the last thing I do.
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.
For every second I spend in this hellhole...
...I'll see you spend a year in living hell!
You fucks will beg me to let you die.
But no, not yet.
I want you cocksuckers to suffer.
I'll fix your asses.
Maybe a long needle in your eardrum.
Or a hot cigar in your eye.
Nothing fancy.
Some molten lead up the ass?
Or, better still, some of that old Apache shit.
Cut your eyelids off.
I'll just listen to you fucks screaming.
What sweet music that'll be.
We'll do it in the hospital...
...with doctors and nurses, so you pricks don't die too quick.
You know the best part?
The best part is you faggots will have your eyelids cut off...
...so you'll have to watch me do it to you.
You'll see me bring that cigar closer and closer to your wide-open eye...
...till you're almost out of your mind. But not quite.
I want it to last a long, long time.
I want you to know it's me.
I'm the one doing it to you. Me!
That sissy psychiatrist, what unmitigated ignorance!
And that old drunken fart of a judge.
What a pompous ass!
Judge not, lest ye be judged!
All of you pukes are gonna die the day I get out of this shithole!
I guarantee you'll regret the day you met me!
In today's world-view, science has taken the place of God...
...but some philosophical problems are still troubling.
Take free will.
This problem has been around since Aristotle, in 350 B.C.
St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas worried how we can be free...
...if God already knows what we're gonna do.
Nowadays, we know the world works by fundamental physical laws.
These laws govern the behavior of every object in the world.
Since these laws are trustworthy, they enable technological achievements.
We're physical systems too. Complex arrangements of carbon, mostly water.
Our behavior isn't an exception to these laws.
So whether it's God setting things up in advance and knowing everything...
...or physical laws governing us, there's not much room for freedom.
You might want to ignore the mystery of free will.
To say, "It's a historical anecdote, it's sophomoric.
It's a question with no answer.
Forget about it."
But the question remains. If you think about individuality, who you are...
...is based on the free choices you make. Or take responsibility.
You're only held responsible or admired or respected...
...for things you do of your own free will.
The question keeps coming and we have no solution.
Decisions can seem like charades.
Imagine it. There's electrical activity in the brain. Neurons fire...
...sending a signal through the nerves into the muscle fibers. They twitch.
You reach out your arm.
It looks like a free action...
...but every part of that process...
...is governed by physical laws.
Chemical, electrical, and so on.
It looks like the big bang set the initial conditions...
...and the whole rest of human history...
...is the reaction of subatomic particles to basic physical laws.
We think we're special, we have dignity.
That now is threatened.
It's challenged by this picture.
You might say, "What about quantum mechanics? I know enough...
...to know it's a probabilistic theory.
It's loose, not deterministic.
It lets us understand free will."
But if you look at details it won't really help...
...because you have quantum particles, and their behavior is random.
They sort of swerve.
Their behavior is absurd...
...and unpredictable. We can't study it based on what came before.
It has a probabilistic framework.
Is freedom just a matter of probabilities?
Randomness in a chaotic system?
I'd rather be a gear in a deterministic, physical machine...
...than some random swerving.
We can't ignore the problem. We must find room in our world-view for persons.
Not just bodies, but persons.
There's the freedom problem...
...find room for choice and responsibility and understanding individuality.
"You can't fight city hall."
"Death and taxes." "Don't talk about politics or religion."
This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda.
Lay down, G.I! Lay down, G.I!
We saw it in the 20th century. Now, in the 21st century, we must realize...
...that we cannot be crammed into this rat maze.
We should not submit to dehumanization!
I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
I'm concerned with structure, the systems of control.
Those who control my life and those who seek to control it more!
I want freedom!
And that's what you should want!
It's up to each of us to turn loose the greed, hatred, envy...
...and insecurities, their mode of control. We feel pathetic, small...
...so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, liberty and destiny.
We must realize we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
Challenge the corporate slave state!
The 21st century is a new century.
Not the century of slavery...
...lies and issues of no significance...
...and classism, statism and other modes of control.
It'll be an age of humankind standing up for something pure and right.
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal
Democrat, conservative Republican.
Two sides of the same coin!
Two management teams...
...bidding for the CEO job of Slavery, Inc!
The truth is out there, but they lay out a buffet of lies!
I'm sick of it! And I'm not gonna take a bite out of it!
Resistance is not futile!
We will win this!
Humankind is too good!
We're not underachievers!
We'll stand up and be human beings!
We'll get fired up about real things!
Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
Well, that's all I got to say.
It's in your court.
The quest is to be liberated from the negative...
...which is really our own will to nothingness.
Once having said yes to the instant, the affirmation is contagious.
It bursts into a chain of affirmations that knows no limit.
To say yes to one instant...
...is to say yes to all of existence.
The main character is what I call "the mind."
Its mastery, its capacity to represent.
In history, attempts have been made...
...to contain experiences which happen at the edge of the limit...
...where the mind is vulnerable.
But I think we are in a very significant moment in history.
Those moments, those what we might call liminal, limit, frontier...
...X- zone experiences are now becoming the norm.
These multiplicities and distinctions send differences, giving...
...great difficulty to the old mind.
And through entering into their very essence...
...tasting and feeling their uniqueness...
...one makes a breakthrough to that common...
...something that holds them together.
And so the main character is to this new mind...
...greater, greater mind.
A mind that yet is to be.
And when we enter into that mode...
...you can see a radical subjectivity.
Radical attunement to individuality, uniqueness, to the mind.
It opens itself to a vast objectivity.
So the story is of the cosmos now.
The moment is not just a passing empty, nothing, yet...
...this is the way in which these secret passages happen.
Yes, it's empty with such fullness...
...that the great moment, the great life...
...of the universe is pulsating in it.
And each one, each object, each place...
...each act, leaves mark.
And that story is singular.
But, in fact, it's story after story.
It dissolves into quick-moving particles that swirl.
Either I'm moving fast, or time is.
Never both simultaneously.
It's such a strange paradox.
I'm closer to the end of my life than I've ever been...
...but I feel more than ever that
I have all the time in the world.
When I was younger, there was a need for...
...certainty. I had to get to the end of the path.
I know what you mean.
I remember thinking:
Someday, in my mid-30s maybe...
...everything's going to somehow gel and settle.
- Mm-hm.
- Just end.
It was like there was a plateau...
...waiting for me. I was climbing up.
When I got to the top...
...all growth and change would stop.
- Even exhilaration.
- Oh.
But it hasn't happened, thank goodness.
In our youth, we don't take into account our curiosity.
That's what's great about being human.
Yeah. You know what Benedict Anderson says about identity?
- No.
- He talks about, say, a baby picture.
You pick up this two-dimensional image and say, "That's me."
To connect this baby in this weird image with yourself in the present...
...you have to make up a story.
"This is me when I was a year old.
Later, I had long hair...
...and then we moved to Riverdale, and here I am."
So it takes a story that's actually a fiction...
...to make you and the baby identical.
- To create your identity.
- The funny thing is...
...our cells completely regenerate every seven years.
We've been several different people.
And yet, we always remain quintessentially ourselves.
Our critique began as all critiques begin, with doubt.
Doubt became our narrative.
Ours was a quest for a new story, our own.
We grasped for this new history, driven by suspicion...
...that ordinary language couldn't tell it.
Our past appeared frozen in the distance, and our every gesture...
...signified negation of the old world and the reach for a new one.
How we lived created a new situation of exuberance and friendship.
A subversive micro-society in the heart of an ignoring society.
Art was not the goal, but the occasion and method for locating our rhythm...
...and buried possibilities of our time.
It was about the true discovery of communication. Or the quest for such.
Finding and losing it.
We, the unappeased, continued looking...
...filling silences with wishes, fears, fantasies.
Driven on by the fact that no matter how empty the world seemed...
...no matter how degraded and used-up...
...anything was possible.
Given the right circumstances...
...a new world was just as likely as an old one.
There are two kinds of sufferers:
Those who suffer from a lack of life...
...and those who suffer from an overabundance of life.
I've always found myself in the second category.
When you think of it, almost all human behavior and activity...
...is essentially no different from animal behavior.
The most advanced technologies and craftsmanship bring us at best...
...up to the super-chimpanzee level.
Actually, the gap between, say, Plato or Nietzsche and the average human...
...is greater than between that chimpanzee and the average human.
The realm of the real spirit...
...the true artist, the saint, the philosopher, is rarely achieved.
Why so few?
Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress...
...but an endless and futile addition of zeros?
No greater values have developed.
Hell, the Greeks 3000 years ago were just as advanced as we are.
What are the barriers that keep people...
...from reaching anywhere near their real potential?
The answer to that can be found in another question, and that's this:
Which is the most universal human characteristic?
Fear...
...or laziness?
What are you writing?
A novel.
What's the story?
There's no story. It's just...
...people, gestures, moments.
Bits of rapture. Fleeting emotions.
In short...
...the greatest stories ever told.
Are you in the story?
I don't think so.
But then I'm kind of reading it and then writing it.
It was in the desert, the middle of nowhere, on the way to Vegas.
So you know, every once in a while a car would stop for gas.
It was the last gas stop before Vegas.
There was a chair and a cash register.
That was all the room there was.
I was asleep and I heard a noise.
You know, just like in my mind.
So I got up...
...and I walked out and stood on the curb...
...where the gas station ends.
You know, the driveway.
I'm rubbing my eyes, trying to see what's going on.
And way down, at the very end of the gas station, they had tire racks...
...with chains around them.
And I see there's an Econoline van down there.
And a guy with his T-shirt off.
And he's packing this Econoline van...
...with all these tires.
He's got the last two tires in his hands.
Pushes them into the thing.
And I, of course, I go, "Hey, you!"
This guy turns around.
He's got no shirt on. He's sweating.
Built like a brick shithouse.
Pulls out a knife, 12 inches long...
...and starts running at me as fast as he can, going:
Haaaa!
I'm still:
"This is wrong."
I walked in...
...stuck my hand behind the register where the owner kept a.41 revolver.
I pull it out...
...cock the trigger...
...and as I turn around, he's coming through the door. I saw his eyes.
I'll never forget this guy's eyes.
He just had bad thoughts about me in his eyes.
I fired a round and it hit him, boom, right in the chest.
Bang! As fast as he came in the door, he went out the door.
He went right up between the two pumps, ethyl and regular.
He must have been on drugs, on speed or something, because he stood up.
He still had the knife, and blood was just all over his chest.
He stood up and went like that, just moved a little. I'm in shock.
So I held the trigger back and fanned the hammer, it was one of those old-time:
I blew him out of the gas station.
Ever since then, I always carry this.
A well-armed populace is the best defense against tyranny.
I'll drink to that.
You know, I haven't fired this in a long time, I don't know if it works.
Pull the trigger and find out.
Hey, man, I guess you already took off or something.
Remind me to tell you about this dream
I had. There was some funny stuff.
All right, man.
I guess I'll catch you later. Okay.
...in the bareback riding.
Copenhagen William from Mike sankey...
Then, for a hatband, sew it into the inside...
I do not await the future...
...anticipating salvation, absolution or even enlightenment.
I believe that this flawed perfection is sufficient and complete...
...in every single, ineffable moment.
- The Blond Bee, Firefly, snake...
- lunatic macaroni munchkin with my goo-gat...
- venerable tradition of sorcerers, shamans and visionaries...
...who have perfected the art of dream travel...
...the so-called lucid dream state, where, by controlling your dreams...
...you can discover things beyond your apprehension in your awake state.
- Winning back-to... she tells him what Felix is doing.
A single ego is an absurdly narrow vantage...
...from which to view this experience.
Where most consider their relationship to the universe...
...I contemplate relationships of my various selves to one another.
While most with mobility problems can barely get around...
...at age 92, Joy Cullison's out seeing the world.
Hey, how's it going?
They say dreams are real only as long as they last.
Can't we say that about life?
A lot of us are mapping the mind-body relationship of dreams.
We're called oneironauts, explorers of the dream world.
There are two opposing states of consciousness...
...that don't oppose at all.
In the waking world, the neuro system inhibits the vividness of memories.
It makes evolutionary sense.
It'd be maladapted if a predator...
...could be mistaken for the memory of one...
...and vice versa.
If the memory of a predator...
...conjured up a perceptual image...
...we'd run whenever we had a scary thought.
Your serotonic neurons inhibit hallucinations.
They themselves are inhibited during REM sleep.
This allows dreams to appear real but prevents competition...
...from other perceptions.
This is why dreams are mistaken for reality.
To the functional system of neural activity that creates our world...
...there is no difference between dreaming a perception and an action...
...and actually the waking perception and action.
A friend once told me the worst mistake you can make...
...is to think that you are alive...
...when really you're asleep in life's waiting room.
The trick is to combine your waking rational abilities...
...with the infinite possibilities of your dreams.
Because if you can do that, you can do anything.
Ever have a job you hated and worked real hard at?
A long, hard day of work, finally you go home, get in bed, close your eyes.
Then you wake up and realize the whole day at work had been a dream.
It's bad enough you sell your waking life for...
...minimum wage, but now they get your dreams for free.
Hey, man, what are you doing here?
I fancy myself a social lubricator of the dream world...
...helping people get lucid easier.
Cut out the fear and anxiety and just rock 'n' roll.
Becoming lucid, you mean knowing you're dreaming?
Then you can control it. They're more realistic than non-lucid dreams.
I just woke from a dream.
It wasn't typical, more like
I was in an alternate universe.
Yep, it's real. Technically, it's a phenomenon of sleep...
...but you can have so much fun in dreams.
- And everyone knows, fun rules.
- Yeah.
- What was going on in your dream?
- A lot of people talking.
Some was absurdist, like from a strange movie.
Mostly people went off about whatever, really intensely.
I woke up wondering...
...where did this stuff come from?
- You can control that.
- You have these dreams a lot?
- I always make the best of it.
You have to realize you're dreaming in the first place.
To recognize it.
You have to be able to ask yourself,
"Is this a dream?"
Most people never ask themselves that, awake or asleep.
People sleepwalk in the waking state and wakewalk through dreams.
They don't get much out of it.
What snapped me into realizing
I was dreaming was my clock.
I couldn't read it, like the circuitry was screwed up.
That's common. Small printed material is pretty tough too. Very unstable.
Another tip-off is trying to adjust light levels. You can't.
If you see a light switch nearby, see if it works.
You can't do that in a lucid dream.
What the hell? I can fly around, have a conversation with Albert Schweitzer.
I can explore new dimensions of reality.
Not to mention, I can have any kind of sex I want. Which is way cool.
So I can't adjust lights!
So that's what you do to test if you're dreaming?
You can train yourself to recognize it.
Hit a switch now and then.
If the lights are on and you can't turn them off, you're dreaming.
Then you can get down to business.
And it's unlimited.
- Know what I've been working on?
- What?
It's way ambitious.
But I'm getting better at it.
You'll dig this.
Three-sixty vision, man. I can see in all directions. Cool, huh?
Yeah! Man...
Well, I gotta go, man.
Later. Super perfundo on the early eve of your day.
What's that mean?
I've never figured it out.
Maybe you can.
This guy always whispers it in my ear.
Louis.
He's a recurring dream character.
Cinema, in its essence...
...is about reproduction of reality, which is, reality is reproduced.
For him, it's not a storytelling medium.
He feels like...
...like film... Like literature is better for telling a story.
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Like if you tell a joke.
"A guy walks into a bar...
...and sees a dwarf."
That works. You imagine a guy and a dwarf in a bar, and it's imaginative.
But in film, you film a specific guy...
...in a specific bar with a specific dwarf who looks a certain way.
Like, for Bazin, what the ontology of film has to do with...
...is what photography has...
- Right.
...except it adds time and greater realism.
So it's about that guy, at that moment, in that space.
And Bazin is, like, a Christian, so he believes...
...in God, obviously, and that everything...
For him, reality and God are the same.
So what film is actually capturing is, like, God incarnate, creating...
...and, like this very moment,
God is manifesting as this.
What film would capture here right now...
...would be God as this table, as you, as me. God looking how we look...
...saying and thinking what we think, because we're all God manifest.
Mm-hm.
So film is a record of God, or the ever-changing face of God.
You have a mosquito. Want me to?
- You got it.
- I got it?
- Yeah, you got it.
- Okay.
Hollywood has taken film and made it a storytelling medium. You take...
...books or stories, get a script and find someone who fits it.
It's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be based on the script.
It should be based on the person or the thing.
They're right to have the star system.
Then it's about that person...
- Right, yeah.
...instead of the story.
Truffaut said the best films aren't made...
The best scripts don't make the best films.
They have a narrative you're a slave to.
The best films are the ones that aren't tied to that, slavishly.
So the narrative thing seems to me...
There's narrativity to film because it's in time, like music.
But you don't think of the story of the song. It comes out of the moment.
That's what film has.
It's that moment, which is holy.
This moment is holy.
We walk around like it's not.
Like there are some holy moments and others are not.
Right.
Like, this moment is holy. Film lets us see that, can frame it so we see it.
"Holy, holy, holy" moment by moment.
But who can live that way?
Because if I were to look at you and let you be holy, I would stop talking.
You'd be in the moment.
The moment is holy, right?
Yeah, I'd be open.
I'd look in your eyes...
...I'd cry and I'd feel this stuff, and that's not polite.
It'd make you uncomfortable.
You could laugh too.
Why would you cry?
Well, I don't know.
For me, I just tend to cry.
Uh-huh. Well, is the?
Let's do it right now.
Let's have a holy moment.
Okay.
- Everything is layers.
- Yeah.
There's the holy moment, then...
...the awareness of it. Like in film, the actual moment happens...
...then the character pretends to be in a different reality. It's layers.
I was in and out of the holy moment, looking at you.
You can't...
You're unique that way, Caveh.
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you.
You can bring me into that.
If the world is false and nothing is true, then everything is possible.
On the way to finding what we love, we find what blocks us from our desire.
Comfort will never be comfortable.
A systematic questioning of happiness.
Cut the vocal cords of every empowered speaker and devalue currency.
To confront the familiar.
Society is a fraud so complete...
...and venal, it demands to be destroyed beyond memory.
If there's fire, we'll carry gas.
Interrupt everyday experience and the expectations that go with it.
Live as if things depend on your actions.
Rupture the spell of the consumer society...
...so our repressed desires can come forward.
Demonstrate what life is and what it could be.
To immerse ourselves in the oblivion of actions.
There'll be an intensity never known.
To exchange love and hate...
...terror and redemption.
Affirmation of freedom so reckless it amounts to a denial of limitation.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure.
You need any help getting down, sir?
No, I don't think so.
Stupid bastard.
No worse than us.
He's all action, no theory.
We're all theory and no action.
Why so glum, Mr. Deborg?
What was missing was felt irretrievable.
The extreme uncertainties of subsisting without working...
...made excesses necessary...
...and breaks definitive.
To quote Stevenson:
"Suicide carried off many.
Drink and the devil...
...took care of the rest."
- Hey!
- Hey.
Are you a dreamer?
Yeah.
I haven't seen too many around lately.
Things have been tough for dreamers.
They say dreaming's dead.
No one does it anymore.
It's not dead.
It's just been forgotten.
Removed from our language.
Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.
I'm trying to change that.
I hope you are too...
...by dreaming every day.
Dreaming with our hands and minds.
Our planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced. Ever.
So don't be bored.
This is the most exciting time we could have hoped to be alive.
And things are just starting.
A thousand years is an instant. There's nothing new.
The same pattern over and over.
The same insights felt long ago.
There's nothing here for me now.
Now I remember. This happened to me before. This is why I left.
You have begun to find answers.
Though difficult, the rewards will be great.
Exercise your mind fully, knowing it is only an exercise.
Build artifacts, solve problems, explore the secrets of the universe.
Savor input from all the senses.
Feel joy, sorrow, laughter, empathy.
Tuck the memory in your travel bag.
I remember where I'm from and how I became human.
Why I hung around.
Now my departure is scheduled.
This way out. Escaping velocity.
Not just eternity, but infinity.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Hey.
Could we do that again?
I know we haven't met...
...but I don't want to be an ant.
We go through life bouncing off one another...
...continuously on ant autopilot...
...with nothing really human required of us.
Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there.
All action basically for survival.
All communication to keep the ant colony buzzing along...
...in an efficient, polite manner.
"Here's your change."
"Paper or plastic?" "Credit or debit?"
"Want ketchup with that?"
I don't want a straw,
I want real human moments.
I want to see you.
I want you to see me.
I don't want to give that up.
I don't want to be an ant, you know?
Yeah, no...
...I don't want to be an ant, either.
Thanks for kind ofjostling me there.
I've been...
...on zombie autopilot. I don't feel like an ant, but I look like one.
D.H. Lawrence had this idea of two people meeting...
...and instead ofjust passing...
...they accept "the confrontation between their souls."
It's like freeing the brave, reckless gods within us all.
Then it's like we have met.
I'm doing a soap opera, you might be interested.
The characters are the fantasy lives of the performers in it.
So figure out something you've always wanted to do, or a life you want...
...something like that.
We write that in...
...then you intersect with others in some typical soap-opera fashion.
Then I also want to show it live, with the actors present.
So once the episode's screened...
...the audience can direct the actors for subsequent episodes with menus.
It has to do with choices...
...and honoring people's ability to say what it is they want to see...
...and consumerism and art and commodity...
...and if you don't like it, send it back, and you get what you pay for...
...or just participating, you know, making choices.
So do you want to do it?
Yeah, that sounds really cool.
I'd love to be in it, but...
...I gotta ask you a question first.
I don't know how to say it, but...
What's it like to be a character in a dream? Because...
...I'm not awake right now. I haven't worn a watch since 4th grade.
I think this is the same watch too.
I don't know if you're able to answer that question.
I'm just trying to get a sense of where I am and what's going on.
What about you? What's your name?
What's your address?
What are you doing?
I can't really remember right now.
I can't really recall.
But that's beside the point, whether
I can dredge up information about...
...my address, or my mom's maiden name or whatnot.
I've got the benefit in this reality, if you call it that...
...of a consistent perspective.
What is your consistent perspective?
It's mostly just me dealing with a lot of people...
...who are exposing me to information and ideas...
...that seem vaguely familiar.
But at the same time, it's all very alien to me.
I'm not in an objective, rational world.
Like, I've been flying around...
It's weird, because it's not a fixed state.
It's more like a whole spectrum of awareness.
The lucidity wavers.
Right now I know I'm dreaming.
We're even talking about it. This is...
...the most in myself and in my thoughts I've been so far.
I'm talking about being in a dream.
But I'm beginning to think...
...it's something I don't have any precedent for.
It's totally unique.
The quality of the environment...
...and the information I'm receiving.
Like your soap opera, for example.
That's a really cool idea!
I didn't come up with that.
It's outside myself...
...like something transmitted to me externally.
I don't know what this is.
We think we're so limited by the world and the confines...
...but we're really just creating them.
You keep trying to figure it out, but now you know you're dreaming...
...you can do anything.
You're dreaming, but you're awake.
You have...
...so many options, and that's what life is about.
I understand what you're saying.
It's up to me, I'm the dreamer.
It's weird.
So much of the information...
...these people have been imparting...
...has got this really heavy connotation to it.
Well, how do you feel?
Sometimes I feel kind of isolated.
Most of the time, I feel connected, engaged in this active process.
Which is weird. Most of the time
I've been passive, not responding...
...except for now.
I've let information wash over me.
It's not necessarily passive to not respond verbally.
We're communicating on so many levels simultaneously.
Perhaps you're perceiving directly.
Most of the people I've encountered and the things I want to say...
...it's like they say it for me, almost at my cue.
It's complete unto itself.
It's not a bad dream.
It's a great dream.
But...
...it's so unlike any other dream
I've ever had before.
It's like "the" dream.
It's like I'm being prepared for something.
"On this bridge," Lorca warns...
..."life is not a dream.
Beware and...
...beware and beware."
So many think because "then" happened, "now" isn't.
But didn't I mention? The ongoing
"wow" is happening right now.
We are all coauthors of this dancing exuberance...
...where even our inabilities are having a roast.
We are the authors of ourselves, coauthoring a Dostoyevsky novel...
...starring clowns.
This thing we're involved with, the world...
...is an opportunity to exhibit how exciting alienation can be.
Life is a matter of a miracle...
...collected by moments flabbergasted to be in each other's presence.
The world is an exam...
...to see if we can rise into the direct experiences.
Eyesight is a test to see if we can see beyond it.
Matter is a test for our curiosity.
Doubt is an exam for our vitality.
Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather participate in life than write.
Giacometti was once run down by a car.
He recalled falling into a lucid faint...
...a sudden exhilaration...
...as he realized something was happening to him.
One assumes you can't understand life and live simultaneously.
I don't agree entirely. Which is to say, I don't exactly disagree.
I would say that life understood is life lived.
But the paradoxes bug me.
I can learn to love, and make love, to the paradoxes that bug me.
And on romantic evenings of self...
...I go salsa dancing with my confusion.
Before you drift off, don't forget...
...which is to say, remember.
Because remembering is so much more a psychotic activity than forgetting.
Lorca, in that same poem, said...
...that the iguana will bite those who do not dream.
And, as one realizes...
...that one is a dream figure in another person's dream...
...that is self-awareness.
You haven't met yourself yet.
But the advantage to meeting others in the meantime...
...is that one of them may present you to yourself.
Examine the nature of everything you observe.
For instance, you might find yourself...
...walking through a dream parking lot.
And, yes, those are dream feet inside your dream shoes.
Part of your dream self.
And so, the person you appear to be in the dream...
...cannot be who you really are.
This is an image...
...a mental model.
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't think so.
At the station? You were on the pay phone and you looked at me...
...a few times.
I remember that, but I don't remember that being you.
Are you sure?
Maybe not.
I was sitting down...
...and you were looking at me.
My little friend, dream no more. It's really here.
It's called Efferdent Plus.
In hell, you sink. In heaven, you rise to your fullness of love.
Hurry up! Come on, get in the car. Let's go.
The story goes like this:
Billy Wilder runs into Louis Malle.
This was the late '50s, early '60s.
Malle had just made his most expensive film, which cost $ 21/2 million.
Wilder asks him what the film's about.
Malle says, "It's a dream within a dream."
Wilder says,
"You just lost $ 21/2 million."
I feel a little apprehensive.
For years, the notion that life is a dream...
...has been a pervasive theme of philosophers and poets.
Doesn't it make sense that death would be wrapped in a dream?
That, after death, your conscious life would continue in a dream body?
It would be the same dream body as in your everyday dream life...
...except that in the post-mortal state, you could never again wake up.
Never again return to your physical body.
As the pattern gets more intricate, being swept along isn't enough.
What's the word, turd?
- Hey, do you also drive a boat-car?
- A what?
You gave me a ride in a car that was also a boat.
No, I don't have a "boat-car."
I don't know what you mean.
This must be parallel universe night.
That cat who just ran out the door?
He comes up and I say,
"What's the word?"
He lays down a burrito, looks at me and says:
"I've returned from the valley of death.
I rapturously breathe in the odors of life.
I've been to oblivion. I ferment the desire to remember everything."
So, what did you say to that?
Well, I mean, what could I say?
I said, "If you microwave that, poke holes in the plastic...
...because they explode, and I'm tired of cleaning up burrito."
The jalapenos dry up.
They're like little wheels.
When it was over, all I could think about was how...
...this entire notion of oneself...
...what we are...
...is just this logical structure.
A place to momentarily house all the abstractions.
It was a time to become conscious...
...to give form and coherence to the mystery.
And I had been a part of that.
It was a gift.
Life was raging all around me, and every moment was magical.
I loved all the people, dealing with all the contradictory impulses.
That's what I loved the most, connecting with the people.
Looking back, that's all that really mattered.
Kierkegaard's last words were,
"Sweep me up."
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
Weren't you in the boat-car?
The guy with the hat gave me a ride...
...in his car-boat thing.
You were in the back seat.
I'm not saying you don't know what you're talking about...
...but I don't know what you're talking about.
You guys let me off at this specific spot you gave him directions to.
I get out, ended up getting hit by a car.
Then I woke up. I was dreaming.
Later I found out I was still dreaming, dreaming that I'd woken up.
False awakenings,
I used to have those a lot.
But I'm still in it now.
I can't get out of it.
It's been going on forever.
I keep waking up into another dream.
I'm getting creeped out, like
I'm talking to dead people.
This woman on TV tells me how death...
...is this dream-time that exists out of life.
I'm starting to think I'm dead.
Let me tell you about a dream I had.
When someone says that, usually you're in for a very boring few minutes.
But what else are you gonna do?
- I read this essay by Philip K. Dick.
- In your dream?
No, I read it before the dream.
It was the preamble.
It was about that book,
Flow My Tears, the Policeman said.
- He won an award for that one.
- That's the one he wrote really fast.
It just flowed out of him.
He felt he was channeling it.
So four years later, he was at this party.
He met a woman with the same name as the woman in the book.
Her boyfriend had the same name as the boyfriend in the book.
She had an affair with the chief of police.
He had the same name as the chief in his book.
Everything she's saying is right out of his book.
That really freaks him out, but what can he do?
Shortly after that, he was mailing a letter...
...and he saw this kind of shady-Iooking guy standing by his car.
But instead of avoiding him, he said, "Can I help you?"
The guy said, "I ran out of gas."
He hands him some money, which he never would've done.
He gets home and thinks:
"This guy can't get to a gas station.
He's out of gas."
So he goes back, finds the guy and takes him to a gas station.
As he pulls up he thinks,
"This is in my book too.
This exact station. This exact guy.
Everything."
So this whole episode is kind of creepy, right?
He's telling his priest how he wrote this book...
...and four years later all these things happened.
And the priest says,
"That's the Book of Acts."
He's like, "I've never read it."
So he reads the Book of Acts, and it's uncanny.
Even the characters' names are the same as in the Bible.
The Book of Acts takes place in 50 A.D.
So Dick had this theory that time was an illusion...
...and that we were all in 50 A.D.
The reason he wrote this book was that he somehow...
...punctured through this veil of time.
He'd seen what was going on in the Book of Acts.
He was really into Gnosticism and the idea that this demon...
...created this illusion of time to make us forget...
...that Christ was to return and the kingdom of God would arrive.
Someone's trying to make us forget that God is imminent.
That's what time and history is.
This kind of continuous daydream or distraction.
I read it and thought, "That's weird."
And that night I had a dream.
There was this guy who was supposed to be psychic.
But I was, like,
"He's not really a psychic."
Then suddenly I start floating, levitating up to the ceiling.
As I almost go through the roof,
I'm like, "Okay, I believe you."
And I float down, and as my feet touch the ground...
...the psychic turns into a woman in a green dress, Lady Gregory.
Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron, this Irish person.
Though I'd never seen her image...
...I was sure that this was the face of Lady Gregory.
So Lady Gregory turns to me and says:
"Let me explain the nature of the universe.
Philip K. Dick is right about time, but wrong that it's 50 A.D.
Actually, there's only one instant, right now. And it's eternity.
It's an instant in which God is posing a question, which is:
'Do you wanna be one with eternity, do you wanna be in heaven? '
And we're all saying,
'No, thank you. Not just yet."'
So time is just this constant saying no to God's invitation.
That's what time is.
It's no more 50 A.D. Than it's 2001.
There's just one instant, and that's what we're always in.
Then she tells me that this is the narrative of everyone's life.
Behind the huge difference, there is but one story...
...of moving from the no to the yes.
All of life is,
"No, thank you. No, thank you."
Then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in.
Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace."
That's the journey.
Everyone gets to the yes in the end, right?
Right.
So we continue walking, and my dog runs over to me.
I'm so happy.
He's been dead for years.
So I'm petting him, and there's this gross stuff...
...coming out of his stomach.
I look over at Lady Gregory, and she coughs.
She's like, "Excuse me."
And vomit dribbles down her chin.
It smells really bad.
And I think,
"That's not just the smell of vomit.
That's the smell of dead-person vomit."
So it's, like, doubly foul.
I realize I'm in the land of the dead.
Everyone around me was dead.
My dog had been dead 10 years,
Lady Gregory a lot longer.
When I woke up, I was like,
"That wasn't a dream.
That was a visitation to this place, the land of the dead."
So how did you finally get out of it?
It was, like, one of those life-altering experiences.
I never looked at the world the same way again.
But how did you finally get out of the dream?
That's my problem. I'm trapped.
I keep thinking I'm waking up, but I'm still in a dream.
I wanna wake up for real.
How do you really wake up?
I don't know.
I'm not very good at that anymore.
But if that's what you're thinking, you should, if you can.
Because someday, you won't be able to.
But it's easy. You know, just wake up.
(young boy) Hey, Mowgli!
(girl) Hush. It's starting.
(man) Come, children. Come watch.
Mowgli, tell us your story.
I never knew where I came from.
But I always knew where I belonged.
This is me and Bagheera, the panther who found me in the jungle.
He's a good friend.
But my best friend of all was good ol' Papa Bear.
Man, we had some crazy times together.
And when the monkeys grabbed me, things got really crazy.
(Ranjan) Monkeys!
Bad monkeys! Bad!
Go, Papa Bear!
(Mowgli) Then I came face to face with the meanest, scariest tiger in the whole jungle,
Shere Khan.
(yells)
You stay away from Mowgli, you mean old tiger, or I'll tie some fire to your tail and burn your butt!
(yells)
(laughter)
(roars)
I got him, Mowgli. Did you see?
You sure did, Ranjan.
But it's gonna be hard to finish the story now.
But we all know how it ends.
Shanti blinks her big, beautiful brown eyes at you, and you follow her into our village.
- I did not.
- Did so!
- Something was in my eye.
- Both of them?
Well, you were so ugly, you made my eyes water.
Well, you...
Now, now, we give thanks for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes.
Without them, Mowgli would never have come into our lives.
Come to think of it, you used the same trick on me.
And you still fall for it.
Thank you for a wonderful story,
Mowgli.
- Goodnight, Mowgli.
- Night, Shanti.
Watch out for Shere Khan on your way home.
You and your stories.
Everyone knows tigers don't come into the village.
Tigers go wherever they want!
Goodnight, boys.
Tomorrow's gonna be so great.
Erm... nothing.
Uh-huh. Well, you'll need plenty of rest for doing nothing tomorrow.
Off to bed.
(yawns) We never get to stay up late.
Even wild beasts need their sleep.
- (roars)
- Help! Ferocious tiger!
Goodnight, my little wild thing.
Goodnight, Mowgli.
Happy dreams.
Erm...
Goodnight, sir.
Why do you always call him "sir"?
His name's Pop.
(snoring)
(roars)
Hmm!
(roars)
(yells)
Come on, Mowgli, wake up!
It's morning.
You said we'd go to...
Ranjan.
You want to wake the whole village?
When does the tiger roar?
I don't know.
After he catches his prey.
His prey.
Let's go get our prey.
(humming)
- Boys?
- Huh!
Where are you going so early?
To... do our chores?
Not without breakfast.
(singing)
- That's OK. We're not hungry.
- Got to go!
Boys! Where are you going?
- To do our chores!
- Bye, Pop! See you later.
Remember, don't cross the river.
You can take the boy out of the jungle.
But you can't take the jungle out of the boy.
Yes.
That's what worries me.
- Hey, Shanti!
- Ah!
What are you doing here?
Getting water.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm on the lookout... for danger.
Danger? Please.
There's no danger around here.
Well, keep this just between us.
Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks.
Tiger tracks? Right.
It's Shere Khan.
I hear he's looking for me.
Seeking his bloodthirsty revenge.
So keep your ears open, and always watch your back, or the last thing you'll ever hear is...
(roar)
(screams)
When does the tiger roar?
(both roar)
You're horrible!
Horrible, stinky boys.
Come on, Ranjan.
He's a bad influence.
Now, don't move.
That wasn't very nice, you know.
Stop that. You're not a jungle boy.
Why are you so scared of the jungle?
- Because it's dangerous.
- Dangerous? But Mowgli says...
You shouldn't listen to everything Mowgli says.
But I thought you liked Mowgli.
Well, I do. I like Mowgli.
But I have... oh.
Er, you left this at the river.
Thank you.
She's in a bad mood.
Hey, Ranjan.
You want to see a little trick
I learned in the jungle?
That's a pretty good trick.
Well, here's a little trick
I learned right here at home.
Wow.
That's a neater trick.
Like I said, Ranjan, don't listen to him.
She's right, Ranjan.
Don't listen to me.
Listen to the jungle.
Can you hear it?
Yeah.
The jungle.
Yeah, man.
And when you hear that rhythm, you get a crazy feeling inside.
That morning sun
peeks over the mountains
And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear
Hear what?
Hear the jungle rhythm
Those birds
are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks
The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear
To the jungle rhythm
Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat
start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder
It's moving me
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm
Come on, Shanti.
Can't do without rhythm
And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere
Join in the dance
You'll dance along with 'em
Feeling it steal your soul
- We'll stomp our paws
- Flap our wings
Maybe do one or two crazy things
- Khan khan.
- Yeah, that's it.
(monkey noises)
(howls)
(trumpets)
Shanti, try this.
Not quite.
There we go.
No.
Take a look. Perfect.
Check out those chattering
monkeys
Swinging through the banyan trees
Two by two
To the jungle rhythm
Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance
Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo
To the jungle rhythm
That's it!
Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat
start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder
It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free
- When I feel
- When I feel, when I feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Wait. Wait stop.
You're crossing the river.
Mowgli, you can't go in the jungle.
It's dangerous.
Mowgli! Stop!
Shanti, what is it?
Children, come inside this instant.
All of you.
Mowgli.
That includes you.
I am very disappointed in you.
You put everyone in danger.
You know you're not allowed to cross the river, yet you disobeyed me.
- But...
- No, Mowgli.
The jungle is a dangerous place.
I should know.
You are confined to your room without dinner.
That should give you time to think about what you've done.
Mowgli, I was only trying to...
Oh, you can hightail it
out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
Oh, Baloo.
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
and your strife
Oh, yeah! I mean the...
Do bah badda dadda de da dah
Rum pah patta reet ta dah
That bring
the bare necessities of life
Now, that's more like it!
Look at you.
Growing like the proverbial weed.
Let's see if you still got it.
Take it away, Little Britches.
Poor fellow.
I said, take it away!
Well, this ain't gonna work.
You just ain't Mowgli.
I guess I got to get used to singing solo.
He's just not getting over that...
(gasps)
Oh, no. Not again.
Baloo?
(growls)
Mowgli.
(bird squawks)
(bird squawks)
Get out of here. Shoo!
(bird squawks)
Now, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
Baloo?
Baloo?
Oh, man.
Bagheera. How's it wagging?
This has to stop.
You can't take Mowgli from the man village.
The boy's future lies with his own kind.
Aw, his future can wait.
I miss my bear cub.
It's not safe for him in the jungle.
Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli.
Let Shere Khan try something.
We handled him once, we will again.
- Baloo, don't push your luck.
- Out of the way, Baggy.
You're not going near the village.
Later, Baggy.
That's it! Hathi, plan B!
Hup, two, three, four.
Keep it up, two, three, four.
Remember, men, our objective is full and complete containment.
Prepare for Operation... Operation...
Er, "Stop That Bear"?
Very good, son.
Prepare for Operation Stop That Bear!
By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
Oh, we stamp and crush
Through the underbrush
Will you please stop?
Brigade, halt!
Huh?
I told you, Baloo, there's no way we're letting you near the man village.
You ain't gonna stop me now, Baggy!
Look out below!
- Search the water!
- This way.
Nothing here, sir.
Baloo.
I've got him, Colonel!
Confound it, soldier. That's a fish!
Whoopsie.
Disgrace to the uniform.
Colonel! This log can't possibly support your weight!
Balderdash!
Why, my dear boy, back in '88,
- in service to the Crown...
- Oh, no. Not again.
They don't make trees like they used to.
Got him!
Got him right here!
Disguised as a panther, Baloo?
It's me, Hathi. Put me down
Sorry.
Keep searching, men.
He couldn't have gone far.
- My toes are getting pruney!
- Who are we looking for again?
Confound it, man.
We're looking for the elusive...
Don't turn me in, little guy.
I just want to see my bear cub.
I won't. I miss Mowgli, too.
This way, quick!
Hey, thanks, kid. You're alright.
(growls)
Say, fellas, look who's coming.
That's Shere Khan.
- What'll we do?
- Don't start that again.
Lucky. Hey, Lucky.
Yeah?
That's the one we told you about.
Shere Khan.
Mmm!
Shere Khan. You don't say.
Hey, watch this. I got one for you.
Oi, look at me! Look at me!
I'm Shere Khan and my tiger tushie's been torched!
Ask me if I can whup that tiger.
Go on.
Can you whup that tiger?
I Shere Khan!
Do you get it? Save me! Save me!
I've been outwitted by 40 pounds of scrawny man cub! Help!
I'm cracking myself up here.
I don't know how I do it.
(growls)
(rustling)
(rattling)
(pot breaks)
Hi, kid. Mind if I drop in?
Baloo?
Oh, Baloo...
Shhh!
(muffled shouts)
Papa Bear! Am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Feeling right for the first time in a while, that's what.
Hey, kid. Show me you can still fight like a bear.
Oh, Little Britches, you lost your touch.
Mowgli, I've got something for you.
Mowgli, it's me.
I get grounded all the time.
Ah. (chuckles)
I'm sorry you got in trouble.
Come on, man cub. Show yourself.
- (Baloo) Come on!
- Whoa!
Mowgli?
Come on. Stick and move.
(screams)
Help! Wild animal!
Wild animal? Where?
Let's get out of here.
Help!
What's that bear doing here?
There's a wild animal in the village!
What's the matter?
There he is.
Where are you going? No!
Come back!
You're going the wrong way!
Whoa! A tiger!
(roars)
Don't let him get away.
- No!
- (Baloo) Get outta here!
- Shanti, get indoors.
- No, no. He's over... No!
Shanti!
Shanti, wait for me.
A tiger.
Come on, follow me!
- Whoa!
- Mowgli!
Hold on, Mowgli.
Mowgli!
(Father) Mowgli, where are you?
- Mowgli!
- They must be in the jungle.
Ah! (chuckles)
The jungle!
What a weird scene.
Is that place always like that?
You don't know the half of it.
That village was terrible.
All you hear is rules, rules, rules and work, work, work.
Kid, watch your language.
That's all they do! Washing, dressing, fetching, cleaning...
I'm tired just listening to it.
Sounds like they're screwy over there.
I don't want to talk about it.
Especially Shanti.
- Who's Shanti?
- Just a girl from the village.
Hold on. Not the one that lured you into that village in the first place?
Yup. That's the one.
I knew it! I knew she was trouble!
I tried bringing her to the jungle and she got me in trouble.
Say again?
I wanted her to see what fun we have.
And she got you into trouble?
- Yep!
- Ooh, man.
She thinks the jungle is scary.
- Where'd she get that crazy idea?
- You got me.
Do my snake eyes deceive me?
It's the succulent man cub.
You're with me now, kid.
Forget that girl.
You're better off without her.
You got everything you need here.
And me?
I got my old singing partner back.
Then hit it, Papa Bear!
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That bring
the bare necessities of life
- Wherever I wander
- Where you going?
- Wherever I roam
- Oh, yeah.
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home
The bees are buzzing in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under
The rocks and plants
Take a glance at the fancy ants
And maybe try a few
Thanks, Baloo.
The bare necessities of life
will come to you
They'll come to you
Oh, Baloo!
I don't want ever to see that girl or that village again.
Well, of course you don't.
It's just us bears from here on in.
Yeah, man.
Hey. You remember everything
I learned you?
You bet I do, Papa Bear.
- Nah-uh!
- Huh?
When you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you pick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware
Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use a claw
But you don't need to use a claw
When you pick a pair
of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue?
The bare necessities of life
will come to you
- They'll come to you
- To me?
I so despise these song-and-dance routines.
Mowgli?
Mowgli? Is that you?
Mowgli?
(hoots)
He's gotta be here somewhere.
(rip)
(squawks)
(screeching)
I swear...
...I shall never again associate... with man cubs.
(pants)
Where could he be?
(sniffs)
Why, the little...
...snack.
Who is it?
Who's there? (gasps)
Excuse me.
Might I be of some assistance?
Are you lost, little one?
Are you hungry?
I'm starved.
Bad snake! Bad, bad snake!
Ranjan? What are you doing here?
You leave Shanti alone!
OK, Ranjan, I think he's had enough.
(roars)
You're not getting away that easy.
Ranjan, you're not supposed to be here.
We have to get you home.
No! Mowgli's in trouble and we're gonna find him.
I can smell him.
He's this way!
Oh, OK.
But stay close.
We don't want to run into any more scary animals.
- (roars)
- Oh, stop that!
Oh, mercy.
(chuckling)
Shere Khan?
Anyone I know?
I wish.
Stupid man cub.
Man cub?
Did I say man cub?
Well, you know...
...l'd love to stay and shoot the breeze and all, but...
What's your hurry?
No reason. I, I...
Where is he?
- Who he?
- The man cub, Mowgli.
I know you know.
But I, I don't.
Please don't insult my intelligence.
It makes me irritable.
Oh. He's not in the village.
I know where he isn't.
Now tell me where he is.
Well, he's, he's...
The swamp!
He's at the swamp.
- The swamp, eh?
- Yes.
Trust in me.
He'd better be... for your sake.
He is. He is.
I'd take you there myself, but I'm afraid I'd slow you down.
Indigestion and all.
(Father) Mowgli!
(Mother) Ranjan!
What is it? What on earth?
Retreat!
- Colonel Hathi.
- Take cover!
Oh, no. Not again.
(parp)
Excuse me.
Pardon.
Colonel Hathi, what is the meaning of this?
Man is in the jungle.
What does he want?
Mowgli!
Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy.
Don't worry. We'll find them.
Mowgli!
Ranjan!
Baloo.
Uh! Almost got it, Baloo.
Whoa!
Them primo mangoes, always the hardest to get.
Got 'em.
This is the life.
Heads up.
Delicious.
Hey, check this out.
Hey. Not bad.
Where'd you learn that?
- Shanti showed me.
- Shanti?
No. I, I said wanti.
I wanti another mango.
No, that's not what you said.
You said Shanti.
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Did.
- Didn't.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-uh.
- I heard it.
- Who cares about Shanti?
It's just a stupid trick, right?
Yeah, right.
You don't need her, kid.
You're with old Baloo now.
What are you laughing at?
What're you doing here, Baggy?
Haven't you heard?
Man is in the jungle.
What do they want?
They're searching for Mowgli.
Mowgli?
Perhaps maybe you have seen the boy.
Me? Uh, no.
Well, you know his future is in that village.
Yes.
I just wish I knew where he was.
Yeah. Sorry.
I wish I could help you out, Baggy.
Enough games, Baloo!
Give me the boy.
Baggy, Baggy, Baggy.
I can explain.
I can explain. I...
I can explain, but I don't have to.
As you can plainly see,
Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone.
I know he's around here somewhere.
And he can't hide forever.
Well, he won't get past you, Baggy.
Kid?
Kid, where'd you go?
You trying to scare the tick out of my ticker?
Wow.
The whole village, looking for me?
- We can't let nobody see you.
- I thought they were mad.
We got to lay low.
They must really miss me.
I wonder if Shanti's with them.
Shanti?
You definitely don't want her to find you.
Do you?
No. We can't let anyone find us, especially that girl.
Come on, Baloo, we gotta get moving. Lay low. Hunker down.
Hibernate, like.
Now, Mowgli, what if that girl tracks us down?
What are you going to do?
Then you'll have to scare her.
Scare her?
Has the milk run out of your coconut?
No, she's terrified of wild animals.
In case you haven't noticed, kid,
I'm no wild animal.
Except at parties.
I suppose I'm more of a honey bear.
You can do it, Baloo.
You taught me, remember?
You scrunch up your eyes like this.
And show your teeth like this.
And roar like this. (roars)
Roar?
No, no. Like you mean it!
Do you want that girl to take me back to the village?
(roars)
Yeah, man. That was great.
Well, I don't know.
Trust me, that'll do it.
In that case, Mowgli, consider that girl scarified.
- Thanks, Papa Bear.
- Anything for my Little Britches.
OK, let's skedaddle.
Now don't worry.
I got a place downriver.
- It's the perfect hideout.
- Real quiet, huh?
Quiet?
You want quiet, go back to the man village. This place is happening.
OK, here's the village.
- We cross the river and...
- (Ranjan roars)
Ranjan, be careful!
OK, we went right.
No, no, no, left. Left, I mean.
Right. No, left, then right.
Oh!
This jungle all looks the same!
- (laughs)
- Ranjan, what's that?
Mowgli? He must have been here!
Or some animal with really sharp claws.
That snake lied to me.
Now, don't take it out on the water just because you don't like the reflection.
I mean, not everyone can be born with such great looks.
You let that tiger get his claws on you and you won't be so good-looking.
What? That pussycat?
He's harmless. Watch this.
Oh, no.
What's the matter, Stripes?
Man cub got your tongue?
Lucky, let's find something to do somewhere else.
No, no. Hang on, fellas.
I got another one.
How many men does it take to whup a tiger?
Surprise me.
None. A little kid can do it all by himself.
(growls)
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
- Come on.
In fact, we heard that kid is right here in the jungle.
Right under your whiskers.
Interesting.
I heard he's headed back to the village.
Wrong again, kitty.
No, Lucky, keep your gob shut.
They say he's headed downriver, with a bear.
Downriver, you say?
Don't listen to him.
Yeah. He's new around here.
He don't know anything
On the contrary, he seems to know quite a lot.
Hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire?
Isn't it ironic that your name is Lucky?
(all scream)
Come on, lads, this way!
This is the perfect hideout?
This is King Louie's place.
Was, kid, was. He's splitsville.
Me and the monkeys turned it into the greatest secret hideout ever.
Coming through. Hey, Baloo.
Good to see you back again, man.
- Everybody knows about it.
- Then how can it be a secret?
I mean, everybody who's anybody.
Nobody who's nobody don't know nothing about no place that everybody who's anybody knows about. You dig?
My head hurts.
Turn the thinker off a minute and just dive in.
Step aside, and I'll show you what a real rug-cutter can do.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the boss of bop, the jack of jive, the jungle cat who's really gonna keep it alive.
Get ready to stir it up and serve it up.
I'm talking about
Baloo is in the house!
Hey, cats, alright!
When we start to move
Hey, honey, it ain't no joke
We got a savage groove
We didn't learn from human folk
No human folk
Excuse our incivility
We're W-l-l-l-L-D
When the music plays
All the people stomp their feet
But a stomping paw
Can lay down a better beat
Tell me we ain't naturally
W- l-l-l-L-D
It's a snap
To bring out the beast in you
You're free like the bird it's true
Or a frog or a hog or...
Oh, man, whatever!
From the baddest cat
To the sweetest little deer
Tonight's the night
We're gonna get our tails in gear
Show me your ferocity
Go W-l-l-l-L-D
We snort, we squeak
Up high or deep underground
We snarl, we shriek
We fly round and round and round
Ah, go, you sweet thing.
That's inhuman, baby.
The old mongoose
Gets good and loose
The ocelot gives it all he's got
The parakeet
Goes, "Twiddlee-deet"
The red macaque
Shouts "Hang on, Jack!"
- The tiny worm
- The pachyderm
- The spotted cat
- The water rat
- The great cuckoo
- The bear Baloo
Are W-l-l-l-L-D
Here's the thing!
If we're broke, we never squawk
We don't need to check no clock
To know what time it is
It's time to rock
When you dance like that
Hey, honey, it sure is hip
I can't stand it!
I want to tip my hat
But I got no hat to tip
I don't need no hat.
Ask me why and I won't lie
I'm W-l-l-l-L-D
We grunt, we growl
Up high or deep underground
We hoot, we howl
We fly round and round and round
My oh me, it's plain to see
We're W-l-l-l-L-D
He, she, me, uniquely
W- l-l-l-L-D
Every beastie running free
W- l-l-I-I-I
L- D!
Whoo-hoo. That's my boy.
They don't swing like that in your man village, do they kid?
Well, no.
Big fat no.
Say, what that village like, anyway?
Whoa, don't bother the kid.
He told me all about that scene.
Let me lay it out for you.
Those people are crazy.
Everybody works and nobody plays.
Oh, man!
They got nothing but rules, rules, rules.
And there's even this girl who thinks the jungle is a scary place.
But, you know, it doesn't matter, cos Mowgli will never see that village or that crazy girl again.
Ain't that so, kid?
Mowgli? Mowgli?
Mowgli?
Mowgli?
That morning sun
Peeks over the mountains
And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear
Hear the jungle rhythm
Did we find Mowgli yet?
Are you tired?
A little.
I'm sure we'll find him soon.
Come on. Hop up.
You OK up there?
(yawns "Uh-huh")
How could it be
Half as good as being free?
Part of me
Like the jungle rhythm
Like the jungle rhythm
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
It sounded like Mowgli.
- Mowgli!
- Ranjan, wait!
Mowgli!
Shanti? Whoa!
Are you OK?
Oh, I feel "vine".
What are you doing up there?
Hold on. I'll be right...
- I can't believe I found you.
- I thought I'd never see you again.
You out here, kid?
Hey, Little Britches!
Mowgli?
You're not really helping.
- Ranjan, stop pulling.
- It's her.
That wild bear that carried you off.
- What wild...
- (Baloo roars)
(roars)
Baloo, don't! No!
Roar.
My poor sneezer. That hurt.
You come anywhere near Ranjan and I'll really show you hurt.
- Wait!
- Don't make me do it.
Wait. Calm down. It's OK.
But he's attacking us.
Attacking? I'm the one socked in the schnozzle.
That's because you scared her.
But, you told me to scarify her.
- What?
- No.
Wait a minute.
Mowgli, you planned this?
Well, I...
- Come on, Ranjan.
- Shanti, I can explain!
Don't even bother.
Shanti, wait!
Man, you weren't kidding about her.
She's bad news.
No, she's not. She was helping and you scared her.
Man alive!
First, you tell me to scare her, then, you tell me not to.
Kid, I only got so much room in this noggin, and it's filling up fast.
You just don't understand.
Alright, how's about laying it out for me?
Read you loud and clear, kid.
You wanted that girl to find you.
Oh!
Shanti! Shanti!
Where are you?
Come on!
There you are.
I'm so sorry.
Will you let me explain?
Come on, at least talk to me.
(growls)
You seem surprised to see me, man cub.
I can't imagine why.
I wasn't going to let you get away with what you did to me.
You see, you humiliated me, man cub.
Surely you do realise
I simply can't let you live.
Run.
Oh, you're going to try and outrun me.
How droll.
Come on. This way!
(growls)
Alright. Stay here.
Mowgli, no!
Wait here.
I have to help Mowgli.
But I want to help Mowgli, too!
No, I'll be right back, I promise.
Don't move.
(gasps)
Whoa. Hold still. Calm down, kid.
Where's Mowgli?
Shere Khan.
Shere Khan?
Hold on!
Whoa!
Whoa!
(roaring)
(roars)
(chuckles)
No matter how fast you run, no matter where you hide,
I will catch you.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Hurry! Hurry!
Faster! Faster!
Not another man cub.
Can't you go any faster?
Baloo!
What is the meaning of this?
- Mowgli's in trouble!
- Shanti, too!
Who's Shanti?
(gasps)
(thunder)
Take the kid! I'll help Mowgli.
Baloo!
Be careful.
Hmm? Mowgli?
Mowgli, is that you?
(stones rattle)
Mowgli?
Uh!
- You! Stay away from me!
- You! Why are you here?
- One of my den has a problem.
- I spent a night in the jungle.
I was attacked by a snake.
But I don't care.
- I'm here to help Mowgli!
- I'm here to help Mowgli!
- You what?
- You are?
I guess we're on the same side.
I guess so.
- OK.
- OK.
You go that way. I'll cover you.
(thunder)
(gong sounds)
(gong sounds)
(gong sounds)
(gong)
(gong)
(gongs)
(roars)
(crash)
Oh, no.
Well, isn't this a delightful turn of events?
(chuckles)
So, what's it going to be, man cub?
You or your adorable little girlfriend?
I'm waiting.
One.
- Two.
- No, don't!
Thr...
(chuckles)
No more games, man cub.
- Mowgli!
- Come on!
Mowgli, look out!
- Oh, no!
- We can do it. Jump!!
(roars)
Come on!
Mowgli.
(screams)
(roars)
(roars)
Hello, Stripes. You're looking a bit down in the mouth today.
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
I always said you had a good head on your shoulders Khanny, me boy.
This is fantastic, playing to a captive audience. I just love it.
- Bagheera.
- Mowgli.
It's awfully good to see you, man cub.
Come on, follow me!
Bagheera, this is Shanti, my best friend from the village.
(distant) Ranjan!
Shanti!
There they are!
- Papa! Who-hoo!
- Come on, Mowgli!
(distant) Mowgli!
Mowgli, I have to go.
(distant) Shanti.
Well? Come on, Mowgli.
Er...
Come on, Ranjan.
Oh, Baloo.
It's OK, kid.
That girl isn't so bad after all, is she?
Go on, Mowgli.
Really?
Really. Don't let her get away.
Come with me.
Now you know I can't do that.
I'm gonna miss you, Papa Bear.
Me, too, Little Britches. Me, too.
(sighs)
Alright. There, come on, now.
You'd better hurry up.
(sighs)
(distant) Hey, wait!
Mowgli!
What took you so long?
- Race you back!
- Come on, Ranjan.
Wait! Wait!
- Shanti!
- We've found the children.
- Ranjan!
- Mummy!
You gave us quite a scare.
Shanti, I was so worried about you.
I'm OK. I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help Mowgli.
I'm sorry, sir. It's just that...
No, Mowgli. I'm sorry.
I should have understood that the jungle is a part of who you are.
I'm just glad you're safe.
- Ranjan.
- You won't believe it.
There was a big old snake and I beat him up.
Of course you did.
I'm proud of you, Baloo.
That was very brave...
Now, Baggy.
Don't get any ideas about running after him and trying to talk him into staying with us.
He belongs in that village, and you know it.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
He's got his whole future there.
I'm sorry, Baloo.
You're absolutely right.
I'm really gonna miss that kid.
Me, too.
Wait a minute.
I'm having myself an idea.
Baloo?
Come on, Mowgli. We'll be late.
OK. I'm right behind you.
Just getting some water.
- Alright. Be careful, son.
- I will. See you, Pop.
Let's see if he remembers to actually bring back some water this time.
Hey, Shanti, let's remember to actually bring back water this time.
(laughs)
Yeah, man!
Man, that beat is chillin' me.
- Hi, Papa Bear.
- Hey there, Little Britches.
Shanti!
Ranjan?
Ow!
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
and your strife
Yeah, man.
I mean, the bare necessities
That's why us bears
can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities
of life
Oh, yeah.
With just
the bare necessities of life
One more time!
With just the bare necessities
of life
Yeah, man!
Can you hear it?
Yeah, man.
Now, I'm the king of the swingers
The jungle VIP
I reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's bothering me
I want to be a man, man cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeying around
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human, too
Whoo, baby!
Yeah, take it away!
Crazy man, crazy.
Let's go.
Here we go.
Come on.
Bop te roonee!
- Check this out.
- This place is happening!
Can you hear it?
Oh yeah.
Step, step, step, step aside.
And I'll show you what a real rug cutter can do.
Anything for my Little Britches.
Hit it, Papa Bear.
Yeah, you
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
Someone like me
Can learn to be someone like me
Can learn to be someone like you
Can learn to be someone like me
Yeah, man.
Hey, not bad.
Sometimes when night has come
The river sings a song
In my dreams it seems to leave me
Right where I belong
Wandering everywhere
Each way I turn is wrong
How I'm wishing I could be there
Right where I belong
Smiles that have warmed me
Arms that have held me
Are all a part of who I am.
It's never easy
leaving your friends behind
Missing them, loving them
Someplace was meant for me
And that's what keeps me strong
Somehow knowing I'll be going
Right where I belong
Right where I
Home where I belong
Check out those
chattering monkeys
Swinging
through the banyan trees
Two by two
To the jungle rhythm
Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance
Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo
To the jungle rhythm
Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat
start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder
It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free
- When I feel
- When I feel, when I feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm

{11599}{11640}It's a cramp!
{11867}{11910}Officer down.
{11927}{12022}These stairs are killing me, honey.|We may have to move.
{12031}{12096}But, Dad, there's only four steps.
{12121}{12181}All right, if you love it here...
{12194}{12232}... I'll build a ramp.
{12472}{12591}It's been three hours since lunch|and we' re still cleaning up this egg.
{12596}{12677}Man, would you look at all that gunk.
{12682}{12706}Seriously.
{12711}{12804}Does he roll his food|on the ground before he eats it?
{12815}{12941}We need to send a letter to the mayor|about washing our hands before we eat.
{13064}{13121}Like he's going to listen to us.
{13130}{13194}Hey, cells vote, man.
{13201}{13236}Cells vote.
{13564}{13601}Got you, you little....

{15207}{15232}I don't like!
{15585}{15641}I'll turn up the heat in here.
{16054}{16112}Connecting, please hold.|One moment.
{16119}{16143}Now connecting.
{16148}{16250}Mr. Mayor, how will you deal|with the fat-cell housing shortage?
{16259}{16369}I'd like to announce we' re beginning|construction on a third chin.
{16374}{16420}We' re having jock itch!
{16424}{16458}Any comments on today's cramp?
{16463}{16549}What about the hair cells|laid off from the scalp?
{16554}{16623}There'll be plenty of new jobs|on the back.
{16631}{16715}What about the request|for better nutrition?
{16721}{16815}85% of red blood cell children|don't know how to carry oxygen.
{16820}{16884}People, people you worry too much.
{16889}{16949}The body is in perfect shape.
{17041}{17091}No more questions. Thank you.
{17184}{17226}Do they know I work hard?
{17231}{17258}Nobody cares.
{17263}{17326}-Mr. Mayor--|-Leah, I've got a body to run.
{17331}{17426}-I've got Tom Colonic's new ad.|-Let's go, put it on.
{17484}{17540}{Y:i}This is a paid announcement.
{17598}{17666}{Y:i}The bowels didn 't always|smell this way.
{17671}{17732}{Y:i}Eating right and exercise...
{17737}{17804}{Y:i}...kept this area|a center of activity.
{17808}{17891}{Y:i}But during Phlemming 's term,|rot and stagnation...
{17896}{17939}{Y:i}...paralyzed this neighborhood...
{17944}{18009}{Y:i}... the colon, and the sphincter.
{18014}{18084}{Y:i}It's time we get things moving again.
{18088}{18171}{Y:i}I'm Tom Colonic.|As mayor, I'd set long-term goals...
{18176}{18247}{Y:i}... that include salads|and eating bran.
{18252}{18359}{Y:i}Mayor Phlemming may think|things are fine the way they are.
{18367}{18476}{Y:i}But if we pull together|and put in a little hard work...
{18481}{18585}{Y:i}...a new Frank could be|right around the corner.
{18595}{18652}{Y:i}Mr. Colonic? What's that smell?
{18678}{18744}{Y:i}That's the smell of change, Billy.
{18778}{18818}{Y:i}The smell of change.
{18856}{18879}{Y:i}Paid by Colonic for Mayor.
{18884}{18943}Can you believe those lies?
{18948}{19059}He's got a point. You promised|to focus on health issues.
{19064}{19091}I want health...
{19096}{19199}... but think of the sacrifices,|the hard work and lack of chips.
{19206}{19255}That's not what voters want.
{19260}{19342}-Why are you behind in the polls?|-Don't you worry.
{19347}{19428}I have a plan to flush Colonic|down the toilet.
{19455}{19488}Honey.
{19536}{19573}Shane.
{19616}{19649}Coming!
{19682}{19741}You okay? Where does it hurt?
{19769}{19793}Leg.
{19803}{19834}Is it here?
{19840}{19871}A leg.
{19888}{19923}Here?
{19928}{19977}Leg.
{20088}{20115}Here.

{20580}{20610}Oh, now what?
{20648}{20715}Sir, turn on the optical feed.
{20769}{20819}{Y:i}Let me take a look, Dad.
{20851}{20875}{Y:i}Open wide.
{20892}{20931}Open wide.
{20968}{21041}Could you swallow first, please?
{21220}{21259}Definitely red.
{21346}{21390}Are you ordering out?
{21398}{21465}I' m making an appointment|with the doctor.
{21470}{21571}Sick? We' re not getting sick!|We have far too much planned.
{21743}{21838}You can't override without|a vote from city council.
{21859}{21898}Yes, my dear.
{21910}{21974}Voice manual control on.
{22003}{22108}-That's only for emergencies.|-Leah, this is an emergency.
{22113}{22150}On second thought...
{22155}{22197}On second thought...

{23176}{23298}Yeah, I never heard that one before.|Take him to lockdown. Next.
{23349}{23386}Hey, it's"the Germinator!"
{23432}{23511}You got me there.|Save some for the criminals.
{23516}{23618}-You never catch anything, Jones.|-You should've seen this thing.
{23623}{23671}It's no ordinary germ.
{23675}{23746}This thing ain't even|from Frank's body.
{23751}{23829}This is like a AI Roker germ,|a Heavy D germ.
{23837}{23889}Talking about this?
{23958}{24043}Yeah, he's slouching right now.
{24048}{24079}In my office!
{24127}{24203}-Chiefy-weefy, what's up?|-Don't"chiefy-weefy"me.

{24363}{24452}-Hold on a second.|-I told you to wait for backup!
{24457}{24531}But again, you had to|do it your own way.
{24536}{24581}-Man, I could have--|-Right!
{24586}{24648}Trillions of cells|working together...
{24653}{24714}...you' re the only one doing it alone.

{24776}{24873}What?! Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.|The missus? She's great, yes.
{24879}{24935}What? I'll put a man right on it.

{25185}{25301}You know what? You' re right.|Maybe it is time I give you a case.
{25311}{25343}Talking about what?
{25348}{25408}I' m putting you on a job|in the throat.

{28934}{29021}Who cut off the heat?|Somebody pay the bill! It's cold.
{29026}{29146}{Y:i}Now arriving with some milk, a cold|pill with a pleasant fruity flavor.
{29213}{29277}Wow, this is huge.
{29282}{29362}Don't be all impressed.|It's 99% sugar.
{29367}{29432}Yeah? And 99% of you is just stupid.

{30538}{30623}-You said"Drips"with a"p."|-Whatever.
{30647}{30758}This ain't working. I'll ask|the chief to assign someone else.
{30763}{30787}Wait.
{30796}{30853}Hold up. I need this job, Leah.
{30858}{30908}Just give me a shot.

{32215}{32333}I grew up on the wrong side of the|digestive tract. No fancy schools.
{32357}{32412}My high school was crack central.
{32433}{32536}No, it was in the crack!|Right in the stanky puckered center!
{32594}{32678}We lived on peanut butter|and cellulite sandwiches.
{32683}{32742}Ever blow-dry your hair with a fart?
{32747}{32801}{Y:i}-Okay, you were poor.|- You bet!
{32806}{32885}Ever make a snowman from paper|cling-ons? That's poor!
{32890}{32930}You'll make me vomit.

{34178}{34224}It's a routine sore throat.
{34229}{34311}Looks like a saliva boat|went haywire and crashed.
{34316}{34376}Saliva boat? That's pretty unusual.
{34381}{34440}IKnock down that hot spot, ladder team!
{34487}{34511}Step away.

{36929}{36993}Excuse me! What are you doing?
{36998}{37046}I' m soothing the irritation.
{37054}{37133}You just soothed my witness|into a germ-cicle.
{37181}{37247}Don't worry, he'll be normal|in a few days.
{37252}{37286}That's too late.
{37291}{37358}He has information on what went down.
{37363}{37440}Nothing"went down."|It's a common sore throat.
{37445}{37498}This is a crime scene.
{37610}{37701}Want to be useful? Plug some|Turtle Wax into that thing...

{37792}{37859}Now that's inflammation relief.
{37864}{37900}Later, Doug.

{38782}{38856}I' m not getting out of my bathrobe.
{38863}{38982}I'll get a keg and plop myself down|on the sofa in front of the TV.
{38987}{39053}Some quality time|with the wife and kids.
{39124}{39162}What's that smell?
{39171}{39259}That's Bruno. His tummy's still upset.
{39270}{39383}No, I' m talking about that|nasty, skanky, sweaty smell.
{39393}{39464}Shane won't buy me deodorant anymore.
{39469}{39523}She says it causes cancer.
{39836}{39894}Did the foot fungus pay up yet?
{39899}{39962}No, that guy's getting flaky on us.
{39967}{40079}You ain't going to collect|nothing from him up here in the pit.
{40084}{40174}Now get down there,|send him a message.
{40287}{40415}So, this is where the scum of Frank|comes to fester.
{40419}{40542}Hey, you lost, pal? This is|a private sweat gland. Now beat it!
{40547}{40657}I' m looking for volunteers. Some|germs who want in on a big score.
{40687}{40808}Yo, Red, we run the rackets here.|Take your hustle someplace else.
{40813}{40864}This ain't about no hustle.
{40869}{40940}This is about the baddest illness|you've ever seen.
{40945}{41018}Look who thinks he's|the Ebola virus, huh?
{41075}{41123}Ebola?
{41136}{41202}Let me tell you something|about Ebola, baby.
{41207}{41310}Ebola is a case of dandruff|compared to me!
{41315}{41380}All right, pal. You' re out of here.
{41385}{41481}Bruiser, take him to the face|and bury him in a blackhead.
{41486}{41594}It'll take a Swedish facialist|and six steaming washcloths...
{41599}{41633}...to get you out!
{41638}{41709}Sounds like a gas, baby. Bring it on.
{41863}{41930}Bruiser! What are you? A sissy Mary?
{41939}{41968}What are you doing?
{41973}{42020}{Y:i}Che fa? What's he doing?
{42251}{42345}You ain't so tough, huh?|That was nothing.
{42383}{42415}So, uh...
{42420}{42489}...what kind of sickness|do you have in mind...
{42495}{42571}-... boss?|-Deadly.
{42663}{42701}Hey, Dad.|Hey, Uncle Bob.
{42720}{42754}Hello, beautiful.
{42759}{42824}I stopped by the camping store...
{42829}{42896}...and I got some stuff for the hike.
{42918}{43046}Right. On this hike, is that|teacher of yours going to be there?
{43082}{43137}Yeah, my whole class is.|Why?
{43151}{43224}I was thinking I might|take a rain check.
{43249}{43314}Mrs. Boyd isn't still mad at you.
{43322}{43411}I didn't think so.|We could do something better.
{43444}{43549}Yesterday, without thinking,|I did all my hiking for the week.
{43554}{43642}I hiked to the liquor store,|the cigarette warehouse....
{43647}{43727}-But, Dad, you said--|-I said I'd think about it.
{43732}{43822}It's a holiday weekend.|It's important to be together.
{43894}{43958}Yeah, I guess you' re right.
{43962}{44071}Well, I have something special|up my sleeve.
{44133}{44233}Have you ever seen a rattlesnake|swallow a football?
{44238}{44276}I don't think she has.
{44281}{44316}It's fun. Come on.
{44321}{44424}-Come on. I'll show you.|-Thank you, Uncle Bob.
{44448}{44502}You' re gonna love it!
{44614}{44660}{Y:i}Why are we wasting time here?
{44665}{44737}I am on a 12-hour|time release program.
{44742}{44827}-Throat, nose, then aches and pains.|-I got it.
{44832}{44901}Real important stuff.|Wait in the car.
{44906}{44963}I got police work to do.
{44968}{45047}One glazed and one|with a jelly-filled nucleus.
{45098}{45151}{Y:i}Brain memory library.
{45156}{45230}You got any information|on something called...
{45235}{45292}{y:i}-..."EI Morry Roho"?|-Stand by.
{45297}{45398}I'll check, but we' re really|all about sports statistics here.
{45472}{45505}{y:i}-Sir?|-I' m here.
{45510}{45583}-What you got?|{y:i}-"La Muerte Roja"is Spanish.
{45588}{45659}{y:i}-It means"The Red Death."|-The Red Death?
{45664}{45748}-Is that some taco sauce?|{y:i}- You have a nice day.
{45904}{45945}Yo, Drips!
{45987}{46045}You ever hear of The Red Death?
{46903}{46966}Look alive, boys.|Dust at nine o'clock.
{47072}{47118}Eat hot nose juice, dust.
{47477}{47535}-We' re here. You happy?|-Hear that?
{47541}{47593}Quick! The dam is under attack!
{47598}{47641}Hey, chill, pill!
{47646}{47713}Snot guns are booger-coating|some dust.
{48087}{48162}Now, get to work!
{48169}{48262}This is your big plan?|A sore throat? A stuffy nose?
{48267}{48344}-People will think you' re--|-A common cold.
{48349}{48449}Until I make my move,|that's precisely what I want.
{48454}{48517}Yo, check it out. We got cops here!
{48522}{48550}Hey, look.
{48572}{48689}Be careful! That's a pollen pod.|Frank is allergic to this stuff.
{48694}{48773}-I didn't know he had allergies.|-Of course not.
{48811}{48890}Pills know nothing|about what goes on in here.
{48949}{49038}In the words of the immortal|James Brown, get down!
{49043}{49068}James who?
{49425}{49481}-Hey, Frank.|-Danny.
{49536}{49572}Nitwit!
{49577}{49625}You could've damaged the dam!
{49630}{49731}Relax, this baby was built to last.|Solid cartilage.
{49736}{49835}You' re an engineer now.|I need to test the mucous viscosity.
{49901}{49961}Frank! Why are you leaving so early?
{49966}{50086}It's all shoveled. Hippo's asleep.|I' m taking Shane to Docky's.
{50091}{50176}-Did you think of something?|-Yeah, I did great.
{50217}{50312}I guarantee you there ain't|nothing wrong with this dam.
{50326}{50403}So you want me to take care of them?
{50408}{50520}No. Hit all the pressure valves.|They' re about to blow the scene.
{50694}{50784}What in the name of sweet|bleeding Frank?!
{50789}{50862}The membrane is cracking, you--
{51502}{51579}-You missed a spot!|-Come on, fellas. Go!
{51584}{51639}-Let's get out of here!|-Stop!
{51644}{51672}Immunity!
{51677}{51708}What the Frank?
{51820}{51857}Wait a minute!
{52415}{52460}Nose hairs!
{52571}{52603}Watch out!
{52685}{52717}Look out!
{52846}{52891}We' re going to die!
{52968}{53041}I' m standing here.|Can you use a tissue?
{53046}{53119}-I don't have one.|-Use your imagination.
{53124}{53160}What's that there?
{53304}{53328}-Better?|-Much better.
{53328}{53338}-Better?|-Much better.
{53343}{53440}I gotta go get her. She'll be|excited and probably call you.
{53497}{53580}If not for you, none of this|would have ever happened.
{53584}{53627}If you'll excuse me, I...
{53632}{53683}... have a nose to dry.
{53771}{53852}{Y:i}This is Nerve Network News. NNN.
{53944}{54050}In an act of selfless bravery,|a cold tablet stopped a runny nose.
{54055}{54148}{Y:i}The heroic tablet will be|honored this afternoon.
{54153}{54183}Trudy?
{54188}{54292}In lighter news, there was pandemonium|in the stomach today...
{54296}{54340}{Y:i}...as animal crackers arrived.
{54344}{54400}They are adorable, aren't they?
{54407}{54526}Now, we go live to Cerebellum Hall for|an address from Mayor Phlegmming.
{54531}{54566}Okay, Mayor.
{54571}{54646}In five, four, three....
{54664}{54760}Good evening, citizens of Frank.|In the past few weeks...
{54765}{54875}... my opponent has used fancy words|to try to confuse the issues.
{54880}{54991}Words like"exercise,"|"Iow-fat,"and"diet."
{54996}{55124}{Y:i}Words designed to scare us into|changing what has worked for years.
{55131}{55228}Well, I say let's stay the course.
{55233}{55314}{Y:i}Remember, a fat Frank|is a happy Frank.
{55319}{55363}That's not what I wrote.
{55368}{55471}I propose something that every|organism in this city will enjoy.
{55476}{55513}I give you...
{55518}{55624}...a dream vacation to|the annual chicken wing festival...
{55628}{55673}...in Buffalo, New York.
{55758}{55886}Final plans have been made and nothing|is going to stand in our way.
{55911}{55943}And we' re out.
{55977}{56095}-That wasn't the speech we agreed on.|-Where's the twerp in the wheelchair?
{56100}{56147}Hello, Johnny. How you doing?
{56159}{56266}Congratulations. Excellent work|in the nose. Let's get some pictures.
{56284}{56377}The caption should read,|"Mayor and Pill Stop Cold... Cold."
{56382}{56497}Mr. Mayor? Excuse me, sir,|but we have a problem.
{56508}{56535}Now what, Jones?
{56540}{56628}Whatever was in the sinuses|is a lot more than a cold.
{56633}{56736}Don't listen to Jones. His diagnostic|skills are remedial at best!
{56741}{56811}You iced a key witness|to a viral attack!
{56816}{56846}It was an accident!
{56851}{56921}The kind a time-release dipstick|would have.
{56926}{57015}I am sick of you!|That's it, I can't work with him!
{57020}{57068}I can't work with you!
{57073}{57107}Officers, please.
{57112}{57230}-Jones, what's this virus?|-The virus that torched the throat.
{57235}{57303}It caused those snot crests|I was surfing!
{57307}{57396}They were caused by the sneeze,|which you caused.
{57401}{57485}Then why was that|viral-looking mother fleeing?
{57503}{57563}We should put the city on full alert.
{57568}{57666}-Liquids, bed rest. Just to be safe.|-We'll do no such thing.
{57671}{57801}I won't listen to the white blood cell|with the worst record in Frank.
{57806}{57878}Keep those opinions|in that mushy head...
{57887}{57990}...or you'll find yourself|in our next nosebleed. Understood?
{58023}{58074}Son, I apologize for all this.
{58079}{58158}Now, why don't we find you|another...
{58163}{58194}... more capable officer to work with.
{58283}{58355}Sir, if it's all the same to you...
{58343}{58398}... I think I'll stay with Jones.
{58525}{58561}Suit yourself.
{58659}{58752}You didn't have to do that.|I don't need your sympathy.
{58756}{58793}It's not sympathy.
{58798}{58894}I' m here to make Frank feel better.|If this alleged virus...
{58899}{58959}...impedes my mission,|I must pursue it.
{58964}{59018}{Y:i}Yeah, whatever.
{59058}{59131}What did the mayor mean by"record"?
{59164}{59226}You did something terrible,|didn't you?
{59245}{59323}Sometimes being too careful|is all it takes.
{59328}{59352}How so?
{59357}{59466}I was cruising the digestive tract,|just minding my own business.
{59486}{59596}{Y:i}Outside was Shane 's science fair.|Everyone was excited.
{59601}{59696}{Y:i}The winner would get their picture|in the local paper.
{59701}{59829}-Think they'll like my volcano?|-All the parents are going home sad.
{59848}{59952}Their kids' projects are cardboard|and glitter paint and science.
{59957}{60003}Shane, yours is art.
{60018}{60096}-Wow, what a great tepee.|-Tepee?
{60103}{60160}Mrs. Delirious, come on.
{60182}{60295}I'll check the competition. Try and|learn them something about volcanos.
{60414}{60462}Partner, what you got there?
{60467}{60570}These are polluted oysters.|Well, they were polluted.
{60575}{60685}I replanted them six months ago.|That's how long the state says.
{60690}{60758}Every time the tide came in,|they'd flush...
{60763}{60806}...all the bad stuff out.
{60827}{60872}Can you eat them?
{60884}{60975}Well, if my hypotenuse is correct,|sure.
{61017}{61052}Yeah, definitely.
{61069}{61111}You got yourself a sale.
{61411}{61483}You should check your math|on that one.
{61534}{61620}{Y:i}I was in the kidneys|while a 6-31 was in progress.
{61625}{61724}{Y:i}That's incoming shellfish.|I went to the stomach, to be safe.
{61729}{61810}{Y:i}Unscheduled shellfish|now arriving at gate six.
{61826}{61885}And you must be Shane's dad.
{61891}{61952}Guilty as charged. Frank Detorre.
{61957}{62019}Pleasure to meet you.|I am Mrs. Boyd.
{62024}{62088}I am Shane's science and PE teacher.
{62093}{62181}I am just absolutely crazy|about your daughter.
{62186}{62212}She is a doll.
{62217}{62284}If you mean that, I'll keep her.
{62461}{62505}Oh, my God.
{62550}{62610}That is so funny!
{62626}{62696}Oh, my God, I got the giggles.
{62734}{62776}She's a sweetie-pie.
{62782}{62893}She wants to go to the city|and help people someday.
{62901}{62984}No kidding.|You mean like a concierge?
{62989}{63052}No, like, poor people.
{63072}{63113}Yeah, she told me that.
{63131}{63222}Frank, it's so wonderful to see...
{63227}{63300}...Shane participating|in the science fair.
{63306}{63414}Since her mother passed away,|she's had a really hard time...
{63421}{63482}... being part of the group activities.
{63493}{63542}She's going to be okay.
{63662}{63698}{Y:i}And then I saw him.
{63724}{63796}He was on the clammiest oyster|I'd ever seen.
{63876}{63909}Mr. Detorre?
{64009}{64033}Are you okay?
{64105}{64140}Those oysters.
{64158}{64253}The oysters?|Oh, yeah, that's Zach's project.
{64268}{64313}He's a little slow.
{64321}{64416}The doctor says he has a brain|the size of a tangerine.
{64467}{64548}We gave him this project|to push him along.
{64553}{64633}He just started it this morning,|which is funny.
{64653}{64694}We'll give him an 'A' anyway.
{64694}{64710}We'll give him an 'A' anyway.
{64724}{64748}Mr. Detorre?
{64934}{65028}{Y:i}There was no time for questions.|I did what I had to do.
{65043}{65095}Look at that guy!
{65320}{65439}{Y:i}You can guess which photo|made it to the paper the next day.
{65443}{65518}{Y:i}Overnight, Frank became|the town laughingstock.
{65523}{65622}{Y:i}The photo ran in every daily|across the country.
{65627}{65706}{Y:i}He got fired from his job|at the pea soup factory.
{65711}{65806}{Y:i}Lucky for us, Bob hooked up|Frank with a job at the zoo.
{65811}{65921}{Y:i}It was a 90% cut in pay,|but it was the best we could do.
{65926}{66010}{Y:i}Needless to say,|none of this helped Shane.
{66018}{66110}And as for me, I got suspended|for unnecessary force.
{66115}{66184}Since then, every day I wonder:
{66189}{66239}"Did I do the right thing?"
{66245}{66334}From the description,|it sounds like you were justified.
{66344}{66368}Excuse me?
{66373}{66448}Oysters are filled|with dangerous bacteria.
{66453}{66520}I've been trying to tell everybody!
{66525}{66648}{Y:i}-I never thought you 'd be on my side.|-I never thought you 'd be right.
{66727}{66812}Sir, we have a strict|no-shoes-no-service policy.
{66817}{66851}You have to leave.
{66856}{66932}Is that how you treat|the handicapped?
{66955}{66993}Handicap?
{66999}{67087}I have a chronic|ingrown-toe condition.
{67092}{67179}Doctors say that soon|I won't be able to wear...
{67184}{67279}-...even the roomiest of footwear.|-I'll bring your menus.
{67284}{67365}Bring some clam strips|and some steamers...
{67370}{67417}...when you come, please?
{67434}{67473}What's the big surprise?
{67490}{67604}I know you wanted to go|on a trip this weekend, so....
{67712}{67736}Buffalo?
{67741}{67801}Buffalo, New York.
{67808}{67879}The buffalo wing festival|this weekend.
{67924}{67984}Great. So, what's the big surprise?
{67992}{68067}We got tickets!|I called a scalper!
{68073}{68100}Look.
{68114}{68169}Ninety-nine kinds of wings.
{68174}{68275}One hundred and twenty-eight|different dipping sauces.
{68280}{68347}You love math.|Crunch the numbers on that.
{68352}{68414}The possibilities are infinite.
{68419}{68474}Look! Here you are.
{68479}{68531}Ms. Chicken Wing Festival.
{68599}{68631}See this?
{68654}{68734}He's the champion.|But he won't be for long.
{68739}{68852}Because I' m coming.|I' m coming to get you, baby. Fun?
{68884}{68955}Yeah, that's really cool, Dad.
{68959}{69018}See, I told you she'd be excited.
{69023}{69063}Now, tidy up, will you?
{69255}{69383}Okay, Frank. This is your conscience|speaking. Now listen carefully.
{69394}{69482}{Y:i}This hiking trip means|a lot to her. Make it work.
{69502}{69547}{Y:i}Use that charm.
{69593}{69638}What's wrong now?
{69649}{69742}Oh, jeez.|Oh, it's this damn toe.
{69746}{69786}Do me a favor, huh?
{69804}{69857}Don't you get old.
{69868}{69934}Listen to the toe.|Don't you get old.
{70182}{70226}Boss, your plan worked.
{70232}{70324}That's right. I got this city|exactly where I want it.
{70364}{70476}-What about the cop and the pill?|-If they give us a problem:
{70481}{70530}{Y:i}Fire!
{70764}{70860}Get it down! Money on the wood|make the game go good.
{70865}{70929}Five bucks says size don't matter.
{70985}{71032}Let's do this thing now.
{71101}{71144}-Chicken-pock fights.|-Get back!
{71156}{71194}Yeah, get him!
{71199}{71263}That's my baby! Try the headlock!
{71268}{71350}-See that dude?|-A virus! We should arrest him!
{71355}{71436}No, that used to be a virus,|now he's on our side.
{71441}{71527}-That's Chill. He's a flu shot.|-He doesn't look fluish.
{71532}{71623}Just stay here and watch|the maestro work.
{71643}{71678}Yo, Chill! Chill!
{71683}{71746}Pock fights are against the law.
{71775}{71810}Where you all going?
{71815}{71900}Thanks a lot, junior.|You just cost me twenty.
{71905}{72011}Money won't be your problem if|you don't tell me about the sinuses.
{72016}{72108}I was injected into this body|to rat on influenza only.
{72113}{72212}And this don't sound|like influenza to me. Now beat it.
{72217}{72316}I bet Johnny Streptococcus and the|Melanoma family will be interested...
{72321}{72371}...to hear about your work.
{72376}{72498}You can't jack me on that, brother!|I' m in the virus protection program.
{72503}{72606}You, virus. Children's strength|ought to take care of you.
{72618}{72701}You done done it now, Chill.|He's a psycho cop.
{72706}{72756}It's too late to spill it.
{72761}{72850}Just off the Thorazine.|He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
{72855}{72944}He's going EI Pollo Loco|on your crazy behind.
{72961}{73011}I just can't look.
{73019}{73043}All right!
{73126}{73213}The guy's big time.|He goes by the name of Thrax.
{73218}{73289}Go to that new place.|The Zit, on the head.
{73294}{73381}You can't miss it. It's huge.|They' re meeting tonight.
{73386}{73410}I' m out.
{73440}{73546}But you didn't hear that from me.|You didn't hear that from me.
{73578}{73635}Next time, I'll be the bad cop.
{73640}{73680}You are a bad cop.
{73702}{73749}Who you calling a bad cop?
{74111}{74196}{Y:i}My, what big zits he has.|How does this happen?
{74201}{74262}{Y:i}You wash your face|with fried chicken.
{74376}{74449}Wait. Where do you think you' re going?
{74454}{74508}-To get our cootie.|-Like that?
{74513}{74597}-They'll tear you up. Get spiffy.|-Spiffy?
{74900}{74955}Peep this. Check it out.
{74960}{75067}Pliable cellular dynamics.|What an ingenious defense mechanism.
{75075}{75119}Ooh, let me try.
{75212}{75252}What do you think?
{75271}{75312}You should guard the car.
{75332}{75414}This is my mission too.|I am going in with you.
{75419}{75503}All right. But we gotta|get you something to wear.
{75651}{75696}You sure this is working?
{75701}{75758}Trust me, it's perfect.
{75763}{75786}Perfect.
{76170}{76212}We got company. Be cool.
{76256}{76366}Now, try to relax. Fit in.|Shake a tail cell or something.
{76392}{76450}I don't dance.|I have no left feet.
{76455}{76487}You don't dance?
{76492}{76579}Don't tell me you ain't|never gotten jiggy with it.
{76584}{76633}I don't believe I have.
{76638}{76712}Come on, baby, give me|a little bit of this.
{76726}{76749}Oh, all right.
{76763}{76820}-Here you go.|-That's it, baby.
{76825}{76899}-Get down.|-Don't let it settle at the bottom.
{76937}{76974}Oh, mama. Yo!
{77106}{77181}You stay and practice.|Boy, you need it.
{77186}{77267}If I' m not back in five,|you come looking, okay?
{78187}{78235}Barkeep, what you got?
{78413}{78538}-You got a problem with that?|-No. It's just the way I like it:
{78543}{78608}Extra disgusting.
{79182}{79266}Three teams will move through|the cranial artery...
{79272}{79335}...and one through|the nasal passages.
{79340}{79447}We are going to the brain, baby.|And we are stealing one of these.
{79452}{79553}This sucker comes from a place|called the hypothalamus gland.
{79591}{79674}Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus.
{79679}{79743}Controls the temperature for the body.
{79748}{79834}We are going to march in|and take the prize.
{79843}{79931}Frank's gonna heat up|like a sidewalk on a summer day.
{80134}{80161}Go away.
{80252}{80298}I need to talk to you.
{80457}{80482}What a zit!
{80495}{80542}What is it? What do you want?
{80565}{80617}I want you to help me.
{80628}{80673}Should I call the cops?
{80682}{80792}Or maybe Shane should know|about the 200-yard restraining order.
{80797}{80888}Please. She's been|humiliated enough already.
{80920}{80944}Humiliated.
{80949}{81036}You turned me into|a walking air-sickness bag.
{81041}{81111}My family was humiliated.|You understand?
{81116}{81176}Do you have any idea|of the teasing...
{81181}{81258}...that my sons, Ralph and Chuck,|had to endure?
{81277}{81361}I know your daughter Hurly|had to transfer.
{81366}{81404}Her name is Shirley.
{81421}{81469}That is much prettier.
{81488}{81564}-Tom Brokaw called her Hurly.|-What?
{81569}{81618}But it was a cute picture.
{81647}{81749}We gotta get this water underneath|our bridge, for Shane's sake.
{81754}{81851}I would never hold anything|against one of my students.
{81862}{81907}Get back to work!
{81950}{82044}-Be prepared. It's going down tonight.|-Tonight?
{82049}{82128}Me and Madcow|are going to Wrestlemania.
{82144}{82168}See this?
{82183}{82277}This DNA bead comes from a girl|in Riverside, California.
{82282}{82384}Didn't like to wash her hands.|Took me three whole weeks.
{82389}{82475}And this one.|Nice lady in Detroit, Motown.
{82480}{82516}Six days flat.
{82524}{82583}Then there's this old guy in Philly.
{82592}{82667}I killed him in seventy-two hours.
{82672}{82787}I' m getting better as I go, but|the problem is I never set a record.
{82793}{82844}Until my man Frank, that is.
{82850}{82963}I'll take him down in 48 hours.|Get my chapter in the medical books.
{83027}{83114}Excuse me. Excuse me.|I got one more question here.
{83119}{83238}Could a white blood cell|do anything to stop this evil plan?
{83243}{83323}You know, hypothetically speaking,|that is.
{83336}{83438}-And, who are you?|-Who am l? Who am l?
{83458}{83573}A bad, booty-shaking pickinosis.|Yeah. That's who I am.
{83578}{83643}-Never heard of you.|-You just got here.
{83648}{83730}But ask any of them,|when it comes to illing...
{83735}{83825}... bad, booty-shaking pickinosis|stands above the rest.
{83830}{83881}Oh, that hurts.
{83910}{83942}That ain't no germ.
{83946}{83988}That's a cop.
{84017}{84142}Well, what do we have here?|An officer of Frank's finest.
{84147}{84241}Somebody lay down a towel.|This is going to be messy.
{84287}{84358}Attention, germs. You are surrounded.
{84407}{84431}Surrounded.
{84436}{84496}Yo, Hammer. You can stop dancing.
{84649}{84672}What kept you?
{84722}{84757}{Y:i}Es el muerte rojo!
{84762}{84817}{y:i}No me mates!|Get out of here!
{84822}{84881}Please lift the restraining order...
{84885}{84949}...so I can do this|father-daughter trip.
{84954}{85002}The answer is no.
{85017}{85053}Please.
{85109}{85150}Think about it overnight.
{85209}{85311}It would make a little girl|very happy.
{85385}{85473}Only for use against|the most stubborn cold symptoms.
{85535}{85587}-Childproof caps.|-Get him!
{85786}{85828}Why you hit so hard?
{85960}{86031}Drix, I could use a little help here.
{86036}{86060}Give me that.
{86236}{86305}Oh, no. Not again.
{86507}{86587}You have something white on your lips.
{86623}{86663}Other side.
{86807}{86836}Get out!
{86845}{86871}Out!
{86876}{86980}The answer is no! Absolutely not!
{87156}{87230}Thanks. You saved my cytoplasm|in there.
{87323}{87381}Mr. Thrax has left the building.
{87531}{87606}Let's call for a scab|and get to the precinct.
{87707}{87766}{Y:i}Jones! ln my office.
{87780}{87877}Hey, hey, who died?|Other than Thrax, that is. Brandy!
{87882}{87974}-I mean, Leah. Why are you here?|-You really did it now.
{87979}{88093}-I didn't see you back there.|-Disregarding orders, destruction...
{88098}{88201}... popping a pimple without a permit!|What were you doing there?
{88206}{88295}-Promoting good health, sir.|-Is that what you call it?
{88300}{88366}He was lethal.|If we hadn't stopped him--
{88371}{88479}-We'd be frying eggs off of Frank!|-Watch it, you'll cause a panic.
{88484}{88574}People would think|about what's going on in this body...
{88579}{88613}... not the stupid trip!
{88617}{88722}Okay, you want us to start thinking?|Well, here's a thought:
{88727}{88761}You' re fired.
{88775}{88827}-Mr. Mayor--|-Your badge, mister.
{88839}{88945}Figures. I finally do something right|for Frank, and I get fired.
{89043}{89125}Without him, Frank could've been|in mortal danger.
{89130}{89241}Mortal danger? You'd love to prove|that, wouldn't you, Mr. Drixenol?
{89246}{89326}Get your name in the|{y:i}New England Journal of Medicine.
{89331}{89409}Son, read what it says on your arm.
{89414}{89480}"For the temporary relief|of symptoms--"
{89484}{89561}Exactly. Temporary.
{89566}{89614}You' re a wannabe. A placebo.
{89619}{89715}A generic brand.|An over-the-counter Tic-Tac.
{89730}{89798}Now, get out of my body!
{89900}{89963}{Y:i}Continuing symptoms,|while annoying...
{89968}{90059}{Y:i}... will not derail plans|for the trip to the annual...
{90064}{90115}{Y:i}... chicken wing festival.
{90172}{90231}-What's so funny?|-I don't know.
{90264}{90336}They' re making this too easy.
{90375}{90464}You know, no one has ever|gotten wise to me...
{90469}{90516}...and now for the first time...
{90521}{90602}...an immunity cell|has figured out everything...
{90607}{90654}...and they don't believe him.
{90719}{90788}Can you taste the irony in that?
{90830}{90894}Shut up! What are you two laughing at?
{90940}{90979}We' re back on schedule.
{90991}{91058}But boss, we' re the only ones left.
{91063}{91138}Maybe we should incubate for a while?
{91169}{91206}You incubate.
{91211}{91278}I' m going to make my deadline.
{91324}{91402}Medical books aren't written|about losers.
{91541}{91575}I' m not going.
{91604}{91717}-You' re not going where, hon?|-To Buffalo. I' m not going.
{91769}{91869}Honey, we' re all packed.|Buffalo's going to be a blast.
{91900}{91963}I' m going camping with my friends.
{91968}{92012}You' re welcome to join us.
{92019}{92079}Well, I don't think....
{92084}{92133}I'd really like you to come.
{92175}{92257}You don't want me|huffing and puffing after you.
{92261}{92300}You want to go, okay.
{92305}{92366}Uncle Bob will go with me to Buffalo.
{92426}{92490}I' m tired of this. It's not fair.
{92495}{92560}I go where you want.|I eat what you want.
{92565}{92632}Don't you ever think|about anyone else?
{92653}{92696}I think about you.
{92705}{92800}Like when you packed me|a fried Slim Jim sandwich?
{92827}{92892}Yeah. It was a turkey Slim Jim.
{92898}{92932}You know, Dad....
{92973}{93064}Maybe if you and Mom|listened to me a little more...
{93068}{93122}...and took care of yourselves...
{93127}{93175}... maybe she'd still be here.
{93215}{93320}IKnock off that hamburger talk.|Come here, honey.
{93400}{93444}Your mom died...
{93465}{93510}... because she got sick.
{93538}{93599}And how do you think you get sick?
{93604}{93640}Germs.
{93648}{93696}It's the way you eat.
{94611}{94635}Who's that?
{94640}{94732}You know my great-great-grandpappy|fought the measles?
{94737}{94862}There's been a Jones on the force|since we came on the umbilical cord.
{94867}{94917}Until now, that is.
{94931}{94995}All right, ladies.|Wrap it up now.
{95076}{95161}Well, I....|I guess I should get going.
{95166}{95238}Wouldn't want Frank|to build immunity to me.
{95243}{95330}Maybe next time he takes Drixenol|it'll do him some good.
{95378}{95441}-Goodbye, Drips.|-That's Drix.
{95457}{95483}Whatever.
{96832}{96877}People, let's get started.
{96885}{97000}I don't need to remind anyone|that today's our trip to Buffalo.
{97004}{97131}Frank will be up in 20 minutes.|I don't want him losing an eyelash...
{97136}{97175}...or stubbing his toe.
{97299}{97325}Free screening?
{97330}{97435}We' re broadcasting live dreams|from the brain's subconscious.
{97682}{97739}{Y:i}You get back to work right now.
{98009}{98097}That's right, big boy.|You keep on dreaming.
{98114}{98162}At least you got your health.
{98201}{98254}Ninety-eight point six.
{98259}{98332}Ninety-eight point six.
{98351}{98434}-Ninety-eight point six.|-Perfect.
{98523}{98572}You can't come in here!
{98766}{98791}Baby...
{98796}{98879}...you are looking fine today.
{99427}{99512}Don't forget the cushion|we take to football games.
{99517}{99604}Don't want the voters|in the hemorrhoids complaining.
{99609}{99669}Something's wrong with the weather.
{99674}{99755}-We' re probably drinking coffee.|-Look at the map.
{99760}{99820}-What if Jones is right?|-Jones?
{99851}{99886}Funny. Funny.
{99904}{99961}You care more about your reelection...
{99966}{100013}...than our lives.
{100018}{100095}I' m going to the hypothalamus|to check it out.
{100100}{100135}Hypo-who-what is this?
{100141}{100206}Leah, wait!|Who will answer the phones?
{100480}{100535}{Y:i}Be advised. We have a break-in.
{100684}{100716}Sarge?
{100748}{100805}Nothing down there but bad dreams.
{100839}{100879}{Y:i}Frankie.
{100977}{101001}Wait.
{101032}{101154}{Y:i}Maybe Shane would like to know|about the 200-yard restraining order.
{101185}{101273}{Y:i}Maybe if you and Mom|listened to me a little more...
{101278}{101337}{Y:i}...and took care of yourselves...
{101342}{101443}{Y:i}-...maybe she 'd still be here.|- You 're fired. Get out of here!
{101458}{101532}{y:i}-Get out!|-No, I can't.
{101569}{101626}{y:i}-Get back to work.|-What the-- Huh?
{101682}{101733}What the heck was that?
{101763}{101844}{Y:i}Francis Detorre,|you stand up right now!
{101908}{101982}Thrax is alive and he's in the brain!
{101987}{102051}Oh, great, pal. Spoil the ending.
{102056}{102117}-What's your temperature?|-98.6.
{102122}{102180}-Is this broken again?|-Drix!
{102205}{102324}{Y:i}You get those skid marks|out of my class! Out the door!
{102913}{102986}This cat was sick before I|even got here.
{103031}{103126}{Y:i}Now boarding: the 937,|with nonstop service...
{103131}{103199}{y:i}-... to the toilet bowl.|-Tickets, please.
{103320}{103353}IKeep it moving.
{103357}{103393}-Thank you.|-Drix!
{103397}{103435}-Yo, Drix!|-Jones?
{103440}{103487}Get your butt off this boat!
{103492}{103604}-Thrax is alive. Let's go.|-I' m sorry, Osmosis. I can't help you.
{103609}{103634}Excuse me?
{103639}{103708}I can't combat a virus.|Read my label.
{103713}{103772}Learn to think outside the pillbox.
{103777}{103804}IKeep it moving.
{103814}{103913}I know sugar pills who cured cancer,|because they believed.
{103925}{103998}Oh, I don't know, Ozzy. Look at me.
{104006}{104058}I' m cherry-flavored.
{104110}{104176}Hey, pal, are you on or off?
{104186}{104251}Fine. Flush your life|down the toilet.
{104256}{104366}The zipper's down.|All ashore that's going ashore.
{104632}{104725}-You know a pill who cured cancer?|-No.
{104730}{104778}It makes for a good pep talk.
{104812}{104877}{Y:i}Let's go catch a cold.
{104947}{105029}How about a hug for your Uncle Bob?
{105034}{105114}Okay. Nice talking to you too.
{105136}{105185}Hey, muscles.
{105199}{105278}-You don't look so good.|-I feel a little fluey.
{105283}{105381}You know what they say,|"Starve a cold, drown the flu."
{105386}{105465}Your body needs fluids.|And lots of them.
{105476}{105508}Is beer fluid?
{105513}{105542}Of course.
{105547}{105654}-What about all that wet stuff in it?|-I thought that was the beer.
{105660}{105759}No, finish that up.|Come on, we want to get better.
{105764}{105882}There we go. That's it.|That's my good washboard-tummy guy.
{105926}{105993}This is it. Men, go, go, go.
{106031}{106068}Hi, baby.
{106094}{106143}Why are you waiting?|Shoot him!
{106148}{106202}If you follow me, she dies.
{106207}{106231}Don't shoot.
{106406}{106510}-This ain't time to get carsick.|-I' m okay, I' m 1/8 Dramamine!
{106515}{106572}It's just this darn heat!
{106593}{106685}As long as it don't hit 108 degrees,|or Shane's an orphan.
{106805}{106912}Shane, look what I bought for you.|They' re false eyelashes.
{106917}{106949}Whatever.
{107065}{107105}Just close your eye.
{107150}{107211}You look good with falsies.
{107337}{107356}What the--?
{107361}{107395}Let me go!
{107640}{107705}{Y:i}Oh, don 't worry.|Shane will be fine.
{107719}{107811}I want to her to be at ease|and not worry.
{107816}{107841}Listen...
{107852}{107928}...why don't you sit her down|and tell her...
{107933}{108037}...that if anything happens to you,|I will take care of her. Okay?
{108050}{108122}I will nurture her,|I will love her...
{108127}{108197}...and when she's 16,|I'll boot her out.
{108208}{108237}Sixteen?
{108242}{108355}I' m not gonna mommy her forever, okay?|I mean, sixteen, sure.
{108388}{108437}{Y:i}Frank? Are you all right?
{108531}{108613}{Y:i}We 've a hostage situation|involving the mayor's aide.
{108618}{108678}Leah, girl, what were you thinking?
{108683}{108713}Now, we go live...
{108718}{108802}{Y:i}... to a chase in the superior|vena cava expressway.
{108807}{108872}{Y:i}Reports of a hostage are confirmed.
{109041}{109068}Look out!
{109179}{109254}{Y:i}Suspect is headed towards the uvula.
{109260}{109302}What the heck is a"uvala"?
{109307}{109407}-It's that dangly thing in Frank's--|-Boxer shorts! Okay!
{109412}{109443}{Y:i}Not that thing!
{109448}{109485}The one in his throat!
{109502}{109563}I knew that. I knew that.
{109664}{109701}Are you with me?
{109707}{109783}{Y:i}Frank, are you with me?|Are you okay?
{109789}{109847}I feel fine. Say it!
{109890}{109934}Frank. Hold on, here.
{109940}{110032}{Y:i}You 're going to the hospital.|The trip is off.
{110037}{110123}{y:i}-Pull it over, big guy.|-The trip is off? No!
{110220}{110268}Shane, isn't that your dad?

{35688}{35774}Dr. lvan Krank|is a dangerous fraud.
{35775}{35857}His experiments did not|turn animals human at all.
{35858}{35973}They turned them into hideous,|weird mutations like this!

{43900}{43948}Good Lord,|I was totally fooled.
{43950}{43998}Don't worry.|Happens all the time.
{43999}{44061}Now, here's your problem|as I see it, doc.
{44062}{44121}While your theories|are scientifically sound...
{44122}{44173}and your equipment|technically flawless...
{44174}{44222}you keep hitting|a failure point...
{44223}{44297}when it comes to the selection|of your subjects.
{44298}{44411}See, you've been experimenting|on swamp creatures...
{44412}{44465}insects, and, uh, reptiles.
{44466}{44533}And all-ee-gators!
{44534}{44599}All-ee-gators are reptiles.
{44627}{44655}Proceed.
{44656}{44724}Mm-hmm. But the fact is,|Dr. Krank...
{44725}{44767}if you want to make a man...
{44768}{44809}you've got to start|with a mammal!
{44810}{44962}Yes. Of course. lt's so simple,|and yet so utterly brilliant!

{44998}{45085}[Sighs] I wish I had a nickel|for every time I've heard that.
{45086}{45168}I shall give you|a nickel...

{45286}{45365}Then I shall make you a boy.
{45366}{45403}Oh, boy!
{45404}{45438}Oh, no!
{45439}{45473}Spot, this is wrong.
{45474}{45519}This is going against nature.

George, wake up.
It's Saturday.
I know, but it's the first day of soccer.
It's our first game.
Soccer?
I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.
You'll be fine.
Come on, come on, it'll be great.
We're going to play like Brazilians.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Mum.
Stuart, don't forget your water bottle. George...
Don't forget your cleats.
You look especially beautiful today.
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.
Okay, open up.
Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah."
I can't believe it.
Her first word.
Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.
I'm not sure that's technically a word.
Of course it is.
But your Uncle Crenshaw says that every Little starts talking by nine months.
In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.
Are you both coming to the game?
Wouldn't miss it.
Frederick...
...this soccer game's making me very...
- Proud?
- Anxious. Especially about...
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.
All those boys stomping around with cleats.
What if someone...
Oh, honey. He's a Little.
All Littles are natural athletes.
- Do you need...
- Could you?
Okay, that's it for you.
Snow, food.
Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?
Or, dare I say it, is it lox?
Oh! Please be lox!
That's for you.
- Boys, are we ready to play some soccer?
- You bet, Dad.
Oh, great. It's glop.
Look what I'm reduced to.
I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.
Wallace! Get up! There we go!
That's right! Dig! Dig!
Go downfield! Downfield!
You guys, spread out! Spread out!
Well, George is getting a workout.
What bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except Stuart.
There's plenty of time.
Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.
He did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices.
That's not as easy as it looks.
Okay, I'm glad he's not in the game.
I don't want him to get hurt.
It's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.
Irwin, are you okay?
Are you all right, Irwin?
Do I look all right?
Here. Come on.
Better substitute.
Tie game. We could play with just 10.
But we have George, so it's like having nine.
We'll have none of that.
Come on, coach.
Stuart! Go in for Irwin!
Mum! Dad! I'm going in!
Yeah, Stuart!
Oh, dear.
Watch your tail out there.
Don't worry, I won't let you down.
Now, go get them.
Let's go, let's go! Come on!
Over here! I'm open!
I got it! I got it!
- I'm going to snatch him off the field.
- Honey, honey.
Knowing boys as I do,
I think he might find that a little...
Embarrassing.
Get it, George!
Go after it!
Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.
George, shoot!
I got it! I got it!
Shoot!
I got it! I got it!
Yeah, I did it!
I have to start wearing a cup.
He just looked so small out there.
So lacking in bigness.
Does he really have to go back next week?
We have to give him room to grow.
I do. I let him slice his own banana.
With a spoon.
I let him drive his car to school.
No other mother does that.
With George walking beside him every step of the way.
How much more room should I give him?
A bit more than you're giving him now.
Maybe Mum was right.
Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.
What does she want you to go out for?
Painting or dancing.
I guess it's my fault.
I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.
That's okay. You won the game.
That's the main thing.
No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.
Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!
Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this?
Yeah. There's only one problem.
Mum.
- Hello, Mrs. Little.
- Hi, Will.
- Is George home?
- He's with Stuart.
We just need to tighten her up and she's ready to fly.
Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.
Hi, Will.
You want to take a break for a while?
I brought my PS2.
Yeah, okay.
But what about the plane?
I want to play with Will for a while.
Play with Snowbell.
Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.
If I can just...
Oh, dear.
Hey, what's that noise?
Sounds like a lawnmower.
Inside the house?
Stuart!
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything!
Pull the brake!
Get the book!
This is cool.
All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."
Takeoff? I'm in the air!
Snowbell, get out of the way!
Please, don't hurt me!
What's going on?
Stuart's just flying in the house.
Flying in the house?
At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.
Watch out!
Hit the dirt!
Stuart!
Duck!
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Everything's fine.
Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.
I'm sorry I wrecked it, George.
I'm sure we can fix it with some glue.
No, we can't. That's going in the trash.
It's much too dangerous.
Thanks, Stuart.
Why don't you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.
Good idea.
Come on, boys. Let's go home.
She treats me like a baby.
I'll fix you both some lunch.
She just loves you so much.
It's hard for her to think of you in danger.
Oh, this has been a bad day.
Mum's mad, George won't play with me...
I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.
Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?
No, it's an expression, Stuart.
The thing about being a Little is that you can look at any situation...
...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...
...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.
Like in this situation, the silver lining would be...
Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.
George has found a new friend.
So you could find a new friend, too.
You're a lot better at this than I am.
I've been a Little a lot longer than you have.
You'll get the hang of it.
Meantime, keep your chin up...
...your back straight and your heart open.
- Then what?
- One step at a time.
And Canada is separate from the United States because...
...Canadians like to be alone.
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.
And please take your leftover lunches with you.
My husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami.
Tony, would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?
Sorry, pal. I've got karate.
Hey, Mark.
Guitar lessons.
Some of the guys are going over to Will's house to play basketball.
Can I come?
They didn't exactly mention that you were invited.
Oh, that's okay. I'm busy anyway.
Just tell Mum I walked you home.
I owe you one.
Sure.
Whoa!
Miss?
Miss?
Are you alive?
She's alive.
Out of the way, please.
Injured bird coming through!
What's going on?
My wing.
Where am I? Hey! Where's the falcon?
What falcon?
That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!
Oh, my!
Get lost, you disgusting vulture!
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!
Do we really want to antagonize him?
Oh, boy, we've got a problem.
No, you can make it. Don't slow down.
You did it.
Yeah. I did.
So, who do I have to thank?
Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.
I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.
Margalo.
You're so strong. Are you an athlete?
Well, yeah.
I play a little soccer...
...fly airplanes...
...race boats.
You can put me down now.
My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.
Oh. Yeah. Of course.
There used to be bandages in here.
- Hey, why don't we try your scarf?
- Good idea.
My pin, it's...
Must have happened when that falcon smashed into me.
It was part of our nest when I was a baby.
I've had it my whole life.
It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.
Gee, that's too bad.
Yeah.
There. How's that?
That's much better, thank you.
So tell me, Stuart Little, do you actually live here?
Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.
The middle Little.
Cute.
So, where do you live?
- You know, here and there.
- You mean you don't have a home?
Once, we lived in a box. Well, not really a box.
It was one of those things where people keep their jewelry.
A jewelry box?
Yes! That's what it must have been.
A jewelry box.
It was wonderful.
Well, I've taken too much of your time.
I'd better go before it gets dark.
No, wait. You can't go out there.
Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.
I couldn't impose.
I mean, you'd really do that for me?
Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.
- Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed.
- You have a cat?
Don't worry about Snowbell.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Those flies really come back on you.
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.
Maybe more food will help.
Hi there.
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!
Scare me? That's a laugh.
Hear that? That was a laugh.
Hairball. Major hairball.
And yet we continue to lick ourselves.
Unbelievable.
Hey, Snowbell. Meet Margalo.
She'll be staying with us for a while.
Staying? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just drag stray birds in here.
Do you think this is a halfway house?
Look, she's filthy.
No offence. She could have germs.
And how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief? Get rid of her.
We're home. Sorry we're late.
- Little hi, Little low.
- Little hey, Little ho.
What the heck was that?
That's just how we greet each other.
Interesting.
Nauseating is more like it.
You're in for it now, missy.
Mother Little hates when animals walk in here off the street.
When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.
Such a pretty little birdie.
Maybe it's just my friends she hates.
- I found her.
- Found me? He saved my life.
He did?
- From a falcon.
- What's that?
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.
A falcon? They are fierce creatures.
Why does the city have falcons?
That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.
On the other hand, we have a hero here.
Way to go, Stuart.
- Hey, Dad.
- What?
Silver lining.
It's a guy thing.
Is it?
Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?
I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's smitten.
He's infatuated. He's bedazzled.
But he's a baby.
Boys start having crushes really young.
Frederick, did you have many crushes?
I'm still having one.
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?
Whip you up an omelette? Pop you a tart?
Stuart, I'm full.
Full? You eat like a bird.
Come on, Stuart, time for school.
I'm not going to school.
I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.
Guess again. You are going to school, and I'll take care of Margalo.
Look both ways crossing the street...
...wear galoshes and, in art class, don't run with scissors.
I'll get your backpack.
Mothers... You know.
- Well, I don't really know.
- No?
See, my mum just kind of one day...
...wasn't there anymore.
So you've been completely on your own all your life?
- You bet.
- I'll bet it's been scary.
No, it's been an adventure.
I wish I had some adventures.
I'm only allowed to paint.
Hey, life is an adventure.
Just walking out that door is an adventure.
Come on, Stu. We're late.
Go for it, kid.
The adventure begins.
That feels like enough adventure for one day.
Hey, look! The Yankees won.
There we go.
Can you say, "Walk with Mummy"?
"Mummy"?
"Walk"?
Nothing.
Martha and I are going out for a bit.
Can I bring you anything?
No, thanks.
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."
Say, "Bye-bye." Martha. Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."
Fresh air.
Remember me?
You scared me.
What can I say? I'm a scary guy.
So, Margalo, you case the joint?
Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me.
They ain't got much.
The mum's got a ring, but it's only two carats.
All right, fine.
What else have they got?
Well, you know, not that much.
I mean, they mostly just have each other.
A moment while I vomit.
Why don't we just try somewhere else?
Because you're set up here.
They trust you. They like you.
And maybe...
...you like them.
Hey, Margalo, come on.
Don't con a conman.
Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.
Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...
...and plucked her out of the gutter?
Who shared his food with her...
...and, I hasten to add, taught her a trade? Who?
- You did.
- I did. Right.
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.
You're not here to play around.
Come on, Falcon!
When I'm on a job, I never play around!
Are you cold?
I guess when the weather gets too cold, you'll just fly south for the winter?
Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.
It's kind of a dream of mine.
Get out of this cold, windy city, catch that jet stream...
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.
- I hear it's paradise.
- Then how come you haven't gone?
Something's always stopping me.
Something's always stopping me, too.
Everybody around here thinks
I'm too small to accomplish anything.
Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.
Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.
I mean, you know...
I mean I'm not glad you fell. I just...
Want some more popcorn?
Okay.
What?
My pin.
It's fixed. How...
On my way home from school,
I drive right past where you crashed.
It was no big deal.
I mean, there was finding it...
...figuring out how the pieces fit together...
...and you know, fixing it.
And no big deal. Just...
Oh, Scottie.
...one, two, three.
Good as new.
No, Stuart, it's not.
It's much, much better.
- Stay with me.
- All the time.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and your little mouse friend.
Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.
Now, get me that ring!
Or the mouse is lunch.
- I'll do the dishes.
- You did them last night.
For you, I'd do dishes every night.
That way, I don't have to change the baby.
She just dropped her dolly.
I'll just...
- Frederick!
- What?
- My ring. It's gone.
- What do you mean?
It's gone!
- Are you absolutely...
- Positive.
Unless...
I'll call the plumber!
What's going on?
Mum's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.
Hey! What about me?
I can do it. Let me go, Dad.
- Go where?
- Down the drain.
I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.
I don't know. It's awfully dark down there.
And smelly. And cold.
But it's Mum's ring. She loves that ring.
Come on, Dad. Let me try.
Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...
...you just tell us.
Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.
- Or yank on the string, we'll pull you up.
- Will do.
How's it so far?
Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls.
- What does it look like?
- Like the inside of your nose.
- Can you see the bottom yet?
- No, just more pipe.
And everything we ate for dinner last week.
And the pipe seems to go on and on.
Well, the plumber said...
What's going on?
Is that a new top?
You know, you have such taste.
Simple elegance is what I call it.
What's on the other end of that string?
- This string?
- Yes.
Well, now, don't get excited, but someone that you and I love...
...has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring.
- Stuart?
- Good guess, Mum.
You let our son go down the kitchen drain?
Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.
It's been well thought out.
If there's a problem, I pull on the string and...
Now you can be upset.
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
Hurry! I'm slipping.
- Get more string.
- Great.
There must be string here.
- There is no more.
- What else can we use?
- Spaghetti?
- We're out of spaghetti.
- Well, do we have macaroni?
- That's too short.
- We can tie it together with...
- No.
Hurry!
Hang on, Stuart!
- Margalo, what are you doing?
- Stuart, I'm coming! Grab on!
Lower! Lower!
I got it!
- Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?
Don't scare me like that.
Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.
What if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal?
I would not have let that happen.
- You let him go down the drain.
- He wanted to go.
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...
...or George wanted to go into the toilet, would you let them?
I love Stuart as much as you do.
I just don't happen to be quite as...
Emotional? Irrational?
What were you going to say?
I forget.
I know I'm overprotective, it's just...
...I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.
I'm sorry, Stuart.
What?
You people sure like your meat loaf.
You find the ring?
Everything but.
Has anyone seen Margalo?
I can't find her anywhere.
Maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighbourhood.
Sure, to strengthen her wing.
Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?
Oh, you know, Stuart...
...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.
Without even saying goodbye?
What are you doing?
I think I know what happened.
I think that falcon got her.
- Yeah?
- I'm going to find her.
And don't try to talk me out of it.
I've made up my mind.
Are you crazy? You can't go out there.
Because I'm too small? Let me tell you something, you're as big as you feel.
Then let me come with you.
No, I need you to stay and cover for me.
Cover for you? How?
Make something up. You're smart.
Stuart, she's just a bird.
No, George, she's my friend.
And when you're friends with Stuart Little, you're friends for life.
Well, if you won't let me come, at least get somebody to go with you.
Snow!
The good silverware's in the dining room.
Take anything, but don't hurt me.
It's me. Stuart.
You. This better be important.
Margalo's still missing.
I should've been more specific.
I meant important to me.
I'm going to look for her. I hoped you'd come.
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favour.
Buy a parakeet and forget her.
I can't forget her.
She's in terrible trouble and I have to help her.
I mean what am I, a man or a...
...mouse?
Is that a trick question?
It's important. You got to help me.
And why would I do that?
Well, because we're family...
...and because I'd do the same for you.
And if you don't, and the Littles ask where I am,
George'll say you ate me.
What?
Why you little rat!
You know something?
Everybody thinks you're so nice.
You're not so nice.
Come on! Lt'll be fun. It's an adventure.
Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down.
Let's pace ourselves.
I'll have a heart attack.
I think I'm having a thrombosis and I don't even know what it means.
George! Stuart! Breakfast!
Get it while it's hot.
Say, "Mama."
Say, "Dada."
Say anything?
'Morning, George.
Where's Stuart?
He already left.
He did? Without eating breakfast?
He had to get to school early...
...because he's in a school play.
Really?
Yes. He plays a mouse.
And they rehearse every morning before school.
Why didn't he tell us?
He forgot.
You know, being worried about Margalo.
Right.
Good. This'll keep his mind off it.
Got to go.
Say, "Oatmeal."
Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart.
Like the burning bush.
Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.
But it's telling us something.
Let your people go!
- We're not giving up.
- Oh, why not?
Giving up is fun.
And look at all the time you save.
I'm telling you, if more people gave up, there'd be fewer wars.
Bill.
George.
Hi, Mum.
Where's Stuart?
He's not home?
Oh, I just remembered.
He told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again.
At Will's house.
And he's sleeping over there tonight.
Sleepover? On a school night?
Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.
Hello?
Hey, Will. It's me, George.
If my mum calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?
Hold on a second.
Hello?
Will, hi. It's Mrs. Little.
May I speak with Stuart, please?
- Stuart?
- You know, my son.
Oh, Stuart. You mean now?
Well, now is when I'm calling.
Oh, he just went in the bathroom.
I think he'll be a while. He brought a magazine.
- Well, then, is your mother there?
- Hold on a second.
- I told her.
- Did she buy it?
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mum.
What will I tell her?
Make something up. You're smart.
If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.
She can't come to the phone right now.
She's in the bathroom, too.
But not the same bathroom!
- Just let her know I called. Thanks.
- Okay, Mrs. Little.
- It's all clear.
- I owe you one.
- Now will you tell me what's going on?
- It's too complicated. Later.
Little hi, Little low.
Little hey, Little ho.
- Boys home?
- Well, George is.
But Stuart is rehearsing his play.
Then he's sleeping over at Will's house.
- He's going without George?
- I think it'll give him room to grow.
Oh, Stuart, we've been walking for hours.
I can't take another step.
You know me, I hate to be negative.
But when I walk this much, I chafe.
Also, I hate to bring this up...
...but I need to go tinky.
How about the alley?
I'm a house cat. We're fastidious creatures.
We don't just yell, "Bomb's away!"
And go wherever we are!
Oh, look, let's face it. We'll never find her.
If only we knew someone who really knew the city.
Yeah, someone who knows the city's disgusting underbelly.
Who do I know that's disgusting?
Don't threaten me!
What I could tell the health inspector...
...would close you down in a New York minute!
Monty!
Snowbell! What are you doing here?
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We need your help.
Hey, Snow, are you two still friends or can I eat him?
- No, Monty, you can't eat him.
- Please.
No! Now, pay attention.
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?
Falcon? Oh, that's a bad guy.
You don't want to fool with him.
Where would we find him?
You don't want to find him.
You don't want anything to do with him.
Trust me.
He'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop before you could yell for help.
Falcons are vicious.
They grab you by your neck and carry you so high, you can't even see the ground.
Then they drop you. And when you land, they drink what's left through a straw.
Snowbell, are you all right?
Oh, yeah. In fact, good news:
I no longer need a litter box.
Mop up on aisle three.
Stu, listen.
This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...
...but it's important to know when the fun's over.
You don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party.
I told you. I'm not giving up.
We're going to find the falcon.
All right, then. It's your funeral.
Okay, listen. Listen carefully.
The falcon lives across the park...
...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.
Not many people go up there.
And even fewer return.
Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."
Why do they taunt me?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?
I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.
Because I know in my growling gut if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.
I'm sure they already know we're gone and plan to replace me with a hamster.
Don't worry. George has us covered.
George?
George doesn't know poop from applesauce.
And I say that with a great deal of affection.
- Hello, Little residence.
- Oh, George. I'm glad you answered.
Who is it? Can you speak louder?
George, it's me, Stuart.
Where are you? How are you? Did you find her? Are you all right? How's Snowbell?
When'll you be home?
Mum and Dad are asking lots of questions.
So are you.
I only have a second.
I just want you to know that we're on the trail...
... and with any luck, we'll be home by dinner.
And, George...
...thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.
But where are you?
Now, listen closely.
We're at the Pishkin Building.
Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.
- Snowbell, I need more change.
- What do I look like, a fanny pack?
Are you still there?
Is that Stuart?
Let me think. Yeah.
I thought he was coming home.
He is. Later.
He and Will just need to rehearse some more.
In fact, I just left him at Will's.
Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?
- Will, I found it!
- Found what?
- The calculator.
- The calculator?
Will, where's Stuart?
It's okay. She knows about the play.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
I had to tell her so she'd know
Stuart's at your house. We're going back there.
Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.
I just need to get the calculator?
- To figure out how long to rehearse.
- It's a very complicated play.
- Come on. Let's go.
- See you later, Mrs. Little.
George, don't forget you two have a soccer game later.
We'll meet you there!
I can't handle this. I'm too stressed.
All this lying. I've never lied before.
That's why she believes you.
- Boy, are we in trouble.
- "We"?
Yeah, "we." He didn't spend the night rehearsing at my house.
What are you planning to do,
Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?
I'll think of something.
So long, Snowbell!
You've got guts, kid.
Guts and spunk.
Not to mention moxie.
You've got guts, spunk and moxie.
Okay. Here we go.
All right, Falcon.
Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.
You up here?
Is anybody here?
I'm here.
I came for my friend Margalo.
If you've hurt her, I'll...
- You'll what?
- Tell me right now. Is she all right?
Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?
Margalo, run!
Fly away while I've got him covered.
What are you waiting for?
This kid's priceless.
Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?
"Oh, my wing. I don't think I can fly."
What are you talking about?
I can't drill through the wood.
She scammed you. She played you like a harp.
Margalo, what does he mean?
Okay, now it's getting sad.
Maybe this will clear things up.
My mum's ring.
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.
But, Margalo, why?
Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.
She has conned smarter than you.
Or did you think you were special?
A real friend?
I didn't lie about that, Stuart.
You are my friend.
Then come with me.
She's not going anywhere.
Oh, yes, she is.
Was that your best shot?
Now, let me show you mine.
Don't hurt him, Falcon!
I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!
Can't we talk this over?
No! Stuart!
Let me go! No, Falcon!
A few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment.
What have I done?
I'll bet something terrible has happened.
The Littles will kill me.
I know, I'll bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit...
...teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as Stuart.
Who am I kidding?
I have to get up there. But how?
I hope I live to regret this.
Stuart? Yoo-hoo?
Come out, come out wherever you are.
Please don't jump out from behind anything.
Remember, I have a strong stomach but a very weak heart.
Here, Mousie-Mousie.
Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?
- Margalo? Where are you?
- In the can.
Oh, okay. I'll wait.
No, in the paint can.
Why are you in there?
Is this some kind of trick?
Just get me out.
Is Stuart in there, too?
No, Snowbell, he's dead.
What? Stuart is dead?
Falcon killed him.
No. He can't be, he's...
I was supposed to protect him.
I wish it was me who had been killed.
Really?
No. But I am very unhappy!
Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.
I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.
Hello there!
I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?
Help!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I need to get off!
Help me!
Help!
Rita, hi. I was in the neighbourhood.
I thought I'd get the boys.
- George and Will?
- George and Stuart.
George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.
But he slept here last night.
No.
George!
What are you going to do now?
Which way's Canada?
This is terrible.
I just want to go home.
I know a Little is supposed to always see a silver lining.
Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.
Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.
Stuart Nothing.
There is no silver lining!
Oh, no. What have I done?
My plane.
My plane!
The silver lining! This is it!
- All right, George, where is he?
- And this time, the truth.
I'm not sure.
It is never okay to lie to your parents.
Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
It's wrong to promise your brother you'll lie to your parents.
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Tell us where Stuart is.
It was a promise. Brother to brother.
George, I understand. I have a brother.
But if he was in danger, that would matter more to me than the promise.
How would we all feel if anything happened to Stuart?
He's at the Pishkin Building.
- Dad.
- What?
- Am I in trouble?
- No, son. You're in big trouble.
- Mum, Dad, I'm really sorry.
- You should be.
For all we know, Stuart could be out there now, lying face down with his...
Or, he could be fine.
We don't have to assume the worst.
After all, it's not the Little way.
Yes, you're right. He could be puttering home right now in his shiny little car.
Smiling and happy.
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.
- Mum.
- Yes, George.
I don't think he's puttering home.
Who would do this?
Tiny little vandals.
That miserable falcon!
From this day forward, I vow revenge.
If that falcon were here right now,
I'd rip his throat out.
I'd scratch his face off. I'd...
That's him.
Don't hurt me.
Kill the bird, not me.
I'm going to be falcon poop.
Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.
And how nice.
She's brought a friend for dinner.
Too bad I don't like canned food.
Snowbell, get out!
Can't. Stuck. Too fat!
Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!
Do what? What's he doing?
Or else what?
Or else you'll lose this.
Put that down, Margalo.
I'm through doing what you tell me to do.
I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.
Oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?
Free.
Big mistake. I'll be back for you, Fur-ball.
Don't hurry!
- Stuart! You're alive!
- So far!
Where'd you get the plane?
A garbage dump.
Sorry I asked.
- I hope we're not too late.
- Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.
Careful now. One step at a time.
That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!
What about me? How will I get down from here?
I think this is it. Turn here.
Okey-dokey. No problem.
Hey, look! It's Stuart.
Stop the car!
Stuart!
Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.
We got to save him. Come on.
It's the Littles. I'm saved!
Wait! It's me!
Follow that flying mouse.
- No problem.
- Hey-Little, Ho-Little...
...Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.
There he is!
If we get out of this,
I'm sticking to painting and dancing.
Hey, lady! Get out of the way!
He's closing in.
Oh, my goodness.
Keep it running.
Okey-dokey. No problem.
He can't hear you.
I think we lost him.
Going up?
Frederick, I feel so helpless.
A mouse needs to know his limitations.
Stuart! Pull up!
I can't! It's stuck!
Well, try harder!
Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!
No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!
Stuart! Pull up!
- Pull up, Stuart!
- Stuart, pull up!
You should've stayed in your little hole, Mouse-boy.
Stuart, we can't outrun him.
Then we'll just have to face him.
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.
But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.
What do you mean?
Stuart! Don't do it!
Party's over, Fur-face.
What's he doing?
They'll crash!
Stuart! Turn! Run away!
Bye-bye, Birdbrain!
Oh, dear.
Got you.
Can't I get a decent meal in this city?
Thank you.
Stuart! Are you okay?
I am now. Margalo saved me.
We saved each other.
What did you think you were doing?
- You almost gave me a heart attack.
- I'm sorry, Mum.
- You ran away from home.
- I know.
And you had George lie to us.
Yeah.
Then why am I so proud of you?
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.
My ring.
Yeah, I took it.
And now she's giving it back.
I'm just happy to have all of you back.
Snowbell!
You made it.
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- Snowbell, where have you been?
You wouldn't believe what Stuart and Margalo have been through.
You should have seen it.
These two were so brave.
Let's go home.
And how about me? I played no part in this?
Well, I have had enough!
I'm staying right here, folks!
Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?
Tuna? I love these people.
Wait! Wait for me!
I guess they're flying south for the winter?
I guess.
You've always dreamed of going, haven't you?
But Falcon never let you.
Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.
The ones who were free.
You're free.
We'd be so far apart.
It wouldn't change a thing.
Well...
- You're sure of the way? We can call AAA.
- We can get you maps, discount coupons.
There's a place in South Carolina where they do the best pecan pie.
I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.
I guess you've waited for this a long time.
All my life. Only...
Only what, dear?
Well, now it's not just talk.
Now, it's the real thing.
Are you scared?
The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.
Somebody once told me,
"You're as big as you feel."
Just spread your wings...
...and soar.
I'll miss you, Stuart.
I'll miss you, too.
I'll miss all of you.
You, too, Snowbell.
I'm not going to cry.
Little hi, Little low.
Little hey, Little ho.
Stuart?
Yeah, Dad?
What's the silver lining this time?
She'll be back in the spring.
Bye-bye, birdie.
- Did you hear that?
- Her first words! She spoke!
- Of course she did.
- I knew she could do it.
Big deal. When she can fall from a tree and land on her feet, then I'll be impressed.
Sous-titres : Filou ;-)
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.
Come on, Spike. Get up.
Get up.
Listen to me.
It's like a pot of stew bubbling on the stove.
All mixed up...
...with no telling what's good or what's bad.
It's all the same.
But there's one thing you shouldn't forget. You know what it is?
Meat?
Everyone says that, but that's wrong.
Without the basic stock, you don't have a stew.
If you add curry powder, you get curry.
We have stock cubes in the pantry.
Not that, you idiot!
Great, a wannabe preacher with a gun. Come on, Spike.
I'll go around the back.
All right.
No point waiting for the cops.
I know your security here.
- You know why?
- Renzi, hurry it up.
You see this logo?
That's your security company.
I used to work for your security company.
I got laid off, so I took up robbery.
Funny, ain't it?
Go on. Laugh.
Funny, is it?
It sure is.
Stop laughing!
We're closed.
Go someplace else.
Now, go ahead and fill up my money card.
Who the hell are you?
Are you deaf?
Damn it!
You!
Take those earphones off!
I'll take this.
Hey, Spike!
These crooks will pay for my doughnuts.
Don't move!
- Hey, Jet.
- What?
You said there were three.
Drop your guns!
To fool an enemy, first fool yourself.
What's the point?
- Listen up!
- You spend too long on the toilet!
You want the old lady to die?
You hear me?
You see the gun?
Sorry, Granny. We ain't cops or security guards.
It ain't our job to save your life.
- What?
- Bad luck, ain't it?
That's Cowboy...
- What are you blabbing about?
- Don't shoot me!
Cowboy?
Who the hell are you?
Just a bounty hunter.
- It's your move.
- Don't rush me.
Do you plan your moves?
Just hurry up.
Listen, Spike.
In shogi, Japanese chess...
...you look 100 moves ahead, then make your play.
You head off your opponent's attack.
That's how you play.
You don't just move at random.
I want to move here.
Take your finger off, and you've moved.
You're far too easygoing.
Now, listen, Spike.
One's character merges in shogi.
- You obviously react to each move.
- Hurry up. Move.
What would you have done if you'd hit the hostage?
I'd have dealt with it.
It was too risky for a measly
1.25 million bounty.
There's no drama in bounty hunting.
Before you became my partner, life was much quieter.
Good, I was considering that myself. Well, Spike?
I found it!
I found it!
Faye, a message for you.
Target heading for town, using Booth 8 on Route 12.
Get me an ID on him and the vehicle.
It's some kid.
I hate bounty-hunting boys.
That's not him.
Time for the CBC News.
Today's top story:
At 10 a.m. On Highway 7...
...a tank er truck exploded into flames.
Seventy-two persons are dead and 425 suffered injuries.
We have a live report from Lylie.
Reporting from the scene.
The wreckage is being removed and the area cleaned up.
People within a two-mile radius of the crash site...
...were soon overcome by the noxious fumes.
A general panic ensued.
Three hours after the accident, calm has returned.
Is there a possibility the truck was carrying a poison?
The police suspect either a toxic chemical...
...or a biological hazard.
The area has been sealed off.
Any leads on why it exploded?
No information at this point.
But police say the vehicle had been stolen earlier.
They suspect this could be a case of biological terrorism.
Live from the scene.
It's on every channel.
D√©j√† vu, huh?
It feels like I had instant noodles last night too.
Don't be so stupid.
You've had that for dinner for three days in a row.
Really?
I thought it was a dream.
We've got other instant food.
We have flat white and buckwheat noodles, all instant.
We've even got instant sushi, but it's over a year old.
- Try your luck.
- I partake!
Just carbohydrates aren't very good for you.
Man needs protein.
What are you going on about?
I said I like meat.
Forget the smalltime punks.
We need a big bounty.
How did it go with you, Faye?
Terrible. You want to hear?
Didn't you say your hacker was easy to trace?
I got caught up in that explosion.
I'll take one.
Plus, I lost big at the races.
Look. That's it!
Were you there?
Well, it was quite an accident.
Virus? I see.
Oh, no! A chemical weapon?
I'm not contaminated!
Hey! Even the dog's avoiding me!
Dirty, dirty, full of germs!
Cut that out!
The Mars government is offering a reward of 300 million Woolong.
Three hundred million?
What can it be?
- You too?
- Yes.
- Well?
- I've never seen symptoms like these.
They all show unnatural pressure on the brain...
...but we have no idea what's causing it.
I haven't got a clue.
On admittance, they all showed reactions in the lymph corpuscles.
Their condition is worsening, but the lymphs are now normal.
Could it be smallpox or Ebola?
It's no virus that we know of...
...and it's not a nerve gas.
What does that mean?
We can't find any traces...
...not even in the dead bodies.
It must be some kind of an unknown virus...
...or some form of a germ-warfare agent.
This could be dangerous.
Sorry. It's my allergy.
I know by now we've cured most allergies...
...but this could be viral.
Someone could be deliberately spreading it.
It's a no-smoking area.
What do they want?
Are you sure?
If not, we'll all end up dead.
It's starting now.
Bio-terrorists?
You'd better watch this, Spike.
- Why me?
- This information doesn't come cheap.
We know that.
Hurry it up.
- It's very valuable.
- Edo, start now.
Lee Samson, computer hacker.
A bounty of 5 million.
We traced his card with false ID on it.
- How?
- I hacked their database.
He used the card to rent a car that was blown up.
But Lee wasn't in it.
Probably an accomplice.
Yes, that's the guy.
I don't get it.
You expect us to hunt him down with these flimsy leads?
But it's all inside my head.
Here you are.
You can draw on the monitor with it.
We don't even know if he's the terrorist.
He didn't have a mask on, so he'd be dead by now.
No, he didn't die.
- How do you know?
- Women's intuition.
Intuition?
Finished.
That's his face?
That's a hell of a face.
If you can find a face like that...
...l'll pay the bounty.
All right.
I'm wasting my time here!
I'll get him by myself.
Sounds like a waste of time to me.
I'll start on the virus.
What? Now you're interested?
You can bank on a woman's intuition.
- But still...
- I'm sick of eating out of Styrofoam.
I used to fly every day.
We sure did.
I'd love to fly again, maybe as far as Saturn.
You liar!
The biggest thing you ever flew was a crop-duster.
- Is that right?
- Excuse me.
I have a question.
No point. We're all going deaf.
Where's the bean-seller?
There's a lot of them down there.
No, I want to buy the other "beans."
You're an undercover cop.
Do I look like a cop?
More like a gangster.
Same thing, really.
I'm a bounty hunter.
So you're the Cowboy?
We used to be cowboys too, in the old days.
Good. We can talk.
That's more reason not to.
Are you looking for beans?
You've got some, have you?
Of course. You can get anything at Moroccan Street.
That's why you came.
Is Pistachio around?
Almond?
Calabar beans. They tell if your wife's cheating.
The innocent eat them all at once and vomit them out.
The guilty eat one at a time and the poison sets in.
That's how it works.
- I don't have a wife.
- You're a lucky man.
- What I want to know...
- Broad beans are bad.
Pythagoras died after eating them.
Don't underestimate the bean.
I want to know about the virus...
...from that truck accident.
Do you believe in demons?
With so much in the world about us...
...why does man's imagination go beyond that?
Why does man long for the skies and yearn for the universe?
Because in the old days, man used to fly.
Do they sell drugs?
If you can imagine it, it can happen.
Even if it cannot be seen.
So you have the virus?
That was no virus.
Hello, Rashid.
I've got a vase for you.
This was made for you.
No, he needs it more than me.
Yes, my friend, it was made for you.
Made for me?
You should always buy such things.
Look, I didn't come here for shopping.
- You made a good buy. See you.
- Wait a minute!
- Inshallah.
- Hey, I said to wait.
Games from the 20th century are much better.
I'm sick of the games they make today.
I'm addicted to these old-school games.
Back then, they were happy with such games.
Same with hackers.
Back in the good old days of Cap'n Crunch.
Such a small thing, but now it's part of history.
Everything's so well-guarded now...
...it's hard to become famous.
So I'm really impressed with what we did.
I've long wanted to do something.
A real terrorist attack.
Oh, no. He's dead.
Your license.
Where are you going?
It's only warehouses down here.
Oh, no. He's dead.
In those days, the sheriff could see his enemies.
So, what was in that tanker truck?
We haven't found a trace yet.
- What do you mean?
- What I said.
Something we can't see and we've never seen.
What's that?
A space truck was found near one of the asteroids.
The driver was dead and the cargo gone.
A truck hijack?
The truck belonged to Cherious Medical...
...but they didn't report it missing.
Rumour has it that it was carrying some sort of contraband.
- Soon after, the terrorists struck.
- Smells fishy.
Cherious guards their secrets far too well.
Why don't you investigate them?
Get them on some trumped-up charges.
Things have changed since you were a cop.
The ISSP has no teeth these days.
We're powerless.
Our bosses only think about their promotions.
The rank and file are in cahoots with gangsters.
We're so rotten, we're falling apart.
Things haven't changed.
That's why I quit.
Ever hear of purgatory?
The place between heaven and hell.
It's where souls that didn't make it to heaven suffer eternally.
Right. This world of ours.
Is this all there is?
There are 30,000 units in the capsule.
Once it's opened, they'll start to replicate.
Be careful with it.
Where's the money?
That's less than we agreed.
You'll get the rest after the party.
Then you can do as you please.
Then I can say goodbye to this pitiful life.
Can I ask you something?
Why does it have to be on Halloween?
In the old days, Halloween was the day when the souls in purgatory...
...could, through prayer, reach heaven.
Start praying.
Hey, amigo!
Hello to the solar system's...
...three million bounty hunters!
It's time for the Big Shot!
Giving you full details of current bounties.
Today's special show will run for an extra 20 minutes.
We'll focus on the extraordinary bounty...
...of 300 million offered by the Mars government.
Yes, it's the largest bounty ever offered!
But no one knows who or where they are.
Are there no clues?
No, they left nothing at the scene...
...and no living witnesses.
So how shall we do this?
Well, we're offering a special prize to anyone...
...who calls in information.
Be the first to access the number on your screen.
Let's tak e a commercial break.
They're totally useless.
Hey, Faye.
Take a look at this.
It's just like before.
- Tattoos?
- I searched for a matching symbol.
Which one is it?
Well, it's not this one.
- This one?
- Is that a true lie?
This one. No mistake.
Unit 7, Mars Special Forces attack team.
Special forces?
So they're military?
They were disbanded three years ago.
Any data on them?
Of course.
What? Most of them are dead.
Next.
What's the matter, Ein?
No way!
Hurry up. Next.
Ein says he's the one.
How would a dog know?
Look, he died two years ago in the Titan Wars.
I've had enough.
Clean it up.
I really hate this kind of boring desk work.
I know that somewhere there's a perfect job for me.
Faye.
Why do I have to waste my youth alongside these jerks?
- Faye, Faye.
- Where did I go wrong?
Lee is using his card again.
They're connected!
- Is that a spittoon?
- Kind of.
- An octopus tank?
- Kind of. What's this?
Ein says this guy is the one we're after, but Faye disagrees.
But unfortunately he's dead.
Vincent Volaju.
Any luck, Spike?
A vase?
They made me buy it.
How about you?
I love Western movies.
Give me a look at it!
I reckon we could sell Edo to a circus.
I saw my old pal Bob.
A drug company's up to something.
Drug company?
There's something in here.
What is it?
You're pretty good.
Here they come!
Are you alone?
Why don't we play together?
I much prefer the real thing to virtual reality.
The real thing?
At last I've found you, hacker boy.
I only needed 500 points!
Then Sporky Dorky appears.
Are you listening?
Damn it. That was my best score ever.
How will you repay me, bounty hunter babe?
Do you realize the trouble you're in?
It's "game over" for you, kid.
You owe me for Sporky Dorky.
What's going on?
Come back!
What the hell?!
That is so weird.
What's inside there?
They're lymph corpuscles.
The things you find in human blood?
But this one is not normal.
What's different?
I don't get it at all.
This is a normal lymph corpuscle.
But this one is slightly different.
What's different?
I'll blow it up.
I still don't get it.
Let's heat it in the microwave.
It's really weird.
What the hell?
Hello? Is that Totas Cleaning?
Make your report.
The ISSP are treating it as a terrorist attack.
They're still investigating, but have no firm leads yet.
They're still analysing it as if it were a virus.
We're safe for a while, but we mustn't waste time.
What about Mendelo, colonel?
We've had reports he's been seen on Moroccan Street.
I contacted my spies there, but he'd already left.
We have to make sure this doesn't go any further.
Life on Mars could end because of it.
But did Vincent actually activate the process?
It is pure evil personified in a test tube.
Its very existence is a threat to all life.
Vincent and Mendelo don't deserve to live.
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Have you seen my car?
Didn't you just drive it out?
Put your hands up.
I know you from somewhere.
I like your outfit too.
- Yours doesn't suit you.
- You think so?
Now turn around.
- What do you know?
- Wanna flip a coin?
If it's heads, I'll tell you.
You're pretty tough for a drug company office girl.
Knowing too much can shorten your life.
But tough girls are my type.
Halt or I'll shoot!
Happy Halloween.
Trick or treat.
I'll mak e mischief unless you give me something sweet.
I'm so tiny that no one can find me.
So great, no one can see me.
But to the marrow, I'm part of you.
What's he trying to say?
I don't know, but as a statement, it's meaningless.
Has anyone seen a really disgusting hat here?
No time for that.
We've just had a terrorist statement.
Probably a hoax.
Perhaps, but yesterday's capsule makes it far too real.
That vase?
What we thought were lymph corpuscles...
...are actually a mass of micro-robots.
A new type of nanomachines.
What's that?
- Heard of them?
- No.
What are they?
Micro-robots, invisible to the naked eye...
...made from a form of protein.
You like your protein...
...but no way you could eat these guys.
Originally used for medical purposes.
So why put them in the vase?
One clue is that lymph corpuscles are composed of bone marrow.
So what?
The one who made the statement knows that fact.
- So what?
- That's all.
What? We still don't know what's going on.
What a waste of time.
How did it go at Cherious?
Security is far heavier than their business demands.
Their guards all carry
G-21 submachine guns.
That's a military-issue weapon, isn't it?
Few civilians can get ahold of them.
I saw a woman with the same tattoo as Vincent.
And she was really...
- She was what?
- Quite beautiful.
If the military's involved, it's a whole new ball game.
It seems that the more we learn, the less we know.
Where are you going?
I'll go and sleep on it.
Everything comes to he who waits.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Has anyone seen that hat?
No, I haven't.
Where did it get to?
What a weird smell!
What is it, Ein?
Here?
Trick or treat!
Idiot! Halloween's not till tomorrow!
It's not him, then.
Trick or treat!
You're welcome to trick me.
Treat, please.
How about if I trick you, son?
I'm not a boy.
I'm a girl!
I've got no time for women! Get lost!
Not him either.
I've found him.
- Hello?
- I've found him!
- Is that you, Edo?
- I've found Lee.
Really? That's great!
I knew you were special.
Where are you?
I'm sending my location now.
Watch him carefully.
I'll be right over.
Don't move.
No problem.
Bye-bye.
Trick or treat, trick or treat.
Give me something good to eat.
Level one cleared.
That was too easy.
You're always playing that.
Is it fun?
What game is it?
She's just a stupid kid!
Which building is he in?
Which apartment?
It's quite a simple game.
The one who has the last ball remaining wins.
That's "game over."
Did you win?
The real game starts now.
What do you mean?
Don't tell me that's a capsule?!
"It's just a game."
No way!
You're kidding, aren't you?
Only one can win.
I'll never get to see
Sporky Dorky.
Hey, don't you go and die on me!
Press my restart button...
Emergency call from Alpha 1.
I've found Humpty Dumpty.
Current location is 2415, and he is mobile.
I'm on my way.
Don't move a muscle till I arrive.
What about bones?
Leaving Sector 17, moving to 18.
Heading for Central Station.
This way. I'll follow you.
You stay here.
Watch the car.
Vincent!
I knew you by your smell.
You stink of spilled blood.
A bounty hunter, huh?
Bad luck for you.
Blame those who put the bounty on your head.
- Why don't you shoot?
- What?
Or are you just putting on a tough-guy act?
Go ahead. Shoot.
No point.
You're worth nothing dead.
I'm not afraid to die.
Death is but perchance to dream.
To dream for all eternity.
You asshole.
Is that all you've got?
What's your name?
Spike Spiegel.
- I'll see you in another world.
- Vincent!
Vincent...
It's me, remember?
Why only me?
Vincent.
Can you hear me, Spike?
You're dying.
He's dead.
He was dead from the beginning.
Just like you.
He's the one who found the body...
...floating in the river.
Thank you.
What did you see?
You were on the verge of death.
I was dreaming.
Well... which is the dream?
The first time ever...
...first time I've been truly scared.
Shaking with fear.
If one single atom had given way...
...I would have died.
It was not destined to be your time to die.
Swimming Bird...
...these blue eyes see everything.
They see the past, the present and the future.
They look upon the full flow of time.
They see not the reality...
...they see only the truth.
Open your eyes of truth.
There is nothing to fear.
Yes. I understand.
So you're not dead?
What about Vincent?
He disappeared.
As if he was never there at all.
We've gotten mixed up in something fatal.
As my father always said:
"The ship that sets sail...
...either keeps sailing or it sinks."
We're just bounty hunters.
This is far too big for the likes of us.
We can still quit now.
We should back off.
Okay, Spike?
He can sleep anywhere.
Why did you disobey orders?
You don't wish to answer?
Did you consider that disobeying orders...
...was the direct cause of so many innocent deaths?
I'm very sorry.
You're restricted to barracks as of now.
I'll give my final decision at a later date.
- Watch her closely.
- Yes.
Our investigation shows the element used on the monorail...
...is the same as that from the tanker truck.
Have you managed to identify that element?
We're doing it now.
The hacking of our computers was carried out by one Lee Samson...
...with a similar MO in a previous attack.
We're running a trace on his path of access.
- Any chance he's their leader?
- Yes, there is.
We believe he has had contact with terrorist groups.
What is their aim?
Is it ideological, or do they want money?
We're still checking.
Is everything still "being checked"?
How long must we wait?
The medicals should be ready by now!
I feel so heavy.
- What's that?
- My legs feel heavy.
- Hey!
- I got it!
I hacked into Cherious Medical.
Check their trucking records for October 15.
- Back on the job, Spike?
- No way.
I'm just checking up.
Otherwise, I can't sleep.
You sleep too much.
Truck, truck, where have you been?
It carried a load of macadamia nuts.
Macadamia nuts?
I wouldn't try to eat them.
I'll check it out.
"Macadamia Nuts Control Department."
"Macadamia Nuts R&D Department."
Why such attention to mere nuts?
Edo, take a look into the R&D Department.
- Any clues to what they're doing?
- No.
My hacking program has crashed.
Now? We were so close.
Edo, try another route and get a profile on him.
Dr. Mendelo al Hedia.
At SIT, he was researching nanomachines.
There's no way that's a drug company.
They're developing war nanomachines for the military.
So Vincent stole some of their nanomachines?
But war nanomachines were banned by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
If this is a military operation, they're doing it underground.
That means Vincent is still alive.
Hello, Steve.
What can I do for you, Electra?
What's that?
A blood sample?
Check it out for me.
Okay, if you agree to a date.
Well, okay.
I'll reserve a table for Halloween night.
What's going on?
Why am I still alive?
What did you do to me?
I gave you my blood.
Now you won't die when I unleash the power.
Just like me.
It won't be much longer now.
Did you find what you wanted?
No, just a lot of things
I don't need.
That's how the world turns.
There are people who make things we'll never want.
Who's making these demons?
Why did you give me that vase?
It was perfect for you.
I mean what was inside.
Nanomachines in the form of lymph corpuscles. Dr. Mendelo's.
A man escaped here over three years ago.
He said he had made a hideous development...
...one that's programmed to spread through touch...
...or through the atmosphere.
In the blood, it assumes the form of lymph corpuscles...
...and endlessly replicates...
...until it reaches the brain and destroys it.
Then it turns to protein and exits the body...
...leaving no trace at all.
That's as much as I know.
There's only one thing
I want to know:
How come Vincent's still alive?
What are you trying to do?
Are you doing this for money?
For revenge?
Or is it just a game to you?
I am only trying to find the door.
The door?
Have you ever had a dream where you're aware...
...that you are in the middle of a dream but can't wake up?
That's when it started.
From when I was still on Titan.
Vincent was a guinea pig.
He injected an anti-nanomachine into Vincent's blood.
Anti-nanomachine?
It replicates like nanomachines.
It destroys nanomachines.
It was a vaccine experiment.
Vincent started it.
Only he can stop it.
But we don't know his motive.
Maybe he doesn't have one.
Perhaps Vincent is just waiting for Judgment Day.
Doesn't Dr. Mendelo have everything?
Nanomachines, the vaccine?
He disappeared and deleted all the data from his computer.
He never imagined anyone could use his discovery.
He disappeared without a trace.
No one can stop Vincent.
I lost two things on Titan.
One was my past.
There were no opposing armies in that battle.
They were all killed to test the nanomachines as weapons.
I was used as a guinea pig...
The only one who survived.
I lost all memories of my early life.
I didn't even know who I was.
What was the other?
Did you see the butterflies?
I saw countless butterflies.
So many, so very beautiful.
When the nanomachines reach the brain, a light is seen.
It's as if...
The most beautiful sight in the world.
I've talked too long.
Rashid, please give this to the doctor.
Should you happen to meet him.
Yes, I will.
Okay, then. Inshallah!
What's this all about?
We're the ones who'd like an explanation.
Why does your blood have the anti-nanomachines?
How did this escape our attention?
We thought only Vincent had it.
How did you get it?
Have you contacted him?
We'll place you in protective custody.
If I have the vaccine in my body...
...can't we use it to protect the population?
You just don't get it.
Our sole purpose is...
...to completely destroy all record of the nanomachines.
With no records, they never existed.
Hi.
What is the bond that ties us all together?
It's not as if we're family.
There's no linking bond like that.
We each go our own way and do as we please.
They give me so much trouble.
I've had enough.
I want to be alone again.
One more move and I win.
Hey, leave them alone!
But does it matter?
So what if they don't come back?
The toss of a coin.
If it had come up tails,
I would've asked you on a date.
Nothing special, mind you.
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?
They'll either kill us or wipe out our memories.
We'll lose our identities anyway.
We'll be like the living dead.
Like Vincent?
The reason you survived the attack is because...
...you have them in you.
That... What is it?
Nanomachine vaccine?
- You know everything.
- It's like you said.
Knowing too much can shorten my life.
You're no ordinary bounty hunter,
Spike Spiegel.
You're too good to be just a soldier.
My name is Electra Ovilo.
So now I know.
It's a strong name.
I didn't know I had them inside my body.
Vincent was...
Poor Vincent was all alone from birth.
All he had as a boy was hate and the will to fight.
No one has ever loved him.
That's why I wanted to help him.
I thought I could, but I was very wrong.
Back there, on the monorail...
...he looked at me as if he didn't know me.
He had forgotten all about me.
Did you love him?
I don't know.
Have you ever experienced a brand-new feeling...
...that welled up inside your heart and filled you...
...with indescribable pain?
Yes, I have.
Maybe I was looking to be saved.
Years ago, back when
I was much younger...
...I was afraid of nothing.
I had not the slightest fear of death.
I was ready to die anytime.
But then I met a special woman.
She made me want to go on living.
For the first time,
I was afraid of death.
A feeling I'd never had before.
Where is she now?
She went away.
You're the first person
I can talk to like this.
What's between you and Vincent?
We share similar souls.
That's why I must find him.
He said his name was Spike, didn't he?
So he's a friend of yours?
How do you know?
What do you plan to do?
I came here to finish it.
The final party begins.
My next trick is special nanomachines.
These will not self-destruct.
They will multiply until...
You plan to destroy the world?
You... You're insane.
You think so?
Who decides where to draw the line of insanity?
Aren't there those who cross and recross the line?
Soon you will understand.
It's not me.
The rest of the world is insane.
Will you join me?
We'll be the only ones left alive.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't know what will happen, but I don't want that.
Do it by yourself.
- Vincent!
- I said never to come here.
Everything is ready to go.
I want to get away.
The cops are closing in.
- Pay me what you owe me.
- Have you prayed?
I'll be at the bridge connecting this world to heaven.
You can watch it all alone from purgatory.
What will happen to me?
You're a soldier.
You're prepared for it.
Do I get a cigarette?
One will do.
- Shall I, sir?
- Ignore him.
No, don't shoot!
Throw down the gun.
Open the door.
I'll have these.
Where are they?
At the waterworks.
I tracked Lee's hack route to the waterworks.
So he plans to put it into the city's water supply.
- The antiterrorist squad!
- Yes!
- That'll fix him!
- Don't we need permission?
If we don't, there'll be serious trouble.
This is a no-smoking area.
If we go through channels, we'll run out of time!
We've got a job to do.
Where's your blood sample?
This way.
It's open.
- Protective suits?
- No time!
They're behind us!
Where's Electra's vaccine?
It's being cultured in number three...
No, case number two.
- Is this it?
- The yellow packs.
I'm not lying, but it's not finished yet.
In 20 hours, each pack will have 100,000 units.
I'm sorry, Electra.
You can get out through Level 3.
Thanks.
So no date, I guess.
- Who are you?
- ISSP. We're taking over here.
I've had no such orders!
We ask your cooperation.
I can't let anyone see me like this.
Rest in peace.
Waiting for a call?
No, not particularly.
Aren't you waiting for Spike to call?
What? I didn't notice them leave.
- Hello?
- Vincent has gone.
Where the hell have you been?
He's planning a very nasty Halloween party.
How do you know that?
Spike! You idiot!
Where the hell were you?
- ISSP are headed for the waterworks.
- City waterworks?
Gate 2 all clear, sir.
Tank 3 shows no abnormalities, sir.
A suspicious object near the gate to Plant 4.
Bomb squad on the way.
Object appears to be...
...a pumpkin-shaped balloon.
That's strange.
Why is he dressed like a warlock?
There's a Halloween costume parade in Alva City.
So he wants to blend in?
He'll do it in the middle of town?
But how?
His accomplice said Jack was in place.
Jack?
Yes, I see.
Jack-o'-lantern?
Yes, a Halloween lamp.
We're starting now.
What's that?
Unit A, report!
Damn it! Find out what's going on.
- Sir!
- What is it?
It's the army, sir.
- Damn!
- Sir!
Who's in charge?
Who ordered the army to take over?
That's classified.
We're in charge now.
What gives you the right?
- National emergency.
- A what?
Test results are in.
Hurry up. Tell me.
I told you to leave!
It's composed of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide...
...with traces of argon, neon and krypton.
It's air, sir.
But the town will be full of jack-o'-lanterns.
He said he'd be at the bridge joining here to heaven.
What's that mean?
Jet, we need 20 to 30 aircraft as soon as possible.
What are you planning to do?
I'll take Swordfish.
Wait a minute!
Faye, go to the weather control centre.
Hey, not so fast.
You can't beat Vincent.
He's indestructible.
- We have unfinished business.
- It's a waste of time!
If he wanted to destroy the world, he'd have done it.
This invitation says the party won't start without the guest.
If you don't go, the party won't start.
Go for it!
Only death cures stupidity!
The army. What a nuisance!
I've got no time to play with you!
It's an emergency.
We need help!
But we have rules.
All our fighter jets are at the airshow celebration.
There's no time.
Anything that can fly will do!
You said anything?
It's too early to start the party.
They made good planes back in those days.
Can they actually fly?
We'll have no trouble spraying the vaccine for you.
Don't overdo it, old fella.
Where are we headed?
Saturn?
No, we're going to vaccinate the city to save it.
We're only going as far as Alva City.
I was just kidding!
They really can fly!
They're all museum pieces.
Haven't been flown for decades.
Don't give up now!
Hey, taxi!
Who's in charge?
Who are you?
As you can see,
I'm just a terrorist.
- What do you want here?
- Your demands?
I want it to rain.
Rain? What for?
Well, how about...
...rain on the parade?
This is hopeless.
The parade is tying up traffic everywhere.
The bridge to heaven?
You forgot to pay!
Has the party begun?
It's just starting.
Reminds me of the sinking of the Bismarck.
You old liar. That was back in WWll.
We're almost there.
Get ready.
I knew you'd come, bounty hunter.
The last time we met,
I managed to survive.
Your eyes are more than empty holes.
Come to save the world, have you?
You're too late for that.
Sorry. I'm just a bounty hunter.
It ain't none of my business.
I'm only here to get revenge on you.
You think this is just a threat?
I will do it.
Go ahead.
Before you die, tell me one thing.
I died up there on Titan.
Is this world the one the butterflies showed me in the dream?
Or is that world the actual reality...
...and my world just a dream?
I don't understand.
Vincent!
You won't get away this time.
No. Stay back, Electra.
Shall we go... together?
Vincent!
Why didn't you shoot?
I remembered...
She was the one I loved.
I wanted to escape from here.
I searched for the door out of this world.
But now I understand.
There is no door.
You should've known.
You were frightened to open your eyes and see.
Electra...
The time I spent together with you...
...was my only reality.
I'm so glad we could meet again at the end.
What did the rain do?
It spread the vaccine much faster...
...than the nanomachines could act.
Do you think there'll be a rainbow?
Jet? Want to go to the races?
You never learn, do you?
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.

- Hi! I'm Lenny.
- Hi.
Little body, did I scare you? I'm sorry.
Wake up. Wake up.
Okay, don't worry about it,
I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy.
You just keep holding your breath, little wormy.
- Yo Lenny!
- I'm coming, Franki!
Move it, come on! Pap's waiting.
Here we go.
Got you! Okay, body you're free.
Now escape, go! Just go, cry freedom.
- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- Lenny, what are you doing?
What? I was just... picking you some flowers!
Hey, mom said it's not okay to hit me!
Mom's not here.
Don't. Don't!
What do you mean?
It's a theme song.
Are they gone? Are they gone?
You're sure?
Good morning, south side reef,
I'm Katie Current, keep in a current!
We've just received a visual confirmation.
The sharks are gone! I repeat, the sharks are gone.

Lenny? Franki I understand, but Lenny?
- You can't be serious.

It takes not only muscle to run things, now Lenny, he's got the brains, that's something special.

A cold blooded killer! Look at him!

- You're fired!
And on top of that, you're gonna have to start paying me!
- For what?
- So not have us to that little whale wash of yours!
WHALE.
Welcome to Oscar's crib.
Sixty foot slide covered tomb.
There's swimming casualties and plankton across the deep, when you feel a little... old school.
Oh stop your moaning, Oscar!
That could be a lot worse, you know?
Yeah, that's true. I can have this job and look like you!
Who's behind me? Who's behind me!
Babe, give me some!
Indigestion.
She's gonna blow!
Wait! Headphone guy's still in there!
I get you! Hang on!
- Still think it could be worse?
- Yeah! I can look like you!
You're funny. We'll see how you laugh at this!
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!
It's all right. It's all right. Look,
I'm gonna get you some cool pies, we'll get you free hot wax and all that, you like that?
- Allright, go at it, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.
All right.
- Ernie look, who's burning!
- Just the fish we were looking for!
- Yeah.
- The boss wants to see you right now!
- Right now!
- Ernie! Bernie!
My jelly fish brothers, voodoo!
Hey what's up, men?
Ah men, good to see you!
Fellows, I'm gonna ahead, over there with Don Worby.
That's not the way you sing that song, man!
Hey Sykes! My brother from another mother!
What's the day is it, baby?
What's going down?
Hey baby, this is all gravy today, allright snap you fin, right on it. Snap it!
- You are not snapping it!
- Oscar!
Hey, don't sweat it, Sykes, a lot of other fish can do it.
Oscar, would you just sit down, okay?
- Thank you!
- Look, I've been gone off for my markets.
Your owe to me is five grand! Five gees, okay?
- Five gees? Man, it's not five gees!
- See if this refreshes your memory!
Wow! That's crazy! Look at that!
You wrote everything down so you wouldn't forget!
Wow! This is a perfect example why you're in management and I'm not. You go boy.
Look, I have to start paying
Don Lino for protection, so everything you owe me, you owe him!
- How did you figured that?
It's simple. The food chain.
You see, on top there's Don Lino. There's me.
- And there's regular fish.
- And there's me!
No, there's plankton, there's single celominas.
- Then there's me.
- I'm getting to that, there's coral.
There's rocks. There's whale poo.
And then there's you!
- There's my stuff.
- So after he's squeezing me, he's squeezing you!
- What?
Wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Easy boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place!
There's is no happy place with him around!
Okay, okay, okay. Please, please just give some time, that's all I'm asking!
I'm begging you, Sykes, please!
- Please!
- All right.
Cause I like you. I'm gonna give you twenty-four hours to pay out.
All of it?
- How will I do that?
- That's your problem.
Bring my five thousand clams tomorrow, or else...
- Or else what?
The boys will explain you.
Unpleasant!
Five thousand clams?!
You borrowed five thousand clams from mister Sykes?
Oscar, why do you get yourself into these situations?
I don't know, Ange, it's just hard, allright?
Because I'm a little fish in a big pot. A really big pot.
The ocean.
I'm nobody.
- I want some of that!
- Missis Sanches?
Uh, no. That.
The top of the reef. Where the somebodies live.
I wanna be rich and famous like them!
- But I'm stuck down here.
- Well, what's wrong with down here?
I'll tell you what's wrong with down here.
Remember my dad? He worked at the washes the whole life.
He was the number one tongue scrubber.
Every year for twenty-five years.
To me working at the wash was the coolest job in the ocean.
But then I've learned something
I would never forget.
Ha, ha! Oscar dad's the tongue scruber!
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!
My dad was the greatest.
But nobody loves nobody.
- I wanna be a somebody!
- Oscar, you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody.
What's the difference, if I don't pay mister Sykes' beg by tomorrow.
I'm dead anyway.
Wait here.
What's this?
- A pink pearl?
- Hm.
- Where did you get that?
- My grandmother gave it to me.
She said it started from a tiny grand of sand, but then after a while, it grew in something beautiful.
- Dreams can begin small too.
- No, I couldn't.
Take it! It'll get you the money you need for mister Sykes.
What's new on the stand? I'd been on all over this a thousand times,
I don't wanna to say it again.
You know, you've really given me actually, you know that?
I don't know how else to say this to you, Lenny.
You see something, you kill it and you eat it. Period.
Thanks. That's what sharks do!
That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?
Your brother Franki here, he's a killer.
- Right, pap.
- He's beautiful, he does what he's supposed to do! Wipe your face.
But you...
I'm hearing things...
You gotta understand, when you look week, it make me look week.
- I know, pap.
- I'm sorry.
- Lenny, Lenny, look at me.
Look at me!
This ain't nobody's business, this is for you! It's for both of you!
And you're acting like you don't even want it!
I need to know that you can handle that.
Right here in front of me now, eat this.
Yeah, oh Jee! Thanks pap.
Here's the thing. I'm on a diet, and I've read an article about these shrimps, they are not good for you, you know how many calories are in one shrimp?
- A lot!
- It's true! It's true, and the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took her baby, cause she past away, and then the baby lost it's legs, and it's all I wasn't suppose I gonna stop, but I still take care of him with my wife.
It's crawling and it's fearly happy, it's difficult, cause
I've been working on a second shift at the factory, there put food on the table, all the love and I see that little guy's tears, it's the worst in the world.
Front story.
I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you, eat it!
- No! Have mercy!
- Pap, please!
- Eat!
- Don't eat!
- What are you...
- Son, eat...
- No! the shrimp!
- Please!
- No, please, no!
- Lenny! Eat! Eat, eat, eat!
- Eat, eat, eat, eat!
- Put the shrimp down!
All right, go now. No one's looking. Get out of here!
- You're free. Go on, go, go!
- Thank you. You're good person.
Come on, fellows!
- Papa, why can't I handle the reef?
- No! No! We're gonna do this as a family.
Franki, I want you to take Lenny out, and show him the rules.
- Oh come on, pap.
- Son you're gonna learn how to be a shark!
Will you like it or not.
- That kid better show up, or he's dead meat!
- Yes, at a word, boss.
Get a whole load of the money, give it to mister Sykes.
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!
- This is our chance, you don't wanna miss it!
- Are you sure about this?
A friend of friend of mine tipped me off!
- Race is rigged. We can't lose!
- Well what's the horses name?
Lucky day.
LUCKY DAY
SEABISCUIT
- We're gonna be rich. Rich!
- Top of the reef, here I come!
No, wait! What am I doing?
Remember what Angie said, remember what Angie said.
What did Angie say?
Dreams can begin small, you just have to bet it all!
Bet it all!
Five thousand on Lucky day to win!
That's two hundred a one!
- That would pay a million clams!
- Than I guess it makes me, Oscar la millionaire.
Lucky day! Lucky day! Lucky day!
Nice bet.
You have a name?
You wanna tell me what it is?
Well mine's Lola.
Come on man! Get it handled yourself!
So...
Lola, my name's O...
My name is Oscar, sweety.
- Missis Sanches!
- I hate when it hops, smooth dog, don't work with me!
- No, my bad. Hey! So...
- Oscar!
I was starting to think you skipped on on me.
Sykes! Hey! I see you... already to your way to the cashier stand.
- What are doing?
- You mind bring us back some drinks?
- Why are you touching me?
- That'll be great man, thanks.
Oh I know, I'll bring back some of little winner thing!
- You mean the one with the toothpicks?
- What are doing? Don't listen to him!
- Come on Lola, let me escort you to... my box.
- Your box?
His box? You can't even afford the gum to the seats!
He just laid five grand on Lucky day,
I think he can afford anything he wants!
Five grand? My five grand?
- No, it was another five grand.
- You had the money to pay me back and you bet it anyway?
- Hold on.
- Give me that!
- Sykes!
- Clearly I've made a mistake.
- No! No, wait! Lola!
Look, deep down, I'm really superficial.
And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but you are a nobody.
Oscar, you're cute, but you are a nobody.
Wait Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody!
I'm a winner!
You are unbelievable, you're in trouble up to your gilles, and still, you're asking for more?
Now go on, get in here!
Oscar, you better pray that this horse of yours comes through.
You bet my five thousand!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Out of my seat!
You, out of my seat!
Unbelievable! Unbelievable!
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye!
Horses are ready on the post.
Race is going special by
Seabiscuit and some of other!
The long shoulder Lucky day appears of having trouble of getting out of the gates.
- What?
Only a sucker could have bet on him!
No, no, no, don't sweat it man, he does this all the time, he just blam.
- Oh, what's this?
Lucky day has crossed his way through the gates!
And he's off for running!
That was straight away
Seabiscuit forcing on Lucky day!
Fast! Go fast!
Coming round the fall tone the Seabiscuit riding, and Lucky day well behind the pack.
And in comes Lucky day!
Coming up from behind!
He's passing other tales! Now or never!
Sykes, you see? Who's your fish now?
Around the final turn here comes Lucky day!
Lucky day is now calling the Fishfingers!
He gets ahead.
Wait, I'm getting tired, just beg him up!
Look how Lucky day goes!
Absolutely amazing!
This is Lucky day's big day!
That's Lucky day!
What happened!
Lucky day is down!
No!!!
And here comes Fishfingers followed by Seabiscuit yellow tail.
Fishfingers wins!
- What is it?
- Wait, wait, wait I just wanted to hold you!
Get out of my way, let me see!
Poor sad day for Lucky day!
And that's why they call him the low shot.
Yo, that was crazy, right?
Who knew? I mean everything's set, there's a luck, we're good to go, we're in the money, and he trips underwater. Who in a hell trips underwater? And by the way...
That's it! That's it, I've had it.
Ernie, Bernie, I want you to find the deepest, darkest hole in the ocean, and when you do, dig deeper, and put him in it!
Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. It's just business.
Don't worry about a day, cause every little thing is gonna be all right!
- This is how you sing it, Oscar.
- Yeah.
Sykes, you like your money.
I set ticket easy on you.
- But Sykes is not here!
- True.
- Ernie, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah man, go on.
Why is it that millacscan sting on a people?
But they have no affect on you.
Ernie, I didn't mean it Ernie!
I didn't mean it man!
Ernie! You made a joke!
- Good one man! Respect!
- Respect.
Load fire!
- Franki, you know I can't do this!
- Lenny, if you wanna make pap happy, you gotta kill something!
- Or I could find a very old sick fish and just wait!
- Oh.
This getting around, you think of the day in the restaurant, you know how fish pop!
Bit of bit, bit of bob, this that the other, then how you're doing? Boom!
Get a body here. Dead
Okay, seriously I can't understand why this is so you have to be more specific.
- More specific? You want specific?
- Be a shark, for once in your life!
- Oh, what am I gonna do?
Lenny, forget about it, okay?
We do a couple of practice, but a bim, but a bom, pap's happy, you're a shark, life goes on! Capish?
- Okay.
- Okay, capish.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bingo.
Right there, there you see? TV dinner.
- Don't get lousy on this.
- All right. Come on. I am the tiger.
Franki, I can do this!
What if I can't do this?
- Then don't bother coming home.
- Good point! All right.
Hit him in the tale again.
- I like his funny face, man.
- Funny face, yeah.
- Ernie!
- No!
Guys! Guys! Don't leave me alone!
Come on, there could be a shark out here!
Oh no, wait!
I'm sorry, no, no, no. I'm not gonna...
- Lenny!
- What?
Like this!
Oh my god! Just get off me!
Wait a minute!
Do me a favor, don't chew me,
I'm not for that.
- I'm not gonna eat you.
- Don't do the whole hit trip thing with me!
Listen to me, don't move until I tell you!
That's it, Lenny, here you go, body!
That's it, dig straight, baby. Dig it!
Look, I'm just pretending, so you can get away.
When I turn around, you take off!
Tastes like chicken! Mhh.
- Oh no. No.
- What did I tell you!
I'm sorry, I didn't get it, you want me to go now?
- What are you doing, just come home!
- That's it, I've had it up to here!
- Oh no!
- Hurry, swim!
- No, Franki wait!
- No, get your boy! Get your boy!
Franki!
Lenny,
- Lenny, is that you?
- I'm here, Franki.
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm so cold.
- That's just because we're cold blooded.
Moron!
Franki, no!
No!!!
This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Franki!
Oh my, how am I gonna explain this to pap?
Oh no!
Watch it! Back off! I'm crazy! I will do it!
- Wow!
- Wow!
Oh, what a...
Don't hurt us, we're sorry!
It was all Ernie idea!
Oscar! Did you kill that shark?
All right, yeah! Yeah!
Exactly how it looked, that's how it is.
What happened!
- Oh, you want to know what happened?
- Yeah, you're standing on top of shark!
- Go on man!

Big old shark, seventy-five hundred feet long, so he's swimming at me, right?

And it was all like, you want come at me like that, you want come to all like that?
Dude, do the muscle thing, the muscle thing!
Oh right, right. So I told that dude,

And I pointed like this, well he's got a brother.
And he lives right over here!
And I think it's time for a little family reunion!
- You see man, I told you!
- Excuse me.

- Pardon me. Move it!
Sorry, sorry! She seems so nice on TV.
Oscar, Katie Current. As a first fish in history, that ever take on a shark and win, tell me, does this mean you're now the protector of the reef?
- New sheriff in town, the big cahuna?
- Katie, I'm a keeper of reef,

- Of course!
Any shark tries to mess around in Oscar town, is going down!
Yeah, just poetic, I mean poetic!

You wanna see my puppets?
Hello!

We're gonna make a fortune!
Just let me handle it.
- What about the five gees?
- Forget the five gees.
- From now on we're partners!
- So what exactly are we talking about here?
- I'm thinking about 90/10 split.
- Well, that's actualy pretty generous.
You're the 10, I take my 90 off the top.
- I don't think so!
- Talk to me.
- You get 50!
Dude! You're going the wrong way!
- Fifty-fifty!
- Fifty-fifty!

- No, he's slaying sharks!
Hey, that's good, that's good, I like that!
Oscar, the Sharkslayer!
- Wow!
- A Sharkslayer!
You heard it here first, from now on, any shark tries to bother this reef, it's had its funeral.
I could fly high...
- Franki, we'll miss you.
- To Franki!
It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Franki.
May whoever did this, die at thousand depths.
May his stinking maggy coffered corpse rot in a fire depth of hell!
Thank you for your kind thoughts, Giuseppe.
Oh and may Lenny be found safe and sound too.
- Hope he's okay.
- Oh Lenny.
- Don't worry, boss.
- I said some things to him...
- We' gotta find him.
- We're searching everywhere.
Forget about it, he'll turn up.
What's wrong with that kid?
Why does he gotta be so different?
Franki, god rest his soul, he was perfect. Perfect!
Oh, Luca, who could have done this?
Don Lino, at this most difficult time, please accept my deepest condolences.
Thank you, Don Brizzi, for honouring my son with your song.
I got some news, about the guy who took out Franki.

- Thank you, thank you.
- Any request?

- All right Oscar, you can do this!
- Go get them Oscar!
Lenny! Where the hack is he?
- Lenny!
- Hey! What are you doing?
There's a Sharkslayer around here!
Oh yeah, Lenny! Lenny!
- That was close.
- Super close.
Don't panic.
- Quiet, we're safe.
- No, not you again!
- Yeah, what was that?
- What is with you, man!
- Shh, he could be anywhere.
- Who?
Shh, the Sharkslayer.
- There's no Sharkslayer around here.
- Yes, there is!
- No, there is not, trust me on this one.
- Get a hold of yourself, man!
- This is no time to act crazy!
- You're the one acting crazy! Crazy!
You're right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself since the... the... No, don't cry!
No, that's not all that.
- Just relax.
- It's my fault!
- Not really, but still!
- Okay calm. You just need a little time.
- Man look, things are work out.
- You think?
Yeah! So...
Look, I'll take off, and you should just go home, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey, good luck, dog.
- Wait!
- What, man?
- I didn't catch your name.
- Oscar.
- I'm Lenny. Hi!
- Hi.
- Where do you live?
- Lenny? Where I come from, fish don't like to get grabbed by sharks, okay?
- Sorry.
- Go home!
There is no home for me anymore.
Don't you understand that?
- You're too big to be grabbing me like this.
- Take me home with you.
- Shh! What?
- You won't even notice I'm in!
I'm like the invisible shark!
- Are you crazy?
- Please, I'm begging you, don't leave me alone!
- Shh!
Yo! Put you fins on the wall, where I could see them!
- Got ya!
- Hey, yo! Shorty!
- Oscar!
- What ya doing here?
- Check out my mad bum!
- Check it out.
Bum! There is!
- Do you like it?
- You kids got some skills!
What did I tell you? You can shooting be doing this!
And besides, it's not safe to be here at night.
It is now, dude bro, you're the Sharkslayer!
- Sharkslayer?
- Sometimes I'd be coughing like that.
Look, I just need you off of these streets.
- Come on!
- Get your butts home!
Cause I know your moms, and I'm just tell them you are doing bad.
- Hey let's go make mister Sykes puff up!
- Yeah! Bye Oscar!
- Lenny! Did you see what just hapened there?
- I know. They think you're the Sharkslayer!
As if!
- I appreciate your funky tone, actually.
- No, wait up! Hey! I'm sorry.
Seriously, I don't want you mad at me.
And I certainly don't want you to 'slay me'!
You're having a good time, right?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Well, for your information,
I am the Sharkslayer!
Oscar the Sharkslayer, that's what they're saying!
- Wait, you mean you?
- Yeah.
When the anchor...
- Oh, you're a liar!
- Hey, I didn't lie, all right?
Allright, I lied!
But that was a little lie! Come on, no one's was gonna be hurt anyway!
What am I doing? I'm not gonna explain myself to you.
- You know what? You're on your own!
- No problem!
And if god forbids, someone should, I don't know.
Find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back...
- You wouldn't!
- I would.
Come here!
Of course you can cup on me!
But you know, I mean, you're a shark, right?
And I'm a Sharkslayer, so we can't be seen together.
- You dig dug?
- Dig dug, dug dig. Dig dug, yeah!
- Yo, diggy dug!
- Just come on!
Okay Lenny, follow my every move and don't make a sound.
You got it. Wow, echo. Echo!
Now, coming for the south side sharks, I'm fifty.
Oh, it's not okay to hit!
- Get your bum in there!
- You think anybody heard that?
- Who is that? Ha? Who's that?
- Yo-hoo! Crazy Joe!
I thought I heard something!
Did you get that shark?
- You have no idea, Joe!
- That's great! Well, gotta go, my show's on!
All right. We're safe. For now.
Hey a bed! Oh! Yeah, that's good. That's heaven.
Snuggely buggley waggely!
- I love you man!
- Wow, hold on!
- You're my new best friend!
- Stop it! Okay, you wanna be friends?
Fine, but we gotta lay down some rules.
Rule number one, no snuggely buggely, whatever that just was!
- You got it. Anything else?
Allright, rule number two!
And this is the most important rule.
Any event, that possibly, you know, you're hungry...
Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat anyone.
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm different from the other sharks.
Let's put it that way, leave it at that. Good night!
- Define different.
- You'll laugh.
- I'm not gonna laugh!
- Well that's just what you said, and then what happens later? You laugh.
Lenny, I give you my word.
Okay, I will tell you, I'm...
I'm a vegetarian.
Hm, hold on.
So that's it?
- What do you mean that's it?
- I'm just...
You're first fish I've ever told!
I'm so tired of keeping that all a secret!
- And my dad,
- Wow, hey! he'll never accept me for who I am.
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you, man.
- I think all sharks should be like you.
- God, that sweet to say.
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.
- Really?
- If you wanna blame anybody, blame me. Cause if I hadn't been out there, in the first place, nothing of this would happen!
Yeah, if pop knew that, he'd ice you for sure.
Ice? Was that a godfather or something?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, 'yeah'?
Yeah, he is.
Hey, are you all right?
GAME OVER
- Ha, man, I told you!
- I'm doing this!
Left circle double left square right to the down square square.
Another square! Respect.
- Respect.
Oh yeah? Well I got some news for you!
The Sharkslayer made me his manager, so I'm now... what I like to call untouchable!
Did you hear me?
- Sykes!
- Okay.
Hey Oscar!
- Sykes!
- Hey hey hey, there he is, my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer!
- Yeah whatever, Sykes listen.
And another thing, from now on you're gonna have to start paying me for protection!
Sykes, the deal is off, the shark
I killed was Don Lino's son!
- I know! Any grade?
- Not if he finds out!
What do you mean find out? I've got him on the phone right now!
That's right, Lino. I've got the
Sharkslayer right here in front of me!
- And he's gonna slay you and all of your sharks!
- Sykes, shut up! Shut up!
Hey that's good. That's good, I like that.
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!
- What? Oh, kid, he wants to talk to you.
- I know, I'm not here! I'm not here!
Yeah, he's right here.
- Hello.
- Shut up? Shut up?
You don't tell me shut up,
I tell you shut up!
- What? Hello?
- Yeah, how you're doing?
Let me have a pie with everything on it.
Anchovies, meet balls, mushrooms...
- Luca!
- Oh, hi boss!
- What are you doing working in a pizza joint?
- Get off the phone!
But I'm hungry!
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer!
They are going to tear you fin from fin!
Come on, now who's your puff daddy?
Who takes care of you?
Come on you two, we've got work to do.
- I was winning!
- Sykes, Sykes, hold, look!
- You got it all wrong!
- I've been writing songs about you kid!
- All the shark bites..
- Sykes.
With his teeth dear.
- And then Oscar,
- Sykes!
- Kicked his butt!
- Sykes, Sykes, man!
- Come on!
- Maybe I can help?
Hey! Lola! What are you doing here?
You pop it up sometimes in places!
Oh you said to wait, so...
- I've been waiting.
- Look, I don't have a lot of time for a whole hand clappy making the life's go on music playing and the guitar thing, you know.
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid? That's funny.
I'm not afraid of nothing, it's just...
- Oh baby, you're so tense.
- Yeah, you know. I've really been stressed lately, like protecting the reef, you know, I do that for myself.
- It's just too crazy.
- It's just too much.
Yeah, you know, just one thing on top of the other.
Actually I was thinking about retiring.
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?
You have worked your way to the top.
You don't wanna go back to the bottom, do you?
- No. No, no way!
- You just show them who's boss.
And the sharks will leave you alone.
Yeah, you're right!
Lenny!
- Pss! Lenny! Where are you?
- Hello, Oscar.
Angie! Hey! What are you doing here?
What Oscar, did you forget something?
Oh maybe, you forgot your shark!
Hi.
Shark! Swim Angie! I'll cover you! Quick!
- Before it's too late! Go home without me!
- Oh stop it! Your friend shark here told me everything.
- Lenny, why would you do that?
- I don't know, I like her!
Thank you, I like you too.
What were you thinking bringing him in here?
- No, I just, I'm still working at the cakes.
- Cakes? You lie!
- Everybody thinks you're slayer of the sharks!
- Who am I gonna tell that they are wrong?
- How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me?
- Don't take it personally. Come on, I lied to everybody!
All right. Look, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you, but listen I got just one... little problem I gotta take care of.
- Of what's that?
- Sharks are coming to get me!
- And they should!
I mean, what did you expect?
You just take credit for killing the shark and everything will be fine and dandy for the rest of your life?
Yeah!
But don't you worry about it.
Me and Lenny got it, we go fix it!
- Wow, wow, wow.
- What's with the 'we', I don't wanna 'we' part of this.
- Hey, too late now, vagie boy, they'll be looking for you too.
- Point taken. What's the plan?
- Allright, just what we will do.
Oscar! Here's the plan! You tell the truth. And you go home!
Allright, look. This we're gonna do, right?
We will paint you up all bloody. Just mess, right?
And you go swim out and meet the sharks before they get here.
And you will say stop!
Don't go no further! This Sharkslayer's crazy man!
He beat me senceless!
He's stone cold killer, man!
And then you can tell them I'm huge!
You know, tell them that I'm handsome.
- You're going way too far, Oscar!
- Acually he hasn't gone far enough.
Exactly!
What?
You need slay a shark, and I need to dissappear.
This is what we're gonna do.
This is Katie Current, reporting live.
We've got uncontrolled reports of...
Shark!!!
Look, it's the Sharkslayer!
Holy microbe! Did we get that?
Hey, Ange! Oscar's on the TV!
Show me that. Allright, do what you do best.
Do you hear them, Lenny?
They are going crazy, man!
- They love us!
- They love you, they hate me!
- What?
- Let's switch sides, maybe I can be the Fishslayer!
- They'll never see it coming!
- Come on, man!
You saw this, you'll never have to go home again!
You can start a new life!
- Now give me a growl!
- Okay.
- Like that?
- That was pretty good.
Let's go!
Is that what you're offering?
Do you understand how huge my client is? Turn on your TV right now!
Lenny, hold on! Lenny, Lenny!
Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV!
- Don't swallow!
- Oscar?
No, it's Pinnoccio. Of course it's me!
Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Sorry, is when you step on somebody's fin at the movie theater.
It is sorry. Sorry, is what you say,
Hey, where's the baby, dude?
And it turns out to burst is just fat!
This is as far away from sorry, as you could possibly get!
- But Oscar! I think I'm gonna puke.
- No, no, no! Lenny, just open up.
Nice and easy.
- Are you not entertained?
- Go Oscar, man!
- You can't handle its rule!
- Go get them!
You had me at hello!
Turn your TV back on! What are you doing, turning your TV off? Turn it on!
This reef is huge. How we're supposed to find the Sharkslayer?
This is it, Lenny. Big finish!
Just like we practised.
- The flying fish?
- The flying fish!
Little more help here, body boy!
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
Curse you, Sharkslayer!
Yeah, and you tell Don Lino, that I don't never ever ever ever never!
Want to see another shark on this reef again!
- Ever!
Remember this name,
Oscar the Sharkslayer!
Aha! You see? You see? Ha?
Look at Oscar! Oscar!
Hey, Lol...
It seems that Sharkslayer not only countered a few sharks today, but maybe a few hearts?
Has the reef's most eligible bachelor have been snapped up?
I'm Katie Current. You're live watching the Sharkslayer making out.
Hey Angie, can you hand me the blue one?
Thank you.
Who steps in the room?
- Yeah!
- Oscar and Lenny!
What a dream baby! Give me that!
Give me some fin!
- High fin!
- Give me some fin!
- Low fin!
- Did you see me? I was like...
- That was great!
- When you punched me, the crowd was...
Yeah, the ate it up! Hey Angie, Angie you ain't know how Lenny had me in him, did you?
- It was like an Oscar explosion!
- How good was I?
- Oh you was the ball!
- Thank you, thank you.
Hey, hey, hey! Casanova!
I saw your big finish on the news.
Nice smooch, lover boy.
It was just private, just private.
- Private! The entire reef saw you do it.
- Hey, somebody's got a bad move.
Come on, Ange. Let me see the smile!
- Show me the smile, baby!
- Knock it off!
- What is gotten in you?
- Me? I want, I swear! Sometimes I wanna take your big dumb dummy head and just...
- Ange, Ange, what is the problem?
- Problem? There's no problem, I'm not having problem!
Maybe it's probably because you're the one with a problem!
- Hey you guys?
- What have you got against Lola?
Not my lips, that's for sure!
- Okay, what's going on?
- I'm gonna stay out of this.
Look, why would you even care about Lola anyway?
- I don't!
- You don't?
- No!
- No what?
- I don't know!
- You guys, you wanna get?
- No
- No!
Just tell me, Oscar, cause I'm curious.
Why do you think she's interested?
Do you think for one minute that she would even be with you, if you want to reach a fame of Sharkslayer?
- Come on guys, please don't fight.
- Are you that light?
- At least she treats me like I'm somebody!
- Yeah, but will she love you if you were nobody?
- Nobody loved me when I was nobody!
- I did!
Before the money, and before the fame, before the lie! To me you were a somebody, Oscar.
Now you're nothing! But a fake. A shame.
- You're joker.
- Here I come!
Sebastian, the way you'll washing dolphin!
- Angie.
- No, forget it! Just go!
Cause I'm tired of hearing that everything you had in your life wasn't good enough.
Including me.
- Angie?
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Go back and do it again.
Hey, come on. It'll be okay.
You can't have the lose!
You got shark breath!
'O' mints
'Coca cola'
'Get real'
What are you kids doing?
How many times I got to tell you?
This is past your bed time! Go on, all right.
Hey, hey, hey! What are you kids are...
Well, it looks pretty good!
You guys should do this for a living!
Preparation 'O'!
It slays hemorroids like Oscar slays sharks!
Hey Oscar!
Angie was right. I am a joker.
Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you in here?
- All your friens are inside!
- Not all my friends.
You may not little bottom feeder from the whale wash.
Forget about her. She's a nobody.
I'm the nobody.
Oh let me guess. She told you that she loves you, is that it?
It's not like you feel the same way about her.
You know what? I don't think this is gonna work out.
What? Are you dumping me?
Let me explain something to you.
We get party like at your birthday.
Ha! Young love!
CHOCOLATES
FLOWERS
- Hey Oscar!
- Hey, I can't talk, I gotta find Angie!
I need to tell her... I love her!
Where you're going, Oscar?
- Hi, whale wash.
- Give me the phone!
- We'll you got a whale to wash and the price...
- Give me back the phone! And the price is... very very low. Consider no good washers!
- Good one, Ernie.
How many times do I have to tell you? It's gosh!
You get a whale of a wash, and the price - oh my gosh!
- All right, we get it man.
- Whale wash, rhymes with gush!
- Give me that!
Get out of here, both of you.
Won't you use some place else, will you?
- Sykes? Where's Angie?
- You tell me!
Whale wash, you got a whale of a wash... No?
- It's for you.
- Ha?
- Hello?
- Is this the Sharkslayer?
- Yeah, who is this?
- It's Luca the octop... I mean, forget about it. Now you follow these instructions, okay?
Fall cabinet, top drawer, there's a package. Get it.
That's right, tough guy, we got your girl.
That is gonna be a sit-down. In one hour.
- Who is it?
- Shh!
Be there if you don't want to see her sleeping with the fishes.
The bad ones.
Now nod your head if you understand.
Now tell me if you nodded your head.
I nodded.
They got Angie. And they want a sit-down.
I never meant for anybody to get hurt, especially not Angie. This is all my fault.
That's a classic move. I've seen it a thousand times.
They take the thing you love the most, and then they use it against you!
Look, we gotta go to that sit-down, and we gotta save her.
Wow, wow, wow. Look,
I wanna save Angie too, but I can't just sit there and say,
- Hi pap, I'm a dolphin!
- Lenny?
And my friend Sharkslayer, he is a fake!
- Fake?
- Come on!
We're gonna need a better plan than that.
This is a joke, right? This is a joke?
Because you know, I told Lino,
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!
Tell me you didn't make it a low kid.
Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell me you're a real Sharkslayer.
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Sykes.
I'm not.
But the sharks don't know that.
Would you stop screwing around? This will never work. We're dead, we're dead!
Sh! Thank you, Sykes. Thank you!
My man Sykes has just begged me not to murder you all up here, right?
Now I might listen to him.
But then I cannot might not.
And that depends on the individual behaviour of all the individuals in here. Individuals.
Hey, is that right?
- Look, he's got dolphine muscle.
- My uncle Will got wacked by one of those.
All right. Which one of you sorry deans caled this meeting?
That would be me.
So, this the Sharkslayer? I've been looking forward to meet you.
I feel like we're practically family!
You know that's funny, ain't it?
I brought my kids into the world. Full love and care.
And you took them out.
You know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
I'm the Don! The boss of the Great White sharks!
Hey boss, I saved your seat.
I've been running this reef since before you was born!
And If you thought that guy like me, can't get to a guy like you, guess what?
You thought wrong!
Man, you're the one who's wrong.
I barely know that girl.
- What her name was?
- Oh yeah?
Well I say he's bluffing.
- If I wasn't marry.
- How you're doing, pretty lady?
- Lola! We meet again!
- You know, Sharkslayer, there's only one thing
I like better than money...
Revenge!
- Oh, I'm in love!
- Your shark slaying days are over! and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Ha? What's so funny?
You got nothing! Nothing!
Sebastian, take a roll!
Can't touch this!
Can't touch this!
Stop! Oscar time!
Okay!
New rules! Nobody!
I repeat, nobody makes a move without my okay.
I am the pattern marker now baby!
From now on everything flows through me!
What did he do? What did he do? I can't see it!
You don't lose a two, you don't grow one back without my okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
If you sneeze, you don't white dead boogie without my okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right. And you don't say okay, without my okay.
Okay?
Okay! Thank you all for coming, good meeting, we gotta go.
And one more thing. What is with all your living in a low boo?
- Oscar!
- That was supposed to be my get yourselves a real high-down!
- Oscar.
And take the good look, Lino. It's over!
- Your old school!
- Oscar!
What?
Excuse me.
- Ange, are you okay?
- No! I am not okay!
- He ate me!
- I had to take it.
- The taste was killing me!
- Lenny?
Is that you?
You're alive?
I thought I lost you!
What are you wearing, ha?
What is that?
Hey boss, it's Lenny!
He was wearing the disguise, so we wouldn't recognize him.
But now he's not wearing a disguise, so we do recognize him!
- Hi pap.
- Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea how this looks?
This is the best sit-down,
I've ever been to!
What are you doing with disguise?
You took out your own flash and blood!
- Franki!
- Look pap, just listen!
It's not that, you never take side against the family, ever!
Hey Don Lino! Sir, listen!
It's not his fault!
- This is between you and me.
- What did I ever do to you!
You took Franki away, and you've turned Lenny into a dolphin!
I'm gonna get you!
- Oscar! Look out!
- Oscar! Swim! Swim for your life!
You're gonna regret the day you became the Sharkslayer!
- Look who's talking in the pot hole!
- Ha?
You're still hungry big guy!
Well say hello to my little friends!
- Try again.
- Whale wash.
You get a whale of a wash and a price. Oh my gosh!
All right, you got it right!
- You got it right.
- Move! Everybody everyway!
Come on, Lino. It's time to clean up your act.
Pap, leave him alone!
All right Lino! Game's over!
Lenny? What are you doing in there?
- Sorry.
- Where's Lino?
- He's right behind me, isn't he?
- You're mine now!
- Let's finish the Sharkslayer.
- Oh we're about to!
Thank you for coming to whale wash.
Okay! Somebody needs to get me out of the bubble. Today!
- Angie?
- The Sharkslayer has done it again!
- Hey!
- This time...
- Wait!
- glorying two sharks into his death trap of high gene.
- No!
Oscar, you're the somebody, everybody wants to be!
The top of the food chain!
Tell our cameras, how it feels to be you.
- Angie?
- Oscar, get me out of here, quick!
I need to get straight so I get as far away as I supposed to.
- Look what you did to him!
- No, it's all a big misunderstanding!
Sharkslayer, over here! One word about you, Sharkslayer.
- Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!
- Stop!
I am not a real Sharkslayer!
- I lied.
- What?
And I'm not a real financial advisor!
Okay, it was an anchor that killed Franki.
I didn't have anything to do with it and neither did Lenny.
If that was true, why did you ran away?
I think you always wanted me to be like Franki.
I'll never be the shark you want me to be.
What is your problem?
So, your son likes calp? So?
His best friends are fishes. So?
He likes to dress like a dolphin, so what?!
Everybody loves him just the way he is.
Why can't you?
Don't make the same mistake that I did.
I didn't know what I have. Till I lost her.
Will you get me out of this?
So I can hug my kid.
- And tell him I'm sorry.
- Pap!
Give me a hue.
I love you son, no matter what you eat, or how you dress.
- Oscar?
- Angie?
Angie...
I wish I knew now what I knew then. I mean...
I wish you knew, what I knew. I mean...
- Before this.
- You're blowing it, man!
Mind your business, all right?
I'm just emotional, and there's pressure!
What I'm saying, I just...
I didn't mean the top of the reef.
Everything I wanted was right there in front of me.
The whole time.
What about being a somebody?
I'm nobody without you.
You're not helping.
Oh, come here! You big dumb dummy head!
I've never told you till this, but you're the best henchmen and guides I ever had.
Come on, group hug!
- Ah! Hey!
- Sorry man, sorry.
Come such, straight again man, don't be afraid.
Oh forget, the moment's gone.
So Lino, Don, we're cool, right?
I mean like the reef is safe, you know walk the streets, you know without... you know?
Yeah, we're cool.
Oscar, excuse me, Oscar?
You've lost everything you've lied so hard to achieve.
Tell me, what's next for you?
Come on! Everyone's waiting!
- Mister manager!
- Hey, I just gotta put the finishing touch on my new desk.
I love you, pap.
- Yo, dog!
- Sykes!
All right partner, let's see what you can do.
Sykes and Oscar's whale wash is now opened for business!
Yo E, B, let's get this party boomed!
The other wheels of steel!
Yo Christina! Missy!
How about we have a low?
Oscar leashes furnal!
What's up with your bow? Let it go!
Hey Angie? Sorry papa and I are late, but we brought some new customers!
- Hey, how you're doing?
- Wow!
Okay, guys! Come on in!
- Yo, yo, what's up brother?
- Hey Oscar!
What's up!
No, no snap it, snap it, you're not snapping!
- I'm snapping, I'm snapping!
- It's okay, yo Great Whites can't do it yo!
- Yo!
- Yo, what's up?
- What's up with what?
- Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, you say yo one more time, and I'm gonna yo you!
I'm sorry.
- Okay dude, I painted you high!
- All right!
- Paint me out!
- Hey! You think you're smart?
What am I? A clown?
Keep going with me, don't let me lose you!
Cause I can't lose you!
In your face!
- Allright, what you got?
- You don't wanna mess with me!
Yo-hoo! Break it down, fellows!
This is it, Digipals.
In a few seconds, the doors will open for the best movie of all time.
A Digimon movie.
Seven hours of waiting in line and skipping breakfast...
...have finally paid off.
Nanette Manoir.
The end of the line starts at the end.
Au contraire, Angela Anaconda.
The end is for riffraff, which is French for:
Those who must wait since they don't have...
...all-access, VlP passes.
But thanks ever so for keeping our spot warm.
"Thanks for keeping our spot warm."
We are going to have to get digidrastic if we want to get the best seats.
Get ready to rumble.
Hey, wait up! I was first in line!
Saved!
Guys? Where are my best friends?
Refills are free, right?
Taken! Sorry! Saved! Back up, Grandma!
That's it!
If my friends do not get here soon--
Popcorn! Thanks, Johnny Abatti.
Digimon! Digimon!
We're about to have the best view of the best movie, in the best seats ever!
Hats, view, blocking!
S'il vous plait, Angela Anaconda.
As if we would ever be so gauche as to wear them in the actual theater.
Mrs. Brinks, we saved you a seat.
Enjoy the show, Angela Anaconda.
So Mrs. Brinks and Ninny-poo think they can block the Digimon show...
...with their big, fat,
Digimon-blocking heads, do they?
Well, not for long.
Angela Anaconda, digivolve to Angelamon!
Well, look who's here.
Ninnymon and her Brinksimonster robot...
...come to block our view of the entire world.
Prepare for battle, you pathetic Pukimon.
But first, let's make some concessions.
After all, refills are free. Right, Ginamon?
"Help me, Angelamon, more powerful
Digimon than l", you will cry.
Don't worry, Ninny-whinnymon.
My pal Johnnymon is here to give you a kick-start.
And now, get ready for my ultimate, anti-Ninnymon...
...super-secret powers.
Angela!
Angelamon! Angelamon!
Digimon!
-Digimon!
-Excusez-moi, but if you common...
...Iine waiters can't adhere to theater etiquette...
...then I'll be forced to summon an usher.
Oh, Guinevere, je t'aime depuis le premier jour.
I've loved you since the first day.
This isn't Digimon!
This is some boring, phony, fake French film.
But that means....
We're in the wrong theater.
I called dibs on the best seats!
Good heavens!
Who says,
"There's no such thing as monsters "?
You're never quite the same after you meet your first Digimon.
My name's Kari. I'm part of a team called the DigiDestined.
There were a handful of us at first, but we've added a few members since then.
That's me with T.K., another one of the DigiDestined.
And that's Willis, in America.
While the rest of us in Japan only had one Digimon, he had twins.
And while we had our team to count on...
... Willis didn't have any human friends, only his two Digimon.
His digital adventures, as well as ours, began that night, eight years ago.
Did you know there are actually two worlds?
Our world and the Digital World.
Now, don't plan a vacation there.
I'm not even sure where it is.
But when I first saw it, I was so scared,
I was so nervous, I was so cute.
That's my brother Tai, when he was a little kid.
Even back then, he was a born leader.
Brave, strong and graceful.
That night started like every other one.
Tai was making his fourth trip to the bathroom.
Kari, what are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to play with the computer.
But it's doing something weird.
I was right. It was our first DigiEgg.
On the other side of the world...
... Willis was getting his DigiEgg at the exact same time.
Tai, wake up!
Tai! I'm going to the health-food store.
What a weird dream. A computer egg?
I gotta stop watching scary movies before I go to bed.
Take care of your sister.
But, Mom,
I was gonna play soccer with my friends!
The egg's real!
I bet you this is gonna taste a lot better than your egg.
I know what we can do.
Let's use it as a soccer ball.
You're right, it probably wouldn't bounce that high.
If anyone asks where that weird-looking egg came from...
...Iet's tell them our chicken coop is on a nuclear-waste dump.
The rest of the kids are gonna be jealous of us this Easter.
Kari, where'd you go?
Kari, l--
It's alive!
Oh, it's cute. Come here, little baby.
Kari, stay away! I'll protect you.
As usual, Tai came up with a brave plan of action.
It worked about as well as his other plans.
It's taking a bubble bath.
That was the first time any of us really connected with a Digimon.
As time went on, we learned that not all Digimon turn out to be so friendly.
Kari, stop feeding it so many candy bars.
You'll make it sick.
Hey, those are mine! Thanks a lot.
Well, now that it's here, how do we get rid of it?
We can't keep it.
Where's it gonna sleep?
Oh, no, not in my bed!
Fine, then it sleeps on the couch.
I guess we'll just have to tell Mom it's a throw pillow.
I'll get it.
Hello? Tai speaking.
This is Sora. Mimi told me you were the one who threw up in my hat.
Something's wrong with her phone.
Perfect timing.
That's weird. All the electronic stuff in the house is going nuts.
Kari, look out!
It changed. It got bigger.
What did you do? Oh, no.
Where are we gonna hide him?
What's Mom gonna say if she finds out?
It can't get any worse.
It just got worse.
You'd better pin his ears back so they don't get in the food.
Boy, he looks pretty hungry.
He had a strange way of showing his appreciation.
Cut it out! Stop kissing my sister, you!
His breath stinks!
I've had enough. He's outta here.
We don't make much of a tag team, do we?
Kids, I made your favorite: liver sticks.
Great! In a minute.
-So, do you have a name?
-Koromon.
We're in luck. She burned them.
-Tai, his name is Koromon.
-Whose name?
Koromon, what are you anyway?
I'm a Digimon, short for Digital Monster.
I'm from the Digital World.
How come you talk to him, and only whistle at me?
My name is Kari. Kari.
And this is my brother.
His name is Tai. Tai.
-Hi, Kari-Kari, Tai-Tai.
-Never mind.
He can talk.
-You two are the best friends I ever had.
-We're the only friends you've had.
Thanks for saving me from that scratching fur-ball.
Just warn me before you kiss me again.
Once a Digimon truly becomes your friend, they'll do anything for you.
Anything.
Let's have a warning for this, too.
Every time that thing changed shape, or what we now call "digivolved"...
...there was a weird electrical surge throughout the city.
Of course, there was only one way to get Tai's attention.
I'm up. What?
Koromon? What's the matter with him?
Is he sick?
You gave him your liver sticks, didn't you?
You should know that this Koromon isn't the one we befriended later on.
Look! That's gotta hurt.
When this one digivolved, he expanded more than my Uncle Fred at Thanksgiving.
Nice dinosaur. Friendly dinosaur.
Kari, get down from there!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get grounded for this.
What's going on in there?
Did you kids break another lamp?
Piggyback?
Kari, no!
Now let's play horsey.
If Mom's worried about the lamp, wait till she sees her car!
Look both ways before you cross the street.
See any cars?
Do you even know what a car is?
Just be careful, then.
Soda. I'm thirsty. Are you?
Mom usually just puts money in, but I guess that works too.
Just one each.
Where are you going?
How hard could it be to find a dinosaur?
You know, we really shouldn't be playing in the street.
-Did you see that?
-No, I was sleeping.
But you're driving!
-Can we do that ride again?
-Pepper Flame.
Tai wasn't far behind us. He was following our footprints in the diet soda.
Why are you looking at that bus?
Please don't blow it up.
I know my mom says they're always late...
...but they can't help it.
Don't be a bad boy!
I wanna go home now, okay?
Oh, boy!
And that's when we saw our second DigiEgg.
But this one was a lot bigger, and the Digimon inside it, a lot meaner.
I'd hate to see the chicken that egg came out of.
That's a big bird.
Pepper Flame!
Mimi, it's Joe.
Quick, look outside your window.
Polly want a cracker? A really big cracker?
Koromon? Kari!
-Koromon, please don't fight!
-Kari, come on, we gotta go!
-Koromon!
-Kari, it's too dangerous!
Pepper Flame!
My turn.
Sonic Destroyer!
Izzy, did you see that?
What's wrong with the phone?
-You okay?
-Who's that?
Koromon?
I'm Greymon now.
You can be whoever you want, big guy.
Nova Flame!
Cool!
Greymon!
Don't quit!
Sonic Destroyer!
Oh, no, Tai! He's hurt.
-There's nothing you can do.
-Greymon, get up!
Greymon, wake up. He's coming!
It worked on me.
Come on, Tai.
-Go for it!
-Nova Flame!
Greymon!
That night changed our lives.
It was a while before we realized that those of us...
...who saw what happened became the DigiDestined.
Greymon...
...don't you wanna play horsey with me anymore?
Where are you?
It was even longer before we found out that Willis met...
...his Digimon that same night.
He learned alone that being a DigiDestined means...
...sometimes you gotta save the world...
...even if you're the one who caused the problem.
It was another DigiDestined, Izzy, who first noticed there was trouble.
Prodigious!
A computer virus on the lnternet.
Wait a minute.
It's attacking something.
Let me see if I can get an image of its target.
Izzy wasn't the only one tracking the virus.
The whole world was watching.
But no one was prepared for what was about to happen.
Looks like a DigiEgg.
Where'd that come from?
The virus is causing the egg to develop abnormally fast.
I think it's gonna hatch.
Across town, Tai and another DigiDestined,
Sora, were facing their own problem.
"Dear Sora:
I'm sorry about what happened.
"l haven't felt so bad since I accidentally...
"...threw up in your hat and didn't tell you before you wore it.
"l know our relationship has been stormy lately.
"You love thundershowers, what's a few raindrops between friends?
"Love, Tai."
"Love." I mean, "From." I mean....
Who are you writing to, Tai?
It's just an e-mail joke.
What are you doing in here anyway, Kari?
I wanted to show you my new dress.
I'm going to a birthday party.
I got my friend a pink Power Ranger.
Tai and I had a give-and-take relationship.
I would give and he would take.
-Who cares?
-To send...
...you have to click this. Click!
I wasn't gonna send that letter.
-Then what did you write it for?
-Go to your party.
I can't believe Sora's gonna read my letter.
Wait a minute, "Unable to deliver"?
I can't believe she's not gonna read my letter.
You try to tell a girl you're sorry and your computer shuts you down.
Surprise!
Mom? Can I make a complaint?
Kari's eating birthday cake right now, and all we have is leftover tofu.
I can make you a cake, Tai.
Hand me an egg, please.
No.
I needed to use up the rest of the wheat germ anyway.
You get the door and I'll start on that cake.
Izzy, you're all sweaty. What's wrong?
Well, it's about the egg.
The egg has already hatched.
Not that egg. A DigiEgg!
My Digimon analyzer doesn't even recognize it.
Looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a contact lens.
-It's part Digimon, part virus.
-A Digimon with a virus? So?
You kidding? If it stays on the lnternet it could destroy technology as we know it.
If it just hatched, how do you know this stuff?
This kid I met on the lnternet,
Willis, from Colorado, e-mailed me.
I don't know where he gets his information.
He's smart though.
He's in elementary school...
...but he's already taking classes at Colorado State.
So what? I'm in junior high school and I take classes at junior high school.
Look! The jellyfish digivolved.
He's sending an e-mail.
It says: "I'm hungry! "
Am I supposed to call for pizza?
He's eating computer data.
When he's done in this buffet line...
...he's gonna look for a database with more food.
More food? What does he expect to find?
A grocery store?
Okay, that's one box of chocolates.
Your total comes to 1,000,125--
Yeah, that's what it says.
That must be really good chocolate.
Paper or plastic?
In supermarkets all over, computer systems are failing...
...causing congestion at the registers.
And now for the weather.
I made beef-jerky shakes.
-No, thanks, Mom.
-Where are you going?
We need to use Dad's computer.
Don't you want your shake?
-I'm glad someone appreciates my recipes.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kamiya.
-We gotta be careful with my dad's stuff.
-Get out of my way.
A Digimon is eating the lnternet and you're worried about a few books!
But my dad likes his mess where it is.
We'll have more capabilities by networking our computers together.
Why don't we just call up the Digimon on the screen and hit "Delete"?
Don't you think I've tried that?
If this is dangerous, maybe we should call someone...
-...Iike the principal or Bill Gates.
-They won't listen.
Willis warned his lnternet carrier about the new Digimon.
They said, "Great! Let's sign him up and give him 50 free hours."
-All right, we're online.
-He's digivolved again.
My name is Keramon.
-I think he's at the Rookie level.
-This soon? He's digivolving too quickly!
-He's probably at a fast food web site.
-Now what?
Nothing.
We have to watch it eat...
...the world out of house and homepage?
I wish Agumon was here to help us.
I can almost hear him now.
You can hear me now.
It's like he was here.
I am here.
Agumon, where are you?
I can barely hear you.
-Take me off speakerphone.
-It's a transmission...
...from the Digital World.
-Agumon!
-And he's with Gennai.
-It's been a long time.
-Don't forget me.
Tentomon!
Who else is there?
-Biyomon.
-Pabumon.
-Palmon.
-Patamon.
-Gomamon.
-Gatomon.
We need to talk.
Something's threatening the Internet.
We know. The Digimon's already causing major problems in our world.
-I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
-But it is dangerous.
The evil Dark Masters were cupcakes compared to this guy.
That's it, then. Let's do it!
We found a way to enter the Internet.
We'll help you guys because you're the best friends we've ever had.
What better way to express friendship than to save your world.
Tentomon.
Don't get so emotional.
Thanks a lot, guys. You won't be alone.
We'll be right here on the computer.
-lzzy, Digivice?
-I'm one step ahead of you, Tai.
Our Digivices will help you digivolve and together we'll squash that bug.
It'll take a minute for Agumon and Tentomon to get on the Net.
My modem 's older than I am.
I'll call the other DigiDestineds so their Digimon can help, too.
Hi, this is Tai Kamiya.
Can I speak to Joe, please? A test?
He's the only kid I know who volunteers for summer school.
Hi, is Matt or T.K. there?
They're visiting their grandmother in the country?
Hey, Tai. Any luck yet?
Would you like a glass of potato juice, lzzy?
Great! I'd love some.
Be there, be there.... Hello there!
This is Tai.
You're selling ties?
No, my name is Tai.
I'm looking for Matt or T.K.
That's a coincidence.
Those are my grandkids' names.
That's great. Are they there?
Right now? Can I talk to them?
I love to talk to them, too.
They're here visiting me.
Please, I need to speak to them right away.
Okay, I'll tell them. Kids!
I can't take this!
You know, lzzy, I can never get Tai to try any of my recipes.
-I think they taste great.
-Want to try my spinach cookies?
I got Mimi's machine.
Hi, it's Mimi. I'm so glad you called.
Let's get together for lunch.
Leave a very short message after the beep.
Mimi, I--
That girl loves to talk.
You're a natural in the kitchen, just like me.
Mom, I need to get a hold of Kari, right away.
Did she take your cell phone with her?
Do I have enough of this stuff?
Beats me, it's the first time
I've used flour to bake a cake.
Of course she's got it, in case of emergency.
Emergency. What does she think this is?
Happy birthday!
-Make a wish.
-Blow them out.
-Call them back.
-I can't come home.
A magician's coming over later and I volunteered to be sawed in half.
Whatever. Just tell the half with feet to run home soon.
I can't get anybody on the phone.
I want you to call Sora for me.
But you and she are good friends.
It makes more sense for you to call.
Just do it!
Are more friends coming?
I'll make three-bean salad.
Nobody's coming over, Mom.
That's all right.
I only have two beans, anyway.
Sorry, Sora's not home.
I'll tell her to call Tai's house as soon as she gets back.
Hold on, she just walked in.
I'll put her right on.
-Sora, I think Tai wants to speak to you.
-I'm not home.
I already said you're here.
Make something up.
I don't care what you tell him.
But, Sora l--
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.
Sora said she's not home.
-Did you two have an argument?
-None of your business!
You must've been a jerk if she doesn't want to talk to you.
-I didn't do anything!
-I meant that in a good way.
I can't believe she's still mad.
It all started over a hair clip.
He'd better have written me.
Greetings. You have no new mail. Okay?
No, it's not okay. Stupid Tai!
Thank you for visiting meow.com.
Miko, get down from there.
Agumon and Tentomon should be on the lnternet by now.
Does this information superhighway have a rest stop? I've got to go potty.
You should've gone before we left.
Just hold it!
You're gonna need a password.
You can use mine to get on the Internet:
Prodigious.
-Prodigious.
-They're in!
So this is what the lnternet looks like.
They need new wallpaper.
I hope this doesn't take long, it's my bath night.
There he is, go get him!
He doesn't know we're here.
Let's sneak up on him quietly.
Super Shocker!
That's quietly?
Pepper Breath!
That should have worked, but it didn't.
Keramon's sending us an e-mail. It says:
"So, you like to play games?"
I got a bad feeling about this, Agumon.
You better digivolve. Both of you. Now!
Agumon, digivolve to....
Tentomon, digivolve to....
-Greymon.
-Kabuterimon.
Bug Buster!
Electro Shocker!
Nova Blast!
You guys make this stuff look easy.
Hold that thought!
Keramon, digivolve to....
Infermon.
-No way, he's digivolved again.
-We've never seen this before.
Now he's at the Champion level, like Greymon and Kabuterimon.
-Electro Shocker!
-Nova Blast!
-Yeah!
-All right!
He's stronger than a Champion.
Spider Shooter!
Kabuterimon!
-Greymon, no!
-I think I've got it figured out now.
He's bypassed the Champion level and digivolved into the Ultimate level.
He's too strong for our Digimon now.
Then they're just gonna have to digivolve again.
Not so fast.
Greymon, digivolve to....
MetalGreymon!
He's gotta digivolve faster.
Agumon, say something!
Don't take me out, coach.
Tentomon?
I'm fine. Just one question:
Who's Tentomon?
They'll be okay, Tai.
They just need to rest for a while.
I can't believe that two Digimon at the Champion level weren't enough.
We'll never be able to defeat this thing.
Check this out. We're getting e-mails from around the world.
Here's one from Willis in America.
It says, "lzzy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Find a way to slow him down."
-What's he mean, "his fault"?
-I don't know.
Infermon is e-mailing us, too.
Why is he saying "hello" over and over again?
Look at the address.
He's at the telephone company taking over the phone lines.
If we lose our phone connection, we're finished.
That's the only way we have access to the lnternet.
I've got to warn everyone.
All circuits are busy. Try again later.
Oh, great. It's busy. Mimi!
-All circuits are busy. Try again later.
-Come on! How could that be busy too?
-All circuits are still busy.
-Don't tell me!
-Didn't you hear me? It's busy!
-I'm sorry, lady.
All the phones are dead.
-That Digimon did it.
-Not a single call can get through.
Hello, this is Tai.
Hello. Did you program me?
It's lnfermon.
Hello?
Talk about speed dialing!
Infermon was looking for someone.
He was calling every number in the world.
His long-distance bill will be enormous.
What?
"Connection terminated."
What next?
Kids, cake's almost ready.
Phones have gone dead worldwide.
If your telephone is dead, call your phone company.
At least my sister can't call me three times a day.
-See you!
-Are you leaving so soon?
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Save me a piece of cake.
What's the matter with you?
Have you heard? The phones are out.
The stock market is in chaos and people are rioting.
That's nice.
Tai says call, then he won't get off the phone.
We interrupt this programming for a special bulletin.
Goody, I bet it's one of those high-speed chases.
The phone company has set up an emergency voice-mail system.
Simply dial 171 for easy instructions.
Believe me, it wasn't so easy.
First you had to leave a message, then call back to hear one.
Basically, it was playing phone tag.
Perfect! Voice mail!
To leave a message, press 1.
To retrieve a message, press 2.
Please leave your message at the tone.
Matt, T.K., this is an emergency.
Call me right away! By the way, it's Tai.
Kari, if you want to see your toys again, get home right away!
Sora, listen, I'm sorry about the hairpin.
But I need to talk to you right away.
Call me. Or just come over.
Stupid Tai.
Mimi, it's Tai. Please come to my house as soon as you get this message. 'Bye.
That reminds me.
You got this postcard in the mail from Mimi.
What?
She's on vacation? In Hawaii?
Hawaii is paradise.
I don't have a care in the world.
I'm wishing you were here.
-Hi, lzzy. Welcome back.
-Thank you.
So, when's everybody coming over?
Cheer up already.
What happened to the days when we were a team?
We are a team, Tai, but we're just kind of spread out right now.
By the way, where did you disappear to?
-Well, I went to pick this up.
-What is it?
A satellite uplink.
We can get onto the lnternet by tapping into the military's satellite system.
You're a genius. How does it work?
Do you know what a semiconductor is?
One who works part-time on a train?
Never mind!
-ls it hooked up yet?
-Almost.
In the meantime, check the messages to see if anyone called back.
I forgot.
You have one new message.
Tai, it's Matt. What's the big emergency?
Call me back.
I gotta go.
Grandma fell asleep on T.K. again.
Good old Matt.
I knew that somebody on the team would come through.
Matt, did you and T.K. bring your Digivices with you?
Did you pack them?
This is T.K., of course we have them.
What's going on?
An evil Digimon has taken over the Internet.
Agumon and Tentomon are fighting it, but they need help.
Get your Digivices to a computer as fast as you can.
What do we do now?
The closest thing our grandmother has to a computer is an egg timer.
We're going into town to find one.
The uplink's working. We're back online.
Now let's exterminate that bug.
He left the phone company.
Now where is he?
He sent another e-mail.
"I'm close to him"? Close to who?
-He's in America.
-He doesn't even have a green card.
-I said slow down!
-I can't hear you!
The Digimon's in New York.
He's eaten all the data at Kennedy Airport and is headed for the subway system.
Good, that'll slow him down for sure.
I'll e-mail Willis and let him know that lnfermon is heading his way.
I do have one question though:
What do you think that Digimon would be like if the virus never attacked him?
I have one too:
Why are you still drinking that junk?
Just 'cause you don't eat healthy, doesn't mean that I don't.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
-We've got the Digivices.
-Now what?
Awesome! We'll tell Gennai to upload
Gabumon and Patamon onto the Net.
You can do that?
That sounds like fun.
-Usually I just play Solitaire on that thing.
-Careful, Floyd, you almost cut my ear off.
Kids today are so smart, aren't they?
I still can't set the time on my VCR.
Matt, who are all those weird people?
They're not weird. They're my best friends.
Considering this is the only computer in town.
Gennai's transfer of the Digimon is almost completed.
Can I have yours?
You're the bravest kid I have ever known.
We're going back in.
I assume lzzy and Tai were unsuccessful in finding anyone else.
Then you and I'll have to try to beat that thing by ourselves.
-Sorry we're late.
-I was surfing the Net and I wiped out.
Gabumon and Patamon!
-ls T.K. on this ride?
-He's not tall enough.
Gabumon!
Patamon!
Say hello later. We've got work to do.
Keep your legs and wings inside the ride at all times.
Just a little further, guys. Remember, he's dangerous, so stay focused.
I'm looking for the programmer.
Don't interfere!
-He's teasing us.
-Then let's get him.
It's time to digivolve.
-Gabumon, warp digivolve to....
-Agumon, warp digivolve to....
WarGreymon.
MetalGarurumon.
-All right!
-Patamon, you better digivolve.
Patamon, digivolve to....
Infermon, digivolve to....
Diaboromon.
-What's going on?
-He digivolved.
Cable Crusher!
Look out, Patamon!
I'll save him.
-Patamon, are you all right?
-Tentomon!
I'm fine. What about Patamon?
Patamon, speak to me!
Come on, get up! Say something!
-I'm coming! I'll come get you!
-You can't.
But you can.
Wipe him out!
Ice Wolf Spikes!
Web Wrecker!
Tentomon, circle around!
WarGreymon, attack!
-It's no use.
-What are you saying? We're winning.
-This could be it.
-Great.
Not that!
-What's going on?
-There's something wrong with me.
-What is it?
-I think it's your mother's recipes.
I hate to tell you I told you so, but, I told you so!
Look, something's wrong.
Oh, no, they're slowing down.
Come on!
Tai, where'd you go?
WarGreymon has practically stopped moving.
Oh, no!
-I feel a lot better.
-I didn't touch anything, I swear!
-Tai, what did you do?
-lt wasn't my fault.
Who told you to go to the bathroom at such an important time?
Like I had a choice!
Why did you crash the computer?
Now it has to reboot.
-It's not like I did it on purpose.
-Just like it wasn't your fault with Sora.
That wasn't my fault.
Okay, maybe it was my fault.
What happened?
I gave her this great hairpin for her birthday.
Then she got mad and said,
"You don't like my hair style?"
I said "Who could tell?
You always wear a hat. "
Then she said, "Now you hate my hat?"
It's very confusing.
That's what you fought about?
I tried to apologize, but she won't return my phone calls.
We're back online.
WarGreymon!
Where were you?
You two picked a lousy time to take a lunch break!
What happened to him? WarGreymon!
Tai, I can't move!
I let him down. I should have been there.
-"Your Digimon's a loser."
-What did you say?
"How could two Mega-level Digimon get beat by one lousy bug?
"WarGreymon quit like a coward."
You take that back or I'll--
I was reading an e-mail from another kid.
You didn't have to read it so well.
You two, this isn't the time for fighting.
Stupid e-mails!
Go back to the beginning.
Diaboromon's back! Another e-mail?
"Who can count backwards from ten?"
Is he giving us a math test?
What's that?
What's with the timer?
He's making copies of himself.
He's multiplying.
It gets worse! The USA just launched two nuclear missiles.
Willis says the government can't explain it...
...but he knows Diaboromon's in the Pentagon's computers.
I hope I didn't lead him there with my satellite uplink.
One of the missiles is headed for Colorado.
-They'll land in less than ten minutes.
-That explains the timer.
But what's in Colorado?
I have no idea. In the meantime,
Diaboromon keeps multiplying.
The military has the power to stop it.
Every country is trying to intercept them, including Japan.
But Diaboromon has infiltrated all their computers...
...and is rerouting them to fall in the ocean near Hawaii.
Fireworks!
I've got the trajectory for the other missile.
Let me calculate it.
Four carry the two, times three....
It's aimed right for this neighborhood.
Look, e-mails from around the world:
"Get that evil Digimon.
You're our only hope."
Here's another: "Be home by 6:00."
Wait. That's from my mom.
I'm trying to save the world and you're reading fan mail.
-We just lost our connection.
-Great!
I'll get it back. If we defeat the original
Diaboromon, the rest will disappear.
What?
All we have to do is destroy each one, until we find the original.
Sounds great. How many are there so far?
Spit it out, lzzy. How many are there?
There are over 75,000 and counting!
What's that?
It didn't sound like my stomach.
-Tai! Have faith! I'll find the original.
-WarGreymon!
I'll help you.
MetalGarurumon.
They're so slow.
It's because of all the e-mails.
They're slowing down our Digimon processing speed.
I'll write to everyone to stop them e-mailing till the Digimon are strong again.
Are you crazy? Do you know how long that'll take? There's no time.
Now we're...
...just about...
-...finished.
-lt can't end like this.
Tell me, will they make it?
I'm not sure.
But they're gonna try.
Don't give up! No matter what happens, don't give up!
Don't interfere!
How many copies of Diaboromon are there now?
To be honest, I don't know.
I stopped keeping track a while ago.
It's got to be well over a million.
MetalGarurumon!
WarGreymon has started to slow down again.
It's the e-mails.
They're coming in faster than ever.
They're slowing down the processing speed even more.
They're sitting ducks out there.
Please, guys, stop writing!
I know your intentions are good, but you're hurting our cause.
Your e-mails are putting our Digimon in danger.
I've got to help.
There must be a way....
Somehow.
More juice, lzzy?
I just squeezed some onions.
No, thanks, I'm rerouting incoming data from the remote server into local memory.
I'll just leave you two alone.
Wait a minute, where did Tai go?
None of us are sure how, but Tai's bond with WarGreymon was so strong...
... Tai, himself, became digital.
WarGreymon, I'm here.
MetalGarurumon!
Wake up! Don't quit now!
-Why won't he answer me, Tai?
-Keep trying, Matt.
Listen, I don't have a whistle to wake you.
But I want you to know you're not alone.
The mail keeps coming. It won't stop.
Kids from all over the world are writing to you.
They need your help.
You're the only one who can do it.
Feel their hope. Feel their strength.
I feel them.
Where'd your brother go?
They combined.
Part WarGreymon.
Part MetalGarurumon.
They digivolved together to become....
Omnimon.
Transcendent Sword!
Hurry!
Supreme Cannon!
Tai, there's the original. Get him!
We're running out of time!
Omnimon! Quick, attack!
Where is he?
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
Squad leader to Command, we were unable to destroy the target.
The missile will impact.
Repeat: The missile will impact.
He keeps moving.
Every time he's in our sights, he jumps somewhere else.
He's too fast for us.
We have the power to destroy him now, but we don't have the time.
Willis was right, we have to find some way to slow down Diaboromon.
Thirty seconds left.
The e-mails!
If I forward him all the e-mails, it'll slow him down, just like it did to us.
Keep sending them, kids.
You've got mail.
Ten seconds left.
Nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
...five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Connection terminated.
Willis!
Lousy microwave!
How come every electronic appliance has to have a bug in it?
Greetings.
You have one new piece of mail.
It's about time.
"Dear Sora: I'm sorry.... Threw up hat....
"What's a few raindrops between friends?
Love, Tai."
Stupid Tai!
I'm about to barf.
Wait till you try the cake.
When Willis saw what happened on the Internet...
...he was as happy as the rest of us.
So were the twins,
Terriermon and Kokomon.
They figured that would be the end of it.
But they were wrong.
It was just the beginning.
Kokomon!
Willis was about to face the Digibattle of his life.
But he was all alone.
These days the team is older, but some things never change.
Tai's still obsessed with soccer, and Sora 's still waiting for him to call.
Izzy's idea of a fun night is upgrading his computer...
...and Matt's trying to make it as a rock star.
His stage name is: "The DigiDestined formerly known as Matt. "
Even though the older kids don't have much time for the DigiWorld...
...there are new DigiDestined kids to pick up the slack.
That's Cody, a real sensitive little kid, and that's his Digimon: Upamon.
Yolei and Poromon can match wits with the best of them...
...as well as tan lines.
And there's Davis and DemiVeemon.
I know, Davis looks like my brother Tai.
They even have the same personality: obnoxious.
While they were having a good time at the beach...
...I was in New York with T.K...
...partly to visit Mimi and partly to make Davis jealous.
Smile!
Not again.
-lt didn't go through?
-No.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. It says all lines are busy.
There must be an electrical surge.
What do you think we should do now, T.K.?
How about lunch?
Did you guys hear that?
Did we hear what?
I'm getting a feeling there's something strange out there...
...but I'm not sure what it is.
It needs our help though.
I hate it when I'm right.
It turned out that the person who needed our help was Willis.
Kokomon, this has to stop!
Go back!
What do you mean "back"? Back to what?
Destroy!
No!
Terriermon!
Bunny Blast!
Koko Krusher!
Bunny Blast!
Terriermon!
Hurry, T.K. It's over this way.
Kokomon, stop!
A Digimon!
I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
All right, tell me, what do you want?
Go back.
He vanished.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Don't follow me! You're in danger!
Leave it to me.
I'll find out where he's going.
-What does he mean, "we're in danger"?
-All I know is he needs help.
Hi, Mom. Our summer camp is going backpacking in Colorado.
-We're leaving--
-Please deposit $2 for....
I'll call you when I get there.
Come on, Terriermon.
We have to find transportation.
I can't keep running from him.
We're going back.
Colorado? Why there?
I'm sending an e-mail to Davis and the others.
I told him to meet up with us.
We could really use their help, and I'm sure he misses me.
The D-Terminal!
"Found new kid with Digimon"?
Yeah, a new friend.
She wants us to meet them in Colorado.
Well, how does she expect us to get to America?
We don't have the money.
Willis, do we have to go to Colorado?
You heard what Kokomon said.
"Go back." That's where it all started.
But why do we have to walk?
My soles are worn out and I don't even wear shoes.
Terriermon, listen. We--
Come on, Willis, can't we just call for someone to give us a ride?
I'm sorry. You know
Kokomon's getting more violent.
He makes anyone close to us disappear.
I'll find us a ride.
-Let's get out of this sun. It's too hot.
-Wait!
What exactly do you think you're doing?
This way I don't have to walk, and you can stay in the shade.
That's better.
I don't suppose you could turn into a glass of lemonade, could you?
Look, my Digivice.
What's happening to the train?
I don't think this is the entertainment portion of the trip.
It's that Digimon we saw in New York.
Don't interfere!
There's definitely something different about this Digimon.
We're not moving. Where are we?
Don't interfere?
I don't think that Digimon wants us in Colorado.
Explain one more time why we have to stop in three different cities?
We're using my uncle's flyer miles and restrictions apply.
Why did we have to take this particular taxi company?
I've an uncle who lives in Houston.
He has an account with them.
-It's not really that bad.
-At least it's free.
What do you say, guys, wanna hear some music?
Sure, why not?
We prefer something on the slow and easy side.
Sure.
I'm pretty good.
'Bye, Uncle Fred.
Thanks for the lift. Goodbye.
Yolei, your uncle's a lousy pilot.
On the map, we're abut 60 miles from where we're meeting Kari.
-How do we get there?
-I have an uncle who owns some horses.
No! No more uncles, no more horses, no trains, no planes.
It's got to stop!
Did someone say stop?
Come on, guys, this is our chance.
Well, at least my way we weren't stowaways.
-Climb in. It's perfect.
-Let me handle this.
Yeah, ma'am, I said stop. I'm starting my own truck stop and was testing it.
It seems to work fine.
You stopped. Thanks.
-Let's go.
-Come on.
Hey, pal, you must've had the same idea we did.
Hey, would you cut that out? That's rude.
Sorry about that. He's young.
Davis, guess what? He's a Digimon.
A what?
Hey, he's right.
Wow! In America, they have Digimon by the truck load.
Our Digimon like each other.
And the guy says,
"l was talking to the duck."
This is kind of nice, being around others for a change.
Yeah, for as long as I can remember, it's just been me and Willis.
Having a Digimon makes you a DigiDestined...
...and we're all part of a team.
Why are you alone?
Well, let's just say I have my reasons.
Anyway, it's nice meeting someone as cute as you.
Back off there, blondie.
What's wrong, Davis?
Did I say something wrong?
We found this kid. Now what do we do?
He's angry because he wanted to be with Kari by now.
My family's vacation home is just a couple of towns away from here.
You guys can wait for them there if you want to.
I'd better e-mail Kari and T.K. to tell them where to meet us.
-Where are they coming from?
-From New York.
The kids behind the fence.
That girl was cute, too.
That's it, lover-boy. Leave Kari out of this.
I'm sorry.
Listen, Davis,
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.
Maybe I should just make a phone call and get us a lift to my house.
I'd like a pizza for delivery with mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni...
...pineapple, Canadian bacon, anchovies, and green peppers.
That sounds delicious, but aren't you going to have anything?
If Davis eats it all....
-There's no fat below my neck.
-Since you're delivering that pizza...
...to my house, would you mind picking us up on the way?
-Tell him to forget it. I want Chinese.
-Shut up!
I said, "Line up."
We'll line up on the side of the road with a sign, so we're easy to spot.
-You've done this before.
-They'll be here in two minutes or it's free.
-Willis, you're smart.
-Well, it was mostly my idea.
Great, then you're buying the pizza!
-Pizza!
-Guys, come on, let's go!
-Why do I have to be the one paying for it?
-It's your pie. You buy.
Don't open your big mouth unless it's to eat pizza.
If I'm paying for it, I get the first half.
And I get the second half, too.
Now that that's settled,
I guess we're ready to go.
We'll tell you how the pizza tasted.
If that driver thinks he's getting a tip, forget it!
What is it?
Davis!
Destroy!
Kokomon.
You know this Digimon?
DemiVeemon, quick, digivolve!
DemiVeemon, digivolve to....
Veemon!
Vee Head Butt!
How about a little teamwork?
Pick me up. We'll attack him from the air.
All right, we've got you!
Watch out for that sign.
Time for plan B.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Flamedramon, attack!
Fire Rocket!
One small detail.
Who is that? And why is he attacking us?
Cable Crusher!
Koko Krusher!
Kokomon, I'm doing what you want.
I'm going back.
Go back...
...to the beginning!
Willis, use your Digivice.
I feel strange.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
He's got pants now.
Bunny Bubble!
Gargo Pellets!
Go back.
-What for?
-Go back.
He put up a good fight, but we won.
We didn't win anything.
He won't stop until I give him what he wants.
What does he want? Maybe I can help.
Don't ask questions.
It's for your own good.
-The less you know the better.
-Willis, wait.
We're a team now.
It's okay to tell them the truth.
Well, the truth is, we don't have a ride anymore.
No problem. I can handle that.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Raidramon! The Storm of Friendship!
-Did somebody call for a ride?
-That's cool.
Couldn't you have done that before?
Can we get a ride, too?
Sorry, we're on a mission.
-It's a big gust of wind.
-No, it's Davis.
Same difference.
How do you stop this thing?
So, this Kokomon attacked you?
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
Where are your friends T.K. and Kari?
They're still not here yet.
What? What do you mean,
Kari's not here yet?
Good question.
They really should have been here by now.
If I know Kokomon, your friends aren't coming at all.
That's it, pal.
Enough secrets.
You seem to know a lot about this monster.
Spill it. How do you two know each other?
And more importantly:
Why is he only attacking you?
Because I created him.
You must be kidding.
You just can't create a Digimon out of thin air.
I've told you too much already.
Kokomon makes everyone who tries to help me disappear...
...Iike I'll bet he did to your friends T.K. and Kari.
Willis.
I have to do this by myself.
I need to be alone.
Great, I'll go with you.
Willis, we've been walking for hours and you haven't said a word.
Being a DigiDestined means you don't have to face things alone.
What are you running away from?
Eight years ago, a DigiEgg came out of my computer...
...and it hatched into twin Digimon:
Terriermon and Kokomon.
I finally had someone to play with.
My very own pets, and they talked, too!
It was the best.
They depended on me.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Sometimes they would even do my chores for me.
I wanted more of them...
...so I got the stupid idea of creating a DigiEgg on the computer.
That's when it all went bad.
Before my DigiEgg hatched, it was attacked by a virus...
...and it mutated into Diaboromon.
When Tai and the others destroyed him,
I thought my bad dream was over.
But the real nightmare was just beginning.
The virus tracked us down and dragged Kokomon away from me.
I watched helplessly for four years as he slowly became this terrible monster.
And now he's obsessed with chasing me.
During the battle he said to you,
"Go back to the beginning."
What did he mean?
I think he wanted me to come here where it all started.
Every time he tries to tell me why, the virus stops him.
He can't fight it.
This won't end until he's destroyed.
But I can't do it. It's all my fault, not his.
What's the matter with you?
That's the saddest story I ever heard.
I'm the one with the problem, not you.
-Get over it.
-Okay.
That was fast.
You know what? We're gonna help you.
You will? How are you gonna do that?
My friend, we're DigiDestined.
We'll find the answer together, as a team.
I've never been on a team.
Anything I should know?
Yeah, I'm the only one who can kiss Kari.
-Just a little one?
-Don't even joke around about this, got it?
-She and I really hit it off in New York.
-I'm not kidding.
Willis?
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I've got really big ears.
I know you're facing Kokomon tomorrow.
I want to be right there next to you.
I couldn't live with myself if something were to happen to you.
This is my mistake and I won't risk your safety to correct it.
-He's my brother.
-I don't care!
Willis, I'm not your pet. I'm your friend.
And friends are always there for each other.
Now that's what I'm talking about: teamwork.
Thanks, pal.
Okay, let's find Kokomon.
Don't worry. He'll find us.
Go back!
I did! I'm here! What else do you want?
Destroy!
He has a lot of issues.
He's digivolving.
Terriermon, be careful. He's stronger now.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
Veemon, your turn.
Show him what you're made of!
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Armadillomon, you too!
Armadillomon, armor digivolve to....
Digmon, the Drill of Power!
Hawkmon, go for it!
Hawkmon, armor digivolve to....
Halsemon, the Wings of Love!
Fire Rocket!
That's the way!
I'll trip him up. Almost tripped myself.
Gargo Pellets!
Don't make me do this.
How do you like your Kokomon, flame-broiled or grilled?
Can't we end this quickly?
After all, I'm on vacation.
Howdy.
Aren't our Digimon fantastic?
Digmon could be a little more animated.
I guess that's it.
I don't think he's gone.
Now what?
I'm not a duck.
I need a nap.
I think I strained something trying to digivolve.
We're being sucked in.
This is my fault.
Why? Are you the one who taught him to juggle?
Put us down, you clown!
-Leave them alone! Take me instead.
-Okay.
Watch out!
What do we have to do to end this fighting?
Destroy!
Bunny Blast!
A little help here.
Veemon!
Let me help you up.
Now let me help you up.
-Hawkmon, I'll help you.
-No need. I'm--
Oh, Hawkmon, I'm so glad you're not hurt.
Yes, I know, but you don't have to choke me to prove it.
Armadillomon!
Cody, I've been digging all over for you.
Vee Head Butt!
Bunny Blast!
Bombs away!
-We got him!
-Think again.
He's gonna eat us.
Hand of Fate!
Angemon!
And Angewomon!
You saved us! Exquisite timing.
Sorry we're late.
-Hey, look, T.K.
-Kari!
We would've been here sooner, but our plans got derailed.
Yeah! Kari, you made it!
Gatomon and Patamon were worried.
So they digivolved into Angewomon and Angemon.
Celestial Arrow!
Angel Staff!
Either this is an eclipse, or we're in trouble.
-I'm not supposed to be out after dark.
-It's cold.
Look, his wounds are healing.
It's got to be that virus inside of him.
Poromon, there's nothing you can do.
Stay here.
Let me go!
Davis, what's happening to you?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, you big bully?
Kokomon is making time go backwards.
Everyone's getting younger.
Davis, you're a baby.
Who are you calling a baby, you baby?
I'm a baby, look!
"Back to the beginning"?
Willis, "Back to the beginning" didn't mean go back to Colorado.
It means, go back in time to when the virus first attacked Kokomon.
-That's it.
-We have to stop him.
Before you know it, we'll be changing diapers.
Let me go!
I'm sorry but you're grounded.
We don't have the strength to defeat him.
The new Digimon will have to use the power of the golden DigiEggs.
We must digivolve to our Mega forms to release the golden DigiEggs.
Angemon, warp digivolve to....
Seraphymon!
Angewomon, digivolve to....
Magnadramon!
Aren't they beautiful?
Hurry, here he comes.
We released the golden DigiEggs.
Now the others can golden armor digivolve.
This is our last shot.
-What do I do with this?
-Just do exactly what I do.
You ready?
Golden armor energize!
Golden armor energize!
Veemon, golden armor digivolve to....
Terriermon, golden armor digivolve to....
Magnamon!
Rapidmon!
Is that the coolest thing you've ever seen, or what?
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
-lt didn't work.
-He's too strong.
Every time we attack, he regenerates.
Let's blast him from the inside.
Good idea. Follow me!
He ate them. Terriermon!
Listen to me, Poromon.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Time to heal.
What's that up ahead?
I don't know. Look!
What's he doing?
He's trying to tell us something.
-What's he pointing to?
-There must be something inside of him.
The virus!
He's trying to show us how to help him.
What does he want us to do?
Destroy!
Destroy the virus!
Right. Time to heal.
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
Kokomon!
Willis!
The virus, it's all gone.
Thank you.
Now I've lost both of them.
You'll never lose me, Willis.
I told you, I'm your friend.
Friends are always there for each other.
Terriermon!
I guess without the virus,
Kokomon couldn't heal himself anymore.
The battle was too much for him.
Don't be sad, Willis.
One thing you have to learn about Digimon, they never really die.
Thanks for coming back to New York with me. I'm gonna miss you guys.
-I think we'll see each other again.
-I sure hope so.
We're getting used to being part of a team.
Right, Terriermon?
Yeah.
One last thing. 'Bye.
Hey, what did I tell you about kissing Kari?
She's my girl.
What do you mean "your" girl?
Nothing, just guy talk.
Hi, Mom, I'm on the island.
I'm waiting for the ferry and I'll be home.
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. It was a great trip.
I met a lot of new friends.
I had a couple of fights, but I'll tell you later.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Does anyone besides me smell a DigiEgg?
Kokomon!
Like I said, Willis learned about teamwork the hard way.
He also found out that Davis was right.
Digimon never really die.
Their information just gets reconfigured.
Only sometimes they come back singing a different tune.
He's tone-deaf.
We have seen a star in the east.
It told us the Son of God is born.
Nativity Play/Sermon/Dinner
The Lord Jesus was laid in a manger...
...to bring salvation to the souls of those...
...with no place of their own.
Nothing is harder than to have no place...
...but many are those without one.
Tell me about it!
In their solitude, they long for someone who will say:
"I want you to be here."
Not me, thanks.
Be quiet!
Jesus was born to offer those alone a place in which to be alive!
"Joy to the world, the food has come."
Gin! It's "the Lord has come"!
You don't know much, do you?
More than some faggot.
I am a mistake made by God.
In my heart, I am a woman.
Women can have children.
What if a miracle like the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...
...was to happen to a homo?
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I'm eating for two.
Serves you right!
Miyuki!
Time to eat!
Miyuki!
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.
I am a woman.
And it's a waste to spill food like that.
Don't just gobble your bread.
Eat it with love for the people who made and brought it here.
I hate that Bible-thumping.
You're just like Akiko.
Who's Akiko?
My old lady.
Well!
Don't call your mother that.
Eat shit, you old fart.
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!
That hurts! You old...
..."bag lady."
You peep pretty loud for a chick that can't even find its own worms.
Should a burden on society like you be talking?
You're a burden on us.
What does that make you?
The kettle the pot's calling black!
You mouthy brat!
Can't you at least get along at Christmas?
Oh, yes...
Miyuki, I got you a present.
They're gone!
A whole set of
"World Literature for Children."
Why would I need that?!
Hana looked hard for those!
Even a homeless teenage runaway needs a Christmas present!
I choose not to go home.
Six months on the street means you don't have a home.
I can go home any time I want to.
It's the ones who say that who never do.
Speak for yourself, you old geezer!
What are you doing to Dostoevsky?!
I won't take that, today of all days!
Not even my father ever hit me!
So I'll do it for him!
Grow up, will you?!
Don't hurt yourselves.
Show more respect, kid!
I'm not a kid!
With little tits like these?
You filthy old pervert!
That's harassment!
Will you two stop!
Huh?
It's been...
...abandoned.
There, there, there.
Care for this child.
What a world!
Oh, man!
Oh, my! You're a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.
"John Doe."
She's a girl, I said!
He's so rude!
How old was I when I started living like this? Thirty-something?
I still thought that I was better off...
...than a child with no home.
There, there, now! We'll take you somewhere warm.
The cop shop's that way!
This is a Christmas present from God!
She's our baby!
Huh?

Sorry!
What do you mean, take her with us?
I'm just doing God's will.
Her parents might come back.
What parent would leave a child out in this cold?!
That's a devil, not a parent!
Kiyoko wanted us to find her.
"Kiyoko"?
"Kiyoko"? Why "Kiyoko"?!
From kiyo, "pure", on this purest of nights.
How tacky!
Kiyoko's a fine name!
Did you have a girlfriend named that?
Idiot!
Look, we can't just name her!
She's not a puppy or a kitten!
So I'm taking her home.
To a cardboard box?
There's no room!
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!

Peek-a-boo!
Oh, dear! Tell me what's wrong!
Shut up!
Hey!
I know, I know, he's not your mommy.
He's just a homeless homo.
Don't say that in front of her!
A baby crying around here will sound weird!
We're going to take you to the police soon, okay?
You're not going anywhere, are you?
Idiot! We're taking her to the police!
Don't shout or she'll never shut up!
Why won't you stop crying?
Are you hungry?
There, there!
Maybe she's sick.
Tomorrow...
I promise I'll take her then.
Christmas should be the happiest day of the year.
If we take her in now, it'll always be the worst day of her life!
Maybe...
...she needs a diaper.
Hana, boil some water.
I'll make some milk.
Hey! Whose side are you on?!
Go buy some water!
My angel isn't drinking from the tap!
Why me?
Where does a bum get off telling me
"Them that works eats"?
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.
So "no man is an island" after all, huh?
You're buying water?!
A Christmas miracle.
What a haul!
Watch where you're going, brat!
You watch where you're going!
I was married once.
With a child?
No, don't tell me!
I don't want to hear this!
You never forget for one second.
A child's the only thing you hold dearer than life itself.
A boy?
No.
Bullshit!
Come on! Give it back!
Hey, you're the girl who hangs out with Gin.
Get out of here, will you?
We don't want Gin after us.
Why not?
You're the light of his life, that's why not!
There's not much light in a cardboard box.
Let me have this book.
How old?
Twenty-one, I think.
Five or six years older than Miyuki, I guess.
That old?
If she was alive.
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant, and we got married.
I was in heaven.
You could have poked me in the eye and I'd have just smiled at you.
But my daughter got sick, and the medical bills were huge.
I was something of a bicycle racer then.
I needed money.
There was this race...
You threw it?
A punk I knew had this scheme.
They found out, I got kicked out of racing, and my girl died.
I just didn't feel like working anymore.
And then my wife followed my daughter.
Oh, no!
That's how you get to be a man like me.
I didn't want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!
It's freezing!
You're used to this.
Kind of.
I'll give her the milk.
Dreams do come true.
I always dreamed of being the mother of a little girl.
A nice, warm house, a pretty daughter.
Even if my husband was no good...
...I would accept dire poverty as long as I had my child.
Feed the poor kid!
You're so pretty.
The prettiest little girl in the world.
What do you want?!
They're gone.
Santa Claus, maybe?
"Uncle Bag" and the baby are gone.
What's that faggot thinking about?!
Man, he's got big feet!
You can't have feet fixed.
Are you taking her back?
There's probably an APB out on her.
And for you.
I doubt it.
An arrest warrant, maybe.
Her parents are probably sorry about this now.
So let's take her to the police.
A baby's always better off with its real mother.
Not necessarily.
Sometimes a foster mother's better.
- What?!
- Don't be stupid.
I never knew my real mother.
But I'll bet if she saw me now, she'd flip.
How can someone homeless raise a child?
I know, I know!
I don't want her shunted from one foster home to another...
...without even one memory...
...of ever having been loved.
You don't have to be a foundling to feel that.
They must have had reasons.
Nothing should make you abandon a child!
That means you've taken love and tossed it away, like trash.
Yeah, but what can we do about it?
Find her mother.
And ask why she abandoned her baby.
If she can make me understand...
...I'll forgive her, and my mother too.
Find her?
How?
We'll have to pay again.
This is an expensive year-end!
What if we find another baby?
They don't toss them out in twos.
Another key!
Look at these panties.
You'd catch cold in them!
Are they the ones?
Are these your folks?
Look, business cards.
A hostess club won't be open at this hour!
We've got some walking to do.
You've gotta be kidding!
He was eating for two!
But why pack like you're off on a trip and then abandon a baby?
Maybe it was one last trip they were taking.
A family suicide?!
Then what do we do?
We can't search the next world!
Shh!
We apologize for any inconvenience.
Trains will be delayed due to heavy snowfall.
It's so hot in here!
What a stink!
Have you bathed lately?
No. Or washed my clothes.
How embarrassing!
Oh, dear! There, there.
Did she piss herself?
That's why it stinks!
It's you that stinks!
Quiet!
Shut that kid up!
Watch it!
Hey!
Miyuki!
What's she up to?
We wasted our train fares!
It was me who paid them.
I'm sorry!
There's no more milk.
Go ahead, blame it all on me.
Oh, cheer up!
Let's sing a song.
What's that?
The Sound of Music, of course.
Never heard of it.
That's going to make you even hungrier.
I'm starving!
I told you!
Look after my little angel.
Go on without me.
Just say you'll never forget the queer you once knew.
Look.
A cemetery.
I'm not dead yet!
Now I'm alive again!
But there's nothing for a baby in these offerings to the dead!
We'll get by!
Yeah, sure! "We'll get by!"
People keep on saying that till they end up living like us!
And while we keep on saying it, the kid'll end up under a stone here.
"Kiyoko"! She has a name!
Yeah, whatever. And she's cute.
She's so pretty.
But listen to me. I'm serious.
You listening?
If you really care about that kid...
...you'll find her someone to take care of her.
I speak from experience.
That's what her parents said, I bet.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't abandon a kid.
Don't be stupid!
No. Your family abandoned you!
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...
...while some dumb faggot pisses on me?
What are we doing here?
Tell me.
Wracking our brains!
We're scavenging offerings left in a cemetery.
And why? Because we're homeless.
- Stop it!
- No! I'm not going to stop.
We are three good-for-nothing bums...
...who can't even look after ourselves.
Shut up! I'm thinking!
I won't shut up.
You can't get milk from an old queer's tits, no matter how hard you think.
Come on, Hana! You know we can't do this.
Speak for yourself!
This way the whole family will be dead.
Oh, my!
You're so lucky, Kiyoko!
God must really love you!
Then why was she...
...dumped?
Left!
- That's a dead end!
- It's right!
- Tails.
- Heads.
What's this guy doing parking like that?
Doesn't he know what a "public thoroughfare" is?
How did that happen?
Bad luck. The car got stuck, and I forgot the parking brake.
Then someone shouted,
"Dorothy, wait!"...
...and then I heard, "Whoops!"...
...and the damn car rolled on top of me.
I don't bring my men with me when I'm visiting the old man's grave.
I owe you. Call me if you're ever in trouble.
Oh, no, we never have any trouble.
You're from Kinshicho?
We were just going there.
I know it's rude to ask...
If it's rude, then don't ask.
Come on.
Would you know this establishment?
Club Swirl: "Midori"
Know it?
Its owner's marrying my daughter today.
He's one of my men, but he's too cocky.
I was against it.
But your daughter chose him.
The daughter I brought up, married to a man like that...
Know what I mean?
But if your daughter's happy with him...
...isn't that the main thing?
You're right!
I went to the old man's grave so I wouldn't cry at the wedding.
Watch the road!
Good evening, sir!
Make yourselves at home.
Daddy, you're late!
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.
I owe them my life.
My daughter, Kiyoko.
Oh. Hello.
What have you gotten us into?!
Just shut up and eat!
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.
Don't you think Kiyoko has amazing luck?
Yeah.
Maybe she does.
Oh, yeah. Her name's Sachiko.
Not "Midori"?
Just at the club.
She's Sachiko, "happy child," though she didn't look it.
But some plastic surgery turned her into a good little earner.
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.
Do you know where she is?
I doubt you'll wring any money out of her.
No, I have something to give her.
I'm sorry
I spilled your food.
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.
She said her husband was in debt.
What's wrong with you?
That bastard.
Do you know him?
Then she borrowed more money from us...
...and ended up screwed both ways.
You know where she is?
If it weren't for his damn get-rich-quick scheme...
If it weren't for his damn get-rich-quick scheme...
...l'd still be with my wife and kid!
But aren't they both dead?
I'll kill the bastard!
You'll get killed!
Mitsuo! Mitsuo!
It was that maid!
Are you okay?!
She's got a gun!
Hey, what?!
Kiyoko! Miyuki!
Hey!
Thank you very much.
She's got a gun, you know!
- Our lives are already wasted!
- Hana!
There!
Yes! One of your cabs picked up a young woman with a baby.
Number 12-25. Send it to...
...the Tokyo Tower.
My name is
Hey! Wait a minute.
We're homeless bums, not action-movie heroes.
What we need now is the police.
If you like the police so much, get them to adopt you!
Those children are like family!
I thought I could depend on you!
Don't talk like you were my damn wife.
I'm not going anywhere.
Gin!
We've done all we could.
You're giving up?
There's nothing we can do.
You are really the lowest of the low!
The best thing you'll ever do is die in the gutter!
Oh, poor you! You'll be dead and no one'll care!
All you ever do is cause people trouble!
Dead or alive, you're living trash!
The king of trash!
Okay, so I'm trash.
But you're ugly.
- Yes?
- I want to get rid of some trash.
I don't think I'd fit.
Yeah, that's what I am, living trash!
Who cares if you die in the gutter?
You're dead all the same.
You okay?
Hang in there, Gramps.
- May I make one last request?
- What?
Give me a drink of that.
You're not selling me into slavery!
Somebody, help!
I always wanted to die drunk, in a nice old house.
Now I'm halfway there.
Fate works in strange ways.
L've lived a long time...
...but I'm just trash, as worthless dead as alive.
Don't talk like that!
You remind me of myself when I was younger.
Looking at you now...
...may I make a last request?
Get rid of this for me.
Some people will be hurt if it's known who I am.
Okay. I understand.
No one will ever know.
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?
Request?
And now, goodbye.
That's it!
Thanks, Gramps!
Time for the New Year's clean-up!
Big breasts... Cool!
Husband?
Father
Police.
Your dad's a cop?!
My father was a policeman!
Father, policeman?
Except I'm the one he's going to be arresting.
Hold it.
Hi! How've you been?
Now? Just cleaning up.
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
No! Not that!
Time to die, old man!
Kiyo's coming? I'm there!
The girls are drinking near here.
Yeah?
All cleaned up.
Give it back!
Give me that back!
Her foreigner husband looked like he was in a real bad mood.
Did he hit her?
No, she was being real nice for a girl so young.
My wife could learn something!
His foreign assailant fled, taking a young woman and a baby hostage.
With the groom in serious condition, police speculate this may be a war...
...between crime syndicates.
Hey, this is serious!
I'm not kidding around, either!
My mom's religious.
She chants all the time.
Me.
Isn't she cute?
I found her. Those spots on her back look like wings.
So I called her "Angel."
But she's gone.
Father.
I stabbed my father.
I can never go back.
The baby? A gift from God.
Yes.
Give me a break!
L've got a family at home!
Those children are my family!
They went in there.
Hey! The fare!
I'll be right back.
Miyuki! Kiyoko!
Miyuki! Kiyoko!
Where are you?
Kiyoko! Miyuki!
How could you do this to me?!
It's your own fault!
You never listen to anything I say!
Use the scarf I made you...
...to mop up the blood!
What have you done with Angel?!
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?
She's right here.
Our angel.
I'm hungry.
Make me some food.
Why?
What are you doing in my house?
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I'll get dinner.
Kiyoko! Miyuki!
Uncle Bag?!
Oh, I've missed you, my little angel!
I wish I was her mother, but I'm just another homo.
Miyuki...
...I'm so glad you're safe.
Where's the geezer?
He could be dead for all I care!
I'm dying.
Maybe he went home.
Who cares?
All he thinks about is himself.
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you're in love with him, aren't you?
Don't be silly! I like my men to be more "manly."
The kind of man I like is slender, middle-aged, tanned...
...with a divine square-back haircut and a lower-town accent...
...who says, "Ah, what the hell"...
...when I don't quite have the cab fare.
So, what now, Miss Hana?
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.
It's hard to say.
I'm glad.
He just died there?
He was homeless.
I might be next.
Just do your job.
Gin!
Gin! Gin!
Take it easy.
Gin!
Calm down!
Where is that man of mine?!
Kiyo...
If only tonight...
...I wanted to see you before I died.
Kiyoko!
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?
- An ambulance.
- Well! Aren't you rude!
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can't sleep out on the street!
The geezer's not here, we're freezing, sleepy, hungry.
This sucks!
I guess there's no choice.
I never thought
I'd be here again.
I'm sorry. We're closed for a private party tonight
Hana?!
I know I have no right to come strolling in now...
...but there's no one else
I can call on, "Mother"!
Hana!
Mother!
Hana!
Geezer?!
What happened, Gin?!
Some kids beat me up.
I guess I'm just not an action hero.
He said he knew you.
But he said he was homeless, you know.
So am I.
What? But why?!
Since Ken died I'm like a canary...
...that's forgotten its song.
You sing all the time!
Isn't she cute?!
I wish I could have one!
So Ken died, did he?
AIDS?
He slipped on the soap.
Well, death is always a hair's breadth away.
But if you were in trouble, why didn't you come back?
We certainly had fun here, didn't we?
In this old bar
I've had so much to drink
My old memories
All start to blur
My lover
Has left me
People call me notorious
Aw, you're ugly!
Good for nothing
Get off!
Good for nothing
What a terrible thing to say
Eat shit, you old fart!
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!
I couldn't come back after I'd done that.
A little bit of money took care of that.
I'm just happy you're all right.
Stop it! You scare me when you start crying.
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?
Well...
Where is your mother, anyway?
Abandoned?!
Yes! L've been abandoned!
Them's the breaks, I guess.
I could see me in her.
Born on the street, and back there again.
That's why I want to find her a home full of love!
All I ever wanted was love!
Ow!
What the hell?!
The geezer's come out.
Where are my clothes?!
Way to go, Gin!
Come back any time.
Thank you, Mother.
My mother's white breath / as she watches me set out / on a long journey.
Oh, man!
An empty building's always nice, but look who got here first.
L'd just love to fill up on some meat!
Don't you dare!
Just kidding!
The snow's let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?
Okay.
Get me some sake.
Just one.
- No!
- I wish.
"Honey, I'm home."
You stayed in there?
You'd think you were homeless!
Actually, we're looking for these people.
Sachiko Nishizawa.
Do you know her?
She never paid me back for her
Neighborhood Association dues.
Are you a relative?
No! We're acquaintances of a relative.
Her husband was no better.
Gambling day and night, and mean when he drank.
Living on his wife's earnings and borrowed money.
Where are they now?
I wouldn't know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.
They left about three months ago.
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.
They were a nice couple at first...
...but it wasn't long before they started fighting.
That's poverty for you.
All that debt didn't stop him from lording it over her.
Even the most dedicated wife has her limits.
You'd see bruises sometimes.
The poor woman.
Not on her, on him!
Oh, dear!
But his mother would always take his side against her.
His parents built them this house.
Where do they live?
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.
Her mother-in-law was always complaining...
...that she never did any housework.
But her son was perfect, of course.
Of course!
That's why I told her...
...she'd never see a grandchild with his wife working in a club.
But she did get pregnant.
Well, a man and a woman...
They can always find time...
...to do what they must!
Shinkocho 1-2-25
Maison Happiness Apt. 203
What if they ran out from this new place too?
What a horrible man!
Poor Sachiko! Working to pay off her husband's gambling debts!
Right!
But I never thought of abandoning the kid!
- Huh?
- Nothing.
That's no reason to just dump the kid!
L've said that all along.
Miyuki: Angel has come home. Dad.
Doesn't it ever get tired of snowing?
Thank you.
I wonder how we look to them.
Like a bum, a homo, a runaway and a foundling.
Kiyoko is God's messenger.
We're her servants.
Unpaid servants.
Paying for a father's sins.
Yeah, if her father had been any good at all...
...we wouldn't be going through all this.
Even a good-for-nothing father never forgets a child.
I'm going out.
What's the matter with her?
A child never forgets its parents.
I never stop wanting...
...to see my daughter, just once.
So she's alive?
Yeah.
And your wife?
I'm sure she's remarried...
...and living happily.
"Hello.
It's me, Miyuki."
Why did you split up?
- Drinking and gambling.
- What?!
Just like...
I'm a louse.
But I've always wanted to do something for her as a father...
...even just a little.
When I was gambling this would have been nothing.
Now I've had to sweat blood just to save 30,000 yen.
That's great, Gin!
We can stuff ourselves!
Stuff you!
Ishida speaking.
Miyuki? Is that you?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Excuse me, but if you wouldn't mind...
"Get out", you mean?
Other customers might like to sit down.
There's hardly anyone here!
You guys stink!
What are you?
Homeless or something?
Does trash have kids too?
Just like real people?
Who are you looking at?
Hold it, you!
Sir! No!
Hold it, I said, you low-life!
It's New Year's Sale time at The Food Store!
Come to The Food Store for all your special New Year's needs!
See in the New Year with your family!
Call an ambulance, quick.
Right!
I knew it! Kiyoko really is the messenger of God!
Hey!
Miss Hana!
Hey!
Hana!
Following a recent gangland shooting incident...
...police are seeking a fugitive thought to be Latin American.
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...
...in protecting the leader of his syndicate...
...will be questioned after he recovers from his wounds.
Isn't she cute!
When was she born?
Not long ago, I guess.
So the mother...
I'm not.
What's her name?
Kiyoko.
That's my name too.
What a coincidence.
Your friend is very weak.
Make sure he gets rest and proper nutrition.
Doctor!
Believe it or not, we're homeless.
I'm just a doctor.
Rest and nutrition don't fit with our lifestyle, you realize.
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.
All anyone can do is their best.
Take care.
The bill for today is 29,830 yen.
Bring your health-insurance card and you'll get a refund.
I'm sorry, Gin!
Stop crying! You'll get the bills all wet.
That's 30,000 yen.
Kiyoko?!
Dad?
So you took up nursing.
I see.
I'm glad you're well.
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
How's your mother?
Fine.
Yeah? That's good.
What are you doing now?
I'm in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.
You must hate me.
I was never any kind of a father to you.
But that 30,000 yen was money
I'd saved up for you.
You may not believe it.
I always wanted to see you.
When I was little,
Mom and I searched for you.
We even checked unidentified corpses.
After you disappeared,
Mom ran the store herself.
The store?
It was hard for a woman to run a bicycle shop alone.
That's not quite the same as a bicycle racer.
The man you owed money to was shot and wounded the other day, you know.
He lived?!
That's a relief.
I thought you'd say that.
I ran up the debts, not him.
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.
I'm getting married.
Oh? That's good.
To him.
Great! But isn't he about my age?
He's been married.
His daughter got sick and died...
...and his wife followed her.
That man makes me so mad!
Aren't you moved?
Here's the address and phone number.
Yours?
The old house is gone.
Even if you can't now, call me sometime.
Kiyoko!
L've had about all I can stand!
Miss Hana?
Telling us you were a racer!
I was always at the track.
Yeah, betting!
And your debts snowballed so you couldn't face your family...
...and you ran and hid in a cardboard box!
Yes, damn it!
That's what your father is!
He can't bet, he's spineless, his feet stink and he can't drink!
He kills off his wife and daughter to buy sympathy!
He said you had an incurable disease!
With a father like that, you have my sympathy!
Is this how you repay me?!
Repay you?!
Am I hearing right?
If we're talking about debt,
I'm waiting for my change!
Debt's a concept you don't even understand!
You understand how to troll through garbage cans!
And how to get in debt and how to make babies.
Though you're not too good at raising them, are you?
And your debts you shove off on your wife.
Always running away, never doing anything right!
Running away's the only racing you ever did!
Miyuki! We're leaving!
Miss Hana?
I guess he's better.
Should you have said that in front of her?
If she's his daughter, she'll forgive him.
Being able to speak freely...
...is the lifeblood of love.
Maybe I'm naive.
So you're in love with him?
Don't be silly.
I'm the Weeping Red Devil.
What?
It's a story I love.
There was a red devil who wanted to be friends with people.
But since he was a devil, no one would go near him.
So his friend the blue devil made a plan.
He'd wreak havoc among the people, and the red devil would save them.
When you try to achieve something, someone's bound to get hurt.
You always have to sacrifice something.
The plan worked.
But the blue devil had to go away so they'd never know it was a trick.
It's a sad story.
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?
It's best for everyone when they're with their family.
Soon we'll find Kiyoko's mother.
And then what?
You don't have a real family!
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery
Numbers have been drawn for the annual New Year's Jumbo Lottery.
Top prize in the 200-million-yen lottery is a very rare number.
Group 11, number 111, 111...
...is worth 50 million yen.
A different group pays 100,000 yen.
To repeat, the winning prize number is...
This just in.
Police have released a sketch of an infant taken...
...from a hospital in
Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward.
We've come all the way here, but we don't have her address!
The geezer's got it!
Let's go back.
Where are you going?
- The police!
- What? You hated that idea!
I was just ego-tripping.
Now I want to apologize to her parents.
They might not be able to sleep waiting for news about her.
That's what we said from the very start!
They might even be about to commit suicide!
L've done something that can't be taken back!
I'll throw myself in this river.
I'll step neatly out of my shoes, stand on the handrail, and be at peace.
But then I'll see a baby's face on the water.
No! While I see this child's face,
I cannot die!
Hey, you!
No!
You're too young for this!
Please! Let me die!
You!
Sachiko Nishizawa.
What were you thinking of?!
Is that an apology?
If we hadn't found this child, she would've frozen to death!
It wasn't me!
My husband took her away when I wasn't there!
L've looked and looked!
Is that true?
All I've suffered on account of that man!
"Hi, Mom!"
God really loves this child, you know.
I want you to give her lots of love too.
Do right by her, or you'll pay for it.
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry!
Mrs. Nishizawa!
What are you doing in here?!
Get out of here! Get out!
Wait! I'm no thief.
You're lying! Get out!
Where's the baby?!
Did an old queer and a girl come to give it back?
What are you talking about?!
You abandoned a baby!
I can prove it.
Are you a cop?
Huh? I'm just a bum who was passing by.
Are you right in the head?
I'm damn near crazy from all this!
Why is the baby you abandoned on the news as being "taken away"?
They'll call us kidnappers!
It wasn't me.
That's not my kid.
What?
There, there! Don't cry!
Take care.
Raise her right.
See you again someday.
Never leave her again.
On the year's last day / when all of a life's accounts / have been settled up.
Sachiko stole that baby out of the hospital.
She stole a baby and then abandoned it?!
That's a person's life!
She lied to me about it!
And now it's gone way out of control.
I don't want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!
What?!
Don't act like you're not part of this!
You don't want to get involved?
You're her husband!
That's all over!
I'm getting my life back together.
Look!
I won 100,000 yen in the lottery.
My luck's turned!
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.
No. They threw him away.
I'm no loser!
These were in your wife's bag.
Any idea where she might have gone?
She said she was going to be with her baby.
She was going to kill herself!
There's no time to waste!
No! She was just going to go look for the kid.
She's desperate.
That only means one thing!
But where do I look?!
Hana!
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
God must be busy at this time of year.
Better once a year than never.
Geezer?
You're too late. You just missed a very moving finale.
What's the matter?
"Kiyoko"!
"Stomach"?
"Mother"!
Now that's settled...
...what the hell do you mean?!
Fake! The mother!
Sachiko's a fake!
Pardon?
Why won't you drink?
A baby has to drink from its mother's breast.
We'll never be close if you don't!
Sorry. Wrong people.
She can't be far!
But where do we look?
We can't just give her up now!
That's Kiyoko!
Should you be running?
If I don't run now, when will I?
This way!
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!
Who said "family suicide"?
You did!
- Which way?
- Left.
- Okay, right!
- Why?
You're a lousy gambler!
You got that right.
Somebody help!
Hey!
Wait!
Thief! Thief!
What's wrong?
A woman just stole my truck!
Hey! Thief!
Yes! That woman!
She's a baby thief!
Be quiet, will you?
Please! Be a good baby!
Stop! Give Kiyoko back!
Give me a break!
I'm forever in your debt!
Gin!
That woman's crazy!
Get closer!
I can't!
You have to, for Kiyoko!
- Who's Kiyoko?!
- Step on it like a man!
Okay!
Please! Be quiet!
- Gin!
- Geezer?!
Geezer!
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!
Pass her!
We'll die!
Step on it!
Okay!
Stop crying!
Don't be afraid.
I'll never leave you again.
You want to die?!
Gin!
Gin!
There!
- Are you okay?!
- Where's Kiyoko?
- Faster!
- Okay!
Which way?
We're at the scene...
...where a truck has crashed into a building in Shinagawa.
Now a woman holding a baby has appeared on the roof.
Witnesses say the woman is connected with the incident...
...as she was driving the truck.
Now there's someone else on the roof!
Stay away!
No!
Tell me why you took that baby.
I didn't!
This baby is mine!
You're lying! Its real parents are worried sick about it!
That's not true!
You of all people should know what it's like to lose a child!
She's dead. My baby died before she was even born!
All the other babies looked so healthy there in the ward.
I wanted to die.
But then this baby smiled at me.
I decided she was mine.
I thought as long as I had her, everything would be fine.
My husband would mend his ways, and we'd be a real family.
That's bullshit!
Build a family by ruining a baby's life?
If you're going to die, do it alone!
A life is a life. It's only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.
Give her back, okay?
I want to be reborn.
Sachiko!
Sachiko, don't die!
Come back to me!
I was wrong!
Please, don't kill yourself!
We'll start again!
We'll be reborn!
Sachiko!
I'll go first and wait for you.
Sachiko!
Please! Let me die!
Kiyoko wants to see her mom and dad!
I want to go home.
I'm sorry!
Take her...
...to her mother and father.
Oh, no.
Hana!
I'm okay!
I'm still alive!
Inspector, I don't know how to thank you.
We're not the ones you should thank.
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.
- In my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah.
That was some New Year's!
It's "No Smoking" here.
Lighten up! I'm a hero!
You mean "we"!
I guess we won't have to listen to
Kiyoko's damn crying anymore.
She's not "Kiyoko" anymore.
I'm not pleased.
What can we do?
Not that.
This is a men's ward!
Perhaps we're intruding.
No, it's just...
...I'm told they're homeless.
Who cares?
We'd like them to be her godfathers.
Come in.
Excuse us.
The baby's parents would like to thank you
Dad...
Long ago, when the pyramids were still young, -
- Egyptian kings played a game of great and terrible power.
They did battle with magic and monsters for riches and glory.
From these Shadow Games erupted a war -
- that threatened to destroy the world, -
- until a brave and powerful pharaoh locked the dark magic away, -
- imprisoning it for all eternity within the mystical Millennium Items.
But even eternity doesn't last forever.
It was never to happen, and for 5000 years it never did.
The secret of the Millennium Puzzle remain safely beyond reach.
Within the imponderable conundrum of it's intricate design.
For a boy named Yugi, the mystery of the Millennium Puzzle -
- remains just that.
The solution, if one exists, eludes him as it did those that came before him.
But this time, fate has played a hand in bringing the puzzle -
- and this person together.
It was never to happen.
And for 5000 years it never did.
But while the desert does it's best to conceal -
- that which should remain burried, -
- it eventually yielded it's most ancient and terrible secrets.
We found it. The lost tomb of Anubis.
Professor, what do you make of this? It's amazing.
What possessed them to put the sarcophagus in chains?
Hey, all right!
Maybe this one next.
Yeah! One to go.
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.
Now what have we here?
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised when he sees I've figured -
- this puzzle out all by myself.
The last piece.
This is it.
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.
What's going on?
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.
This tomb is cursed.
Hey! What is this?
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!
Return to the dark realm from whence you came!
It was never to happen but after 5000 years it did.
And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.
In the three short years since he started playing Duel Monsters -
- Yugi Moto has risen to international stardom, -
- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.
But what makes this young man such a talented duelist?
Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -
- powerful God Cards he's assembled in his deck?
Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven his dueling powers time and again.
He has reigned victorious in the most prestigious tournaments, -
- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.
And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -
- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -
- around this little high school pipsqueak.
Yugi says his success is due to his grandfather's coaching -
- and to his belief in the heart of the cards.
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.
But other say it is the three Egyptian God Cards -
- that make Yugi virtually unbeatable.
And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -
- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?
You've got one.
And this time things are gonna end differently, you pompous windbag.
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.
Make all the smug pronouncements you like, but know this:
There's got to be a way to beat your God Cards.
And I won't stop until I find it.
Now I activate the Magic Card -
- Polymerization.
This allows me to fuse my three dragons together, -
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
And that's just for starters.
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles my dragon's attack points:
Megamorph.
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful than any monster on the field.
There is more to power than just attack points.
And just what is that supposed to mean?
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess powers far beyond meer monsters.
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -
- I can bestow upon the third, infinite strength.
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is the strongest monster in play.
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him what true power is all about.
Attack with Fist of Fury!
No.
My dragon.
- No!
- System overload!
The simulation is malfunctioning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was certain that our calculations -
- were correct this time, sir.
If you just give us one more chance, sir.
So you can fail again? Sorry.
Please, sir. We're close to postulating a winning strategem.
Well if I were you I'd start postulating myself a new job.
You've had more than enough time to find a way to beat -
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But as usual I have to do it myself.
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.
There's gotta be some way to defeat Yugi's God Cards.
And I think I know were to start looking.
The God Cards?
What a horrible nightmare.
That's it, no more white wine spritzers before bedtime for me.
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -
- but I can still see that something terrible is about to unfold.
About time the museum got a descent display of Egyptian artifacts.
Hey, that looks just like a Millennium Item.
This I gotta see.
This is flight command.
Initiating Duel Dome launch convertion. Over.
Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -
- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.
We show Mr. Kaiba now approaching primary flight deck.
Begin complete systems check at once.
- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.
- Navigation sensors.
- Check.
- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.
Blue-Eyes White Jet, you are clear for take-off.
Activating main thrust rockets.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.
Red wine spritzer, sir.
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.
You and I have never been friends, so let's not start pretending that we are.
Oh, my. Sounds like someone's need a hug.
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it, there is something I need.
Listen. I've come to your little fantasy island -
- in search of a card powerful enough to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.
And you believe I'd might have this all-powerful God-smiting Card because?
Because you created the game, Pegasus.
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy, but I'm retired now.
The only things I create these days are places like this for the fishies to enjoy.
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -
- and would have never let them out of your sweaty little hands, -
- unless you also created a way to beat them.
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess.
I may have one card that could help, but you can't have it.
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -
- but I don't think you deserve it.
True I may not see as well as I once did.
But to be honest, it doesn't take a magic eye -
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has trounced your sorry behind again and again.
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.
Well since I'm such a disappointment, you should have no trouble -
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?
Because if you'll put up the card I need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -
- just for a chance to trounce little Yugi?
My, my, my, seems you're even more desperate than I thought.
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.
Kaiba, my dear and devious friend, let the games begin.
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.
But I haven't seen this many people running from school since they served -
- meat loaf surprise last year.
- What in the...
- Let me see.
Wonder who these guys are all waiting for.
It's him.
Told you he's alot smaller than on tv.
Me first. Let me at him.
Please just give me one shot at those God Cards.
Get out of my way! If anyone gets the God Cards, it's me.
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?
Life on the top, T√©a. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.
So they all want a piece of him, and those God Cards.
T√©a, try to sneak Yugi around the back, while we hold them off.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.
- On three.
- Quick, after them.
Forget about those nobodies.
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?
I said you're nobody.
Yeah, that's right. And everybody knows it too.
Well just everybody who's anybody, that is.
Listen up. Nobody but nobody calls me a nobody, -
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.
The Master of the Gods, not the Master of the Clods.
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -
- by doing top-contender, and I think I know one.
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.
So if you wanna get to the King of Games -
- you'll have to go through me, the Godfather of Games, capiche.
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.
Won't take long. Let's do this.
Okay, ladies first.
Funny. Take this!
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.
Hi, there.
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.
Say ah!
What the...
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in order to summon Maju Garzett.
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you to say it, not spray it? Some menace.
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.
Which means all the monsters you got out on the field are destroyed, pal.
Lightning Sword.
Ah, nuts!
Maybe now, you'll have the proper respect for Joey -
- the Godfather of Games.
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.
We're gonna get ya.
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.
Quick! Yugi, this way.
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.
Some place where we will be save from that Duel Monsters mob.
Some place they'd never look.
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?
Is this the latest in duel arena technology, or what?
This place is an outdated joke.
But then so are you, so I suppose it fits.
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.
Look, enough small talk.
Let's duel!
I'll start things off.
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.
A world of chaos. A world of absolute mayhem.
That's right. A world of Toons.
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually still using that idiotic Toon World card.
Well, this is gonna be even easier than I thought.
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.
And this for later.
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.
I summon X-Head Cannon.
I'll throw two cards face down.
For later.
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?
No wait that I now play this.
Card of Sanctity.
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us each to draw until we both -
- have six cards in our hand.
Just what I needed.And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?
I know what it means. Now you can summon your strongest monsters to the field -
- more easily.
Please, what do you take me for, some kind of a rookie?
You're not quite that good, Kaiba-boy.
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.
But I won't be using her just yet.
First I'll attack with the Gemini Elves.
And I think I'll have them target... -
- you.
Cartoons are so violent these days.
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.
When they deal damage to a player, that player loses a card from his hand.
Aren't my Toons simply magnificent, Kaiba-boy?
Oh, don't look so sour.
Think of it this way, at least it will be them stopping you little quest to the top and not -
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.
I guess it's true that when you get old, the mind is the first thing to go, because -
- you forgot all about my face down cards.
And now it's gonna cost you.
Attack Guidance Armor.
This trap's like a magnet that redirects your own attack right back at you.
No, you wouldn't.
Oh, yes I would. And I will.
Guidance Armor, attach to the Toon Gemini Elves.
But they were just innocent Toons.
You'll pay for that.
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.
And play Ultimate Offering.
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -
- this first monster will be quite a powerful one.
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile.
Well, compared to the next Toon, that is.
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.
Sure, I'll have to give up another 500 of my life ponts, -
- but then, you know what they say, Kaiba-boy:
You have to spend life points to take life points.
Of course, you know all about that.
Yugi's been taking your life points for what, going on three years now?
Oh, I'm sorry to keep bringing that up.
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.
Now by discarding one card from my hand, -
- I can remove any monster from the game.
I see.
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -
- but I guess this is goodbye.
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't be getting off that easily, -
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
Head from my hand.
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.
What? But X-Head Cannon is your own monster.
What are you scheming?
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.
It removes one more monster from the game -
- and I'm using it on my Y-Dragon Head.
Why are you removing your own monsters?
And now, I summon -
- Z-Metal Tank.
That makes no sense, unless...
Unless I still have one more card to play, Pegasus.
And it so happens I do.
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.
It's well worth half my life points to bring back all my monsters.
And nice trick to know when you wanna summon more than one monster in a turn.
And as you're well aware, these aren't just any monsters, Pegasus.
They combine.
Together they create the ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need to blast any card I want out of the duel.
If you still say you're gonna win, then it's time to change your tune.
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!
Use Cannon Firestorm.
That's all folks.
Now let's see which you've got to beat the Egyptian Gods.
Looks like you had two cards up your sleeve.
What do you mean, two cards?
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.
Nice try, you snake.
The museum is the last place those demented duelists would think to look for you.
Hope you're right.
Hey, it's some kind of an Egyptian exhibit.
Look, T√©a.
That blue pyramid, there.
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.
Let's go check it out.
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
If we stay here I'm gonna blow chunks.
Okay, I get the point, T√©a.
You're not a mummy fan.
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?
Oh, well it looks like great minds think alike.
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.
This says, it's called the Pyramid of Light.
In all my years of egyptology, I've never come across this relic before.
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror who tried to bring about the end of the world.
Well I guess it's pretty safe to say his plan didn't work, right?
Legends say a brave pharaoh destroyed him using -
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.
The same pharaoh who many believed possessed your Millennium Puzzle.
Come, I'll show you.
See? There is the knife.
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.
"The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -"
"- unless blinded by events predetermined."
"Thus light and shadows both be killed."
From the light comes the dark.
T√©a? Would you read me the story about the bunny?
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion talking and forget all about it.
'Cause right now we got bigger problems.
Like where King Tut's freaky cousin went.
The mummy's body's been stolen.
And that's not all. He napped that pyramid thing too.
Grandpa. Stay here.
I have a feeling Kaiba's in danger. I have to warn him.
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.
I'll call you.
What hit me?
Probably whatever broke into the museum.
No. This is terrible.
Yeah, they took the mummy and the Pyramid of Light.
This is one crime those crooks is gonna regret.
According to the legend, Anubis found that he would one day return from the dead.
What's going on?
- You don't really think that...
- T√©a, I don't know what to think.
Let's just hope that legend is just a legend.
Stop the car!
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.
And he says that it's real important that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.
All I know is that Seto hasn't been acting like himself lately.
I think he's gonna totally lose it.
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.
Or, like you helped. Then again you duel worse than my mom.
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.
Check it out. What's Kaiba's limo doing at Yugi's place?
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.
My brother's waiting for you on the top floor.
I got it. Thanks.
Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.
Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.
This is want he wants.
But it is too much of a coincident that Kaiba would send for us -
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.
And I'm pretty sure it has something to do with that Anubis guy.
It seams like you had some kind of battle with him 5000 years ago.
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my days as the pharaoh are clouded, -
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.
I sure wish we knew more about what happened back in your past.
All that matters is that we face the future together.
And I wouldn't have it any other way. Are you ready partner?
Ready.
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Kaiba's car is outside so Yugi must be here.
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?
My brother is about to duel him.
Welcome.
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.
'Cause this time things are gonna be different.
Initiating duel simulation.
Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.
I hope you've brought your Egyptian God Cards.
Otherwise, this duel isn't gonna be any fun at all.
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.
Spare me the fairy tales.
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.
If you think you sense something dangerous, you're absolutely right, -
- because it's me and my deck, and in this Duel Monsters match -
- you're about to lose big-time.
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.
If you say so.
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.
Now what'd you say we get down to business, already?
Something tells me that this duel is not a good idea.
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself for once and listen to what I'm telling you?
You're in no position to be making demands.
So shut up and duel.
And may the best duelist win.
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.
You've been taking credit for being the best duelist for way too long.
And to tell you the truth I'm sick of it.
By the time this duel is over, you'll be exposed to the world as a total fraud.
Let's duel!
I'll start.
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in defence mode. Try and get past him.
Very well, I shall.
I play Queen's Knight.
And now, say goodbye to your monster.
Queen's Knight, attack!
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -
- which allows you to play a new beast in it's place.
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would he let Kaiba play a monster -
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?
And you're being so helpful, because why?
Because by doing so I also get to summon a new monster.
King's Knight.
And these two knights are in play I can -
- automatically summon my Jack's Knight.
And next I place one card face down.
Make your move.
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.
And then nothing in your deck will make a difference. Your move, Yugi.
An Egyptian God Card.
I sacrifice my three knights to bring forth my ultimate creature.
Behold the Egyptian God Card:
Slifer the Sky Dragon.
Your monster is completely defenceless against the devine power of Slifer.
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!
Had enough?
Not only am I not afraid of your God Cards -
- but I'm gonna force you to summon all three of them at once.
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -
- you have to bring out every monster in your deck that falls into -
- the same category as the one that's on the field already.
Very well. Then I play two more God Cards.
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.
It's no mistake.
My entire strategy was to draw out your three Egyptian God Cards, -
- so I can be the first duelist to crush all of them at once.
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.
So the Pyramid of Light is more than just an ancient artifact.
It's also a card.
Now pyramid, activate!
Looks like your so called unstoppable monsters have been stopped.
Impossible.
See for yourself.
Wow, check it out.
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?
He actually did it.
Yugi. What's this?
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.
This weird stuff always happens when Yugi duels.
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.
What's going on?
This is crazy.
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.
That blue beam is the same color of the Pyramid of Light from the museum -
- and I bet it's no coincidence.
What ever is going on in there, one thing's for sure: It can't be good.
Yugi, where are you?
Kaiba, do you have any idea what you've just done?
Well, let's see. I think I have just beaten you.
Hey, wait a sec. This place looks kinda familiar.
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.
I've gotta find it so we can reconnect.
I'm pretty sure that one of these rooms belongs to him.
Question is, which one? There must be a million doorways in this place.
Oh, man I feel as bad as you look, Joey.
Tristan. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats.
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?
Pharaoh, are you here?
Pharaoh?
Nothing.
Pharaoh!
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your faith in the Gods and they let you down.
If I were you now is a good time to start praying for mercy.
Because from here on out, I'm planning to take you apart piece by painful piece.
So let the torture continue with this:
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.
Your face down card is destroyed.
And if you like that, then you're gonna love this:
Peten the Dark Clown.
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.
And to top it off I'll place this face down on the field.
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew you'd make that move, -
- which is why my face down card is Deck Destruction Virus.
You set off this cribleling trap when you destroyed my Dark Clown, -
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect ten random cards from your deck -
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.
No.
I hate to be the bearer of even more bad news, -
- but when you destroyed my Peten the Dark Clown, -
- you activated his special ability, allowing me to summon another -
- Dark Clown to take his place.
I summon Des Feral Imp.
And next I'll activate the magical Card of Demise.
It let's me draw five new cards from my deck.
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and activate White Dragon Ritual -
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.
When I lose my life points I'm losing my actual life energy.
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.
Take a good look.
It's the monster that's been the bane of your dueling existence ever since -
- our first match. And now he's back.
But he's not alone.
Any last requests?
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!
Where did he go?
Hey, hold on!
This isn't his room.
Pharaoh. Oh, no.
Who's there?
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?
Hi.
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?
Woaw, it looks like an earthquake hit this place.
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?
He's in there and so is my brother.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Looks like that artifact we saw back at the museum, only this one's super-sized.
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?
Anubis once tried to destroy the world using the power of the Pyramid of Light.
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.
All of this insanity started when my brother played a card that -
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -
- from 5000 years ago.
And if the myth is true then Anubis is using it to finish was he started in the past.
This is crazy. We gotta get them out of there.
I don't know what dark powers are at work here -
- but I can't let them go unchecked.
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -
- and I'll boost her strength with Mage Power.
It may cost me 800 life points, -
- but my Valkyria now gains 500 attack and defence points
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.
1000 additional attack points make my Valkyria -
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.
- A trap.
- Very observant.
Now your attack is diverted.
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -
- it infects ten more cards in your deck.
I've lost half the cards in my deck already.
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -
- who just hates to say goodbye.
And next... -
- I'm gonna summon up your worst nightmare.
Because if you couldn't defeat one Blue-Eyes... -
- there's no way you'll defeat three, -
- especially when combined as the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
If you think he's scary now, just wait till he attacks. In fact don't wait.
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.
Look at the world's best duelist now.
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?
Yugi, what the heck is going on?
We've been drawn into the Millennium Puzzle -
- and that thing up there is somehow responsible.
Then what's that, down there?
That blue one looks like the Pyramid of Light I saw at the museum.
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.
Fighting pyramides and creepy floating eyes. Wonderful.
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?
Maybe.
I think this all has to do with an ancient Egyptian sorceror.
I knew it was gonna be something insane.
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.
Centuries ago he tried to destroy the world and I'm starting to believe -
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?
The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Thus light and shadows both be killed.
Doesn't look like the duel's going too well for your friend the pharaoh.
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -
- we can outrun them.
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it only gets worse from here.
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.
No. That Pyramid of Light has created a deadly Shadow Game.
I know you sense it we must stop now.
The only thing I sense is your fear. Not that I blame you.
But I came here to win and stopping's not an option.
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel, when clearly I should have been champion.
For all the times I'd had to listen to your preach about the heart of the cards.
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.
Next I reveal my face down card, Sage's Stone.
When Dark Magician Girl is on the field and Sage's Stone is played, -
- it allows me to automatically summon Dark Magician.
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.
For now I sacrifice both magicians -
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.
And with his rise to power comes your Blue-Eyes far from grace.
Because for everyone of my sorceror's fallen comrades in the graveyard -
- your dragon loses 500 points.
And right now there have been three magicians laid down to rest, -
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's power decreases by 1500 points.
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.
Now, will you stop this madness?
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.
No, I'll have no monsters on the field to defend my life points.
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!
You may have destroyed my clown, but you forgot about -
- Deck Virus Trap Card.
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out.
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic mystic's powers are so mighty, -
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards, like your Deck Virus and destroy it.
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.
- What?
- That's right.
You see I have an even more powerful monster, compliments of Pegasus.
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
Could it be? A card I'd never seen before?
And for every dragon in my graveyard -
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains an additional 300 attack points.
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -
- for at punishing grand total of 4500 points.
But don't forget, due to my sorceres' powers, -
- your new dragon's attack points decrease by 1500.
I don't think so. Thanks to my dragon's Shining Diffusion.
What, your points didn't decrease.
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -
- or Monster Effect Cards can be used against him.
Just face it, Yugi, your days as a champion duelist are over.
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast you back to the minor leagues -
- where you belong.
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.
How do you like it? The pain, the sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.
Now it's your turn.
You're sure this is the way to that mummy guy?
Yeah, every hallway looks the same.
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.
Check it out. It's some kind of energy stream.
Maybe if we follow this thing, it'll lead us to Anubis.
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.
It's putting out energy waves that are making my pacemaker go haywire.
Up here!
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?
Pegasus, what are you doing here?
How about we start with a thank you, you little ingrate?
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me when in fact this is all been arranged by an -
- evil lord who tried to take over the world five millennia ago and is now back -
- to finish the job. I looked it up.
Now, this Anubis has created the ultimate Shadow Game -
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.
And Yugi and Kaiba are right in the middle of it.
We just gotta find a way to help them.
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.
Foolish mortals there is nothing you can do to stop my rebirth.
I have infiltrated the realm of the pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.
We won't stand here while you suck the life out of others to save yourself.
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.
Yeah, because just in case you haven't noticed, we've got you outnumbered.
This place is crawling with stiffs.
What do you want, anyway?
Behold the future since you won't live to see it for yourself.
Soon my beasts of destruction shall annihilate all traces of life on Earth.
And I will finally complete that which I started millennia ago.
It is by your very hand that this devastation will occur, mortal.
For when you released the pharaoh, you released me as well.
What's he mean?
This is between me and him.
Listen, you guys need to find a way outta this place and save yourselves.
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?
There was a prophecy my grandpa read to me in the museum.
And I think it may have something to do with this. I just don't know what.
Yugi, that's crazy.
Just go guys.
Wait there's no way we're leaving you, we're team.
We've been through everything together and there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.
- That's right.
- But...
The last thing I wanna do is put my best friends in danger.
What are you doing? T√©a, please, get down from there.
My friends need me. I just know it.
Foolish girl.
T√©a, come back in here at once.
I've got to help my friends.
- She's falling.
- Grab her.
I'm coming, guys!
- T√©a.
- How did you find us?
Are you kidding me? Remember the friendship symbol we drew?
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -
- bond never will.
- Right.
We're all with you. And we're always be with you.
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.
- Yeah.
- Right.
You see? There's nothing out there that's more powerful than our friendship.
T√©a is right. I can feel it. All we have to do is stick together.
Hey, stick it together, is what we do best.
We'll never leave your side.
- T√©a.
- Your pathetic little bond -
- is nothing against my power.
Soon my soul will be fully restored and your world shrouded in darkness.
Yet, you fools prate along about togetherness?
- Then so be it.
- T√©a!
- T√©a!
- What's out!
What? I can do that.
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.
Take this.
That wasn't suppose to happen.
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.
Neither do kicks to the head.
Let's try this.
These carcasses won't quit.
How do you destroy what's already dead?
It's no use. They just keep coming.
How the mighty has fallen.
Lying there on the ground like a dog waiting to be put out of it's misery.
Get up, get up so I can knock you back down.
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.
But believe me, I cannot let you win this duel.
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.
You know I think you're the one who doesn't have clue what this match is really about.
It's about pay back.
And this card will see to that.
But first let's deal with your so-called Big Shield Gardna.
Do you think it's big enough to block the power of -
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.
I told you when we started this duel -
- that this time things were gonna be different, Yugi.
You may have beaten me in the past, -
- but now there's nothing you can do to stop me from having my revenge.
You're finished.
Not yet. I'm not.
I activate Pot of Greed which let's me draw two cards.
Now I summon Watapon in defense mode.
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -
- I can summon another monster to the field.
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.
So let me see if I've got this right, now.
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.
Well, then it's your funeral.
First the Card of Demise I played before sends this dragon to the graveyard.
And I know you know what that means, don't you?
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has more destructive power than ever before.
Kaiba, please listen to me.
All I wanna hear from you is your anguished cry of defeat.
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.
People are getting hurt, lives are in danger.
And this Pyramid of Light you've created is source of it all.
There's a dark power in our midst and you can't deny it.
With every life point lost, we both become weaker. I know you can feel it.
We must stop. Before it's too late.
Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi now with my Shining Dragon -
- and destroy the rest of his life points.
No, I should stick to my original strategy -
- and defeat Yugi with his very own Egyptian God Cards.
I'm afraid that for you it's already too late, Yugi.
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this we still have time to stop this madness.
All we have to do is end this duel.
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate your final special ability.
No, you're playing with forces you can't possibly understand.
Finish him. Finish him, now!
No, I wanted a perfect victory, and with this card I can -
- use Yugi's own most powerful monsters against him.
I use Shining Nova.
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes into a blast so strong it -
- destroys itself plus anything I choose.
And the card that will feel the wrath of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -
- is the Pyramid of Light.
No, I need the pyramid to destroy the pharaoh.
What am I saying? I must destroy it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.
Your reign as the King of Games is over.
That title will be mine as will all three of your Egyptian God Cards.
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon sacrifice yourself -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
This I cannot allow.
What? The Pyramid of Light wasn't destroyed?
The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.
Hey, what is this? Show yourself, whoever you are.
I have been here the whole time, mortal, whispering in your ear.
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.
Kaiba. Look out!
Kaiba. No!
You have served me well, little worm, -
- but you have outlived your usefulness.
So it's been you behind this whole duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.
The Egyptian Lord of the Dead, Anubis.
I am pleased that you remember me after all these years, my pharaoh.
It will make my ultimate vengence all the more sweeter.
You will fall and my reign of destruction shall begin.
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -
- have already fallen, trapped within your puzzle.
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.
You're wrong. I can still sense their presence.
And I will fight to defend them.
No matter what happens, I will not let your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.
All I need due is defeat you in this duel.
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.
The magic of the Shadow Games that you locked away centuries ago -
- will once again be unleashed into the world.
And I shall finally take my rightful place, as the pharaoh of this realm.
With the Pyramid of Light at my command -
- there's nothing you can do to stop me.
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.
Reverse of Reverse.
Search your deck from now until doomsday.
And you still won't find anything to stand against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that for you doomsday is today.
Now watch as your last line of defense is ripped to shreds before your eyes.
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.
My Celtic Guardian. No.
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -
- half of that monster's attack points are taken away -
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon you will be the relic burried away.
Soon worms will feast on your flesh, just as they did on mine.
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.
That's all I have left.
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.
That eye up there seems to be his power source.
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Predetermined events is just another way of saying fate.
The prophecy means the eye can be blinded by fate.
Heads up, you freak!
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.
If I'm right I gotta find that Dagger of Fate.
Yugi, please hurry!
It's empty. Please be in here somewhere. Yes.
Here it is.
Let's just hope that fate is on our side.
Come on!
No!
A weakness in the Pyramid's power.
I activate Double Spell.
By discarding one card from my hand, I can select a new one -
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.
And I know just the card I want.
Monster Reborn.
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
And I have a hunch this time, your pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.
Go, Shining Nova.
Use all your power to finish what you started before -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
Impossible.
And with that I'll end my turn, now that the Pyramid of Light is gone.
Your opponent tried and failed to destroy the pyramid with that dragon.
You alone couldn't make such a difference.
You're quite right that I could not have done it all alone.
You may have destroyed the card, pharaoh, -
- but not the Pyramid of Light around my neck. Behold its power.
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.
Thenien the Great Sphinx.
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.
Hey look. Tell me that attack meter is broke.
Say hello, Thenien.
5000 years ago, I never had the chance -
- to summon Thenien to our battle.
So I think it'd be best if we made up for lost time -
- and finally had a proper introduction.
Thenien, meet the pharaoh, and pharaoh meet your doom.
We don't have anything that can beat that sphinx.
Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct about what Kaiba was planning.
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -
- and I still have one face down card to play.
Reverse of Reverse, -
- which allows me to use the last card played by Kaiba:
Return from the Different Dimension.
When Kaiba spoke of dealing me the perfect defeat, -
- he meant wiping me out with my own Egyptian Gods.
Allow me to introduce Obelisk the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.
My Egyptian Gods, combine now! For infinite power.
Now go, Titan Firestorm!
No.
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!
Yeah!
- You did it.
- We did it.
Kaiba. Are you all right?
Let me help you.
I can take care of myself.
What the...?
Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.
Now let see how well you play this game, when the monsters are real.
- Monsters?
- For real?
It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.
Nothing in your decks of cards can save you now.
It appears you are one card short, pharaoh.
Yeah, but I'm not.
Attack! Gilford the Lightning and Gearfried the Iron Knight.
Begone!
You have no concept of my powers and now the end begins.
We're pancakes.
Not yet.
These Toon Monsters won't last long.
We have to get out of here, while we still have the chance.
Yugi, I know you'll take this creep down.
Yes, you would, 'cause we will be with you all the way.
- Always.
- Always.
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.
How can we beat a real monster?
How? With a real monster.
- Yugi.
- What's this?
The one card that can beat him.
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!
If the monsters are real, so are all their powers -
- including this dragon's ability to destroy any monster.
Destroy Anubis!
Wow, check it out.
No!
He's not coming back again, right?
We should take a closer look at that prophecy to see what it foretells for the future.
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.
No one could return after suffering a defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.
Oh, please, spare me all your bull about friendship, will ya?
If it wasn't for that freak crashing the party we both know that -
- the winner of todays duel would have been me.
So enjoy your last days of being champion. Why you still can.
I gotta say it's nice to have the old Kaiba back.
Yeah? Well this conversation's over. We'll duel again.
Wait up!
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all the damage you did to the Duel Dome.
'Cause I don't think his insurance is gonna cover this.
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.
And unless he changes he won't have best friends like this.
What Kaiba doesn't get is that victory means nothing, -
- unless you can share it with the people you love.
'Cause then...
You're really a winner.
You can say that again.
SUBTITLES BY
Lightkeeper
Now, this might be
The room of any small boy... but it happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin.
And, like most small boys...
Christopher Robin had toy animals to play with.
And together they had many remarkable adventures... in an enchanted place... called the Hundred Acre Wood.
But of all his animal friends...
Christopher Robin's very best friend... was a bear called Winnie the Pooh.
Winnie the Pooh?
Wait halfa darn minute!
It seems to me that most of these stories are about that silly old bear.
Well, then, Tigger, who should this story be about?
Well, I happen to know someone... who's extremely fascinatin', not to mention handsome and debonair-y.
But the title already says
Winnie the Pooh.
Oh, that's easy to fix.
There! Now, that's a wonderful title.
And speaking of wonderful things--
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things
Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one
Tiggers are cuddly fell as
Tiggers are awfully sweet
Everyone el-es is jealous
That's why I repeat and repeat
The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are marvellous chaps
They're loaded with vim and with vigour they love to leap in your laps
They're jumpy, bumpy, clumpy, pumpy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one
I'm the only--
Hello! I'm Tigger.
That's T-l-double-geh-er.
- And that's me. Hoo, hoo, hoo!
- I know.
You've bounced me lots and lots of times.
Yeah. Fun, ain't it?
Say, you want to go bouncin' with me, on account of bouncin's what tiggers do the-- eh, best.
- Eww.
- Well...
I would go bouncing with you, Tigger... except that I must count all these honey pots... to be sure that I have enough for winter.
Let me get that, please.
- Bother.
- Yech!
What do these Pooh bears like about this icky, sticky stuff anyway?
Well, no time for goofi n' off.
I've got dawdlin' to do.
Hoo, hoo! T.T.F.N.!
Ta-ta for now! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Oh, d-d-dear, dear.
Hiya, Piglet, old pal!
What say you and I do a little bouncin' together?
B-B-Bouncing? Oh, my!
I-l haven't enough firewood to last the winter, and--
Why, sure, you do!
Why, there's lots of firewood.
What's this?
It's lyin' all over the place.
- Whoa! Whoa!
- There. See?
- Now we can go bouncin'.
- B-But...
I would really rather prefer that my firewood... not have quite so much chair in it.
Oh. Well, then, uh, T.T.F.N.!
Gotta be bouncin' along!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Well, hello there!
And good mornin', Mrs Kanga, ma'am!
Well, good morning,
Tigger, dear.
She called me "dear."
Pardon me for askin', but you wouldn't happen to be interested... in doin' a bit of bouncin' with me, would ya?
Well, I'm afraid I have just too much to do this morning, dear.
Oh. Well, if you have to--
See ya later. Bye.
Tigger! Tigger!
Tigger.
Oh.
I wonder why nobody wants to bounce with me.
Oh, well.
What am I talkin' about?
There's plenty of others I haven't even asked yet. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
And so, the others all came 'round... to see what they might do to help.
But the end of Eeyore's house was merely the beginning... of a very unfortunate day.
Wow! Look at the size of it.
Your attention, uh, please.
I have officially completed the plans.
- What plans?
- The plans for removing this boulder... and restoring to Eeyore, uh, his happy home.
No need to bother on my account.
All we need is a little, uh, uh, team effort.
Rabbit's Rock Remover!
Now, then, Pooh bear, release the counterweight.
Kanga and Roo... start depressurizing the granite extractor.
Piglet? Piglet... start pulling your own weight over there.
But l-- I don't weigh anything.
A-- A little more over there.
Yes. That's good.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Over here. This way. This way.
All right, now--
- Oh, good. I think--
- Bother.
- Oh, my.
- Oh!
Well, now, why didn't it work?
Oh, let's see here now.
- The counterweight--
- Perhaps we could use another helping hand.
Yes. All we really need is--
- Tigger!
- Hello, you blokes!
- Anyone up for a little bouncin'?
- No! No!
No bouncing! Look!
Just look at all this work we have to do!
What? Movin' that old thing?
Hoo, hoo!
Not a problem.
All you need is a little bouncin'.
How will b-bouncing move the rock, T-Tigger?
Tut, tut, tut.
Not now, Piglet.
If maybe we had a little, uh--
Mm-hmm. Right there!
"Bouncing will move this boulder."
It's almost amusing.
Whoo!
Oh! Help!
Whoa!
Wow!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now that that's outta the way... who's up for a little bouncin'?
What is it with you and bouncing?
Just look at my rock remover.
Everything's ruined... and all you can think about is bouncing!
But that's what tiggers do best.
Exactly. Unlike us.
I'm afraid he's right, dear.
Wh-What we're trying to say is that, uh... we really can't bounce like tiggers... anyway because, uh--
We're not tiggers.
Who needs them other fell as anyhow?
Mostly I'm happy and I'm bouncy
Because lam the on liest one
But now all at once
I feel so lonely
For someone like me
Someone like me
Right now
I'm sort offeerin 'downcy
I'm just about the loneliest one
And deep in my heart
I'm sort of wishin'
For someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody with springs and things
Who laughs and sings
And jumps everyday
Somebody who's fun, fun, fun
Who loves to trounce and pounce
And bounce their gloomies away
Howl dream there is another
A double or a triple of me
To keep him company
But since I'm awake
I feel so lonely
Because I know it can't be
It never can be
Bein' that I'm the one and on liest
Someone
Like me
Someone like me
Tigger? Um--
T-Tigger?
Don't be sad, Tigger.
Wh-Why don't you go bouncin'?
That'll cheer you up.
No one to bounce with, Roo boy.
Oh. Well... what about another tigger?
Another tigger?
Well, that--
No, it's-- it's impossibibble.
It's crazy.
I'm the on liest one.
But aren't there other tiggers?
I've got a mama. Don't you have a family somewhere too?
Why, that's ridic-- Uh--
I mean--
Ooh, a family full of tiggers, you say.
Hoo, hoo.
Can you imaginate such a thing?
Why, that'd be more tiggers than you could stick a shake at.
And we'd all be bouncin'!
Bouncin' morning, noon and nighty-night!
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- But I could still bounce with ya, right, Tigger?
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
My very own tigger family!
Oh-ho. You wish to find your family.
A most noble quest, indeed.
There we are.
Help yourself to the cream and sugar.
The search for
Familius Genus Tiggeris.
That is Latin, I believe.
Or is it, uh, Greek?
Speaking of family, why, my very own family portraits... hang right over there... a collection I've gathered throughout the years.
Notice the interesting twists and turns of its many branches... stretching out across the ages.
It all comes from having strong roots, you know... and plenty of time to grow.
In fact, I do believe that the very seed of my family... began to germinate as far back as the 1 4th century... when a great-great-great grand-uncle of mine... went out on a limb and proclaimed his blossoming love... for a blooming young maid.
As their love blossomed, they eventually... were blessed with nine fine young saplings.
Never a bough did break--
Now, my dear boy, are you quite all right? Perhaps some more tea.
Anyway, if I may go out on a limb here...
I would first and foremost suggest for Tigger... that to find one's family, one must first look up... one's family tree.
Oh, it does bring to mind a distant nephew of mine.
An odd sort of fellow. He became a sailor and fell in with a member...
- of the feline persuasion.
- My... family tree?
My family tree!
Why didn't I think of thinkin' of that?
So long, beak lips! Thanks for the tip!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
I say.
Was it something I said?
And so began
Tigger's grand search... for his family tree.
He searched high.
He searched low.
He searched near... and he searched far.
Yoo-hoo!
Family! Family!
Hello!
But Tigger, how are you gonna know... which tree is your family tree?
Why, that's obvious, Roo boy.
My tigger family tree has got to be the biggest... hugest and most gigantical tree in the entire Hundred Acre Woodses... on account of all the enormous numerical numerous numbers of... tigger family members that'll be on it.
And besides and furthermore, it'll be all stripedy... just like yours truly.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
The only question is... where could my family tree be?
There! Good as new.
Or maybe even better, if I do say so myself.
Could be a bit drafty.
Might leak some.
Sort of lopsided.
Kind of cramped.
Otherwise, a dream house.
Hiya, donkey boy!
Hiya, donkey boy!
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger?
Back to his bouncy old self.
Oh, is this perhaps a tigger family tree up there?
Were you asking us to bounce with you? Because, you see, we would be glad to--
Hello, tigger family!
Hello!
- Uh, no, not this one. Hello!
- Hello!
- Other tiggers, come out, come out, wherever you are!
- Other tiggers!
- Come out, come out, wherever you are!
- And aren't! Et cetera!
- Hello! Tigger's family!
- Hello! Tigger's family!
- Where are you?
- Pooh bear?
I didn't know Tigger had a family.
Yes. Only it appears... that he has lost them.
Seemed to be lookin' for 'em.
Uh, was that something we were supposed to be doing too?
Why, I believe it must be, Piglet.
I quite often remember to forget these sorts of things.
Oh, no, no.
Aren't you coming, Rabbit?
Huh? To look for more tiggers?
As if one wasn't bad enough.
No, no! No!
I have too many winter preparations to make.
And-- And if you three had any sense, you'd be doing the same.
Come on.
- Hello! Hello!
- Hello!
- Tiggers! Come out, come out, wherever you aren't!
- Tiggers!
- Hello! Tiggers!
-Just where aren't those tiggers anyway?
We looked every which and where... not to mention right over there... and not a single stripedy tree in sight.
Maybe I've been going about this all the wrong way upside down.
Maybe what I need to do is find some sort of clue... as to where are their whereabouts.
What kind of clue?
Maybe in here. Some thingamabob or an heir-i-loom or something.
Oh! Maybe this belonged to my uncle!
Whatever.
And just think... if there are other tiggers, we could all bounce... the Whoop-de-Dooper, Loop-de-Looper,
Ali-Ooper Bounce!
'Cause it's the bounce that tiggers do best.
The Whoop-de-w--
What kind of bounce?
Oh, you know, that bounce I bounc-ed when I bounced that big rock... the most hardest bounce of them all that only the very bestest bouncers can bounce.
- You know.
- Only the very bestest bouncers... can bounce it.
Oh! Could my auntie have made this for me?
I could bounce it.
It looks like she made a pair.
If you could teach me the Whoopy
Super-Duper Bounce, then I could--
Teach ya the W-D-double-L-A-O-B?
What? That's ridickerous!
Why, it-- it's a--
It's a very powerful bounce, and it's only... for professional bouncers.
But I'm a real good bouncer.
Hoo, hoo, hoo.
No offence there, Roo boy... but I think you're a little on the smallish side of tiny... and kinda lackin' in perpendicaler.
I-l could do the Whooper Dooper, uh--
The Looper Dooper, uh--
If you teach me.
Oh, you can't bounce the bounce... if you can't even pronounce the bounce.
Repeat after Tigger.
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
It's got the zip that makes you flip and that's what really counts
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
Now, half this bounce is 90 percent mental.
If you calculate the specific tiggerjectory... of your stripecelleration dicipherus... by the square boot of your rebounce, your vertical situituation indicator... and your stripersonic springnertia should ric-a-ticochet... your hydranific fu-silly-age... into an accelerometric de-orbit!
- Any questions?
- When do I get to learn the Whooping Looper Whooper--
I mean, the Looper
Dooper Whooper, uh--
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
Now, you swing your legs up high, and you twist your tail in tight.
Wind up all your springs... and with your eyes situated straight ahead... you let it all loose.
Um, is this right?
It's best when done by tiggers
'cause ourtiggerific figgers
Are filled with vim sand vigours and that's the thing that triggers
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce
- The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts
- Right.
It activates, it elevates accelerates and more
- Whee!
- You're bouncing off the ceiling like you never did before
- The Whoop-de-Dooper
- Whoop-de-Dooper
- Loop-de-Looper
- Loop-de-Looper
Ali-Ooper
Bounce
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Wow! Now me! Now me!
Tut, tut, tut!
Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wait a minute.
We haven't gone over all the safety rules and regularations.
- Aw!
- Rule number one:
Always bounce in a well-lit area.
Rule number the-next-one:
Never bounce near an open flame.
Rule three: Never bounce right after eatin', or you'll get tail cramps.
- First you-- And then you--
- Rule number four:
Do not forget rule number--
And then you let it all loose with a--
Rule number--
Whoo!
Whoa!
I think you let it a little too loose.
Maybe another lesson?
I could--
What is this doohickey?
Why, that's no doohickey.
It's a thingamabob.
Been in the family for generations.
And I never even knew
I had a doo-- Hoo, hoo, hoo!
This is the exact thingamabob
I was lookin' for.
And it must have a picture... of my tigger family inside it.
- Oh, boy!
- Oh! I can't wait.
I'll bet I got my mother's eyes... and my father's tail and-and-- one of my sister's chins, of course.
My grand pappy's stripes.
It's kind of, sort of--
Empty.
Completely tiggerless.
How am I supposed to find my family now?
M-Maybe there's another way to reach 'em.
Another way?
A letter!
Why don't you write 'em a letter?
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- Hello!
- Hello?
- Hello out there.
Hello! Tigger's family?
Tigger's family tree.
Hello!
Uh, how will we know a tigger family member... when we see one?
I suspect that he, or she... would be rather more bouncy than usual, Piglet.
I found 'em--
Tigger's family.
- Really?
- Oh! Where, Eeyore?
Here they are, bouncin' like anything, stripes and all.
No need to thank me.
Do these particular tiggers seem... rather strange to you, Piglet?
Y-Y-Yes, and rather f-fierce.
Still, I suppose you never can tell with tiggers.
Pardon me, Mr-- or Mrs-- Tigger... but could you perhaps accompany me back to Tigger's house?
He misses you very much, you see.
And he--
Oh, bother.
Uh-- Uh, hello, tigger family member.
Uh, uh, I was wondering--
That is, i-i-ifyou're not too busy--
Oh! Whoa!
D-D-Dear.
Sinkin'? Figures.
If I could just have a moment?
But-But please come back!
We really need your help.
It would just take a minute. Oh, bother.
Nice tigger.
Ooh, hoo!
I-l don't remember tiggers being quite this s-slippery, do you, Pooh?
Well, now that
I think of it...
I don't remember a tigger making quite that sort of sound either.
- Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh bear?
I don't think these are the right sort of tiggers after all.
Not that anyone will miss me.
Let me see now.
"Dear T-l-double-geh-ers. Tiggers.
Greetin's and salivatin's!
Please drop by any old time... on account of my house... is your house, and vice-y verse-y.
Love, Tigger."
Hoo, hoo.
There! That oughta do it!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now there's nothin' to do... but wait.
- Hello, Tigger's family.
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Tigger's family?
- Are you out there?
- Anybody out there?
Why, if my tummy is not mistaken... this particular family tree... is a bee sort of family tree.
And where there are bees... there's honey.
Um, I think there may be something moving... in this tree.
D-Do you think it could be...
Tigger's family up there,
Pooh bear?
I suppose there's only one way to find out, Piglet.
Just as my tummy suspected.
Ow!
Bother. If only these bees were a bit less... busy.
Perhaps if I hummed a soothing sort of song...
Like such:
Go to sleep
Shh, quiet lf you're a bee
A lullaby
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
Rest your wings
Till the morning light
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
Your honey
Is safe tonight
Just dream to the tune
I 'am singing
Time to stop
All that buzzing and
Stinging
Mm, ouch.
Lullabee, lullabee
Honey bees in the tree
All I want is a smackrel
Or two
Or three
Don't sleep lightly
Sleep very tightly
Happy slumbers
To you
Shh.
Pooh bear's been up in that tree an awful long time, don't you think?
Most likely he's stuck.
Been known to happen.
Oh, d-dear!
Then l-- I'd better climb up and-and see if he's all right.
Uh, Pooh bear.
- Uh, a-a-are you stuck?
- Oh!
Oh, bother.
Uh, Pooh bear?
- Oh! Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh?
- I have come to the conclusion that--
- Whoa! that these bees are definitely not the right sort of tiggers!
It doesn't look good.
Bees! Run!
At last, the day had come to an end... as days often will.
And what had begun as a very exciting idea... had changed to a rather discouraging one.
Tigger?
Uh, I gotta go home now.
Mama will be worried about me.
Tigger?
Oh, what, am I kiddin' myself?
They're not comin'...
'cause I might as well face it-- there aren't any other tiggers.
I guess that means this silly old thing's... just gonna stay empty for... all of forever.
But isn't that the wonderful thing about tiggers... being the only one?
You betcha, Roo boy.
Oh, the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm
The very only
Last, lonely, single... s-s-s-solitary... one.
First, l--
And just so--
And then l--
Like this. And then a little twist, like such.
And then I let it all loose with a--
Oh! Whatever are you doing, Roo, dear?
I'm practising the Whoop-de-Doop-Tee Bounce.
Maybe if I do it really good for Tigger... he wouldn't miss not having a family so much.
But I can't bounce it yet.
Well, I'm sure you'll be able to do it in time, dear.
But Tigger seems awful lonely, don't you think, Mama?
I suppose he might be every now and again.
- Mama?
- Yes, dear?
I wish I had a big brother like Tigger.
Now, why wish that... when you have a Tigger like Tigger?
'Cause then I'd be his little brother... and he'd be just like one of our family.
- Wouldn't that be great?
- But, Roo, dear...
Tigger is one of our family.
And as long as we care for him, he always will be.
Sweet dreams, Roo, dear.
I still wish I could do something to make him feel better.
I say, young Roo, if you suggest that a letter... would bring cheer to our friend Tigger... then we shall, by all means, write one!
Now, uh, what sort of letter is this to be?
It's by us from them to him.
By which from what to whom?
From Tigger's family to Tigger.
Ah, yes!
"Dear Tigger,
Just a note to say--"
Uh, "just a note to say"?
What shall it say?
Well, uh...
I suppose it might say... um, "dress warmly"?
Oh, oh, I see.
Excellent advice.
Oh, Owl?
Perhaps-- "Eat well"?
Good point, Pooh bear.
"Stay safe and sound"?
Oh, a very good idea, Piglet.
"Keep smilin'."
"We're always there for you."
"Wishing you all the best.
Signed, Your Family."
- There.
- Won't Tigger be pleased?
- Yes, yes, how wonderful for Tigger.
- What a splendid idea.
- Nice, everybody.
- Yes, marvellous work, everyone.
And so, the next morning--
Hello, everybody!
Pooh boy!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Pigilet!
Kanga! Kanga!
Roo! Roo! Roo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Eeyore! Eeyore, old buddy!
Look at what I got. A letter, a letter for me! That's who. Hoo, hoo, hoo!
T-l-double-geh-er spells Tigger!
I, uh, wonder who it might be from.
From my very own family!
I knew I had one.
A great big family!
Full of uncles and aunties... and-and grand-tiggers and second-cousin tiggers!
And they're all just like me.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
Just imaginate it.
Hundreds of thousands of tiggers!
All bouncin' around up there in our huge gigantical family tree!
There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers
And tiggers In ever knew
Like sister tiggers and brother tiggers
And cousin tiggers too
There's grandma tiggers and grandpa tiggers as you can plainly see
When we're all together it's ajumpin 'jamboree
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
There's huge slews of nephew tiggers
Uncle tiggers by the ton
There's whippersnappin 'grandpappy tiggers and grandma tiggers are fun
There's skinny, little tiny little thin, little tiggers
Roly-poly tiggers too
But we're all relations and we're quite a mighty crew
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
- 'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
- The Amazing Flying Tiggers!
'Round my family tree
We're a happy family
The firstest-most roots of my family tree
Reach way backin history
To the braverest, fiercerest noblerest tiggers
You'd ever care to see
The heroicest figgers of my ancestor tiggers
Has always been hailed and cheered
And the sculpturous grace of our tiggerous faces
Is why we're all revered
There were warrior tiggers
Explorier tiggers
And tiggers of worldly acclaim
There were glorious fantazmagorious tiggers
With prizes and fortunes and fame
There's the glamorous branch and the amorous branch
Of our fabulous family tree
And when we sing together
We're in perfect harmony
'Round and 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me
'Round and 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers
And tiggers In ever knew
Hoo, hoo.
Like uncle tiggers and nephewtiggers
And grandma tiggers too
And when we tiggers all get together
We really have a ball
The bounciest, trounciest flounciest, pounciest
Most tiggerifigest
Family reunion of all
Everybody bounce! You know how to do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. And-- I'm especially excited about this part-- they miss me somethin' awful!
And they're comin' to see me tomorrow!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
T-T-Tomorrow?
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, Tigger, I can't wait to meet them.
Now, w-w-w-where did it say that exactly?
Exackatackly nowhere, per se...
'cause with us tiggers, you got to read betwixt the lines.
I'm gonna see my whole family! 'Cause my whole family is all comin' to see...
Little old you-know-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now, Tigger was so enormously excited... that his friends couldn't help but feel, well, a bit concerned.
Tigger?
Tigger?
- Tigger?
- Oh, hiya, Roo.
What are ya doin', Tigger?
Why, I'm buildin' a family room on to my house!
So my family will have plenty of room!
They got to live somewheres after the big family reunitin' party.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- Party?
- Why, sure!
Boy, it's gonna be great.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
It's all right in my letter.
Speakin' of which, you wanna hear me read it once or thrice again?
- Uh, Tigger--
- "Dear--" They call me "dear."
It's embarrassin', ain't it, the way us tiggers go oozin' oodles and doodles of affection?
- Yeah, but--
- "Dear Tigger--" Ya see that?
Us tiggers always call us tiggers by their firstest names.
"Dress warmly."
They're worried sick about me.
"Eat well. Keep smilin'.
Stay safe and sound."
And here is the best part of all.
"We're always there forya."
Isn't this the all-time greatest?
Yeah, the greatest.
I was gonna tell him, but I couldn't.
Pooh, do you think you could?
Why, certainly, Roo.
Could what?
Tell him, uh, about the letter?
Why, certainly.
Could that be them already?
Tiggers are usually fashion bubbly late.
Welcome, dear brothers, to the house of Tigger!
Oh. Hiya, buddy bear.
You're just in time to help me finish up with the finishin' up.
- Hold these here while I put those there.
- Uh, Tigger... there is a very important matter which I must discuss.
You're right, Pooh boy! I could use another balloon or two dozen.
Um, Tigger?
Hmm. Something isn't right here.
Much better. Now, what'd you want to talk about, Pooh boy?
Pooh?
Perhaps I'll need a bit of help.
Tigger was so very excited... and had so very many things to do... he heard very little of what anyone else was saying.
But as it so happened... none of his friends had the heart to tell Tigger... very much of anything anyway.
Not like he won't find out for himself... sooner or later.
Oh, poor dear.
He'll be so disappointed.
- Oh, d-d-dear.
- Indeed.
Oh, what have we done?
Oh, perhaps his family will come... and everything will be fine.
That's it!
There!
A veritable work of art.
Ah. And just how will this cheer up Tigger?
Uh, well, uh, the stripes look okay.
But what we have to do is act real tiggery.
We gotta do a lot of bouncing... and say a lot of tigger stuff.
Yes, such as,
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"
"Absoposilutely."
That's kinda sorta like--
Like Tigger, but, um--
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
Ah!
You've got to look like a tigger
-And-And sound like a tigger
-And act like a tigger too
If we paint black stripes on our underwear
And glue on whiskers too
We're bound to appear far more as tiggers do
Ha, ha. Unquestionably.
Maybe we could all say T. T.F.N. and shout hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
We all might sound a lot more tiggerish too
You think?
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger
And act like a tigger too
If we break things up and knock things down
And leave the place a mess
That's the thing that Tigger does the best
I oughta know.
And if I don't eat honey from the honey pot
Ol' Tigger will plainly see
I must be another tigger because I couldn't possibly be me
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger
And act like a tigger--
Um, also.
Oh! Thank goodness I found you all here.
There's a terrible storm headed for--
What on earth are you doing?
Stripes? Springs?
Have you lost your minds?
You should be covering the windows!
Counting your supplies!
Gathering firewood!
Winter is here, and-and you aren't even ready.
What are you doing wasting your time with--
What am I doing wasting my time?
I've got serious work to do!
At least I haven't lost sight of what's really important.
Well, l-l-l really didn't have enough time... to gather any firewood.
I am down to this...
Last lonely honey pot.
Well, come to think of it, uh... we don't really look or act very much like tiggers.
Thought I was pretty convincing.
Wait! Wait! We gotta do it!
We have to do it!
Think how sad
Tigger's gonna feel.
Oh, but we don't really know how to be a tigger.
Yeah, we do. Um--
If we could all be happy
Full of friendliness and cheer
He'll surely see we are his family
Ah!
We're filled with joy and laughter
And the happiness he starts
Candlelit from the bottom
Of our hearts
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you you've got to be like a tigger
-Full of glee like a tigger with a happy
-Hoo, hoo, hoo
- How to be a tigger
- How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger is up to you
You've got to be like a tigger full of glee like a tigger
With a happy hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
I wonder where they could be.
What if they got the wrong directions?
What if they strayed off the beaten path?
What if they're out there hopelessly lost?
Clutched in the cruel grasp of winter?
Hold on, tiggers!
I'm comin' to get ya!
Surprise!
Is it-- Is it--
Is it really you... my very own one and only family?
- Yep, yep!
- Come in, come in!
There's a lot of catching' uppin' we gotta do.
We haven't seen each other in--
We haven't seen each other!
Ooh! Ooh.
Um, gee, it's, um, nice... to have all us tiggers gettin' together like this.
- Huh?
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.
- Sure.
- It certainly is.
What am l--
Where the heck are my mannerisms?
Uh, uh, r-r-refreshin' refreshyments for all.
Hoo, hoo.
Comin' right up. Hoo, hoo.
Help yourself. Don't be--
Don't be shy. There you go.
Take two, you're small.
I mean, they're small.
- I mean, oh, here, have another. A lot of vitamins and minimals after all.
- Bother.
Oh, um, my, what-- what-- what a nice home you have.
Yes, and what lovely decorations.
So bouncety and, uh, stripedy.
- Nice weather.
- Party flavour?
Now this party's really startin' to pick up. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- So, what you been up to, cousin?
- I-l-l-- I've been, uh--
Bouncin'! Bouncin', bouncin', mornin' and noon, and noon to night.
Why, that's what I've been doin' too!
It must run in the family.
Hey, who's up for some family-type fun and games?
You look like a fun-lovin' type offella.
I got a great party-type, family-type game we can play.
How about pin the tail on the do--
It looks like you already been playin' it.
- Whew!
- I know.
Let's all do what tiggers do best.
That would be bouncin', of course.
- Oh, yes, what a lovely idea.
- Oh, of course, bouncin' again.
- Yeah!
- Let the bouncin' begin!
Yeah!
Bounce. Bounce.
Oops.
I do enjoy bouncing.
- Bounce, bounce.
- Don't bounce too high now, Roo.
Tigger. Tigger, dear.
You certainly have a wonderful family, Tigger.
Wait a second! We gotta bounce the Whoop-de-Dooper...
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce!
What a tiggerific idea!
Guests first.
You gotta swing your legs up high.
And you twist your tail in tight.
You wind up all your springs... and with your eyes, fix them straight ahead... you let it all loose and go...
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"
Roo! What are you doin' impersonizin' a tigger?
Piglet?
Kanga. Owl.
- Eeyore!
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.
We only wanted to help, Tigger.
Oh. Oh.
Now I understand.
It was all a big joke.
Well, that's all right...
'cause somewhere out there... there's a tigger family tree full of my real tigger family.
I've got a letter to prove it.
And I'm gonna find 'em, so...
T.T.F.E.
Ta-ta forever!
Poor Tigger, all alone in the cold.
He must be very sad... and perhaps lost.
And maybe even a bit... hungry.
Bother.
Pooh, you gotta help me find Tigger.
It's all my fault.
He never would have left if it wasn't 'cause of me.
I didn't mean to make him feel bad.
I just-- I-l just wanted him to-- to be my big brother.
Oh. Oh.
We gotta go find him.
We just gotta.
And so we will.
What we need is-- think, think, think-- an exposition.
- An expotition?
- Yes.
To the place where Tigger is.
Or was. Or will be?
I believe Rabbit should lead us.
- Rabbit?
- Oh, yes.
He's the only one who ever says he knows what he's doing.
Absolutely not.
I mean, uh--
Well, after all, he, uh--
I-It was not, uh, my-- he, um--
He wanted to leave, uh, didn't he?
But, Rabbit--
He could always give that extra little push... when you needed it.
Oh, thank you, Roo.
I-It was n-nice to have him here when things were fr-frightful.
Sort of lit up the room when he came in.
Uh, well, uh--
Y-- Well--
What do you need, uh, me for?
Why don't you, uh, go find him yourselves?
But we're just not clever enough,
Rabbit.
Rabbit. I miss him.
Well, l, uh, oh--
Oh, very well.
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger.
Now, now, uh, careful, everyone.
It's a bit windy!
Are you all right, Eeyore?
Eeyore? Oh! Oh, d-d-dear!
- Help! Ooh!
- Uh, we must take care... to stick together.
Perhaps not this stuck, Piglet.
P-P-P-Pardon me, P-Pooh.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Where are ya?
- Tigger!
Tiggers!
Tiggers!
Where are you, tiggerseses?
I-- I hope they're all okay.
Tiggers!
Tiggers! Whoa! Whoa!
The biggest, hugest... and most gigantical, stripedy tree... in all the entire
Hundred Acre Woodses!
Is it-- Is it--
My family tree!
My family tree!
I found it. I found it.
I can't believe it!
Hello! Hello up there!
Where are you, tiggers?
It's me, Tigger!
Hello! Hello, family!
I got your letter, and-- and I came to see ya!
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Maybe they forgot I was comin'.
But...
I thought-- I thought you were always there for me.
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Where are you, Tigger?
- T-Tig-- g-g-g-er!
Oh, th-th-th-th-than-- th-th-th-th-th--
Oh, you're-- you're welcome.
Tigger!
"Dear Tigger."
Tigger? Is that you?
Tigger! Tigger, it's me, Roo!
- Down here!
- Oh, Tigger. Thank goodness.
- Tigger! Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger! Tigger!
- What? Hello? Did s--
- Could it be?
- Tigger, look. Tigger, down here.
It looks like the whole family is finally here!
I'm comin', tiggers!
Tiggers! Tiggers!
- Hey, you're not tiggers.
- It's so wonderful.
What are you guyses doin' here?
"Doing"?
What are we doing here?
We came all this way to look for you.
Now-- Now forget about all this "other tiggers" nonsense... and, uh, come home.
Nonsense?
No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Are you, uh-- Are you crazy?
- It's not safe out here.
- Exactakly!
That's why you should all go home where it is safe.
But I've gotta wait here in my family tree... for my real family!
Family! Family! Family!
- Family!
- Is that a rumbly in your tumbly, Pooh?
I don't think so, Piglet.
Come on, hurry up.
No time for dawdling.
Not a second to waste.
Watch yourself there, Roo boy.
Take care, Pooh bear!
Don't be scared, Piglet.
Up ya go, donkey boy!
Help! Oh, no, no!
Tigger!
Oh, no! Oh!
The Whoop-de-Dooper,
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce.
The more you try, the more you fly.
And that's what really counts!
Tigger! Tigger!
Wake up, Tigger!
Wake up!
Tigger?
- Yes!
- We're alive!
- You saved him, Roo.
- That was just wonderful, Roo.
- Oh, Roo, that was very brave.
- Hooray.
What a Whoop-de-Doopin',
Loop-de-Loopin'
Ali-Oopin' Bounce that was!
It was, wasn't it?
I mean, I really did it, didn't l?
Did ya?
Come here, you. Why, that bounce was just as good as any old tigger fa--
Tigger... family member.
Tigger?
Please don't go.
There they are.
We found them.
We found them.
- There's Tigger!
- Roo! Oh, Roo.
- Mama! Mama!
- We've been searching all over for you.
- How wonderful.
Oh, Roo, dear,
I was so worried.
I'm sorry, Mama.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, my little Roo.
Pooh bear!
- Pooh bear!
- Christopher Robin.
Pooh bear! Pooh!
There you are.
- Silly old bear.
- Oh, my!
- Nice to see ya.
- Where have you all been?
We were looking for Tigger looking for Tigger's family.
Tigger's family?
You didn't have to go looking for them.
But-- But I got a letter, and-- and it said that-- that--
It was right-- Oh.
I must have lost it in the avalanchee.
I can't even remember the words.
Dear Tigger, just a note to say--
Dress warmly.
- Eat well.
- Stay safe and sound.
Keep smilin'.
We're always there for you.
- Signed--
- Your family.
You mean you fell as are my family?
I'm afraid we have nothing better to offer.
Well, of course not, Pooh boy...
'cause there's nothin' better than the best!
I should have seen it all along.
Spotted you a mile away.
Then the whole mountain came down on top of us.
- But Tigger saved us!
- I wasn't worried at all... except for the part where I was worried, of course.
Ahem, ahoom and et cetera.
In honour of this most occasional occasion... my firs test ever family reunitin'...
I'd like to present each ofya with a present!
Firs test, for Eeyore!
A new family room for your lovely home.
Seems kind of big.
Bit on the comfy side.
Not very drafty.
But I suppose
I'll get used to it.
I love parties so much.
And for Pooh boy, enough honey to last all winter.
Or till next Thursday anyways.
Why, thank you, Tigger.
It looks good enough to eat.
And for Piglet, old pal, a winter's worth of firewood.
- Keep warm.
- Oh, thank you, Tigger!
Well, you're very welcome.
I think I'll eat a piece myself.
And for you, long ears,
I promise from now on...
I'll always watch where I'm bouncin'.
Oh, well, thank you, uh, uh, Tigger.
Bravo, Tigger! Bravo, I say.
Very well done indeed.
- I'm very impressed.
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you, Tigger.
- Thank you so much, Tigger.
- Oh, look at this.
- Whoa!
You didn't think I was gonna disremember you, did ya?
Go on. Go on. Open her up.
It's all yours.
Is it really for me, Tigger?
Only the best for my bestest little brother.
Wait halfa minute.
We still need a family portrait to put in it.
Look this way, everybody.
Closer.
Smile.
Sunny days and starry nights
And lazy afternoons
You're countin 'castles in the clouds
And hummin' little tunes
But somehow right before your eyes
The summer fades away
Everything is different
And everything has changed
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Home
Funny how photograph
Can take you backin time
To places and embraces
That you thought you'd left behind
They're tryin' to remind you
That you're not the only one
That no one is an island
When all is said and done
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Home
There'll come a day
When you're losin' your way
And you won't know where
You belong
They say that home is where the heart is
So follow your heart
And know that you can't go wrong
If you feel lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
- If you feel lost
- Lost and on your own
And far from home
You're never alone, you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waitin' there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you
Where you belong
I know your heart
Will lead you
Home
Must you go?
I've promised.
I said I'd go to him.
But you'll never make it back!
Thank you.
Don't go! Please!
I've always...
An earthquake!
You OK, Boss?
- Yeah.
- We're ready. The van's loaded.
Be right there.
Gomeo Studoos
It is with regret that
Ginei Studios, Ltd... announces its studio facility is obsolete and will be closed.
This project celebrates its greatest star, Fujiwara Chiyoko... who sustained it through much of its 70-year history...
This is voice-over!
I can't be in the shot!
If you'd gotten permission to interview her sooner... we wouldn't have to fake it!
She's not a performer anymore!
Then you should have shot this
30 years ago!
The crazy old biddy... hiding herself away like some hermit!
Next time I kill you!
But no matter how big a star she was, she's over 70 now.
I mean... she's old!
Look!
There it is!
Let's not expect too much, eh?
We don't even know... what she looks like now.
She'll never grow old!
Um...
Missus!
Does Miss Fujiwara live here alone?
She has for years... her friends are her books and her garden.
This is her own homemade herb tea.
You are very lucky... she's agreed to let you interview her.
We went to a great deal of trouble finding her.
It's a great honor.
You said you had something to give her?
Uh, yes...
Usually before she'll meet anyone new, the earth has to move.
What has to move, Mino?
"The earth moves," Missus.
The earthquake... that one this morning.
Wasn't that something!
I thought my time had come!
How do you do?
I'm Fujiwara Chiyoko.
This is truly a great day.
We are most deeply honored.
Oh, don't be so formal.
You're from studio...
"Rootasu".
It means "lotus".
Oh, I love lotuses!
I'm aware of that.
Thus the name of our studio...
They'll be in flower soon out back.
In poetry they symbolize...
Yes! "Simple purity."
Well, Mr. Tachibana... you mentioned you have 'something' for me.
Oh, yes! I'm sorry...
I've kept this...
I've kept this for you until I could find you.
I've put that out of my mind for years.
Was that the key to something important?
To the most important thing there is.
Thank you, Mr. Tachibana.
But where did you get this?
Uh... well, many years ago someone at Ginei Studios found it.
I never thought
I'd hold it in my hand again.
Well, I guess the earth is telling us to get started.
Uh, certainly.
My fate seems to be tied to earthquakes.
I was born during one, in 1923.
The Great Kanto Earthquake...
My father had so wanted a child!
He was killed, and it was as if... his life had been traded for mine.
The shop he left behind... allowed my mother and me to live well.
I grew up in a dangerous world of one period of turmoil after another...
The politics of the day had veered to the right.
But girls' magazines were more important to me, I guess.
I'd gaze at the pictures and dream of the day I'd meet my prince.
Was that when... the studio discovered you?
I'll never know... what the managing director of Ginei Studios... saw in a snub-nosed little girl on her way to school.
Is there nothing I can say?
Nothing.
My mother here... thinks that being an actress is a dubious profession.
"Dubious," she called it?
Madame!
Our new film is set in Manchuria.
It will cheer on our soldiers there... and encourage all the people of our nation!
Surely...
Chiyoko wants to be of service to her country!
Um...
Perhaps, but this child is far too timid to ever be an actress!
She will find a husband and the shop will become hers.
Isn't that right?
Does a sweetshop matter more than a nation?!
Does a woman not serve her nation by staying home and bearing children?
Natoomal Health Week
Your Natoom Needs You!! 
Um...
What are we filming?
Chiyoko!
I feel like a stalker!
Sorry!
I was in a hurry.
Something's going on...
Keep out of it!
- He's not here!
- Go that way!
Did a man come this way?
Carrying something in a cloth?
He ran that way.
Go!
Hey...
It takes guts to shelter someone like that!
Who is that guy?!
May I see?
It's just a sketch.
I'll finish it when I get home.
In winter there it's white with snow as far as you can see.
I want to set up my easel in all that snow... and finish the painting while I'm so cold it hurts.
In that pure white landscape... you feel like you're on some strange, distant world.
I'd love to go there.
Yeah...
To thank you, I'll invite you there when peace comes.
The full moon...
Not till tomorrow.
But I like this moon best.
After the full moon it starts to wane.
But with the 14th night, there's still tomorrow... and hope.
I have to leave.
But you're hurt!
My friends are fighting in Manchuria.
A paintbrush isn't much help, though.
This? It's the key to the most important thing there is.
The most important thing?
Guess.
I don't know. But don't tell me.
Give me till tomorrow.
Promise?
Tell us!
You're in love with someone!
First love!
I...
Isn't that sweet!
Even old people were young once.
Isn't that the key you brought her?
He can't have gone far!
Keep looking!
Miss!
Thank heavens you're all right!
There was a thief in the storeroom!
He's OK.
He made it to the station.
I'm so glad you're not hurt!
The Chief Clerk! Yes!
This is hard work!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
I'll come!
I'll come to you!
Now that's drama!
I cried 53 times at this scene!
When did this turn into a movie?!
That's when I started making films.
I see.
How did that start?
Well, you remember the managing director said... his next film was set in Manchuria...
Manchuria! Of course!
Thank you, Chiyoko.
I knew you'd say yes!
Well, I should serve my country... shouldn't I?
I see...
You were just following that man!
Yes!
I didn't care about movies!
Chiyoko's playing the title role.
How do you do?
I'm sure you recognize...
Shimao Eiko, our biggest star...
Hello, Chieko.
Aren't we pensive!
Hey!
He is...
Give it back!
Looks like Dad found me an actress!
Well! You work fast, "sonny".
"Chizuko," wasn't it?
"Chiyoko."
This is "Mr. Otaki", the managing director's son.
A promising young director.
He loves auditioning actresses.
Sorry. I shouldn't tease.
Someone left it with me.
If I see him in Manchuria,
I want to give it back.
We're not going there for fun.
Who is he? What's his name?
I don't know.
Then how will you find him?
He paints.
- Paints what?
- I don't know.
Not even that?
But...
I'm sure he's in Manchuria!
Never heard of anyone like that.
I remember this!
But I'm sure he's around here!
I don't need amateurs hanging around!
I'm not leaving!
I've crossed a whole ocean... to get here, and...
I... I...
Director! What's going on here?!
This girl doesn't know her lines!
OK, OK!
Once you've made yourself into your character... the lines will come welling up naturally from inside.
Yes, sir.
I told you this was no role for a rank amateur!
I... I just want to see him!
Great! Let's do a take!
Well done.
That was great.
You can act.
What's wrong with you?
So... any clues to the guy who owns the key?
You still haven't given up?
Why not try a fortune-teller?
There's one near here they say is very good.
Divination
The man you seek is in the north.
He paints. He's tall.
And would he happen to be searching for a key?
Do you know him?
If that's the man...
Tell me! Please! Where is he?
Leaving the shoot?!
That's unprofessional!
You just don't understand women.
And you do?
Mass Roumdup Of Actovosts
Im North Mamchuroa
He's a lucky guy, if she's willing to follow him this far.
Would that it were me!
Chiyoko! Chiyoko!
Nationalists?
Communists?
Look!
Bandits!
Miss Fujiwara! Chiyoko!
Hey! This is really happening!
Chiyoko! Speak to me!
Oh... excuse me.
Boss! Let's get out of here!
Where'd the bandits go?!
What's the meaning of this?!
That's what I'd like to know!
Where did Manchuria go?!
Your Highness!
Where is he?
My lord is in the castle!
Your Highness! You mustn't!
My lord!
My lord!
Why would you not wait for me?!
I... I...
You cried at all her films?
Stay your dagger.
Wraith! Do you haunt this castle?
Call me what you will.
Since before you were born
I have known you.
What do you wish?
To assist at my death?
Drink!
What may not be in this world will be in the next.
So I must die...
There he awaits.
That is Thousand-Year Tea!
Now you will burn forever in the flames of eternal love!
I am deceived?!
I hate you!
More than I can bear!
And I love you!
More than I can bear!
One day you will understand!
Boss! No!
Genemon, Marshall of Nagato, at your service!
Since when?!
I will lay down my life to save Your Highness!
I will not leave My lord.
Wraith! Be damned!
I regret to say My lord has been taken captive.
My lord?! Does he yet live?!
You must return to your land!
I come for the Prince!
Onward, Torakichi!
Who?!
Your Highness!
I will go to him!
Your Highness!
Nagato!
Your Highness!
I will not forget your loyalty!
May fortune be yours!
It seems like yesterday.
You don't mind?
Not at all, Miss Fujiwara!
Any way you like.
Thank you.
Where was I?
Breaking through the enemy...
Where Nagato gets wounded.
Oh, yes...
If he was a prisoner,
I just had to help him somehow.
- What the?!
- Villainy!
Guard the prisoner!
I'm here to save you!
You'll never get the better of me!
Could a princess do that?
Behind you!
Finish her off!
Wait.
Who are you?!
Give me a break!
My name is of no importance.
You! You followed me!
Cut him down!
I'm good at being stubborn.
Why do you care about me?
I can't help it. I like you.
The same reason you insist on going to save him.
But I love him!
Stop talking and go.
Leave this fight to me.
I don't need any thanks.
I've always thought
I'd like to die... for the woman I love.
Maybe I should get myself fired...
Have at me, swords!
All of you at once!
Here comes help!
You little imp!
Where is he?!
Hmph! They weren't so tough!
Wait for me, Chiyoko!
I'm coming!
By now his head's on display in the capital!
Kyoto?!
For you, the road ends here!
He's in Kyoto!
Have pity!
No! I won't let you go!
I'll come back!
I just want to see him and give him what's his!
How nice of you!
A man about to be executed is in need of nothing now.
You poor fool!
Pursue him as long and as far as you may... you cannot escape your fate.
Neither you, nor her!
Don't just stand there!
Take her away!
On your feet!
Let me go! Please! Let me go!
I must go to him!
Now we're in Kyoto... faster than a speeding bullet train!
Another age, too...
Torakichi!
Where's Chiyoko?
You're not dressed for this era.
Don't you glare at me!
I taught you everything you know, and now you've shamed me!
You'll learn to listen to reason!
The fool! Making Eiko mad!
It serves her right!
Chiyoko doesn't know her place.
A few men like her and she thinks she's a geisha!
Watch her! Make sure she doesn't run away again!
Wasn't this supposed to be a documentary?
Damn right!
"The Seven Specters:
The Legend of Fujiwara Chiyoko"!
Old people these days!
Are you all right, Miss?
I'm fine.
Leave this to me.
Come this way.
He's in the city, isn't he?
Surely you don't think
I'd keep you locked in here!
I won't forget this!
When you first came here,
I felt I knew you already.
And I thought that some day
I'd like to help you.
And ever since then...
Chiyoko!
Pay attention!
Ajailbreak?!
Some rebel samurai got away!
Spread out!
Sorry.
It's me! Don't you remember?
We met on a winter's day, just like this!
I've searched and searched for you!
To give this back to you...
Wait!
Your key!
Keep it till we meet again.
Over there! Hurry!
You saw a samurai run past here, didn't you?
Where did he go?
That way.
I've seen you before...
You're hiding something.
Tell us.
You know which way he went.
Whoops!
Have no fear, Miss.
And here he comes at last!
You're a damned anti-government rebel!
And you're fools who don't know when your time has gone.
Get on, Miss... and leave the rest to...
Be careful!
You'll strain yourself!
Such kindness to a humble man!
Miss! I'll never forget...
Playing truant, are we?
Off to meet a certain
"human rights" agitator?
I don't understand...
We have proof!
He left you a little memento on your storeroom wall.
He did?!
So you do know him.
That's all I need to know.
We'll continue at the station.
You can tell us everything there.
Another stubborn one!
Tell them what they want to know.
I can't tell them what I don't know.
But I wouldn't tell them even if I knew.
I'd never betray him!
You little fool!
That's what you say now...
But feelings change.
I won't be like that!
I love him more every day!
Everyone's like that.
They say Eiko gave her man all the money she'd earned!
Then he ran off with someone else!
I wish she'd pass some my way!
Huh?
Now what?
Miss! I'm here to save you!
- Who are you?
- Have you forgotten?
I'm Gen the rickshaw man!
I've come, just as I promised... to repay your kindness!
Am I really being set free?
Didn't I say you would be?
We don't need you anymore.
We caught the guy.
Wait! Please!
Wait! Please!
Open the door!
Please! I just want to see him!
Please! Open the door!
Please! Open the door!
What's next?
What is this, science-fiction?
Idiot!
Is this your idea of gratitude?!
But the storehouse is on fire!
You little fool! What makes you think you can just die too?!
- Chiyo!
- Chiyo!
Chiyoko, come back!
Hurry!
Chiyoko!
Come on!
Wosteroa Sweets
It's a picture of her!
Umtol the day we meet agaom. 
Chiyoko!
Chiyoko! Chiyoko!
Are you all right?!
Chiyoko!
Chiyoko! Chiyoko!
You cannot escape...
You cannot escape!
Are you all right?
Are you feeling ill?
I'm fine. If you listen to doctors... you think that old people are always sick.
- We'll come back another day.
- No.
By tomorrow I won't remember...
After the war, it was all we could do to survive.
We had no food, no clothes...
Wanting to make good films was all that kept us going.
Every single day was busy.
But I always believed that some day... we'd meet again.
The world had changed, and I had no idea how to find him... there was always the chance... he'll see one of my films.
Yes, the mid-50's were the peak of your career...
Huh?!
Now you know.
You were at Ginei?
In the Otaki unit?
Uh, yes, but in far too minor a position... for you to have noticed me.
You should have told me!
Well, you know...
I was never a director or even a crew chief.
And I was always getting
Mr. Otaki angry.
Tachibana Genya.
How do you do?
Do a good job.
Eiko, this is Genya, a new apprentice.
I've always loved the dialogue between you and Fujiwara Chiyoko.
Yes, I set her off very well.
Never mention Chiyoko to her!
Remember one thing:
In this business we flatter both the audience and the actresses.
I'll show you how one of these days.
Uh... yes, sir.
Well, I certainly fell for it.
A film director is a lot like a painter, Chiyoko.
A painter puts the colors he likes on a canvas.
And I've found a great color for my canvas.
That color is you.
He seduced her with a line like that?
I should try that one...
I'm sorry!
Damn him!
Sorry.
Fujowara Choyoko
"The Madomma": 
I'm home!
I told you to tell them no!
You won't be everyone's
"Madonna" forever, you know!
A woman's happiness comes from making a home!
But I've got...
All the anti-government rebels have long been set free.
- He hasn't even come to see you!
- No!
I'm going to him!
You don't even know if he's alive or dead!
He's alive! I know it!
You won't be young forever!
We promised to meet some day!
You're too old for these little-girl dreams!
Cut!
What's wrong, Chiyoko?
Here we go again! I'm tired.
The old lady wants a break.
Take five!
The key's gone!
Yes! This is the day it happened!
Miss Eiko!
Is it lunch time?
Not yet.
Genya, get out to the stage.
The princess is not amused.
Please! Look everywhere!
I have to have it!
Don't just stand there! Get looking!
Yes, sir!
Looking for what?
Chiyoko's key!
So Eiko took it...
No one knew that then.
And we couldn't find it anywhere.
It didn't get up and walk away!
It's here somewhere!
What's it the key to, Chiyoko?
Yeah! I'd like to know!
- Me, too!
- Tell us, Miss!
Someone very dear to me gave it to me to keep.
Your boyfriend?
Her steady!
- I wonder what he's like!
- What's he like?
Is he handsome?
What did he look like...
- Like an actor?
- Who does he look like?
Who...
I can't remember!
Not even his face!
I loved him so much!
Now I can't even remember his face!
I'm sorry.
Not at all.
This tea has a wonderful aroma.
It's herb tea from my garden.
It's very good for you.
Shall we continue?
Soon after the key disappeared, you got married...
Yes, to Otaki.
It was as if I'd lost part of my heart with that key.
And I was too old to be dreaming anymore.
Yesterday, the 20th, 
at 11::47 p.m. Japam tome... 
sevem Amerocam astromauts... 
were laumched omto space
from Cape Camaveral. 
As the world watched, the rocket
achoeved orbot om five momutes. 
Darn!
Well, now she knows.
Eiko! What does this mean?
A farce by a great director... to win a popular actress.
And silly me took the role of the thief.
But...
I've always had a guilty conscience about you.
That fortune-teller... was a dirty trick...
It was wrong.
But I would have done anything to get rid of you.
Did you know where he was?
How would I know?
But a certain someone found out about my trick.
What did I ever do to you?
I was jealous!
Of your youth!
And how chasing after one man kept you young!
And I got stuck playing the older woman you'd run up against.
Now I've lost even the energy to hate you anymore.
Isn't this all far in the past?
Um...
We're in a meeting. Come back later.
There's someone here to see Miss Chiyoko.
You're Miss Fujiwara Chiyoko, aren't you?
What do you want now?
I'm sorry... you know me, then, don't you?
Go away!
I'm sure you hate me.
I was as evil as those I served in their abuse of power.
I am on a journey of atonement... for my sins before the war.
An anti-government painter we held left this to you.
He said he was in your debt, and wanted to thank you.
I am most truly sorry.
Chiyoko!

He's waiting for me!

Doctor!
Come back!
I'm going to give him this key!
Wait! Wait!
Please! Wait!
Please! Wait!
Wait!
I'll come to you!
Wherever I must go!
Must you go?
I promised.
I said I'd go to him.
But you'll never make it back!
- Chiyoko!
- Boss! Look out!
Chiyoko! I've always... cared for you!
It's a big one!
Chiyoko, look out!
Chiyoko! Run!
- Chiyoko!
- Are you all right?!
Move that stuff!
Chiyoko!
- Everyone help!
- Quick!
Chiyoko!
Hurry!
She's here! And Genya!
Are you all right?!
Ow!
Did you shield me?
- Yes.
- Way to go, Genya!
I hate you!
And I love you!
More than I can bear!
Chiyoko!
- Chiyoko, what's wrong?!
- Chiyoko!
Genya, what did you do?!
Nothing!
Imagine forgetting someone who saved my life!
No... I look different now.
It's been 30 years...
I've lived quietly since then.
Why did you do it?
After you vanished in Hokkaido, you went back to films.
After that studio accident... why did you go into hiding?
I never thought I'd see him again, even though...
I'd resolved... to follow him anywhere.
So then why?
After the accident,
I realized something.
I wasn't the girl he'd remember anymore.
I hate you!
More than I can bear!
I wanted him to see me as the girl I once was.
Chiyoko?
It's a big one!
Chiyoko!
You're always there to help me...
Chiyoko! Chiyoko!
In the end... she never again met the guy who gave her the key.
That old policeman...
That painter... refused to talk, right to the end.
So I tortured him.
I killed him.
So Chiyoko... was just chasing a shadow.
I'm sorry!
We asked too much of you.
No... I enjoyed it very much.
But I guess this is good-bye.
The doctor says you'll be fine!
You're a poor liar, aren't you?
Don't feel sad.
After all, I'm going... after that man again.
See? I have the key, thanks to you.
It's opened the door to my memories of him.
It's as if while I was talking to you... the girl I was came back to life.
This time you'll find him.
I'm sure of it!
I wonder...
But maybe it doesn't matter.
After all...
After all, it's the chasing after him
I really love.
- Nothing over here?
- Move to the next one!
- Easy, easy!
- Any luck?
- We need more sap today.
- Look out below!
- Any luck?
- A little higher.
A little to the left!
We don't have all day. Hurry!
- I found some
- Good.
Hoist them up!
I got it.
Heads up. How was that?
- Not so good
- Yeah, same here
Hey, Enode!
Working hard?
What would you know about work?
Always off playing.
I do not play, Enode. I explore.
A waste of time.
Our only duty is to serve the gods,
Kaena.
They protect us.
Come on, hurry up.
We'll be late for the offering.
Protect us!
They're not doing such a great job.
Here they come!
The monster.
It steals our sap and keeps us thirsty.
It has turned our planet into a wasteland.
My queen, these attacks are killing us.
Our world is dying.
You must safeguard our people from extinction.
Axis protect me!
Good, good...
Ilpo.
No move.
No move, or marauder will see.
No move.
Ilpo in trouble now.
No move!
I told you...
I warned you...
Ilpo broken.
All broken.
Ilpo, it is me, Kaena.
Don't be frightened.
Ilpo broken again today.
Three times.
Always broken since long time.
You are not broken, Ilpo.
The bug's not looking too good, but you're fine.
Here.
They don't grow like they used to.
It's weird, you have to go further and further to find vines that aren't dried up.
- How?
- Oh, that?
I had a little run-in with a sharken.
Kaena go too far.
Too close to Great Oblivion.
Oh, the Great Oblivion!
The sharkens aren‚Äôt afraid of it. You should see them diving into the clouds.
Kaena get broken!
No come back.
You came back.
Why won't you tell me what you saw?
That.
That, everywhere.
You've seen this stuff before?
Past the clouds?
You saw it past the clouds?
Marauder attack.
Ilpo no move.
Not to move.
Then fall, almost break.
The worm catch Ilpo.
The worm?
A worm caught you?
Then sleep.
Then see the man.
But not man...
Bad... bad!
Then too much light.
Very bright.
- Blue light.
- Blue light?
In my dreams, there's a blue sun.
Was it a blue sun below the clouds?
- Below or above.
- What?
Below or above.
Above or below.
Come on, Ilpo!
The Grand Priest!
Kaena must go!
Quick!
I know.
Time for another offering.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Did you just say something?
- Blurb
- No.
I heard you. Talk again!
That's ok. Pretend all you want.
Maybe you'll talk for my brother.
Kaena, where have you been?
Did you draw any more pictures?
- Show us Kaena!
- All right, all right.
But only if you promise not to tell.
The Grand Priest wouldn't like it.
- We promise.
- Uh-huh.
- You saw a sharken up close?
- Pretty close.
Is it a fast flier?
- Very fast.
- I'd love to have wings... so I could be free.
You don't need wings to be free.
Imagine another world, a beautiful place, with a blue sun, and so much sap you can swim in it.
Where is it Kaena? Have you seen it?
No. But I've dreamt about it and...
My children... we know that the sap is vital to our survival, but with passing time, it seems we are beginning to exhaust our resources.
- That's right.
- What are we going to do about it?
I understand your suffering.
Your suffering is my suffering.
But we must not doubt!
Who made us a gift of the Axis?
Who protects us from the Great Oblivion?
And its terrifying guardians?
The gods!
Who, at the moment of eternal peace, opens the gates of paradise for us?
The gods!
Who has given us life?
The gods!
Yes, our gods!
Let us examine our consciences.
Kaena, you won't believe what I found.
What is it this time, Essy?
A worm that talks. I've got him in the pen.
I want to see.
Why are they holding us?
They plan to eat us.
We have to escape from here.
Follow me!
Right. Ok, there's still some work to be done here but not by me.
I'm gonna go get my wings, and get out of here!
The master will want a full report of this.
- How silly, Essy.
- Hey, don't make fun of him!
I bet that worm talks better than you.
- On my word, that's so silly.
- Hey, Kaena...
- You like my brother, don't you?
- He's all right. A bit dull.
Is our faith unshakable?
Yes!
Do we not owe everything to our benevolent gods?
Then raise our offering to the Well of the gods!
The gods are angry!
We'll be cast into the
Great Oblivion!
No, my children, no!
This is a sign, don't you understand?
The gods are testing us.
Testing our faith.
We must trust in them, and put our lives in their hands!
Stay where you are.
To move is to defy the gods.
Be pure. Kneel.
Pray!
May the will of the gods be done!
Kaena, wait up!
Kaena, what are you doing?
He moved, Zehos.
The Grand Priest moved.
The gods saved him.
The gods don't care about him.
They don't care about us!
She's right. Why did they destroy the temple?
You. Go fix the pen!
- But it's true...
- Now!
Don't do anything stupid.
I saw you move!
My parents moved, and you called them Impure!
- Are you Impure?
- Kaena, you're upset.
You moved to save yourself.
The gods moved me.
They guided me.
- It is they who saved me.
- No.
The gods don't save anyone.
They didn't save my parents.
Your parents did not put their trust in the gods, Kaena.
So, why would the gods protect them?
Your parents made their choice.
I pray that it's not the choice that you will make.
Pray?
What's the point of that?
Your gods are deaf.
If they even exist.
Life is hard.
After your parents died, I raised you as my own daughter.
Took pride in your intelligence, your spirit.
And it wounds me that now you turn your gifts to blaspheming the gods instead of worshipping them.
Think of the life that awaits us beyond Axis!
Oh, I do!
- All the time.
- Ah, of course...
You think I am not aware you fill the children's heads with harmful lies?
Showing them drawings of imaginary creatures and places.
They're not imaginary, I've seen...
- In your dreams, is that it?
- They're real.
I've seen another world. I've seen a blue sun at the base of Axis.
Listen to yourself, Kaena.
Raving, like poor Ilpo.
Do you want to become like him?
Mashing bugs and whimpering in your sleep?
He's not crazy. He went past the clouds and saw...
The Great Oblivion!
And it made him mad!
No!
Look at this! This object is harder than the hardest sap.
Whoever made it was certainly not afraid of your gods.
Do not provoke the gods!
- Give me that!
- No.
You're trying to kill me.
- No, I only wanted...
- You've gone mad!
You've become a danger to us all.
Catch Kaena before she harms someone else.
Her actions are angering the gods, and putting all of our lives in peril.
Find her before she escapes the village.
I saw her! This way.
So, even a tough girl like you can cry.
I thought you'd come here.
I haven't been down here since we were kids.
But, we're not kids any more.
You were right.
Oh, Zehos, what am I gonna do?
Is that the knife?
He grabbed it, and I wasn't even thinking and just pulled away, and...
I know you didn't try to kill him.
Look...
I'll talk to the Grand Priest. He'll let you come back to the village.
I'd rather disappear into the Great
Oblivion than go back.
- Come on, Kaena!
- Listen to me!
There is another world out there.
And I'm gonna find it.
I'm sorry Grand Priest.
There's no sign of her.
May the will of the gods be done.
Hail to you, gods of my people!
I trust our offering was acceptable.
No!
It was not acceptable.
Is this the best you can do for your gods?
I'm sorry, Almighty!
Great troubles afflict our village.
The sap is drying up and...
We have a heretic. A young girl who dishonours you.
- How?
- She has run away, Almighty.
She wants to enter the
Great Oblivion...
Is your authority so weak over your people?
It is just one girl, Almighty.
- She has always been...
- One heretic... can pollute the others with impure ideas.
And then hardship will come to all of your people.
The girl is already dead.
Think no more of her.
Turn your devotion to the next harvest.
Do not insult us again!
We will not, Almighty.
You remember when we were kids, we used to have these contests, see who'd go farthest from the village.
And I'd always win.
Weren't you ever afraid?
Sure I was. But I didn't want you to know.
Anyway, I knew that Axis would always show me the way back.
"Axis, protect me!". That's what you used to say, right?
Like it was something alive.
It is alive. It talks to me.
Listen, when were kids it was all right...
But now we're supposed to be all grown up, right?
And spend our lives harvesting sap and eating worms and... never wondering what's on the other side of the clouds?
I didn't say that.
All I mean is...
Someone has to harvest the sap and... repair the huts and tend the worms.
Oh, you know, you used to be interesting.
Now you're boring.
Now you raise worms.
What else are we supposed to eat?
Anyway, I've got a little brother to look after.
- I can't just...
- Daydream like me, right?
- Go wire worms, Zehos!
- Kaena?
My children... the gods appeared to me last night.
They spoke to me.
They will punish Kaena.
And her treason has made them angry.
The gods are demanding another harvest of sap, by day's end.
Our offering must be better... or we will all perish.
Let us raise our offering to the Well of the gods!
Sap.
I need more.
There may not be much more, my queen.
Sap is drying up.
The villagers can't find any more.
I don't care about slaves!
Death!
Once we've killed that thing there will be.
Your Majesty, we have been trying to kill it for hundreds of years.
And these slaves are beginning to doubt.
If we ignore this, a riot could come.
I beg you, my queen, to consider the fusion now.
And what of our descendants?
Bled dry of sap by this monster?
Destroy!
It must be destroyed!
Your will be done, my queen.
Kaena, I...
It's ok, Zehos.
You've got to take care of Essy.
I'm sorry.
Find her!
A marauder!
Oh no! I'll see if she's all right.
No villager could have invented that worm's armour.
There must be a survivor.
Carefully.
Master, if I may respectfully submit, this is a complete and total waste of time.
She's nothing but a primitive being.
A surprising specimen.
This is the one you're telling me about, Assad?
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Master. It's her.
She's not like the others.
She's curious, and she's got a kind of intuition.
And the way she moves, it's as if she knows every branch and root.
And twice, I mean twice,
I've seen her close he eyes and just jump. As if something were guiding her.
- Not terribly scientific, Assad.
- I should say not.
But you say you've heard talk of a blue sun at the bottom of Axis?
Master, a delusional worm-eater sees a blue sun, and suddenly she's a prophet?
Please, Master,
This is completely irrational.
It hurts my brain! Ow!
It really does.
But what if Vecanoi survived the crash, Gommi?
That is an impossibility, Master.
Vecanoi was destroyed along with everything else.
It's all just scrap metal, scattered across Axis.
Most of it went into building this place.
So it's as if she somehow imagined Vecanoi?
Yes, master. An egg is what she imagined. She saw a blue egg.
A nice, glowing blue egg.
Maybe if we all thought it was a blue egg we could move on with our lives?
What's this?
Oh, she's violent too!
Back off, you... you creatures of the Oblivion!
You back off! And calm down.
You have nothing to fear from us.
Why have you brought her back here,
Gommi?
Don't ask me. Ask this genius.
Why did we?
She needed help.
And what do they do with the worms?
They eat them.
That's disgusting!
And they enjoy it.
Barbarians!
The Master would like to speak to you now.
What are they doing?
They're making the penultimate preparations to facilitate lift-off.
Lift-off?
Yes, this entire base is an intergalactic vessel.
What's that?
Typical humanoid beh... I'd don't think you'd be able to understand.
Assad, the Master wants
- you to come as well.
- OK.
You may take it.
It's yours.
Are.. are you gods?
No. My name is Opaz.
I am a mortal, just as you are.
I'm sorry we frightened you.
We mean you no harm.
You were badly injured, so we treated your wounds.
- And my knife?
- Later.
Your clothes are being repaired, by my prosthetics.
You mean the worms?
"Worms"?
Worms?
We happen to be hyper-evolved vermaform oligochaetes, with cognitive abilities far beyond the best artificial intelligence.
Let me explain something to you.
I, myself, can speak 1200 languages. identify over 10,000 galaxies, you see, and repair virtually any form of silicon-based technology. Hmm-hmm.
"Worms"? Pfff.. Indeed!
- We are worms.
- No we are not just worms!
- We are worms!
- And don't you talk Worm to me!
I heard you all back there, talking Worm.
And it's undignified.
It's disgusting!
It's beneath you.
But it is our language.
I do not talk "Worm".
I think I like our worms better.
They don't talk this much.
Let me explain to you, humanoid.
Those specimens are sadly not evolved.
You'll find that I, however, am your superior, in every respect.
Except that I can eat you.
I hope not.
I would be quite lost without
Gommi and the others.
I wouldn't have survived without them.
And I certainly couldn't have built this ship to return home.
Where is your home?
Far away from here.
My queen, this thing has defied your attacks for centuries.
It may outlive us all.
And if something should happen to you or I, our race will be forever extinguished.
As queen, you must protect your people.
Fusion?
I know what you want, Voxem.
I know you are the last male.
And that you crave fusioning with me.
- But our future?
- Future?
There will be no future while this thing lives.
That problem may solve itself, my queen.
I believe that one of the invaders may have survived, living high on Axis.
If we can find him, he can take this thing away.
I decide!
Your world is not quite as you imagined it, Kaena.
Your world is Astria, and here its twin, Tales, which you saw for the first time last night.
Hundreds of years ago, a Vecarian ship carrying thousands of my people exploded in space, near your planet.
I was the only survivor.
- Axis!
- Yes.
This is your home, Kaena.
It was within these branches that my crib finally landed.
It was Axis that saved me.
Your people live in the middle of Axis, here, at the exact point where the gravitational forces of the two planets cancel each other out.
And we're here.
All the time I was going down to the roots of Axis, but I was really going up?
Below is above and above is below!
Ilpo was right.
You saved him.
I only dressed his wounds.
As I did for many other creatures of Axis.
- So that's where the blue sun is.
- Blue sun?
Yes, I've dreamed of it so many times.
It's down there, at the roots of Axis.
Look!
- It's Vecanoi
- What's Vecanoi?
All the knowledge of my people is contained in its brain.
It was transmitted to all
Vecarians as children.
- It's our memory.
- So, it really exists.
Master, no good can come of listening to a worm-eater with an I.Q. of 2!
I think you might be underestimating her just a little bit, Gommi.
In a matter of days, the ship will be ready.
And then we can leave this pitiful, little world.
It's what you've always wanted,
Master.
It's what you've always wanted.
But the chance to retrieve Vecanoi, to save all the knowledge that he didn't have time to pass on to me!
You should have let her get eaten!
But no... you had to save her, bring her back to the ship.
Master, perhaps we should journey to the base of Axis, just to make sure.
Perhaps, Assad.
You miss her too, don't you?
She's coming back, isn't she?
Soon, I hope soon.
Did she go to that other world?
I don't know. Maybe.
You should've gone with her!
Maybe you're right, Essy.
Maybe you're right.
Help!
- Ilpo?
- Quake! Quake!
Now!
Essy! Essy!
Have you seen my brother?
No. The gods are testing us again.
- We must pray.
- Zehos!
I had a terrible nightmare.
Excuse me?
This is the unstable behaviour
I've been talking about.
Listen to me! The blue sun,
Vecanoi, was being attacked by some evil force, and...
Only the impure move!
Do not mock the gods!
Kneel!
- No! Get up!
- Pray!
The square is going to collapse.
Come on!
May the will of the gods be done.
Is this what happened in your nightmare?
Vecanoi? Was it... destroyed?
No, but it suffered.
And when Vecanoi suffers, Axis suffers.
- They are linked, aren't they?
- I don't know.
Axis is in danger.
The village...
Zehos and Essy and the children...
- I have to go.
- Wait!
We'll go together.
First to your village then to find Vecanoi.
Come on, big guy.
I know you can talk.
- How much longer can this go on?
- Calm yourself!
Gods of my people, my gods, we are in need of you.
Our village is destroyed, and we don't know where to go.
Please, answer us.
Answer me!
Is everything alright?
Come, Enode.
I have good news for our people.
The gods have spoken to me.
What did they tell you?
Do they offer us help?
Better than help, Enode.
Deliverance!
Our suffering has finally been rewarded.
The gods have destroyed our village.
- But why?
- I don't...
So that we may go to join them.
The gods have called us.
They will give us shelter, Enode.
We have passed the final test!
Let everyone know, we leave tomorrow.
- Are you ready?
- Yes...
- Fine, fine. And...
- I'm not fine!
Continue with the final preparations.
When I return, we proceed to lift-off.
Master, this expedition is much too risky.
Please reconsider!
Please?
Vecanoi exists, Gommi.
And Kaena seems to have some special relationship with it.
Can't say I'm crazy about these knew clothes.
They're to protect you, Kaena.
I'd feel a lot better with my knife.
Let us depart!
What? You're best friends with the worm-eater now?
- Ready to fly?
- Oh! I get to fly?
Come on, Assad! Faster!
She's crazy, master. And she has the brain of a slug.
Zumo, are you okay?
Look out!
Poor Zumo!
- I am so sorry, Gommi.
- Sorry won't bring him back.
Master, it's not worth it.
We cannot risk our lives trusting her stupid visions.
The success of this mission is beyond our own lives.
We must face our destiny.
Time is running out.
See? I told you.
I knew this was a bad idea.
A very bad idea.
We should go back to the base before we all get killed.
'Cause we're all gonna be killed.
The sooner we leave this wretched world, the better.
The harvest is over.
We are free!
Come on, everyone.
Run to meet the gods!
The gods are opening the doors of their world.
They've gone crazy. We can't stop them.
But the gods said...
There are no gods, Essy.
We have to go.
It's all right.
Let's go find Kaena.
That is not the way to paradise, Zehos.
The gods have summoned us.
I saw you in the temple
I saw you begging the gods and they didn't come!
Silence this impure one!
Run, Essy! Go!
You have just sent your brother to his death.
What are we doing here?
Gommi, it's quiet.
Yeah. Too quiet.
- It's close.
- What's close?
- I don't hear anything?
- Be quiet!
I'm not hearing anything and my hearing is biotechnically enhanced.
So I should be the one who's hearing...
No move!
Or marauder will see.
Opaz, Gommi, don't move!
- Master, let's move!
- Gommi, stay still!
Let's leave now!
There you are, damned invader!
Now you will come and kill this thing you left behind.
Do not kill him!
Kill her!
We fly my brothers and sisters!
We fly to meet our gods.
I must tell her what I intend to do, Gommi.
I wouldn't be too hasty, Master.
If Vecanoi and Axis are truly linked, what will happen when I retrieve Vecanoi?
How do I know Axis won't be destroyed?
But this is a dying world, Master.
But it is her world, Gommi.
She has a right to know.
- Garoop.
- Garoop yourself.
If only I could persuade her to leave with us.
If you had the chance, would you leave Axis?
It's my home.
You could make another, in a world less hostile.
A place bountiful enough you would have time to learn, to dream, to build a civilization.
No! Ilpo!
Got you!
- Essy, what are you doing here?
- Kaena!
Ilpo took care of me.
Kaena not broken.
It's all right, Ilpo.
They're friends.
They saved my life, and yours too.
- What's going on here?
- Agroop?
Essy, where is Zehos?
They go into the well of the gods.
All go up inside. Village gone.
Something terrible awaits them.
I dreamt it.
I've go to find them.
We don't have time for this.
What about Vecanoi, hmm?
You do talk!
I knew it!
I knew I was right.
Essy, you stay here with Ilpo until I get back.
I'm coming too.
I want Zehos.
It is too dangerous, Essy.
I'll bring him back.
I promise.
Assad, I want you to stay here and protect Ilpo and the boy.
It would be an honour.
Master, you're not...
You're not going there alone?
You can't be serious.
Master, if you think I'm staying here you're crazy. I'm coming too.
I wouldn't have it any other way, Gommi.
Ok, let me help you.
Because there's "floating" and there's "flying".
"Floating", you don't know where you're going. "Flying", you do.
We should reorientate ourselves now.
What?
No.
No!
Kaena, look out!
Hold on, Gommi!
Oh, sticky goo... Yuck!
Um, if I could just remind you...
I'm not built for this.
- Thank you, Gommi.
- You're welcome, I guess.
Our queen has become obsessed with her attacks.
And with each attack, more of us die in vain sucked into her body to make it stronger.
Who will be next?
The queen fears the "ultimate fusion" because she knows that she will have to sacrifice her own life to create new life.
A new generation of Selenites.
Join with me so that we may live.
There's something I must tell you.
What?
You, your people, Axis... all of you are in danger because of me.
Remember, you asked if Vecanoi and Axis were linked.
They are not just linked.
They are the same.
The crash of my ship, the birth of Axis happened at exactly the same time.
Vecanoi created Axis.
And if I am to remove Vecanoi...
What do you mean "remove"?
I must bring it back to my people.
And what about my people? My world?
- I fear Axis will die.
- But we'll die.
How can you accept sacrificing so many people?
I used to think your people were too primitive to care about their destiny.
Until I met you, Kaena.
Please, come with us. There's room for you on our ship.
And all of my people?
You don't realize the power we need to reach the...
- And you knew that from the start?
- Kaena, your world is dying.
And you must realize how important
Vecanoi is!
I curse the day I met you!
Here! You might need this to get back to your ship. My people need me.
Axis, protect me!
Please, have mercy.
The gods will help us, they promised me.
Don't you get it? Your gods are nothing but sap monsters!
Perhaps the gods are merely angry.
- We must pray and ask.
- We trusted you!
No, wait.
Let's not waste our time!
There's got to be a way out of here.
So, little one.
It's you who killed by marauder.
How lucky you are to finally meet your gods.
You are not gods.
- What have you done to my people?
- You are nothing but slaves.
Before the arrival of the blue monster, you didn't even exist.
Your species is a vile aberration.
Too bad we aren't compatible, little one.
Fusing with your perfect little body would be so much more pleasant than what awaits me with my queen.
Where is the old man?
- Where is the invader?
- I don't know.
You lie, slave.
Why would such a powerful god worry about a sick old man?
Never mind.
We know where to wait for him.
He will come to us.
Put her with the others!
It's Kaena.
She's alive!
Zehos, you survived.
But Essy...
I don't know what happened to him.
He's safe, back at the village with Ilpo.
I knew that you would come save us.
Gommi!
- Come on, follow the worm!
- A talking worm!
- Where is Opaz?
- He went to find Vecanoi
These monsters are waiting for him.
- They want him to kill Vecanoi
- I don't care about Vecanoi!
All I care about is the Master.
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
I should have never let him go alone.
Take them back to the Well of the gods, back to the village.
- You're not coming?
- I don't have time to explain.
I've got to find Vecanoi and Opaz.
But what about us?
None of us are safe unless
I do this, Zehos.
- I've got to.
- What about me?
I don't want to lose you a second time.
You'll never lose me.
I'm coming with you.
I've got to find the Master.
Gommi, you'll need to show them the way.
I'll find him, Gommi.
I promise.
Please, we need you.
We're just primitive, unevolved worm-eaters. And we need you.
All right then.
To the Well of the gods. No further.
Then I'm coming back for the Master.
Here.
Can't believe I'm saying this, but...
Good luck, Kaena!
Thank you, my friend.
It leads to the village.
Go, now.
- It's the only way.
- Well, worm-eater,
- This is where I leave you.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
I'm not leaving without Kaena.
Vecanoi!
Hear me!
I have come for you.
Vecanoi, speak to me!
Open for me!
Your monster...
Your monster killed my planet.
- Our ship crashed.
- Your monster steels our sap!
We meant you no harm.
Your monster starves my people.
You created it, you will kill it.
I can't kill it.
Vecanoi will not listen to me.
He will not open.
He has forgotten me.
Then you... will die!
Fuse, my queen!
It's real!
No!
Opaz!
I'm getting you out of here, Opaz.
- Just hold on!
- You... did it, Kaena.
It's you. It's you.
I haven't done anything.
Tell me what to do, Opaz.
Tell me what to do!
Monster!
I finally see you.
Now, you will die.
Slave!
Children... not yet.
Not until I kill!
Kaena!
Kaena, wake up!
Please, Kaena!
- Kaena
- Opaz?
Where are you?
Listen to me, Kaena.
My people are no more.
I was the last.
All the others died hundreds of years ago when their ship crashed.
Only Vecanoi survived.
So he created a gigantic reservoir of life,
Axis, so that you could exist, you humans.
Vecanoi created you.
I don't understand.
He chose you to carry the memory of the Vecarian people.
He chose you, Kaena.
Now you are the future.
You must lead your people.
But how?
How will I know what to do?
Kaena!
Kaena!
Come on, Kaena, wake up!
Stay with me!
Gommi!
Gommi!
Zehos!
Kaena!
- Gommi
- Assad
The Master?
Kaena, wake up!
She is dead.
Kaena is dead.
Who will be our guide now?
She's moving!
She's alive!
There's no more sap, no more water.
How will we live?
He chose you, Kaena.
You must lead your people.
No, stand up!
This is nothing compared to what all of us can learn.
Beyond the clouds is a wide universe.
Millions of suns shine on unknown worlds sheltering so many people.
I am no leader.
All my knowledge is yours.
No one must think for you!
You are free now.
We are free.
Oh, come on, people.
It won't hurt you.
Watch!
Kaena, the new world, will it be beautiful?
Yes.

{10859}{10888}Run!
{10889}{10928}Fall back!
{11001}{11034}Grab hold!
{11095}{11133}Let's go!
{11164}{11193}(panting)
{11194}{11235}Come on!
{11280}{11314}(grunting)
{11315}{11337}And the plan?
{11338}{11392}How about try not to get killed?
{11418}{11431}Hold on!
{11466}{11487}(grunting)
{11488}{11517}Here, you'll need this.
{11518}{11562}Where are you going?
{11563}{11591}Fishing!
{11593}{11650}(grunts)
{11651}{11696}(snarling)
{11697}{11744}Left, right, left, right,|left, right, left, right.
{11886}{11927}(grunts)
{12111}{12172}(growling)
{12240}{12255}Now!
{12297}{12357}(Proteus and Sinbad yelling)
{12401}{12443}PROTEUS:|Whoo!
{12470}{12498}Woo-hoo!
{12499}{12537}(crew cheering)
{12538}{12562}(grunts)
{12601}{12639}- Oh...|- You okay?
{12640}{12662}Yeah.
{12663}{12710}Thanks for sticking around.
{12710}{12770}Ah, just like old times.
{12782}{12801}(men shouting)
{12802}{12821}Look out!
{12822}{12867}- (grunting)|- Sinbad!
{12957}{13009}(grunting)
{13190}{13243}(grunting)
{13438}{13492}(blowing)
{13553}{13643}(gasping)
{13644}{13729}WOMAN:|The day began with such promise.
{13730}{13804}And now look.
{13805}{13847}My sea monster is dead,
{13850}{13929}and I still don't have|the Book of Peace.
{13930}{13988}All because of you, Sinbad.
{13989}{14037}(panting):|Uh-huh.
{14038}{14077}And you are?
{14078}{14150}Eris, the Goddess of Discord.
{14150}{14181}No doubt you've seen|my likeness
{14182}{14249}on the temple walls.
{14250}{14277}(chuckles nervously)
{14278}{14331}You know,|they don't do you justice.
{14332}{14379}Uh-huh. Now...
{14380}{14421}about my sea monster.
{14422}{14458}Right, right.
{14458}{14500}Listen, I'm sorry|about that.
{14501}{14570}I don't suppose a heartfelt|apology would do.
{14571}{14596}(chuckles wryly)
{14597}{14650}Heartfelt? From you?
{14651}{14728}Sinbad, you don't have a heart.
{14729}{14775}(sighs)
{14776}{14851}That's what I like about you.
{14852}{14929}So, I'm going|to let you live.
{14930}{14994}But there's|just one little thing
{14995}{15033}you have to do.
{15034}{15115}Get the Book of Peace|and bring it to me.
{15116}{15141}Right. Hmm.
{15142}{15171}Now, see, that's|a problem for me
{15172}{15215}because I had|my own plans for it.
{15216}{15239}Uh, ransom, get rich.
{15241}{15263}You know, "me" stuff.
{15265}{15287}(startled cry)
{15289}{15379}You're not thinking|big enough, Sinbad.
{15380}{15414}Steal the Book for ransom,
{15414}{15450}and you'll be|rich enough
{15450}{15493}to lounge|on an island beach.
{15494}{15599}Steal the Book for me,|and you can buy the beach,
{15600}{15686}and the island and the world.
{15687}{15713}Hmm.
{15714}{15761}You let me live,|you make me rich,
{15762}{15813}I retire to paradise.
{15814}{15881}So far, I don't see a downside.
{15882}{15929}If you keep your word.
{15930}{16000}Sinbad, when a goddess|gives her word,
{16001}{16055}she's bound for all eternity.
{16057}{16102}All right, you're on.
{16103}{16153}I knew you'd|see it my way.
{16154}{16241}So, when you've|stolen the Book,
{16242}{16324}follow that star|beyond the horizon.
{16326}{16364}You'll find yourself
{16365}{16455}in Tartarus,|my Realm of Chaos.
{16456}{16484}Tartarus.
{16485}{16524}I'll see you there.
{16525}{16563}It's a date then.
{16607}{16649}So, where were we?
{16650}{16687}(chuckling):|Oh, yes.
{16688}{16765}You were holding your breath.
{16944}{16994}He's so cute.
{16995}{17071}And so gullible.
{17072}{17142}Cetus, well done.
{17142}{17181}(rumbling purr)
{17214}{17269}(gasps, coughs)
{17270}{17332}(Kale grunts)
{17333}{17414}- (men cheering, Spike barking)|- Sinbad, you're alive!
{17414}{17457}Glad you made it.
{17458}{17498}Pay up.|He lived.
{17499}{17528}(groans)
{17529}{17557}What happened down there?
{17558}{17587}(gasping):|You wouldn't...
{17588}{17615}believe me if I told you.
{17618}{17648}Try me.
{17649}{17691}All right, here goes.
{17692}{17759}So I meet Eris,|the Goddess of Chaos.
{17762}{17797}She's got|a major crush on me,
{17798}{17846}and she invited me|back to her place.
{17885}{17927}Ha! That's a good one!
{17928}{17970}- Goddess of Chaos?|- (crew chuckling)
{17971}{18006}Oh, I'm writing that down.
{18007}{18054}So, that's it then?|No Book.
{18054}{18091}Now what do we do?
{18092}{18123}A little patience, Rat.
{18124}{18166}It's not like we don't know|where it's going.
{18205}{18290}Men, all sails to Syracuse!
{18291}{18336}Right away, sir!
{18585}{18654}(cheering)
{19293}{19335}For as long|as I can remember,
{19336}{19377}I've dreamed of this moment.
{19378}{19427}The sacred treasure
{19428}{19489}that's protected us|for a thousand years
{19490}{19541}is now in Syracuse.
{19542}{19583}- A toast!|- To Dymas!
{19586}{19601}Hear, hear!
{19602}{19634}To the Book of Peace!
{19635}{19689}And to you, King Dymas|and Prince Proteus.
{19690}{19764}- Make way!|- (crowd gasping)
{19770}{19790}(swords unsheathe)
{19828}{19860}You see?
{19861}{19921}This is what happens|when you use the front entrance.
{19922}{19953}Mm-hmm.
{19954}{19991}What is he doing here?
{19994}{20049}At least he's not out|robbing someone.
{20050}{20125}That's because everyone|worth robbing is here.
{20126}{20171}(panting)
{20197}{20222}I'll bet you ten crowns
{20223}{20266}you're about to put|those swords down.
{20267}{20302}I'll take that bet.
{20303}{20327}PROTEUS:|Guards...
{20329}{20364}put away your swords.
{20366}{20418}I don't see you for ten years,
{20419}{20484}and now twice in one day...|(scoffs)
{20485}{20518}You're smothering me.
{20519}{20550}(chuckles)
{20551}{20630}I knew you'd want to thank me|for saving your life... again.
{20631}{20663}(chuckles)
{20665}{20731}You probably just heard|we had free food and wine.
{20732}{20755}You hear that, guys?
{20756}{20809}Dinner and drinks|are on the prince.
{20810}{20838}Come on.
{20839}{20880}There's someone|I want you to meet.
{20914}{20941}(softly):|Get to work.
{20972}{20996}Weapons?
{21024}{21073}- (growls)|- (gasps)
{21074}{21115}(chuckling)
{21313}{21337}PROTEUS:|Here she is.
{21338}{21369}I've told her|all about you.
{21370}{21393}(gasps)
{21394}{21417}(clears throat)
{21418}{21471}Sinbad, I would|like to introduce you
{21472}{21503}to my fiancee,
{21504}{21566}the Lady Marina,|Ambassador from Thrace.
{21666}{21730}So, this is the infamous Sinbad.
{21731}{21780}I heard all about this morning.
{21781}{21874}First you tried to rob Proteus,|and then you save his life.
{21879}{21927}So, which are you...
{21928}{21983}a thief or a hero?
{21985}{22034}PROTEUS:|Sinbad wanted
{22035}{22085}to give me an opportunity|to thank...
{22086}{22134}- (indistinct conversation)|- (music plays)
{22135}{22181}...him.
{22182}{22269}(gobbling noisily)
{22270}{22313}RAT:|Eight months on the sea
{22314}{22375}with nothing but eggs|and pickles...
{22376}{22442}you don't know what|that can do to a man.
{22443}{22502}Oh, it's almost too easy.
{22503}{22551}There's only|a handful of guards.
{22552}{22575}Forget it.
{22576}{22606}Let's get back to the ship.
{22607}{22634}Just like that?
{22635}{22680}But the Book is almost ours.
{22720}{22760}(sighs)
{22761}{22784}Oh.
{22785}{22826}Wh-What?|Who is she?
{22827}{22864}An old girlfriend?
{22865}{22909}I'm afraid it's|not that simple.
{22910}{22953}Let's go.
{22978}{23014}Jed, pack it up.
{23014}{23069}What? L-I... I just put the...
{23070}{23097}(groans in disgust)
{23206}{23249}(chuckles wickedly)
{23250}{23337}Oh, this is just too easy.
{23377}{23410}Look at it this way:
{23411}{23439}Now that Sinbad's gone,
{23440}{23498}your father can finally relax|and enjoy the evening.
{23498}{23522}(Proteus chuckles)
{23522}{23561}Well, you're right about that.
{23562}{23595}He's trying not to show it,
{23596}{23690}but he's so proud|to have the Book in Syracuse.
{23691}{23772}He's been planning this day|his whole life.
{23773}{23861}And soon it will be|your responsibility.
{23862}{23911}Our responsibility.
{24052}{24089}(sighing):|It's beautiful.
{24090}{24119}It is.
{24120}{24185}My father spent years|preparing it for the Book.
{24186}{24228}There are guards|on every level,
{24229}{24268}and if you look|up to the...
{24309}{24363}Ah... (chuckles softly)
{24364}{24422}You were talking about|the ocean, weren't you?
{24423}{24525}I only wish I'd|seen more of it.
{24526}{24634}I used to imagine sailing|far beyond the Twelve Cities,
{24635}{24675}discovering the world.
{24676}{24725}(chuckles softly)
{24726}{24767}Oh, look at it, Proteus.
{24768}{24834}There's so much wonder.
{24835}{24870}Marina...
{24938}{25011}Our marriage was arranged|many years ago.
{25012}{25062}It's always been expected of us.
{25063}{25144}But politics is not a reason|to get married.
{25145}{25192}Uh, and I don't want you|to do this
{25193}{25232}just because it's your duty.
{25290}{25345}I'm asking you|for myself now.
{25346}{25385}Marina...
{25434}{25472}will you marry me?
{25473}{25521}Proteus, I...
{25522}{25554}DYMAS:|There you are!
{25555}{25583}I think the delegates|from Manoli
{25585}{25610}are trying to give a toast.
{25611}{25644}Although, I'm not sure.
{25645}{25700}They're doing something|with their knees.
{25701}{25739}Marina, I need|an ambassador.
{25740}{25781}(exhales)
{25818}{25857}Of course, Sire.
{25858}{25930}(people laughing and chatting|in distance)
{26022}{26097}(wind whistling)
{26165}{26235}(whooshing)
{26236}{26307}- (candle wick sizzles)|- Huh?
{26724}{26798}(wind howling softly)
{26982}{27026}- (sizzling)|- Who's there?
{27160}{27203}(hissing)
{27296}{27336}Huh?
{27378}{27410}Sinbad!
{27411}{27445}(grunting)
{27514}{27546}(groans)
{27585}{27649}I love playing pretend.
{27691}{27746}(chuckles wickedly)
{27824}{27923}All the pieces|are coming together.
{27953}{27988}(loud rumbling)
{27990}{28055}Proteus, the Book!
{28056}{28128}(loud rumbling)
{28199}{28237}(gasps)
{28267}{28338}(loud rumbling)
{28338}{28386}(debris clattering)
{28603}{28675}(grunts and groans)
{28676}{28710}PROTEUS:|Sinbad.
{28711}{28741}Proteus!
{28742}{28785}It's about time.
{28786}{28834}Do you realize|how serious this is?
{28835}{28865}Do you realize
{28866}{28909}how many times|I've heard that today?
{28910}{28933}You've betrayed Syracuse!
{28934}{28985}Oh... not you, too.
{28986}{29012}Stealing the Book of Peace,
{29013}{29051}when you knew how much|it meant to us!
{29052}{29098}Proteus, here's|the way this works.
{29098}{29140}First, I actually|commit a crime,
{29141}{29189}and then you get|to blame me for it!
{29190}{29261}Then how do|you explain this?
{29317}{29353}Eris.
{29354}{29374}What?
{29375}{29430}Eris... she framed me.
{29431}{29476}- Sinbad, listen to yourself.|- Trust me, Proteus,
{29477}{29535}the Book is in Tartarus.
{29536}{29582}Talk to your father.|Tell him I'm...
{29582}{29613}This is beyond my father.
{29614}{29675}The ambassadors are convening|now for your trial.
{29676}{29708}Whoa, whoa,|whoa, whoa, whoa.
{29709}{29734}Trial? I didn't do it!
{29735}{29773}Look, I left the Book|on your ship,
{29774}{29810}and that's the|last I saw of it.
{29811}{29837}You were there.
{29838}{29884}You know the truth.
{29885}{29910}You know me.
{29911}{29948}Do I?
{29949}{29999}I knew a kid.
{30001}{30066}Who are you now, Sinbad?
{30067}{30105}(sighs)
{30106}{30201}Look me in the eye|and tell me.
{30202}{30253}Did you steal the Book?
{30299}{30351}No.
{30414}{30475}DYMAS:|We've heard enough of your lies.
{30476}{30501}Sinbad,
{30502}{30561}for the last time,|give us the Book.
{30562}{30632}How many times|do I have to say it?
{30633}{30665}I don't have it!
{30666}{30697}AMBASSADOR:|Very well, then.
{30698}{30732}The Delegation
{30733}{30799}of the Twelve Cities finds you|guilty of treason,
{30800}{30837}and we sentence you to die.
{30838}{30862}Take him away.
{30862}{30898}Come on!|This is a joke, right?
{30898}{30942}Are you...|are you people blind?
{30943}{30966}I didn't do it!
{30967}{30993}PROTEUS:|Stop!
{30994}{31018}(gasps)
{31018}{31090}I demand the right|of substitution.
{31090}{31134}Take me in his place.
{31135}{31158}No!
{31176}{31206}Sinbad says
{31207}{31257}that Eris took the Book...
{31258}{31294}and I believe him.
{31295}{31343}Let him go to Tartarus|and recover the Book.
{31345}{31367}What?
{31369}{31398}(murmuring)
{31399}{31424}What are you doing?
{31425}{31471}You claim that Eris|stole the Book...
{31472}{31496}steal it back.
{31497}{31529}You're good at that.
{31530}{31586}Hey, look, I will not be|responsible for your life.
{31587}{31617}You would do|the same for me.
{31618}{31647}No, I wouldn't.
{31648}{31693}DYMAS:|If Sinbad is allowed to leave
{31694}{31754}the city, he'll|never come back!
{31755}{31799}Son, listen to reason.
{31801}{31863}No, Father, you listen.
{31864}{31950}Sinbad either stole the Book,|or he's telling the truth
{31951}{31984}and it's in Tartarus.
{31985}{32046}Either way,|he's our only hope.
{32047}{32085}But you can't...
{32086}{32189}Proteus, you realize that|if Sinbad does not return,
{32190}{32265}you will be put to death|in his place.
{32306}{32357}I understand.
{32358}{32387}(sighs)
{32388}{32418}So be it.
{32419}{32462}Sinbad has ten days
{32463}{32513}to return the Book.
{32514}{32561}(sighs)
{32562}{32589}Release him.
{32590}{32661}(crowd murmuring)
{32972}{33034}(sighs)
{33086}{33131}Oh, and, Sinbad...
{33159}{33216}don't be late.
{33326}{33394}(groans)
{33850}{33893}(creaking)
{33962}{34021}Hmm.
{34142}{34169}So, any idea
{34170}{34213}how we actually|get to Tartarus?
{34214}{34239}Tartarus?
{34240}{34268}(chuckling):|Oh, no, no, no, no.
{34269}{34318}People get killed in Tartarus.
{34319}{34366}So where are we going?
{34411}{34437}Fiji.
{34438}{34511}Fiji? This time of year?
{34512}{34544}Think of the beaches.
{34545}{34607}Oh, beautiful,|if you like mosquitoes.
{34610}{34633}Think of the sun.
{34634}{34679}It's monsoon season.
{34680}{34724}Oh, then the women.
{34725}{34757}They're cannibals, Sinbad.
{34758}{34808}Exactly.
{34809}{34842}(groans)
{34843}{34866}Come on, Kale.
{34867}{34903}He's your friend.
{34904}{34962}Listen to you.|You sound like my mother.
{34963}{34994}Proteus will be fine.
{34995}{35025}You're sure of that?
{35026}{35054}You and I both know
{35055}{35105}Dymas is not going to let them|execute his only son.
{35106}{35135}So we're running away?
{35136}{35168}We're retiring.
{35169}{35223}We don't need another score.|We've got enough.
{35224}{35284}Now, set a course for Fiji.
{35286}{35364}Gentlemen,|we're heading to Fiji!
{35365}{35404}- (cheering)|- Fiji! Fiji!
{35405}{35436}(Spike barking)
{35442}{35525}(grumbling):|Kale... Book.
{35526}{35558}(grunting):|Proteus.
{35615}{35665}Look at all this.
{35685}{35741}I can't believe it.
{35742}{35790}Oh, but this can't be real.
{35791}{35823}It'd be far too deli...
{35824}{35862}- (clattering)|- Uh-oh.
{35930}{35983}This is more like it.
{35984}{36020}Stolen from Venezia.
{36021}{36055}(exhales)
{36056}{36091}From Pompeii...
{36092}{36167}And from a brothel|in Syracuse.
{36170}{36197}Good guess.
{36198}{36232}(gasps)
{36233}{36266}What do you think|you're doing here?
{36267}{36325}I'm here to make sure you|get the Book of Peace.
{36326}{36376}Or bring back your|dead body if you fail.
{36377}{36407}Really?
{36408}{36445}And how are you going|to pull that off?
{36446}{36482}By whatever means necessary.
{36483}{36516}Did you bring a crew?
{36517}{36545}No.
{36546}{36572}You know how to|get to Tartarus?
{36573}{36596}Um... no.
{36597}{36620}Can you navigate|on your own?
{36622}{36637}Yes!
{36638}{36669}Well, good!
{36670}{36712}Then I'll dump your butt|in a rowboat,
{36713}{36767}and you can paddle|all the way back to Syracuse.
{36768}{36837}'Cause we're going to Fiji.
{36877}{36900}Fiji?
{36901}{36925}Yup.
{36926}{36998}Just as I thought.
{36999}{37031}What?
{37033}{37059}Sinbad,
{37060}{37132}you're not|a very complicated guy.
{37133}{37158}All someone has to do
{37159}{37209}is imagine the most|gutless course of action,
{37210}{37243}and you're bound to take it.
{37244}{37300}Hey, this is not my problem.
{37301}{37351}I did not steal the Book.
{37352}{37431}You're really not going to lose|any sleep over this, are you?
{37432}{37455}Not a wink.
{37456}{37511}Because me,|I'd be tossing and turning,
{37512}{37611}knowing I'm alive...|because I let my friend die.
{37612}{37643}(groans in disgust)
{37644}{37685}I'm not responsible|for this mess.
{37686}{37713}And I didn't ask Proteus
{37714}{37743}to put his neck|on the line for me.
{37744}{37821}Look, clearly I can't|appeal to your honor.
{37822}{37891}But I have other ways|of convincing you.
{37892}{37936}Really?
{37937}{38007}Uh... just how do you|expect to do that?
{38008}{38058}By speaking your language.
{38111}{38149}Keep talking.
{38250}{38273}(jewels clink)
{38326}{38362}Yup, this'll do!
{38362}{38429}But not for first class.
{38464}{38534}As you can see, we're|well equipped to accommodate
{38535}{38597}the most discerning|of royal tastes.
{38598}{38655}We have excellent ocean views...
{38656}{38700}(Marina grunting)
{38701}{38756}...luxurious living quarters,
{38757}{38807}with three|gourmet meals a day...
{38810}{38882}pickles, eggs, and pickles.
{38883}{38909}(barks)
{38910}{38940}Oh, hey, Spike,|there you are.
{38941}{38973}I'd like to introduce you
{38974}{38999}to your new bunkmate...|well, actually,
{39002}{39033}you're his new bunkmate,
{39034}{39071}as it's actually his bunk.
{39074}{39122}- (Sinbad chuckles)|- (groans in disgust)
{39123}{39147}We do hope
{39148}{39205}you have a pleasant stay|aboard the Chimera.
{39206}{39259}Oh, if he starts|hugging your leg,
{39260}{39297}it means he likes you.
{39298}{39318}(grunts)
{39323}{39356}If you think...
{39388}{39422}(Spike barks)
{39427}{39502}How did she even get|on the ship?
{39503}{39557}(startled grunts)
{39558}{39623}(exaggerated yawn)
{39625}{39708}Gentlemen, we have a new course.
{39709}{39737}We're going to Tartarus.
{39738}{39780}Huh? What|happened to Fiji?
{39781}{39804}What? No fun?
{39806}{39829}No beaches?
{39830}{39873}Rat.
{39874}{39911}Sorry, Captain.
{39913}{39966}But did you|say Tartarus?
{39967}{39990}That's right.
{39991}{40034}Will that be|the same Tartarus
{40035}{40085}from which no sailor|ever returns?
{40086}{40132}The Tartarus|of lost souls,
{40133}{40163}where they|grind your bones
{40164}{40198}and pickle your|spleen, and...
{40199}{40240}No, Rat.|This is the nice Tartarus,
{40241}{40276}with lots of beaches and drinks.
{40278}{40331}You know,|with little umbrellas?
{40332}{40396}(muttering in Italian):|Non ci posso credere,
{40397}{40480}non ci posso credere,|mi hanno fregato ancora.
{40482}{40579}I'm only doing this|for the money.
{40580}{40622}Right.
{40623}{40665}So how do we get there?
{40690}{40745}That star's our point.
{40802}{40832}(clicking)
{40833}{40849}(grunting)
{41132}{41159}Wow.
{41162}{41215}Our little thief|isn't going to run away.
{41216}{41241}(hisses)
{41242}{41307}He thinks he's going to pay us|a visit.
{41308}{41334}(hissing and clicking)
{41335}{41439}Hmm. Let's provide|some mood music.

{42026}{42095}Look lively!|Jed, get the long poles!
{42098}{42136}Oh, pardon me, milady.
{42137}{42174}Hey, we need|a pole over here.
{42175}{42201}Jin, one over here.
{42202}{42266}Yeah, come on, come on, come on.
{42374}{42420}The Dragon's Teeth?
{42421}{42447}(Rat clears throat)
{42448}{42489}(grunts)
{42522}{42559}Indeed, signorina.
{42560}{42598}Only the most|foolish of captains
{42599}{42646}would dare to sail|a ship through this!
{42647}{42690}SINBAD:|Rat, reef the fores'le.
{42691}{42758}Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.
{42759}{42795}(grunts)
{42848}{42872}Are you sure|you know what...?
{42874}{42909}Yes, we've done this|kind of thing before.
{42910}{42942}- No, there is no other way.|- Look...
{42943}{42969}- And, yes,|- But...
{42970}{43025}you have my permission|to stand there quietly
{43026}{43066}and get a free lesson|in sailing.
{43067}{43090}You know...
{43091}{43127}Besides, a ship is|no place for a woman.
{43129}{43151}(gasps)
{43153}{43175}Jin!
{43177}{43199}Easy on the main!

{50209}{50244}You were so brave.

{50302}{50345}Uh...
{50346}{50380}Uh... (clears throat)

{50745}{50773}Do you have any idea
{50774}{50825}what I went through|to steal these?
{50826}{50850}(scoffs)
{50851}{50940}That's exactly|why women shouldn't drive.
{50975}{51006}Are you crazy?
{51007}{51052}I saved your life!
{51053}{51111}Oh, I would've been fine.
{51112}{51158}I always am.
{51159}{51196}Right.

{53319}{53351}A crew of my most|trusted officers

{54903}{54973}All right, I'm going to need|the full set of chisels,

{55026}{55065}All right, men, you|heard the captain.
{55066}{55121}Find some logs|and be quick about it.
{55122}{55170}- (groans)|- Oh, for heaven's sake!

{56066}{56111}If I break something,|I fix it.
{56114}{56153}Um, knife, please.

{76634}{76678}you're welcome.
{76745}{76801}This life suits you.
{76802}{76831}(chuckles):|Yeah.
{76832}{76878}I wasn't made for dry land.
{76879}{76919}(chuckles)
{76920}{76959}And you?
{76960}{77026}Is it the shore... or the sea?
{77066}{77130}I've always loved the sea.
{77131}{77221}I even dreamed|of a life on it.
{77222}{77269}But it wasn't meant to be.
{77270}{77349}I have responsibilities|in Syracuse.
{77350}{77418}You really have to give it up?
{77450}{77523}Yes.
{77550}{77589}(sighs quietly)

{78268}{78321}but nothing...
{78322}{78421}nothing compares|to the open sea.
{78422}{78494}And is this what|you always wanted?
{78495}{78553}(chuckles):|Not really.
{78554}{78595}When we were young,|Proteus and I
{78596}{78647}used to talk about|joining the Royal Navy
{78650}{78719}and serving Syracuse|side by side.
{78722}{78825}But as we got older,|our lives began to change.
{78826}{78939}He's a prince,|and I'm... well.
{78940}{78994}(chuckles)
{78995}{79053}I was never jealous|of him, though...
{79054}{79125}until one morning,|a ship came into harbor...
{79125}{79220}a ship with his|future on it.
{79221}{79300}It was the most beautiful|thing I'd ever seen.
{79301}{79366}(whispering):|What was on the ship?
{79437}{79476}You.
{79502}{79569}Proteus met you|at the dock.
{79570}{79616}I jumped on the|first outbound ship
{79617}{79662}and never looked back.

{89256}{89315}Alive, that is... (chuckles)
{89345}{89368}Make yourself at home.
{89369}{89407}(chuckles nervously)
{89408}{89441}Thank you. Uh...
{89442}{89474}nice place you got here.
{89475}{89508}Like it?
{89508}{89586}I'm planning on doing|the whole world this way.
{89626}{89692}Wow, that's a good plan.
{89693}{89760}Well, I see you're busy,|so listen, we'll just take
{89761}{89812}the Book of Peace|and get of your way.
{89813}{89836}(chuckles)
{89837}{89876}What makes you think I have it?
{89878}{89934}Uh, well, you framed me|for the theft,
{89935}{89971}so they would execute me.
{89973}{90003}You?
{90004}{90027}Yeah.
{90088}{90131}No.
{90132}{90162}Proteus!
{90163}{90211}You knew he would take my place.
{90213}{90244}(chuckles)
{90245}{90288}What a clever little man|you are.
{90289}{90327}You thought I'd run.
{90328}{90418}Then Proteus would die,|and Syracuse would be...
{90419}{90476}Left without|the next rightful king,
{90478}{90574}and tumble into glorious chaos.
{90575}{90656}You humans are so predictable.
{90657}{90720}Proteus couldn't help|being ever so noble,
{90721}{90776}and you couldn't help|betraying him.
{90777}{90852}But I didn't betray Proteus!|I didn't run away.
{90853}{90900}Oh, but you did betray him.
{90901}{90962}You stole his only love.
{90963}{90992}Look at her, Sinbad.
{90993}{91016}(grunts)
{91017}{91074}He's not even|in his grave yet,
{91075}{91137}and you're moving in|on his girl.
{91138}{91268}Face it: Your heart|is as black as mine.
{91269}{91312}You're wrong about him!
{91313}{91344}He knows I'm not!
{91345}{91379}You don't know|what's in his heart.
{91380}{91420}Oh, yes, I do.
{91421}{91492}And more importantly,|so does he.
{91493}{91528}In your heart,|you know that
{91528}{91574}Proteus is|going to die
{91575}{91632}because he saw|something in you
{91633}{91683}that just isn't there.
{91684}{91715}No.
{91716}{91747}You want to bet?
{91748}{91814}I'll tell you what.|Let's play a game.
{91815}{91864}And if you win,|I'll give you
{91865}{91898}the Book of Peace.
{91899}{91954}(rumbling)
{92022}{92072}There it is, noble hero.
{92073}{92112}- (rumbling)|- (grunts)
{92113}{92188}ERIS:|Not so fast.
{92189}{92240}My game has rules,|Sinbad.
{92241}{92288}I'll ask you a question.
{92289}{92337}One simple question.
{92338}{92423}If you answer truthfully,|the Book is yours.
{92425}{92473}- Give me your word.|- (exasperated sigh)
{92474}{92525}You still don't trust me?
{92526}{92581}Uh... no.
{92582}{92680}(exhaling):|Isn't it a pity|we live in such skeptical times?
{92681}{92717}Oh, all right.
{92718}{92803}You have my word, as a goddess.
{92841}{92872}Fair enough?
{92939}{92985}Ask your question.
{92986}{93011}Excellent.
{93012}{93066}Now, we all know what happens
{93067}{93120}if you get the Book of Peace.
{93121}{93200}You return it to Syracuse|and save Proteus.
{93201}{93254}But if you don't get the Book,
{93255}{93302}you have|a choice to make.
{93303}{93348}Either sail to paradise
{93348}{93390}with the woman|of your dreams,
{93391}{93480}or return to Syracuse to die.
{93481}{93547}You're either a thief or a hero.
{93548}{93612}So, here's my question, Sinbad.
{93612}{93677}If you don't get the Book,
{93678}{93750}will you go back to die?
{93751}{93785}(wind whistles)
{94074}{94134}I will go back.
{94351}{94384}(rumbling)
{94384}{94465}You're lying.

{95487}{95526}I'm sorry, Marina.
{95527}{95592}Eris is right about me.
{95593}{95649}No, she's not.|You answered her question.
{95650}{95677}You told the truth.
{95678}{95742}It wasn't the truth.
{95743}{95824}It was me trying to pass|myself off as someone I'm not.
{95824}{95868}Sinbad,|I've seen who you are!
{95868}{95908}You don't need to pretend!
{95909}{95938}Eris trapped you!
{95939}{96026}Why should you or Proteus|or anyone have to die?!
{96027}{96044}Marina...
{96044}{96094}No! You need to escape.
{96095}{96148}Get as far away as you can.
{96149}{96199}I'll go back.|I'll explain everything.
{96200}{96220}No, Marina.
{96221}{96257}(sobs)
{96258}{96355}I can't watch you die!
{96357}{96431}I love you.
{97039}{97137}But could you love a man|who would run away?

{98828}{98864}I was... (gulps)
{98865}{98930}...beginning to wonder.
{99041}{99067}The Book?
{99068}{99148}I did my best.
{99149}{99194}It wasn't enough.
{99223}{99304}No.
{99304}{99358}You came back anyway.
{99359}{99484}How could I do anything else...|my friend?

{101597}{101665}How dare you?!

{101760}{101828}and now you do this!
{101830}{101888}(panicked cries)
{101889}{101992}Eris, I don't understand.
{101992}{102043}Don't play coy with me.
{102046}{102133}Maybe you can fool these people,
{102134}{102176}but I know who you are.
{102177}{102279}You're a selfish,|unprincipled liar!
{102280}{102319}Wait a minute.
{102320}{102368}I didn't lie.
{102369}{102409}I came back.
{102410}{102444}That's why you're here.
{102444}{102495}This was all part|of your test.
{102496}{102526}I told the truth.
{102527}{102568}And wasn't there something

{103377}{103469}You're cute,|but not that cute.

{105947}{105972}Come on.
{105973}{106020}This is going to be|a heck of a party.
{106021}{106083}Everyone's going to want|to hear about the voyage.
{106084}{106124}Fair winds, calm seas.
{106126}{106177}Nothing much to tell.

{106216}{106242}What's the matter?
{106243}{106296}No fun if you're|actually invited?
{106419}{106469}No, it's just, uh...

{107730}{107762}Just another
{107763}{107818}uneventful day in Syracuse.
{107819}{107858}(chuckles softly)
{107958}{108028}You know, I stood here|with a woman once.
{108028}{108075}She looked over the ocean
{108076}{108140}and wished she could sail|beyond the horizon.
{108140}{108223}She saw... such wonder.
{108224}{108316}And what happened|to this woman?
{108316}{108366}She got her chance.
{108367}{108474}She sailed the seas,|and she fell in love.
{108528}{108572}(sighs)
{108573}{108601}Proteus, I...
{108602}{108692}Marina, follow your heart.
{108694}{108761}Mine is here in Syracuse.
{108762}{108800}Yours...
{108801}{108902}yours is sailing|with the next tide.

{109444}{109496}Captain?
{109497}{109526}Hmm?
{109527}{109576}We're ready to sail.
{109577}{109627}All right, Kale.
{109629}{109681}Take us out.

{110444}{110495}MARINA:|Excuse me, Captain.
{110496}{110564}You need to replace|these rig joints pretty soon.
{110565}{110612}The mizzen ropes|need the support.
{110662}{110735}These joints|were from the Jasmine Sea.
{110736}{110792}That's halfway around the world.
{110793}{110844}Then we'd better get started.
{110967}{110996}Well, you know,
{110997}{111041}that means going through|the Hydra's lair.

{111204}{111248}That's a very long voyage.
{111248}{111354}And it's very, very dangerous.

Hello, there.
Ohh.
Unh.
Tigger! Are you ready for the hive yet?
All I am is ready.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
How do I look? Hoo hoo.
I mean, uh, does this log make me look fat?
Ohh. Like the best honey tree that a bee will ever see. Ha.
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, boy.
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Rabbit, what are you doing?
Oh, can't you tell?
I'm lullabying the bees for our big plan.
They seem to like Bee-thoven.
Eeyore, what are you doing?
I got to use my big voice... to tell the bees about the new hive.
Buzz, buzz. Great new hive.
Tigger, could you tell me what you're doing?
I have to hold the fake hive hive enough for the bees to see.
It's the biggest part of the plan. Hoo.
That's what Tiggers do best.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
You do seem bigger than usual.
Oh, hello, Piglet.
Pooh, what are you all doing?
Harvesting honey, of course.
It's all in the plan.
First, Rabbit will lure the bees with beautiful music.
Then Eeyore tempts the bees into their new hive.
Then Tigger holds up the hive for the bees to see.
And then comes the best part.
We get honey from their old hive. Ha ha.
Can I help you with your big plan?
Well, thank you, Piglet, but, um, perhaps another time.
When we have a bit smaller of a plan... or when you're a bit bigger of a Piglet.
I'm sorry, Piglet...
but I'm afraid this is a very big plan.
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
Places, everyone.
I've gotten their attention.
Oh! Aah!
Great new hive.
Free rent. Buzz, buzz.
Oh, do the bees know the plan?
Piglet, don't get in the way of our big plan.
I'm getting kind of itchy around my leaves.
Oh, d-d-dear!
- Oh, buzz.
- Oh!
Get the little guy.
Oh!
Aha!
Ohh!
Ohh.
OK, Rabbit.
We're geniuses.
Sticky geniuses.
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Oh, goodness.
Oh, the sweet taste of success.
Mm-mmm.
Our plan worked perfectly.
Didn't think it would work... but it did.
Congratulations to us all.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Hooray for Pooh!
- And Rabbit.
- And Eeyore.
And Tigger, too.
But--but I was the...
Oh, Piglet...
I'm sorry that you couldn't be part of our big plan.
Oh, but I thought I...
For a minute there, I thought
I was gonna break out in hives.
Oh, dear.
Even my shadow is small.
Oh, it'd sure be nice if my friends needed me.
Piglet, could you help me lullaby the bees?
Piglet, could you help me call them to the hive?
Yeah, Piglet, could you help me reach higher?
Piglet, we need your help.
Ahh.
Wonderfullest honey.
Oh, I thought Tiggers hated honey.
Well, they do to eat, but to stop the itching... oh, there is nothing betterer.
- Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh.
Did you hear something?
I'm afraid I've got some honey in my ears.
What's that, Pooh?
I can't hear you over all that buzzing.
Who's buzzing?
Bees!
What say we break for lunch?
But what about our honey?
It's your honey or your life.
Hmm.
- Come on!
- Oh, boy.
- Whoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, bother!
Here they come! Aah!
Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Run!
Oh, joy.
- Thanks, donkey boy.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, Eeyore.
- Anytime.
- Thank you, Eeyore.
- You're welcome.
Aah!
Quick, make a beeline for Piglet's!
Oh! Oh! Faster!
Run faster! Faster!
I can't stand it!
They're going to get us!
Get the door! The door!
Ooh! Hurry!
Ohh!
Oh, they're gone.
Or maybe just pretenderin'.
You know, bees are sneaky like that.
I was right.
Eeyore.
You got stung out there?
No. I got stung right here... where I can keep an eye on it.
Is everyone all right?
Uh, Tigger's here.
Eeyore's here.
Pooh is here. I'm here.
Hmm. Who am I forgetting?
I don't know, Rabbit.
Let's ask... Piglet!
Oh, bother.
Are you all right, Pooh?
I just landed on my, um... self.
Say, what do we have here?
Oh, please, Tigger. It's just a drawing in a scrapbook.
But it reminds me...
of the bestest family reunion
I ever had.
Ahem.
Oh, look. There's the day little Piglet... caught his first Heffalump.
That was no Heffalump.
That was just Pooh with a jar on his head.
I forgot how much
I look like a Heffalump... with a jar on my head.
Ohh.
He captured Rabbit, all right.
Oh, let me see! Heh.
That doesn't look a thing like me.
Oh... what's next?
- What's that tiny pink dot?
-I believe it's Piglet.
Piglet? Where is Piglet?
We must've lost track of him after we got chased by the bees.
Ohh, but he's so little.
He could be in big danger.
We have to find him and make sure he's all right.
But how will we find him?
He could be anywhere.
Ohh... think, think, think.
You know, since this is a book of Piglet's memories... maybe it remembers where Piglet is.
Oh, brilliant deduction there,
Pooh boy.
It's a regular Piglet map.
Hoo hoo!
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.
Let's start with page one.
Well, page one remembers
Owl's house. Heh heh heh.
Way to go, Pooh boy!
Why, I bet that little fella's there right now.
Let's go find him!
Then off to Owl's house we go.
He has an answer for everything.
Not to Owl's.
Oh, no.
We'll be there all day.
You can never get a word in edgewise.
Good-bye, honey.
I may be small... but in the biggest, helpfullest way!
Eeyore?
Where are you? Tigger?
Where are you?
Oh, no.
The bees!
Oh! Ohh!
What can I do?
Well, I did help you get the haycorn... and bring you across the river.
Maybe my friends need me.
I have to find them.
Owl, have you seen Piglet?
Piglet? Heh heh.
Of course I've seen Piglet-- many times.
He's about so high, with little pink ears--
No, no, no. We mean now!
Have you seen him this morning?
Hmm. I can't imagine that he's changed that much.
Ohh.
De do do do do do.
This is the part where Owl goes on for a while.
As a matter of fact,
I just saw him go by.
He was just here?
Shh. Come on. Let's go.
...before he's missing.
Then you could stop, of course...
in the obvious place, which is...
- Ohh.
- As I was saying...
I have some great stories... about my second cousin Rupert, who stowed away on a...
Eeyore, come on!
As I was saying, the great expedition-- what an expedition it was.
I told you this was a silly idea.
But he was just at Owl's.
The scrappity book does know where he's going!
Well, Owl's house was on page one.
How about page two?
Which is a picture of...
Kanga's house.
Well, then, Kanga's house is where we'll look for Piglet.
I think you must be right,
Rabbit.
Piglet has always liked visiting Kanga's.
Not always.
There was one time I remember.
Oh, yes. When Kanga and Roo... first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.
Remember, Rabbit?
Uh, n-no.
I, uh, I don't seem to recall.
Here, this'll remind your rememberer.
- Hoo hoo!
- Ohh.
And you came up with a big plan, Rabbit.
I told you-- I don't remember.
There it is.
You know, if I remember correctly...
this story is really about Piglet.
Well, I just don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
I tell you, we won't be safe until they're out.
Out of the Hundred Acre Wood.
- Rabbit...
- Shh!
Isn't it a bit early to be spying?
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, it's actually moving in!
Ohh! Ohh!
Roo. Roo, dear?
Here I am, mama! Ha ha ha.
It's an invasion!
Do you think they're f-f-fierce?
Ha ha!
What does fierce look like?
That's what fierce looks like!
She swallowed him whole!
Ohh! Uhh!
Ohh, d-d-dear.
He'll be eaten for sure.
Ohh, are you all right?
Blaaah! Don't eat me!
Why, you must be Piglet.
My, when Christopher Robin said you'd be dropping by...
I had no idea.
You know Christopher Robin?
Oh, yes.
He told us all about you... and Pooh and Rabbit and Tigger.
The ones hiding in that tree over there.
Hello, dears.
Did you hear that?
She called us dears.
I'm Kanga, and somewhere around here is baby Roo.
I'm not a baby!
- See? I can do this!
- Ohh!
Well, it's very nice of you...
to go out of your way to welcome us.
- Ha ha ha!
- Aah!
Oops. Sorry.
Oh, Roo.
Piglet, it's almost breakfast time.
Would you like to come in for a little bite, perhaps?
Aaah! l do like the sound of the taste of that.
Uh, no, no, no.
We're all due on the other side of the wood... and we can't be late.
Good-bye.
Good-bye!
Might I, uh, get that little something to go?
Come on!
Aren't they dears?
One--Pooh will distract Kanga... long enough for two--
Tigger and I to take Roo from her pouch... and three-- replace him with Piglet.
That is very simple.
Just three little steps and--
What?!
Replace Roo w-w-with m-m-me?
You and Roo are the same size, give or take here or there.
Kanga won't know the difference. Ha ha.
Not until it's too late. Ha ha.
How much too late?
Until after we say, ''Aha!''
What do you think? Huh? Hmm?
Ahh? Hmm?
''Ha ha''?
Why would we say, ''Ha ha''?
Not ''Ha ha,'' Piglet. ''Aha.''
It's a word to say...
''This is how things are and were meant to be.''
Then Kanga will know that we know where Roo is... and we'll only give him back... if she promises to leave the Hundred Acre Wood... and never return. Ha ha.
How is she gonna know that that is what our aha-ing means?
Because we'll practice saying it in just the right way.
We're counting on you, Piglet.
Now everyone pretend that their flower is Kanga.
Ha ha. Ready? Set.
There you all are.
Oh, you brought flowers!
What nice new neighbors.
Heh. Uhh!
- Ahem.
- All right, I'm goin'!
Roo, dear! Time to come inside!
In a minute, mama!
Ready, Pooh?
Yes.
Except for one small thing.
- What's that?
- What is it I'm supposed to do?
Oh! Talk to her very hard... so that she doesn't notice anything.
Oh, of course. Heh heh.
Come on, Roo.
Hop in. Let's go inside.
Oh, Kanga!
Um, talk to her very hard about what?
Anything!
I was just wondering... uh, that is... do you think that... is that a fish in that tree?
- Oh!
- Which tree, dear?
Up there.
Snug as a piggy in a blanket.
What are you playing,
Mr. Rabbit?
That's not a fish, Pooh bear.
It's a bird.
Oh, yes, but is it a starling or a mackerel?
Ohh, it looks kinda wiggly.
It could be a jellyfish.
Hmm. It's tough to say.
If you'll forgive me, dear, we really must be going.
Kind of a peanut butter and jellyfish, isn't it?
Whoa, whoa! Wait, frog!
- Aah! Oh, no!
- Yippee!
Whoo!
- Yecch! Ptoo!
- Let's do it again!
This is a fun game!
Ohh.
Are you all right in there, Roo?
I'm OK. I'm OK!
All right, Roo, dear.
Yahoo!
- Ha ha! This is fun!
- Slow down!
Rabbit?
Oh, Roo.
Wooh-ha...booh-ha?
Uh...uh...ha ha.
Um... what was that word?
- Aha?
- That's the word.
Ah-haah!
Aaah!
Help!
Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear!
Oh, my, Roo, dear.
You've lost your bounce.
Tigger! Pooh bear!
I think it's time for your fishy oil.
Fishy oil? What fishy oil?
It'll help you bounce nice and high.
You don't want to grow up small and weak, like Piglet.
Now, did you have something you wanted to tell me... Roo?
-Uh, no--
- Down the hatch!
Ptoo! Blecch!
See that?
You got your bounce back.
And if you're a good little Roo...
I'll let you have another spoonful.
No-o-o!
Oh, dear. I'm a goner!
Aaah!
You act like I'm going to cook you for dinner.
A-a-aren't you?
Why, of course not.
Ohh! l'm going to give you a bath.
Aah! Cook me instead!
But, Roo, dear.
Don't you know by now...
a mother always knows what's best?
Whew !
Aah!
Aah!
Ah-choo!
Oh, my goodness!
Aah!
Whee! Ha ha ha!
Whee! Ha ha ha!
Now, you know what's next.
I'm afraid to find out.
There's always two things you get after your bath.
A cookie.
Mwah. And a kiss... Piglet.
Oh.
Well, it's a very subtle distinction.
But you see, a jellyfish sounds more like a--
''Blblblblbl!
''Hi, I'm a jellyfish!''
Kinda like that.
Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear!
Another creature of the fiercerest kind!
Rabbit was right.
But it's me--Piglet!
Nah, the Piglet we know isn't half as fuzzy as you.
Why, you can't pull the fluff over our eyes!
Pooh, t-tell him who I am.
Well, I'd love to... whoever you are.
Come to think of it, he might be... a fuzzy-fringed thingamaw hatsis.
Ohh.
No, no, no. This is more of the feather-furred... frizzamabobble variety.
But can we be sure, Tigger?
Oh! I'll prove it to you!
Piglet, where did you come from?
Lucky thing that fuzzy-fringed thingamabob didn't get you.
What did you find out?
Was she awfully fierce and fiercefully awful?
At first, I thought so, but then I found out... she's very nice.
Hello, dears.
Oh, she called us dears again.
Ha ha!
I could get used to this.
Would you like to come in for that little something now?
I'd love to.
I love little somethings.
- But what do we tell Rabbit?
- Wheeee!
Ha ha! Mama, look at me!
Roo!
You gotta see
Mr. Rabbit's garden!
Oh, you hear that?
Mr. Rabbit. Ha ha.
It's got carrots and lettuce and beets... and we played leap bunny--
All right. Settle down, dear.
Now , what do we say to Mr. Rabbit?
Thank you, Mr. Rabbit.
I had fun.
Well, I, uh, certainly enjoyed myself, too... and you can call me Rabbit.
I like you, Rabbit.
I like you, too, Roo.
Aha!
You're right, Piglet.
This is the way things are and were meant to be.
You know, if it weren't for Piglet...
I wouldn't be friends with Roo.
And we'd never have found out how nice Kanga was.
We'd never have any of Kanga's songs.
Or her hugs.
Or her cookies, which my nose is telling my tummy-- are right nearby. Heh heh.
Kanga!
We're so glad you didn't leave!
What are you talking about,
Tigger?
How Piglet took a bath for us.
Not just any old buddy...
would do some thing that brave for his friends.
Don't know if I would.
It was a very biggish thing...
for a littleish guy to do.
And we're ever so worried about him, you see... because we lost him at the honey harvest...
so we're using his book of memories to find him... we hope.
Ohh, dear, Piglet.
But he's so small.
He could be in big danger.
Mama, may I help them look for Piglet?
Oops. Sorry, Eeyore.
Can I, mama? Can I?
Of course, dear.
Piglet needs your help.
Pooh, would you like a cookie before you go?
Oh, my heart tells me I should keep looking for Piglet.
Oh, but you dears will need something... to keep your strength up.
My tummy says yes.
Oh, I just thought
Piglet would need... to keep his strength up, too.
- Bye, mama.
- Bye-bye, dear.
So, where do we look first?
The scrapbook will give us an idea.
It's a book of memories.
It remembers where Piglet is.
Try page three.
Page three shows all of us at the North Pole.
Hey, that was the day we made...
our most spien deriferous discovery of all.
Then that's where we shall look.
But this is not the way to the North Pole.
Well, last time, if
I reconnoiter correctically... the north pole was sort of in a south-down-easterly... kind of over and down direction this way... magnellically speaking.
No. Last time we went this way.
No. That would be the Northeast Pole.
- No, no, no, and no.
- Don't be ridiculous.
I know what I'm talking about .
It's this way.
I--don't interrupt.
Perhaps if we told the story... the story will tell us how to get there.
Don't forget the part about Piglet.
Piglet?
How does Piglet fit in?
Oh, Roo's right.
It really is a story about Piglet, isn't it?
Nine-itty-eight, nine-itty-nine... seventy-two-itty and thirteen-itty... and forty-six-itty... and one whole hundred... gravity-defiant,
Tiggerific bounces.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Look out below!
Hmm.
Aah!
Heh heh heh heh.
Hello, Tigger. Hello, Piglet.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Aw, just waiting for the other shoe to plop.
I knew it. Hoo hoo! These things always travel in pairs.
These are Christopher Robin's big boots.
They can mean only one thing.
An expedition.
Yahoo hoo hoo hoo!
Um, which petition?
Yes. An expedition.
It's when you go off to find a thing.
What are w  going to find,
Christopher Robin?
The North Pole.
Is it scary?
What is the North Pole?
Yeah. Come to think of it, we never found one of them before.
Well, it's a thing you discover.
Are bears good at discovering it?
- And Tiggers?
- Everyone will come along.
And if you see the North Pole, shout, ''Eureka!''
- Oof!
- Why would we do that?
Because it means,
''There's the North Pole.''
Eureka!
Where?
- Where?
- Gesundheit.
Sorry.
I--I was just practicing.
We need a marching song.
A marching song to help us along.
This is fun.
One more time!
I like that song.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Silly old bear.
Would you like a haycorn, Pooh?
No, thank you, but a cookie would be nice. Ha.
Or a banana.
Ow!
Christopher Robin... perhaps I could find it easier if only I was sure.
That is, if I knew what the North Pole looked like.
Mmm.
Well, it's kind of...
It's sort of, well...
I suppose we'll know exactly what it is when we see it.
Are we there yet? Whoa!
Pooh!
Ho ho...
I just fed my tummy, and it's still calling me.
Ha ha ha! Hey, look at me, Pooh!
Oh, I am.
Pooh, I'm swimming!
Just a moment, Roo.
I'm talking to my tummy.
Well, of course you're swimming.
You shouldn't have had that second cookie.
That's not your stomach, Pooh.
It's Roo!
Oh, my!
Roo, I don't believe... expeditions usually go into the water.
Quick!
Don't panic, Kanga.
Everything's fine here!
Nobody's in any kind of a-- especially not Roo! Ha ha!
Do something!
Everyone--do anything!
Don't worry, Roo, boy!
I'll save ya!
Thanks, Tigger, but I don't think I need saving.
I can help!
Piglet, stay here out of the way while we save Roo!
We don't want to have to rescue two little guys!
Catch onto my tail, Roo.
I'll pull ya out.
Just tell me when you're on.
Oops!
Oh!
Rabbit, Roo?
Are we going swimming?
Hey! Maybe we can use this to save Roo!
Give me a push, Pooh!
Thank you, Piglet.
Ha ha. Now I've got him!
Faster, Pooh! Faster! Pooh?
W ere is he, Rabbit?
Pooh! Look the other way!
I can see him perfectly from here!
Are you sure, Rabbit?
You're right.
You can see better from up here.
There he is!
- Aah!
- Oh!
Ha ha ha! Whoa!
Roo, are you OK?
I gotcha, Roo! I gotcha!
Here he is, Kanga!
Ta-da!
Oh... where'd he go?
- My Great Uncle Rupert...
- Pooh bear? Pooh bear!
Pooh bear!
You can rescue me now.
I'm gettin' kinda tired.
Use the pole! Use the pole!
No time for fishing, Piglet!
We gotta save Roo!
Grab on, Roo!
- Hee hee hee!
- Pooh, could you hold this?
Hee hee hee...
Did you see me swimmin'?
That's called swimmin', what I was doing.
Pooh bear!
Pooh bear!
Where did you find that stick?
What , uh, stick?
That stick!
Well, I was standing here without a stick... and then I had a stick, so... maybe the stick found me.
Assembled adventurers, the expedition is over... for Pooh has discovered the North Pole!
- This?
- That.
Eureka!
Hoo hoo! Well, I'll be.
That's the North Pole, all right, all righty!
I should have seen it myself!
But--but--oh... well... eureka!
- Eureka!
- Yay!
Hooray for Pooh!
- Polerific!
- Hooray!
Positively magnetic!
Goodness! Where's Eeyore?
Did ya grab on yet, Roo?
Roo?
Somebody.
Anybody?
Hooray for Pooh.
I always liked that story.
It has such a lovely end.
But nobody said hooray for Piglet.
He was so brave... for someone so small.
And Piglets hate water. Hoo hoo.
Come to think of it, so do Tiggers.
W-y-yooouh!
Wha-ha!
Thank you, tail!
Thank you, Piglet, wherever you are.
Look!
Piglet's scarf!
That's it! Come on, let's go!
Missed him again.
Oh, my.
You know Piglet's scarf never goes anywhere without Piglet.
Oh! This is more serious than I thought!
Maybe he's in grave danger.
Maybe Heffalumps got him!
- Heffalumps?
- Or--or Woozles!
W-Woozles?
And now he's out there somewhere...
And now he's out there somewhere... with a storm brewing in.
Oh, goodness!
Goodness!
Do you think he's gonna be all right?
Piglet shall be very all right, indeed.
Don't let his small size worry you.
Yep. Once he even made a whole house.
He did?
Do you know the story of The House at Pooh Corner?
Mmm... no.
- Oh, yes. It's right here.
- Page three.
On page four.
That's after three.
Oh, It's a lovely tale.
Don't you think so, Tigger?
- Tigger?
- Huh?
- Pooh Corner. Remember?
- Oh, yeah!
Is this story about Piglet, too?
Why, yes, Roo, it is.
He seems to be the hero of every story.
Goodness!
I was just thinking, Pooh...
Oh! Were you thinking of a way to keep warm?
Actually, I was thinking... about how you have a house and I have a house... and Rabbit and Owl... and Christopher Robin all have houses... but poor Eeyore has nothing.
Well, that's certainly something we could think about.
Hmm...
- Think, think, think. Hmm...
- Think, think, think. l'v e got it! Whoa--oh!
Got what? we'll build Eeyore a house of his own!
Oh, that's a wonderful idea,
Pooh!
But where shall we build it?
Well... right here.
Because this is where
I thought of it.
And since this is where
I thought of it... we shall call this place
Pooh Corner.
Pooh Corner?
Uh, Pooh, I was thinking along with you.
Yes, that's true, Piglet.
So we could call this place
Pooh and Piglet Corner... if Pooh Corner didn't sound better... which it does, being smaller and more like a corner.
So, Pooh Corner it is.
Look! Snow somersaults!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Whoa! Whoa-oa-oa!
Bother.
You know, I tried to stop, but it's snow use.
Get it? Snow use! Hoo hoo hoo!
So, whatcha doin'?
We're going to build Eeyore a house at Pooh Corner.
What a tickerific idea! Hoo hoo!
Whatcha going to build it with?
Uh, we haven't decided.
Say! I just bounced by a humongerous pile of sticks!
They'd be positively perfect for a donkey house!
Come on! Bounce this way!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Follow the bouncing Tigger!
What did I tell ya?
More sticks than you can stick a shake at.
Gee, it's almost as if someone left them here for us.
Whoo--ooh--whoo!
I wonder...
Naw!
Now let's get started, so we can finish in time.
Uhh!
In time for what? Ah!
Lunch.
Hello!
There. It's all entirely done.
Let's show old donkey boy the fruits of our elbow grease.
Oh, bother.
I suspect-erate there's something... definitely wrong with these sticks.
All we wanted was for Eeyore to have his own house.
You know,
Eeyore could come live with me.
That is very hospiticious of you, Pooh.
Let's go give old donkey boy the good news!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Oh, dear.
Hello!
Pooh bear!
Oh, you're just in time!
Look what O made.
Why, Christopher Robin.
It's wonderful!
What is it?
Why, it's you, Pooh bear.
Ha ha. No wonder he looks so familiar.
He looks just like you!
Except, of course, for the donkey head.
Eeyore, were you under there the whole time?
I suppose I was.
Weren't you awfully cold under there?
I've been colder.
Last night, for instance, it got downright--
Freezing.
So I did it.
I built myself a house.
Did ya hear that?
Eeyore built himself a house!
Just a leaky pile of sticks.
Did you say... sticks?
So you have seen it. l have? Seen what?
You know, the funny thing about houses... is, uh, well, they never know... if they're comin' or goin', and so they do.
Well, someone somewhere must know something.
I do !
What's that?
It's a high-steppin' pig highfaluter!
I believe it's Piglet on stilts.
Eeyore's house is over there.
Come on. I-I'll show you.
Toodle-oo.
Look at that!
Well, I'll be...
Oh, my goodness!
Welcome home, Eeyore.
Hee hee hee.
Whoa-oh...
Whoa!
Whaa--
Whoaaa!
Hmm... it's my house, all right.
But I'm sure this isn't where I built it.
Where you built it?
But--but--I--
Hmm. I suppose the wind must have blown it over here.
The wind?
Oh, yeah, the wind.
Oh, well, it's been known to do strange and windy-like things.
I think the wind had a little help.
Right, Piglet?
The important thing is,
Eeyore has a house... and here it is, and it's as good as ever.
And even never betterer.
You really think so?
Oh, yes. Much more better than ever, even, Piglet.
Just one thing bothers me.
Oh, dear. What might that be?
'Fraid I'll lose it again.
Don't w rry, Eeyore.
I put up a sign... so you'll always know where it is. See?
''Pooh Corner.''
Nice.
Hooray for Eeyore's house!
Hooray for Eeyore's house!
What?
It's a little crowded... but it'll do.
And that is how
Piglet got the idea... that you, Eeyore, should have your own house.
You mean Piglet built
Eeyore's house all by himself?
Yes, and that's just how much Piglet cares.
Uh-huh. Best house I ever had.
And named it after me.
Oh.
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet, Piglet.
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet! Piglet! Piglet!
Ah-choo!
Oh, dear.
We better find him soon.
Roo's getting cold.
Piglet!
Piglet! Piglet!
Well, perhaps we should look in the book again.
Hey, I just got a Tiggerific idea.
Let's see where the book ends and go there.
- What do you think?
- No, no, no. lf we do this in an orderly manner... we'll find him much quicker.
Now, let's see.
We've been there and there...
But orderlier doesn't seem to be working, does it?
All I'm concerned about is finding Piglet.
Well, I want to find him, too.
We all want to find him!
Rabbit, look!
Oh, bother.
- Rabbit, the book!
- Oh, my.
You're ruining it, Rabbit!
I am not.
Hand it over, bunny boy.
Finding Piglets is what Tiggers do best. lt's what Rabbits do best.
- Tiggers!
- No, Rabbits.
- Tiggers!
- Rabbits!
- No, Tiggers!
- Rabbits!
- Stop it! Stop fighting!
- Oh, be careful.
Rabbits!
That's the only way we have to find Piglet.
Oh, no!
There goes our map.
And Piglet's memories.
I only wanted to find Piglet.
We all did.
Oh, dear.
We better go back to Piglet's.
We have to get Roo warm and dry.
Oh, I do wish I had called it
Pooh and Piglet Corn--oh.
That's the Piglet I know --
always glad to see you.
- Always thoughtful.
- Always brave.
- Mm-hmm.
- Never thinking of himself.
Draw another one, Pooh.
We got to go get Piglet!
Let's go find Piglet, indeed.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Uhh!
Oh, poor Piglet.
Oh. Oh, goodness.
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet!
Piglet?
Look.
Oh, look what I found.
It's one of Piglet's scrapbook pages.
Look, another one.
Maybe we could put Piglet's scrappity book back together.
Then we can find him in no time.
Well, let's keep looking.
I found one!
Me, too.
Me, too.
Aha!
Eureka!
- I think...
- I found...
Another other!
- Here's one.
- Wonderful.
We're getting closer.
Here's one.
How many does that make?
Look, here's another one.
-Piglet will be so happy.
-What's that over there?
Uhh!
Come back, memory!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Ohh!
Guhh!
Ooh!
One more scrappy page for Piglet's scrappity book.
Hey, look, there it is.
But how will we get it?
Oh, we need help.
That's got to be dangerous.
What could he be thinking?
- Who?
- Pooh.
No. Now, now, no one panic.
The first thing we do is not to panic because--
Somebody do something!
Do anything!
Uhh! Oh, my goodness!
Stay calm.
Everybody calm. Don't panic.
Oh, my goodness.
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?
I'm just getting
Piglet's memories.
Oh, bother.
Pooh needs our help!
Oh!
Oh, bother, bother.
Rabbit was right.
We could use a little help.
Here you go, buddy boy.
We made you a rescue rope!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Out of us!
- Me, too.
It's our plan.
Ohh. Ohh.
Oh, my.
Pooh, what are you waiting for?
The rescue rope isn't rescuing.
- We need a little bit more.
- We just need a little help.
- Who's small enough?
- Oh, dear. Who can help?
- Piglet! Oh!
- Piglet.
- Piglet!
- Piglet!
You can do it, Piglet.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
My friends need me.
Hang on, Pooh! Uhh!
Oh, I'm hanging. Piglet.
Ohh.
Oh, Piglet! Your memories!
Whoa!
Oh, no!
Ohh.
Ohh...
Oh, no.
We--we never got to tell Piglet... how we feel about him.
Poor Pooh.
Should've told them when we had the chance.
Ohh. Ohh!
Oh!
Here you go, R-Rabbit.
Something must be very sad.
Well, of course it's sad.
- Pooh?
- Pooh?
Piglet!
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.
We're so glad to see you.
- Glad to see me?
- Oh, yes.
It's so good to have you back again.
Yeah. We've been following your memories... all over the Hundred Acre Wood... and they led us right to you.
Too bad they're all floating down the river.
Oh, goodness.
- Oh, no.
- Oops.
Oh, bother.
We're ever so sorry, Piglet.
Aw, the scrapbook's not that important.
But it showed us the great things you've done.
Oh, l've never done anything great.
Well, of course you have.
Let's tell him, everyone.
No. Let's show him.
That's a wonderful idea.
Come on. Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Hurry!
I don't know if I stand the excitement.
- Here we are.
- Ho ho. Go on.
Is that me?
That's you.
- I'm so big.
- Well, of course you are.
Why, you're double-XL.
Hoo hoo hoo!
If it weren't for you,
Piglet...
I wouldn't be friends with Roo.
Yeah. Yeah. And thanks for saving me with the North Pole.
- Oh.
- Piglet...
Pooh Corner's not a bad place to live.
I'd say this calls for a celebration.
Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray!
Come on, chase me.
Here I come, Eeyore! Watch out!
Come on, you can do better than that.
Hey, where you going?
Here I come!
Get him, Roo!
- Oh!
- Roo!
Oops. Sorry.
Ha ha ha. That's funny.
That's very funny.
Uhh! Ohh.
- Ho ho! Look!
- Piglet, can I try?
Mmm, mmm.
Oh, my.
Oh, do something, everyone!
Oh, uh, um...
Oh, dear!
Good one, Piglet!
It's carrot cake.
Oh, Rabbit, you're a nut.
Mmm. That's delicious.
Oh, dear.
- Where's Pooh?
- Piglet!
Piglet, I have one more thing to show you.
But, Pooh, your cake.
It can wait. Hurry, Piglet.
We shall have a little something... right after I show you a little something, Piglet.
It's right over here.
Ohh.
''Pooh and Piglet Corner.''
Yes, Piglet.
It's the least we could do... for a very small Piglet who's done such very big things.
Thank you, Piglet.
This is fun.
One more time!
Le Vaillant was struck by the hypocrisy
of killing fellow human beings in the name of religion.
Especially since these people professed belief in the same God.
The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written account of his experiences in the Holy Land,
tells us he wandered the streets of conquered Jerusalem
for days after that bloody battle,
until he found the entrance of a cave
that ran beneath the length of the holy city.
Inside that cave, he began to record his epiphany,
which became the basis for a new religious sect.
An order that would combine the fundamental tenets
of the three major religions of his day.
His first converts were
Christian knights
who'd also become disenchanted by the bloodshed.
The force of his convictions even won over a number of Muslims and Jews.
Former enemies who now became willing converts to the new faith.
Many years after completing the original Fazar,
Le Vaillant had further revelations.
He wrote these down, intending them to be added as the final chapter.
Around this time he and his followers were being accused of heresy
by the crusader authorities.
On their way to Syria, he and a group of disciples were intercepted
by some of the very same crusaders he had once commanded.
During the battle that followed,
Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.
The final chapter he had written was lost.
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?
You'll be like the fox in the henhouse.
Heh, heh. Take as many eggs as you like.
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one.
My friend, this is 1000 percent.
By this time tomorrow, you'll be in New York making a deal.
And I'll be in Tel Aviv waiting for my commission.
Visual is all clear.
- Come on.
- Done.
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.
Do you see the egg?
It's beautiful.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I'm going for it.
- I got it.
- Yuri's the man with the plan!
- You're the man with the plan.
- I told you...
- Shit.
- Rudy?
Are you okay?
- Was that a gunshot?
- No, I farted.
Yuri, guide me out of here.
Oh, shit, Rudy. I'm sorry.
Toilet!
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You wanna get towed away?
Sorry. Watch it for me.
- Hey.
- Thanks.
Right on.
Perhaps you've seen enough stones and carvings. Come with me.
I will show you a garment.
A most controversial acquisition.
This was unearthed beneath a false storage room, situated by Theodosius as a decoy against thieves.
But often success as an archeologist depends on knowing where to dig.
Well, I can dig her. Heh.
Rudy! Would you take over?
Can I have your?
Okay, everybody, follow me.
Dad, what's up? My main man!
Why must you always attract attention?
Come on, I love people, I love life...
You love to embarrass me.
I'm just having fun, Dad.
- Anyway, you called. You want to talk?
- Yes, but not here. Come on.
Tell me, are you still involved with that same nonsense?
Hey, I'm legit now.
Straight. Import-export.
And I'm kicking ass.
Now, check this out.
Here, take it. For you.
Fancy watches, fast cars, easy money.
What does it prove in the grand scheme of things, Rudy?
- Yeah?
- You have the egg?
I've got it. Trust me, it's in pristine condition.
- Ten o'clock.
- Yeah, I'll be there.
Later, tonight. Some business.
- I hope for your sake it is legal.
- A thousand percent.
Come on.
Damn plane tickets.
They are here somewhere.
- Where you going? On a dig?
- No, an interview.
Someone I've been trying to meet for a very long time.
- Don't touch that!
- Sorry.
What is it?
The lost chapter of the Fazar.
Oh.
The Fazar happens to be the holy scripture for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.
And, yes, to answer your inevitable next question, it is quite valuable.
But only to practicing members of the Order.
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.
Rudy, we need to discuss some issues.
Come by my apartment this evening.
- Uh, I've got some business tonight.
- Mm-hm.
In fact, uh, it's time to go.
All right. Can you at least call me?
Of course.
Absolutely.
- Tonight. It has to be tonight.
- You've got it, Dad.
‚ô™ In your new dress
As you spend your night ‚ô™
‚ô™ Walkin' and boppin'
Just to get it right ‚ô™
‚ô™ Chugging your drink
Till we break up out ‚ô™
‚ô™ It's a mystery to me
How you do that ‚ô™‚ô™
Be careful.
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.
So let's see what Santa brought for me.
Mm?
This egg was designed by Peter Carl Faberg√©.
A special gift to Czar Nicholas.
Look at the inlay.
Twenty-four-karat gold.
What can I say? One of a kind.
- That's why it's so expensive.
- You cannot find this on the Net. Ha, ha.
That's for sure. But stealing it from the Russian mafia, come on.
Russian mafia?
In fact, he's got some friends.
Very nasty guys.
If they found out about this, you'd end up with your balls stuffed and sewn inside your mouth.
Whoa. So the deal about...
No, no, no. Here's the deal.
I'm giving you an easy out.
I'll take this hot potato off your hands.
- And I'll assume the risk.
- Risk is my business.
You're not listening, Rudy.
Just a second, please.
- Hello?
- Rudy!
Where are you?
You promised to call me tonight!
Uh, I'm in a business meeting.
Really? Are you buying a disco?
- Dad, please.
- I can hear that music!
Hey, where are you going?
That is just what I'm trying to explain to you.
Rudy, what is going on?
Give it to him.
Rudy.
Hey, come here!
Rudy?
My egg.
Move!
Oh, shit.
My eyes!
Got a problem here?
Hey, can I make a phone call over here?
Not yet, Rudy.
Heard you had a big night last night.
How are you gonna pay for all that?
Sell your Ferrari?
Listen, I had a bad night, okay?
Why do I have to look at your face in the morning? Huh?
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?
Yeah. Why?
Yesterday, there was a manuscript in this case.
Last night, security discovered it missing.
So what?
Your father was last to leave the building.
This morning, nobody seems to know where he is.
A case of like father, like son?
- You're full of shit.
- Rudy, relax.
Why should he break the glass if he had a key?
Nobody's making any accusations.
We just wanna ask him some questions.
You have any idea where he is?
No.
Rudy, I've been trying your mobile, but all I get is this recording.
Oh, never mind. I will try again later.
I'm staying at an old friend's home.
Remember Walt Finley?
He is teaching at Ben Gurion University.
Now, this is his number: 972...
- Hello?
- Rudy?
- Dad, how are you?
- Thank God you're there.
- Where are you?
- Israel.
- Israel?
- Pay attention, I beg you.
I was at the police station. You know what they're saying about you?
Not now. I'm afraid I've gotten myself into some big trouble.
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing? Hang up!
Dad! Who's that?
Book me on the first flight to Israel.
Tel Aviv. Right away!
Take your glasses off, please.
Visiting Israel on business or pleasure?
Pleasure, always.
Excuse me, uh, what's the delay?
Our database shows that you've had several arrests for illegally transporting artifacts.
Does it also show I was never convicted?
Please open your carry-on.
Any artifacts which you have not declared?
Oh, the Mona Lisa.
- Hmm. You like to joke.
- They say laughter opens up the soul.
Well, let it open the rest of your luggage too.
- You're joking, right?
- Ha-ha-ha. No.
You know, this is bullshit.
No, Mr. Cafmeyer. This is Israel.
I apologize.
Security is extra tight this month.
Muslims are making their pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Ramadan.
Passport, please.
Rudy? Rudy Cafmeyer!
- Who is this?
- Walter Finley.
Professor of archeology at Ben Gurion University.
And what is your relationship to this man?
Not that it's any of your business,
I'm a friend of his father's.
I've known him since he was in knickers, which would have put you in diapers.
Now, are there any more insurmountable obstacles we have to overcome here, young lady?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Shalom.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Where's my dad?
- Look, let's get your bags into my car.
- Watch where you go!
- Up yours!
Ozzie Cafmeyer is a cranky old fool.
Calls me two days ago to pick him up at the airport.
So I took him back to my house.
We had dinner, talked...
What was he doing here?
I'm getting to that!
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
A few years ago, he found scrolls near the Syrian border.
The lost final chapter of the Fazar written by Le Vaillant himself.
Was he translating it?
More than that.
He was writing a history of the sect.
An unauthorized history.
He's been e-mailing me his chapters, having me lock them in a safe-deposit box here.
- Why a safe-deposit box in Israel?
- Because he trusted me.
Here, here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.
- Okay, where can I find these guys?
- I'll show you.
Their monastery is in east Jerusalem.
The other side of the Mount of Olives.
- We're wasting time. Let's go.
- The present-day Order is just as reclusive as ever.
Fanatically adverse to publicity.
No contact to the outside world. You'd do better trying to get an audience with the pope.
Those are the guys that came by the house and picked up your dad!
Hey! Hey, you!
- Jump in. I'll drive.
- You don't know the way.
- You'll navigate, okay?
- Be careful. This is a classic car.
Professor, buckle up.
- Aah!
- It's them!
Get down!
My car!
Shit. Sorry about the car.
- There they are.
- Let's just nail these sons of bitches.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Where's my father, you son of a bitch?
I'm gonna kill you!
You okay?
Finley, look out!
Rudy...
- Stay right there! Don't move!
- He needs a doctor. Help me!
- Hey, it's not me!
- Up.
- Get up.
- It's not me!
And so you are telling us these men kidnapped your father.
They took him somewhere.
No one's heard from him.
Mr. Cafmeyer,
I can smell bullshit a mile away.
You're only five feet from me.
I believe you're using the alleged disappearance as a cover to smuggle artifacts out of Israel.
Alleged? My father was here.
Now he's missing.
This has nothing to do with why you are in police custody.
You were found next to the corpse of a prominent professor.
Let me guess.
You're accusing me of killing him?
Until we have more facts, all options are open.
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel until we complete our investigation into the professor's death.
You know why you're smelling bullshit?
Because you're up to your nose in it.
I'll be next door if you need anything.
- What about a taxi?
- Within reason.
- What about my father?
- We're looking into it. Good night.
- Good night, officer.
- Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.
- How are you?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Yuri.
- Rudy!
Rudy, let me explain what happened in Odessa.
Explain what? You left me hanging like a piece of laundry.
But there was this cop...
Admit it! You little slimeball.
Or you'll never see your money.
- What money?
- I sold the egg. Remember our deal?
Ten percent.
That's 50 G's for you, my friend.
Lucky for you, this place makes me generous.
Thank you, Rudy.
Thank you.
Rudy, do you have the cash with you?
It's under my mattress.
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.
Tonight? Uh...
Can we meet first?
Come to my office in Tel Aviv.
I have a beautiful new penthouse suite in the diamond district.
You'll be my special guest.
We'd like to use the phone.
Rudy?
Uh... Yuri, I have a much better idea.
Yuri.
Yuri.
Is that you, Rudy?
You slimeball. You almost got me killed!
Hey, Rudy, it wasn't my fault!
- You owe me.
- Owe you?
- You owe me.
- What do you mean?
- You owe me, I said!
- Anything, Rudy. Anything.
Just tell me what I can do to help, my friend.
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?
- Sure.
- Sure?
- Sure.
- Sure.
I'm positive! I'm a pro, my friend!
- And this print.
- Done. For you, anything.
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...
It wasn't my fault! There were cops...
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go. Go.
Shalom.
Look, there he is. Stop!
Hey, you! Stop!
Cafmeyer! Hey, you! Stop!
Get away! Move! Hey, hey! Stop!
No.
Hey, you! Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come on! Come on!
Don't move!
Freeze!
Huh?
Excuse me.
Cuff them.
You know how much trouble I'm in because of you? Do you know?
Let's have a coffee and talk about it.
You have proved to me that my original hunch was correct.
You cannot be trusted.
I came here to look for my father.
I did what I had to do because nobody gives a shit!
We spoke to Immigration.
They have no record of him entering the country.
That's impossible.
What's really going on?
Were you perhaps planning to smuggle out a little something, hm?
Hey, those are mine!
What's going on?
Yes, we checked you out of the hotel.
Change at the airport.
You're going home.
- You cannot do that.
- I can, and will.
Can you take him to the airport without him escaping?
Yes, sir.
- What about Finley's murder?
- You're no longer a suspect.
I'm still the only witness!
We have your testimony, thank you.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.
You're not helping me! You're helping yourself! You're full of shit!
- Move it!
- What's going on?!
What did you find?
Today, as every year at this time, we come to this special place to commemorate the departure of the knights of Christendom from these shores.
Brother Cyrus will now lead us in a passage from the Fazar.
Thank you, first disciple.
As was prophesied in the Book of Tribulations, we await the return of the Army of God, who shall rise like a tide against the sea of those who do not believe.
Cyrus, by what authority do you quote from that disreputable source?
As second disciple, you should know better!
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.
Le Vaillant himself once followed a false path toward God.
We must choose our words carefully.
Wars have started for less.
I will ask for forgiveness at evening vespers.
Your flight doesn't leave for a few hours. You hungry?
Someone here actually cares about me?
We may be overly cautious with security and our artifacts, but we're not barbarians, Mr. Cafmeyer.
It'd be a shame if you left without sampling some fresh hummus.
You like?
- I'd like it more without this.
- Sorry.
Look, I came here to find my father.
He told me he was in trouble.
He's the type of guy who never lies.
It sounds like you really care about him.
The two of you must be very close.
He taught me everything about paintings, antiques, you name it.
You certainly applied that knowledge.
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.
- That's bothering you now?
- Yes, because now he's missing.
And I'm just starting to realize what I missed.
Why am I telling you all this?
You're tired.
You're jet-lagged. You'll feel a lot better once you're back on a plane.
No, I'll feel better when I find him.
This attack was a brutal and senseless act
perpetrated on a man who devoted his life to God and to peace.
His brothers and sisters mourn his passing
and pray that those responsible find repentance.
Who died?
Pierre Gaudet, the leader of some religious sect.
- You mean the Order?
- Mm-hm.
Come on, this way.
Come on. Please keep on moving.
- Hello.
- Get the prisoner off the plane.
- I want him brought back here.
- Why?
We've been informed he's leaving with an artifact.
- Customs checked him. I saw...
- Just do it, lieutenant!
- What's going on?
- You're staying in Israel.
What?
They said you're trying to smuggle an artifact.
Do you believe that?
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?
When I signal, run to the back stairs.
If you make it to the service road,
I'll be waiting.
- If I make it?
- Now push me.
Just push me.
Over here! He's escaping! Quick!
- Unh!
- Quick! I need assistance up here!
What? What are you doing? Hey! Hey!
The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!
Rudy! Get in the back. Hurry.
Get down. Get down!
You all right?
You missed him. He went over the fence.
- You're safe now.
- Safe from what?
I've got some questions for you, okay?
- I used to belong to the Order.
- What?
- You should've told me this before.
- I couldn't.
- Of course not. You're part of it.
- No, I didn't know this was related.
- Oh, sure. You knew about my father.
- Where are you going? Hey!
Hey!
I just risked my ass for you!
Why? So you can hand me over to the Order?
I left the Order when I was 18.
- Oh, you left the Order?
- I wanted to create my own life.
So meeting you at the airport was no accident.
Look, Rudy, let me explain a few things to you, okay?
Most of the followers are peaceful and life-affirming.
There is a small group of fanatics who believe in a darker path.
They call themselves the Army of God.
They've been on standby for years.
And you think they took my father?
I don't know. They might also be the ones who killed Gaudet.
Hey, Rudy, my friend!
- Who's the cop?
- Everything's fine. She's with us.
Uh-huh. My friend, look what
I printed out for you from the disc.
- It's not translated yet, but... Uh-huh.
- It looks like a map of Jerusalem.
Middle Ages, European design.
What's the language?
Aramaic. The language of Palestinian
Christians at the time the Crusades.
See these lines? Here and here?
They are caves and tunnels beneath the old city.
They've remained hidden since the holy wars.
Professor Finley told me about those.
What he didn't tell you is what they lead to.
Why would an archeology professor bring the scrolls to New York but leave the map in Israel hidden inside a safe-deposit box?
Because the map leads to something even more valuable.
- The people who left forgot something.
- Let's hide this.
Hands in the air!
Get them up! Move!
Where is it? Where is it?
Freeze!
Oh!
Oh.
Give me that.
Come on.
Hold on.
Rudy.
Thank you, Avram.
After all this time, you come back to me like this.
Avram, you know I've had to make some difficult choices.
You chose to leave.
Please, can we talk about this later?
I really need some water and clean rags right now.
- Here's some water.
- Thank you, Avram.
- Where am I?
- A friend's.
How long have I been here?
Two days now. Hey. Shh.
You really should rest.
- I'm okay.
- Well enough to leave?
- Israeli hospitality kills me.
- No, it just saved your life.
- Here. Your father's book.
- Yeah.
I've been going through this.
You really should too.
The lost chapter predicts a revolution,
one that is peaceful and spiritual in nature.
This will not be good news to the radical Army of God
who contend that Le Vaillant prophesied a catastrophic holy war.
I suspect this militant faction will stop at nothing
to suppress the true contents of this final chapter.
Though my safety may be an issue,
I have requested an interview with the first disciple
to make these matters known.
Your scholar seems to be on the verge of enlightenment.
It wouldn't hurt you to sample some of it yourself.
Dalia, the world is as filled with temptations as it is with false prophets.
Onions. I need onions.
- Is everything okay?
- We were just...
We were discussing the manuscript.
It's a fraud.
A fraud? The scrolls, they were tested.
- By whom? Secular scientists?
- If you would open your mind...
- To what?
- To this, Avram.
What is this? What is this?
It's mentioned in the Fazar.
Solomon's gold. A treasure the ancient Hebrews hid under the city.
Which might explain why people with guns have been chasing us.
It explains nothing but your ignorance.
The treasure is a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages.
Avram, I need to get to the monastery.
I think they're holding my father.
Impossible. No outsider is permitted.
What about an insider?
A member from overseas that is here on pilgrimage?
That's Cyrus.
The new first disciple.
Children of God, I stand here before you today in great sorrow.
For what should be a celebration of hope and joy, must instead be looked upon as a call to action.
God's vengeance for this murderous deed will be swift and without mercy!
May the eternal spirit of Pierre Gaudet guide us on this path of deliverance.
- Time to see if my father's alive.
- Try the catacombs first.
That door leads to a small stairway.
Follow it all the way down.
Rudy. Be careful.
Rudy.
- Dad! Are you all right?
- Rudy. Yes.
Let me get you out of here. Unh!
No, no, I already tried.
No, forget about me.
You have to stop them.
Pull off that tarp. You will see what this is all about.
Rudy, go. Go!
- This looks like a...
- A bomb?
Sorry we're late, but I could give a shit about this coronation.
Tonight, we will all witness a miracle.
As God's fury cleanses the souls of those against us, let the new age begin!
- Where are you going?
- To find Rudy.
Avram, we have to put a stop to this.
All right, I'm coming with you.
This way.
Rudy!
Dalia, stop! It's a trap.
Now be a good girl, Dalia, and come down here.
Since when did you take your vows with the Order, major?
The day Cyrus vowed there was treasure under the Temple Mount.
That's the day I found religion. Ha, ha.
Hello, professor.
Dad, meet Dalia. She's a good cop.
Now let's ask the major what the big bomb is for. Huh?
It's Ramadan.
Islamic leaders from around the world will be on the Temple Mount at noon.
What are you saying?
This nut case is gonna blow it up?
That will start World War III.
Especially when they find the bodies of an Israeli and an American.
No, no, you're crazy!
This is impossible.
You've completely misinterpreted the words of the first disciple.
And you are a naive moron.
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.
On the contrary, I've found it.
I want to thank you, young Cafmeyer, for unwittingly providing the final piece of the puzzle.
And thank you, Avram, for your loyalty and devotion.
But, first disciple, what they're saying here...
Avram, If you've read the Book of Tribulations carefully, you are aware that the holy war is triggered by a singular event.
Behold the event.
And as my unwavering one, I shall grant you the privilege of assisting us.
Bind him, and her too.
Now, where's my guide?
- Unh! Dad!
- No! Stop!
- There is no need for that!
- Then you will be assisting us too?
- What's he talking about?
- With the map, your father can guide us under the Temple Mount.
Cyrus, please. Millions will die.
It is written! I will raise Mount Moriah and build a new temple.
That prophecy you are quoting is a fabrication!
- Unh!
- Dad! Unh!
Don't do shit for him.
Apparently, stubbornness is an ingrained family trait.
Beats a messiah complex any day.
- Aah! Unh.
- Stop! I will do it. I will guide you.
God help us all.
He helps those who help themselves, professor.
We are near the Temple Mount.
That is where the traps begin.
Perhaps we should use someone expendable to lead the way.
Young Mr. Cafmeyer, we have a job for you.
Rudy!
- Rudy, be careful.
- Okay.
Go.
Avram.
Avram! Somebody help him!
No! Let me go, damn it!
Careful, Rudy.
Come on, Avram.
- You deceived me.
- This is the way according to the map.
- How do we proceed?
- What's the matter with you guys?
See these beams? We take them down and we build a bridge.
Oh, my God.
- This is not the Well of Souls.
- Unh!
In the next chamber, I swear.
Show me.
Directly above us, the Dome of the Rock,
Islam's third holiest shrine.
And henceforth from this day forward, the holiest shrine of the Order.
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.
Bring the bomb.
Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.
We'll get to that.
First, we fill these bags.
There's no time.
Would you take a look around you, Cyrus?
There's a king's treasure here.
Enough to finance 10 of your holy wars.
We set the bomb now.
We can do this the easy way, or the very easy way.
I have a prophecy to fulfill.
And I have a Swiss bank account to fill.
That's the only reason I joined your crazy scheme in the first place.
- Idiots!
- Professor, here.
Stop them! Don't let them get away!
- Unh!
- Aah!
No!
Avram, no!
- Rudy, your dad!
- Dad, you're hit.
- Unh! Unh.
- Dalia, come on.
Let's go. Over here.
Dad, you stay here. We'll be back.
I'll be fine.
Let's go. Come on.
They couldn't have come this far.
We must've passed them.
Come on, let's double back.
Let's split. Go!
Get after him!
I'll take care of that bitch!
- Ah. Help me with these.
- Assist him.
Shit!
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.
She's the dead cop!
Wrong, major.
- Professor, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Take my father out of here.
- What about you?
- I've got to stop the bomb.
- Rudy, please be careful.
Come on, professor. Let's go.
- Are you ready for this?
- Thank you.
Psst.
The bomb is set. It's irreversible.
The prophecy will be fulfilled, and I will vanquish my enemy.
You can't stop the prophecy.
You read the wrong book, pal.
Now it's time to say bon voyage.
Shalom!
Please, stay calm.
- Hey, Dad.
- Rudy!
My main man!
Hey, this is great.
A few more to sign, then we can go to lunch.
Take your time.
- Don't touch that!
- Oh!
I'm sorry. What is this?
It is a map which purports to show the location of the fabled seven cities of Cibola near Canc√πn on the Yucat√°n peninsula.
- Oh.
- These, ostensibly, hm, are the legendary cities of gold containing the Mayan treasure, which the Spanish conquistadors so desperately had sought.
And to answer your inevitable next question:
Yes, it is quite valuable. Ha, ha.
Rudy? Rudy?
Rudy!
So where to, young Cafmeyer?
- Canc√∫n, Mexico.
- Mm-hm.
- Will that be business or pleasure?
- Pleasure, always.
- Rudy!
- Oh.
Cut?
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon.
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Like that's ever going to happen.
What a loony.
Shrek
Beware
Stay out
I think he's in here.
All right. Lets get it!
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.
Well actually that would be a giant.
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.
They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes.
Actually, it's quite good on toast.
Back, back beast, back!
I warned you!
Right.
This is the part, where you run away.
Yeah!
And stay out.
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.
Right, this one is full. Take it away.
Give me that.
Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch.
Next. -Come on.
Sit down there! And be quiet!
This cage is so small.
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.
Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up!
Next.
What do we got?
This little wooden puppet.
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.
Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.
No! Please, don't let them do it!
Next. What do you got?
Well, I've got a talking donkey!
Right.
Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it.
Oh, go ahead fella.
Well?
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.
He's really quite a chatterbox.
You boneheaded donkey!
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!
No, no, he talks, he does!
I can talk. I love to talk.
I've talked to...
Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear!
Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly!
He can talk! -That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!
You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly.
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!
Seize him!
Get him! This way! Hurry!
You there. Ogre. -I.
By the order of lord Farquaad.
I am authorized to place you both under arrest.
And transport you to designated resettlement facility.
Oh really?
You and what army?
Can I say something to you?
Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible.
Are you talking to...
...me?
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards.
They thought that was all over there.
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
But I...
I don't have any friends.
And I'm not going out there by myself.
Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...
I'll stick with you.
You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.
Oh, a, that was really scary.
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something,
'cause your breath stinks!
Man you've? my note!
Just like the time...
...and then I ate some rotten berries.
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.
Why are you following me?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me.
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.
But you got to have free... -Stop singing!
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
Listen! Little donkey.
Take a look at me! What am I?
A...
...really tall?
No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.
Doesn't that bother you?
Nope.
Really? -Really really.
Oh?
Man, I like you. What's your name?
A..., Shrek.
Shrek?!
But do you know, what
I like about you, Shrek?
You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.
I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.
Uh, look at that.
Who would wanna live in a place like that?
That would be my home.
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy.
You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common.
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.
And then there's that big occurred silence, you know?
Can I stay with you? -What?
Can I stay with you, please.
Of course! -Really?
No. -Please! I don't want to go back there.
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.
Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together!
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!
OK, OK.
- But one night only.
- Huh, thank you!
A, what are you do... No!
This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.
And in the morning...
I'm making waffles.
Where do I sleep?
Outside!
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...
...so I guess, outside is best for me.
Here I go.
Good night.
I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside.
Sit by myself outside, I guess.
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.
- I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.
Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have?
It's not...
What a lovely bed. -Got you!
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.
- Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?
Enough! What are you doing in my house?
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!
Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken.
What?
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre!
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?
Oh, no! No, no!
What are you doing in my swamp?
All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go.
And hurry up, hurry up.
No, no, not there. Not there!
Hey don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.
Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What?
We were forced to come here. -By who?
Lord Farquaad. He?
All right.
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is.
Does anyone else know where to find him?
- Anyone at all?
- Me. -Anyone?
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.
Ok, fine.
Attention all fairy tale things!
Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up.
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from.
You. You're coming with me.
All right. That's what
I like to hear, man.
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it.
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again...
What did I say about singing?
- Can I whistle?
- No.
- Well, can I hummer?
- All right.
That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man.
You monster.
I'm not a monster here. You are.
You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
- Now tell me! Where are the others?
- Eat me.
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!
- Tell me! Or I'll...
- No, no, not the buttons.
Not gumdrop buttons.
All right! Who's hiding them?
Ok, I'll tell you.
- Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man?
- The muffin-man. -Yes,
I know the muffin-man.
Who lives on Proully lane?
- Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man!
- The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man.
My lord! We found it.
Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
Magic mirror.
Don't tell him anything!
Evening.
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
Well, technically, you're not a king.
A..., felonious.
- You were saying.
- What I mean is a...
...you're not a king, yet.
But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess.
Go on.
So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
And here they are.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away.
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.
Please welcome... Cinderella.
Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy.
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is.
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.
And last but certainly not least.
Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing?, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina
Coladas and getting cut in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.
So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two?
Or bachelorette number three?
- Two...
- Three! -Two!
One. No, no, no.
Three. Pick number three my lord.
Ok, ok. Number three.
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona.
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.
All I have to do is just find someone...
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...
- I'll do it!
- Yes, but after sunset...
Silence!
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!
Captain! Assemble your finest man.
We're going to have a tournament!
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.
I've told you I'll find it.
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.
Aha, that's the place.
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something.
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!
- Hey, you!
- No, no!
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
Where is everybody?
Hey look at this.
Wow!
- Let's do that again.
- No. no.
All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom.
Sorry about that.
That champion should have the honor, no, no...
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner up will take his place.
And so on, and so forth.
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
Applause.
Let the tournament begin.
What is that?
Ugh, it's hideous.
Oh, that's not very nice.
It's just a donkey.
Indeed.
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion.
How about him.
Oh, hey. Now, come on.
Can't we just settle this over a pint?
No?
All right then.
Come on.
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!
The chair! Give him the chair!
Thank you. Thank you, very much.
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!
Shall I give the order sir?
No. I have a better idea.
People of Duloc. I give you our champion!
What?
Congratulation, Ogre.
You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
Quest? I'm already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back!
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.
Indeed.
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.
Exactly the way it was?
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.
What kind of quest?
Ok, let me get this straight!
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place.
- Is that about right?
- You know what?
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.
I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know,?. Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick.
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate.
Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids.
Does that sound good to you?
A, no, not really, no.
For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think.
- Example.
- Example?
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.
- They stink?
- Yes, no.
- O, they make you cry.
- No.
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start? little wild hairs?
No! Layers! Onions have layers.
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.
You get it? We both have layers.
O, you both have layers.
You know not everybody likes onions.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers.
I don't care what everyone likes.
Ogres are not like cakes.
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.
Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.
Ogres are like onions. End of story.
Bye, bye. See you lather.
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
You know I think I've preferred your humming.
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying
Why, Shrek, did you do that?
Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off.
My mouth was opened and everything.
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.
Yeah, right, brimstone.
Don't be talking? brimstone. I know what I smell and? no brimstone.
And they don't come of stone neither.
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers.
We wear? sleeves.
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?
For emotional support.
We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time.
- Really?
- Really really.
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.
Just keep moving and don't look down.
Don't look down, don't look down.
Shrek! I'm looking down!
I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please.
- But you're already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.
Shrek, no, wait.
Don't do that!
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?
- Oh. This?
- Yes, that!
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.
- No, Shrek!
- I'm doing it.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do.
Cool.
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.
- Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.
Oh, good. Me neither.
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean.
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...
Donkey. Two things. Ok?
Shut, up.
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
What makes you think she'll be there?
I read it in a book once.
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.
Oh, I'll find those stairs.
I'll?. That's right.
Those stairs won't know which way they go.
The drafting stairs,?
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs.
I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it.
Well, at least we know where the princess is.
- But where is the...
- Dragon!
Donkey, look out!
Got you.
Oh, what large teeth you have.
I mean, white sparkling teeth.
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there.
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?
And you know what else?
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.
What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye?
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.
Shrek!
No, Shrek! Shrek!
- Wake up!
- What?
Are you princess Fiona?
I am.
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.
But wait, sir knight.
This be our first meeting.
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.
Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.
Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed.
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?
Uh-um.
But we have to sing through this moment.
You can residing of a poem to me.
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.
I don't think so.
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?
Shrek.
So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks.
- You didn't slay the dragon?
- It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!
But this isn't right.?
That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.
That's not the point.
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.
Well, I have to save my ass.
What kind of knight are you?
One of a kind.
...rush into a physical relationship.
I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude.
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Hey, what are you doing?
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time.
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.
As friends, maybe even as?
Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail.
And you're going to tear it off...
Oh, no. No!
- It talks?!
- Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.
I'll take care of the dragon.
Ruuuuun!
You did it. You rescued me.
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a...
...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.
She thinks I'm a steed.
The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight.
- Aah, no.
- Why not?
I have helmet hair.
Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.
But, how will you kiss me?
What? That wasn't in a job description.
- Maybe it's a perk?
- No. It's destiny.
You must know how it goes.
A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.
And then they share true love's first kiss.
With Shrek? You think, wait...
...you think Shrek is your true love?
Well, yes.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny?
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.
Now, now remove your helmet.
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.
- Take it off!
- No!
- Now!
- Ok, easy.
As you command your highness.
You're an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Well, yes, actually.
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?
He's the one, who wants to marry you.
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?
Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there.
But I have to be rescued by my true love.
Not by some Ogre and his pet.
Well so much for noble steed.
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,
I'll be waiting for him right here.
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?
- I'm a delivery boy.
- You wouldn't dare.
- You coming donkey?
- Put me down!
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.
This is not dignified. Put me down.
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt?
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this?
Just tell her, she's not your true love.
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful.
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like?
Well, let me put it this way, princess.
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.
You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow
Tomorrow?
It will take that long?
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No. That would take longer.
We can keep going.
But there are robbers in the woods.
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good.
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest.
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!
Hey, over here.
Shrek, we can do better than that. Now,
I don't think this is decent for princess.
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
Homey touches? Like what?
A door.
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will...
I said good night!
Shrek! What are you doing?
I just..., you know...
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.
And that one, that's Throwback.
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
Right. Yeah.
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories. Look.
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"
You can guess what he is famous for.
All right. Now I know you're making this up.
No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag.
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.
You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear.
Forget it.
Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?
- Our swamp?
- You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.
There's just me and my swamp.
And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land.
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
No, do you think?
- Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?
- Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?
Everyone, ok?
- Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway?
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.
People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run!
A big stupid ugly Ogre.
They judge me, before they even know me.
That's why I'm better off alone.
You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Yeah, I know.
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there?
That's the moon.
Again. Show me again.
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.
Perfect.
Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby...
- Donkey. Wake up.
- What? -Wake up.
Morning. How do you like your eggs?
- Good morning princess.
- What's all this about?
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
Thanks.
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.
- Shrek!
- What? It's a compliment.
Better out than in I always say.
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.
Princess!
What are you doing?
?mon shery, for I am your saviour. And
I am rescuing you from this green... beast.
Hey! That's my princess.
Go find your own.
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.
Oh, of course. How rude that was.
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!
Man, that was annoying.
Oh, you little...
Shall we?
?all the forin?
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?
- What?
- That. Back there. That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a...
There is an arrow in your butt.
What? Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!
- Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
- Donkey, I'm ok.
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head?.
- Does anyone know how to handle...
- Donkey! Calm down.
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.
Now, you hold still and
I'll yank this thing out.
- Hey! Easy with the yanking.
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite...
- Don't move. -Ok, look.
Time out. -Would you... Ok.
What do you propose we do?
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!
Not good.
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.
Nothing happened.
We were just a...
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.
The princess here was just... Au!
Hey, what's that? Is that...
There it is, princess.
- Your future awaits you.
- That's Duloc?
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a
I guess we better move on.
Sure, but Shrek...
- I'm worried about Donkey.
- What?
I mean. Look at him.
He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.
- Well, that's what they always say.
And the next thing you know you're on your back.
- Dead!
- You know she's right. You look awful.
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.
Well, I won't say nothing, but
I've got this twinge in my neck. And if
I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?
- He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!
I think I need a hug.
This is good. This is really good.
- What is this?
- Wheat rat.
- Rotisserie style.
- No kidding.
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean wheat rat stew.
I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night.
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it.
I'd like that.
- Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?
I'm a... I was wondering.
Are you... a...
Are you gonna eat that?
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.
- What?
- Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside.
But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too.
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.
Oh, what are you talking about.
Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look,
I'm an animal and I got instincts.
And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it.
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones.
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.
I'm not saying that
I do, 'cause I don't.
She's a princess and I'm...
...an Ogre.
Yeah, an Ogre.
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.
Princess. Princess Fiona?
Princess, where are you?
Princess?
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.
- No, no.
- Help! Shrek! Shrek!
- No. -Shrek!
- It's ok. It's ok.
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.
- It's me, in this body.
- Oh my god. You ate the princess.
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
This is me.
Princess? What happened to you?
You're a... different.
- I'm ugly, ok?
- Yeah.
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.
- You are what you eat, I say.
- No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.
What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before.
It only happens when the sun goes down.
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss.
Then, take love's true form...
- Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
- It's the spell.
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24/7.
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.
Shrek?
Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. A...
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.
It's the only way to break the spell.
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.
No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know.
What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets.
Promise you won't tell. Promise!
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.
You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.
Look at my eye twitching.
I tell him, I tell him not.
I tell him. I tell him not.
I tell him!
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want...
Shrek. Are you all right?
Perfect. Never been better.
I... There's something
I have to tell you.
You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.
- You've heard what I said?
- Every word.
I thought you'd understand?
Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!
- I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.
Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something.
What I missed? What I missed?
- Princess Fiona.
- As promised. Now hand it over.
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.
Before I change my mind.
Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me.
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.
- I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.
Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.
- It's not like it has feelings.
- No. You're right. It doesn't.
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,
I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...
No! I mean I... Why wait?
Let's get married today. Before sunset.
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do.
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests.
Farewell Ogre.
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.
- Yeah, so what.
- Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.
- I talked to her last night. She's...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home?
- Shrek. I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!
Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
- But. I thought...
- Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.
Shrek.
Donkey?
What are you doing?
I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it.
It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half.
Oh, your half?
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head
- Back off!
- No. You back off!
- This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go!
- Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.
Fine!
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.
- Well, I'm through with you!
- Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!
So you just shut up and pay attention!
You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do!
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings.
- Go away.
- See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona.
And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you.
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.
- I heard that you two were talking.
- She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...
...somebody else.
She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about?
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?
- Donkey.
- No!
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Can you forgive me?
- Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
- Right.
- Friends?
- Friends.
So? What did Fiona said about me?
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!
Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way.
And I have I way.
Donkey?
- I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.
All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.
People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king...
Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?
Go on.
Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?
Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?
- It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.
The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace".
And that's where you say: "I object".
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!
Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.
- You want to hold her!
- Yes. -Please her! -Yes!
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.
- The chicks love that romantic crap.
- All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?
We got to check it out.
And as so by the power of these two...
What do you see?
- I now pronounce you...
- There they go!
- ... he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I object!
Shrek?
Oh, now what does he want?
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.
- What are you doing here?
- Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona! I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?
Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me.
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?
Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
- Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.
- What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I'm in...
Oh, this is precious.
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.
Laugh.
Shrek. Is this true?
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!
By night one way, by day another.
I wanted to show you before.
Well. That explains a lot.
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight.
- Now! Get them! Get them, both!
- No!
This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See?
- Shrek!
- No.
- Don't just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.
No! Shrek!
- And as for you my wife.
- Fiona!
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!
I will have order. I will have potential. I will have...
All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.
I'm a donkey on the edge!
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?
Go ahead Shrek.
- Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?
I love you.
Really?
Really, really.
I love you too.
A time for true love's first kiss...
Fiona?
Fiona? Are you all right?
Yes. But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.
But you are beautiful.
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
God bless us, everyone.
The End.
{2502}{2580}The story I want to tell you,|can not be found in a book.
{2593}{2682}They say the history of the West was|written from the saddle of a horse.
{2701}{2753}But it's never been told|from the heart of one.
{2781}{2813}Not until now.
{2861}{2900}I was born here.
{2905}{2975}In this place that would come|to be called the ''Old West''
{2990}{3101}But to my kind, the land was ageless.|It had no beginning and no end.
{3117}{3180}No boundary between earth and sky.
{3213}{3301}Like the wind in the Buffalo grass.|We belong here.
{3326}{3362}We will always belong here.
{3445}{3502}They say the mustang is the|spirit of the West.
{3517}{3573}Whether that West|was won or lost in the end
{3582}{3619}You have to decide for yourself.
{3630}{3707}But the story|I want to tell you is true.
{3728}{3757}I was there.
{3776}{3812}And I remember.
{3832}{3910}I remember the sun, and the sky|and the wind calling my name.
{3925}{3982}In the time when the wild|horses ran free.
{10805}{10868}And so I grew from colt to stallion
{10870}{10900}As wild and reckless
{10901}{10941}As thunder over the land.
{10948}{10985}Racing with the eagle.
{10987}{11021}Soaring with the wind.
{11022}{11104}Flying? |There were times I believed I could.
{11869}{11898}Like my father before me
{11900}{11994}I became leader of the Cimarron herd.|And with that honour
{11996}{12037}Came responsibility.
{17370}{17425}Something new came upon|the land one night.
{17441}{17496}Something that changed my life |forever...
{17518}{17587}And so my journey began.
{18973}{19024}A wiser horse might have turned|and ran.
{19053}{19109}But I wanted to know what|strange creature was here.
{20008}{20032}Look.
{20087}{20157}Man, look at that stallion, |it is beautiful.
{21014}{21046}Follow the horse! Let's go!
{23917}{23944}Look out!
{24511}{24544}Don't you get away!
{26023}{26056}I was scared.
{26057}{26103}I didn't know what was going|to happen to me.
{26127}{26148}At least my mother|and the herd were safe.
{29740}{29784}What seems to be the|problem, gentlemen?
{29789}{29825}We got this crazy one here, Sir.
{29857}{29876}Really?
{29991}{30043}The army has dealt with|wild horses before.
{30061}{30099}This one will be no different.
{30209}{30233}I remember the first time
{30235}{30293}I saw a rattler curled up in my path
{30340}{30389}-Induct this animal, Sargent.|-Yes Sir!
{30385}{30445}This one didn't look like a rattler.
{30437}{30500}But I was still thinking...|snake.
{30529}{30570}Grab him, grab him.
{30671}{30716}Okay Murphy, he's all yours.
{30743}{30773}He's a wild one.
{30809}{30866}We'll see how wild he is,|when I am done with him.
{31057}{31093}You want a fight, do you?
{31364}{31386}Right.
{31982}{32013}Make sure that's good tight.
{32182}{32219}Murphy, look out! Watch out!
{33115}{33167}Murphy, are you okay?
{33237}{33352}Corporal, round up some volunteers to|take this animal to the stables.
{33360}{33455}Not the stables. -Sir? |-The corral.
{33473}{33501}It's time to break that horse.
{36435}{36518}Sergent. -Yes Sir.|Tight this horse to the post.
{36536}{36601}No food or water. Three days.
{36605}{36623}Yes Sir.
{37973}{38037}My heart galloped through|the sky that night
{38059}{38100}Back to my herd.
{38108}{38138}Where I belonged.
{38173}{38212}And I wonder if they'd miss me
{38228}{38274}As much as I miss them.
{39570}{39594}We got a hostile!
{39744}{39795}Bring him there this way.
{39934}{39962}Well, what do we have here?
{40005}{40048}We caught him|by the supply wagon, Sir.
{40106}{40143}Ah, a Dakota.
{40165}{40242}Not as tall as the Cheyenne,|and fine featured as the Crow.
{40265}{40316}Take him away gentlemen,|show him our best.
{40325}{40369}Corporal, take him to the stock case.
{40371}{40438}Not the stock case. The post.
{40461}{40482}No food or water.
{40706}{40742}What are you looking at boy?
{40793}{40837}He was called Little Creak.
{40843}{40884}And he seemed different from the rest.
{42212}{42291}There were just no end to the |strange ways of the two legged.
{42758}{42854}With the Colonel permission, Sir. |Incoming patrol report hostiles |headed North.
{42864}{42910}The railroad has expressed concern, Sir.
{42917}{42964}They requested additional patrols.
{42986}{43009}How long has it been, Sergent?
{43010}{43070}Sir?|-The mustang.
{43081}{43117}How long has it been tide?
{43127}{43156}Three days, Sir.
{43173}{43191}Good.
{43200}{43240}Fetch my crop and spurs.
{43717}{43743}Take it easy!
{43813}{43839}Back up! Back up!
{45216}{45293}You see gentlemen,|any horse can be broken.
{45381}{45407}Move along mustang.
{45500}{45581}There are those in Washington who believe|the West will never be settled.
{45627}{45700}The northern pacific railroad |will never breach Nebraska.
{45796}{45902}A hostile Dakota will never |submit to providence.
{45980}{46036}And it is that manner of small thinking.
{46048}{46105}That would say this horse |could never be broken.
{46136}{46215}Discipline, time, and patience.
{46248}{46294}Are the three great levelers.
{46421}{46489}Sometimes a horse's gotta do,|what a horse's gotta do
{46514}{46562}And this was one of those times.
{47465}{47492}Get off me!
{48104}{48173}Soldier! Secure that horse!
{49774}{49826}I wasn't sure|what happened back there.
{49829}{49884}And I wasn't about to stop and ask.
{49892}{49955}All I knew was I was headed home.
{50561}{50584}I couldn't believe it.
{50594}{50692}One moment I was free,|and the next... more ropes.
{54379}{54413}I couldn't understand it.
{54424}{54471}She treated the scrawny two-legged
{54473}{54504}Like one of our kind.
{54509}{54533}Prancing around him
{54535}{54576}Like a love struck ear ring.
{54605}{54649}It was down right unnatural.
{54834}{54934}Great mustang, today I will ride you.
{54996}{55037}This ought to be good...
{55637}{55669}Mares.
{55819}{55873}Okay, Rain, lets see if you can teach
{55875}{55912}This mustang some manners.
{57734}{57761}Okay, I admit it
{57766}{57795}She was charming
{57809}{57866}In a stubborn, irritating kind of way.
{57880}{57930}So, I let her show me her world.
{59917}{59957}Bye-Bye horsey.
{62830}{62870}For the first time in my life,
{62884}{62944}I felt my heart torn two ways.
{63171}{63204}Give it back!
{63220}{63237}Mustang!
{64507}{64551}I had to hand to that boy.
{64563}{64604}He just wouldn't give up.
{65802}{65846}I'm never gonna ride you, am I?
{65895}{65924}And no one never should.
{66567}{66597}You can go.
{66736}{66759}It's okay, go.
{66934}{66971}Go on, get out of here.
{67013}{67043}Go home.
{68613}{68680}I knew this was hard for her,|and she was scared.
{68705}{68809}But more than anything,|I wanted to share my homeland with her
{74439}{74484}I laid beside her that night.
{74497}{74607}Hoping, praying that somehow|she would be okay.
{74716}{74754}There are a couple|of horses over there!
{75379}{75401}Leave her there.
{75403}{75443}She's not gonna make it.
{76223}{76238}Oh, Rain!
{76319}{76348}Easy, girl. 
{76359}{76400}Easy.
{76459}{76489}It will be okay. 
{76825}{76862}You saved my life.
{77551}{77582}I'm not gonna hurt you.
{77590}{77644}Come on, it's gonna be okay.
{82534}{82574}It'll be alright.
{83224}{83268}I didn't know|why we were brought here.
{83283}{83315}What I did know
{83320}{83419}was we had to find a way to escape,|and get back home.
{83569}{83668}Well, that is it, we're rolling |the steam over the mountain.
{83682}{83733}We got six days to connect to Utah.
{83761}{83797}Move out and gone.
{84563}{84599}Ready to go!
{85751}{85833}We're almost on the top!
{86308}{86364}That was the moment I understood
{86372}{86415}They were headed to my homeland
{86416}{86453}And I had to stop them.
{86545}{86594}Get back!
{86645}{86702}Oh, we got to stop!
{86846}{86869}Hold it!
{87056}{87095}Get the mules up here!
{93161}{93191}I don't know where he came from
{93192}{93221}Or how he got there.
{93240}{93282}But I sure was happy to see him.
{94877}{94898}I don't believe it.
{94943}{94971}Go! Go! Run!
{98020}{98040}Look out!
{98141}{98160}Where are they?
{98162}{98185}There they are!
{98786}{98810}Oh no.
{98894}{98927}Oh yes.
{104393}{104444}You will always be in my heart.
{104812}{104893}Take care of her,|Spirit...
{104916}{104954}Who cannot be broken.
{105432}{105477}I will miss you, my friend.
{105911}{105962}I've been waiting|so long to run free.
{105988}{106059}But that goodbye was harder|than I ever imagined.
{106096}{106139}I will never forget that boy.
{106167}{106224}And how we won back|our freedom together.
{109468}{109502}-The end- Fixed by PROMAC.
l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Part of your average family. l've got a dad and a mom.
And a sister.
There's Donnie. We found him.
And Darwin...he found us.
We travel all over the world.
See, my dad hosts this nature show, and my mom shoots it.
And along the way, something amazing happened. l freed a warthog who was really a shaman.
Shaman Mnyambo.
He granted me the power to talk to animals. lt's really cool...but totally secret.
And that was just the beginning of my biggest adventure ever.
And now, Phaedra the Magnificent will walk the Circle of Destiny!
Circle of Destiny, indeed!
Phew! Eliza, your friend stinks.
And those tusks could poke an eye out.
Darwin, chill.
- Phaedra, take us around that tree.
- Sure.
Here's how our moms make us go.
They nudge the back of our necks with their trunks.
- Really? Like this?
- That's it!
And if she wanted us to turn around, she'd nudge one side.
Oh, cool!
Rub behind the ear and the elephant turns. Fascinating!
Eliza, can we go now?
My butt's gone to sleep.
OK, Darwin.
- Bye, Eliza.
- Bye, Phaedra.
Bye...chimp! l think l hear your grandmumsy opening a fresh tin of pudding.
- Darwin, listen.
- To what? l don't hear a thing.
That's what l mean. lt's too quiet. lt's a shame you couldn't spend more time with us, Mumsy.
Two weeks is more than enough.
Your father gets a bit daft when left on his own too long.
He's probably searched the entire estate for his reading glasses.
Good thing l take after you, eh, Mumsy?
Marianne, have you had any luck locating my binoculars?
Try around your neck!
Bad news!
Jungle Boy used the teapot to store his grub-worms.
Dad! Mom! Stampede!
Battle stations, everybody!
Mumsy! Stand absolutely still!
They're not carnivores.
The gazelle is quite harmless.
Unless you happen to be a tuft of grass! lt's Akela!
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- No.
Thank goodness!
Cordelia, l hate to leave you, but we need to get some footage before dark.
Yes, Mumsy.
Will you be all right here?
Don't worry. The girls and l will have a nice quiet evening together.
See you later, then! Bye bye!
Just when we get something cool to drive, l have to be grounded!
Certainly you're grounded.
You tied Donnie to a termite mound.
Hey, he was happy.
- Eliza, where are you going?
- Just going for a walk!
Have we forgotten about that cheetah? lt's OK, Grandmumsy, l do it all the time.
Deborah, does your sister...?
Talk like a monkey, dress like a geek? Yeah!
Come on,
Akela's cubs must be nearby.
Cheetah cubs? To them, l'm a walking snack pack!
- Hey, guys!
- lt's Eliza!
Oh, you've grown so big.
Hey, where's Tally?
Here l am! You should see me run. l'm really fast now.
Fast? As in ''able to outrun defenceless chimps''?
You guys remember Darwin. l've got an idea.
- Let's have a race.
- Yeah! Me first.
Children! lt's time for dinner.
- Not me, l'm skin and bones.
- Mom, Eliza wants us to race.
No, the plains are too dangerous for little ones like you.
But l'll be with them. l'd never let anything happen.
You can trust me.
Please, Mom!
All right, Eliza.
But keep an eye on them.
And don't go beyond the acacia tree.
Hey, slowpokes, l'm winning!
Who are you calling slowpoke?
Eliza, you've passed the acacia tree!
Just barely!
Don't worry, we'll be fine.
Poachers!
Run!
Eliza!
No!
Eliza!
Give him back!
He's just a baby!
Deborah, bring the Commvee straight away! l wish l could, but l'm grounded!
Debbie, now!
Deborah, slow down immediately!
Sorry, Grandmumsy. Dad's orders.
Donnie, this is no time for the wedgie dance!
Will somebody do something?
Somebody?
We'll discuss your impertinence later, young lady!
Follow that helicopter! l couldn't have had a sister who plays with dolls.
Hello, Mumsy. Having a jolly holiday?
Nigel, we must discuss your children's manners.
We're equally as proud, but now's not the time.
My baby!
My baby.
We can't just sit here.
We have to find those poachers.
You were almost killed.
Let Jomo take care of them.
- But, Mom, l have to save Tally.
- Who?
That's what l call the cheetah cub.
She names man-eating wild animals?
Names 'em, plays with 'em, talks in monkey to 'em!
Debbie, enough!
- Could you identify this man, Eliza?
- No. He shined a light in my eyes.
But the handle of his knife was carved in the shape of a falcon.
That'll help, won't it?
There are many knives, many poachers.
- But l have to find Tally.
- Eliza, you must leave this to us.
Promise me, you will never go off alone at night. l promise.
Good girl.
Nigel, l will call if l hear anything.
- Good night, all.
- Thank you, Jomo.
Eliza! Don't go out in the savannah at night.
Yeah, right! She and the monkey are always sneaking off!
- What?
- Debbie! l've covered long enough.
She once fed one of my protein bars to a Komodo dragon!
And in wherever-land, she rode a Siberian tiger!
And ask about the time she was dancing with crazy dingoes!
- What?
- That's not the half of it!
- Eliza!
- Thanks, Deb!
Nigel...l don't know what to do.
Well, l do! Elizabeth has no regard for her own safety.
We have discussed this for years.
She needs a structured environment.
One such as a boarding school back in London!
Hold on! She messes up and gets to go to boarding school?
Mumsy, that's rather drastic.
Need l remind you, that it was in the confines of boarding school that you received your education, not here in the wild?
You don't think it's civilised for a girl to play with cheetahs and chimps?
Hello! What about me?
Do l look civilised?
Frankly, no.
But l'm afraid it's much too late for you.
Mom, Dad, l can't leave!
Tally never would've been out on the plains if it wasn't for me.
- lt's all my fault.
- How?
- l have to go back out there!
- No!
We make these rules for a reason. lf l have to send you away to be safe, l will.
Dad? Please!
Poppet, your intentions are noble, but you're just too young. l'm sorry.
We agreed, when we took this job, we wouldn't split up the family.
We'd keep the children with us on the road. l remember, dearest.
Oh, Nigel.
Are we doing the right thing?
You heard Eliza. She blames herself for this unfortunate incident.
She'll never stop until she finds that cub.
She's quite fearless, you know.
She takes after her father.
That poor girl.
Boarding school? l never heard of anything so ridiculous!
Did anyone bother to ask my opinion? l wish l could tell them l talk to animals.
No! Then you'll lose your power, and we'll never talk again!
- How will l know what Debbie's saying?
- Calm down, l won't break the rule.
Good.
Now, about this boarding school, l can't take gym class, because those tight shorts show off my problem area.
Dar...you can't come with me.
Darwin, come back!
- Whatever is the matter with Darwin?
- He saw me pack my suitcase.
- l guess he figured out l'm leaving.
- Very intuitive, that chimp. l'm sorry about all this, Dad. l'm not sure l wouldn't have done the same thing. ln fact, l went up against poachers myself once, to save an elephant, remember? l remember.
Come, let me show you where we're headed next. The Congo.
- To look for forest elephants?
- Yes. lf we can find any.
There's an old, old Baaka legend, that tells of a solar eclipse, when thousands of elephants made their way to Tembo Valley. l wonder why.
Nobody knows. But there's an eclipse in a few weeks in this exact spot.
And l intend to witness it first hand. l wish l could see it with you, Dad.
Eliza, l received this medal when l was in boarding school.
Perhaps you'd like to take it, for luck.
''Awarded for bravery.''
Oh...it was nothing, really.
A blazing building, twenty students trapped, a makeshift rope ladder...
Well, never mind.
The point is you will have your own challenges, Poppet, and l predict, you will meet them splendidly. l looked everywhere for Darwin. l didn't get to say goodbye. l'm sorry, honey.
You'll see him again soon. l love you. l'll miss you, Mom.
You won't leave without him, Dad?
Of course not, Poppet.
Here's what you can get me in London: CDs, boots, T-shirts.
Basically, anything cool.
Don't forget: ''cool''.
Elizabeth! lt's time for take-off!
Kiss your natural wilderness girlhood goodbye!
Bye, Dad.
Look at that. ls that a new girl?
Darwin!
You didn't think l'd let you get civilised without me, did you?
- You can't be here!
- lt's a miracle l survived the hold!
Your bags are not handled with care.
They don't allow chimps in school.
They'll change their mind when they meet me!
Let's look at my new home.
Small yet charming.
Not much natural light, but we've had enough of nature.
Dibs on this bed!
Feel those springs, firm yet flexible.
Could you lend me your cashmere sweater for the dance?
- Someone's coming.
- Room service? l like school already!
Darwin, you can't be here!
But why?
- l'm a fast learner and...
- l can see your feet!
Let me in!
Are you still quibbling about that 2% difference in our DNA?
Just be quiet until l figure out what to do. l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Guess we're room-mates.
So it appears. l'm Sarah Wellington.
Have you been romping on my bed?
Just trying out the springs.
Firm yet flexible.
Perhaps we should negotiate a few issues.
You stay on your side and l stay on mine.
My things shall be off-limits as they are antique and expensive.
This perfume is French.
And don't even dream about wearing my clothes.
No matter how tempting the urge. l see that you've already rooted through my wardrobe.
Sarah!
Want one of my mom's home-made cookies? l might have a use for you yet. lt's so great to talk to you guys.
You have no idea how awful it's been.
Go on, Eliza, tell Reggie your troubles. l don't suppose you have any of those cheesy snacks?
Cheese Munchies? Right here.
Brilliant!
Now, what's the problem? l miss my friends in Africa.
You should see it there, Reggie. l've even met some squirrels who fly.
Fly? Like a bird?
Don't like the sound of that! l heard her family lives in the jungle in a motor home!
And she bathes where animals drink!
Next she'll be bringing animals into my room!
- Eliza, can you hear me? lt's Mom!
- And your dear old Dad!
- What did you say, honey?
- Has Jomo found Tally?
Sorry, Poppet, no. ln fact, the poachers disappeared without a trace.
- Tell her about Darwin.
- l was leading up to that.
Poodles, l'm afraid we've lost track of Darwin.
He'll be all right. He's probably foraging for bugs right now!
The shepherd's pie is heavenly.
But why do they put these green things in it?
They look like bunny poop!
- Honey, is someone there?
- Just my room-mate, Sarah.
Mom, please don't forget about Tally.
We won't.
We told Jomo where we're headed.
Try to have fun with your new friends.
She's making friends?
Give me that!
Hi. Here's what's going on with my life.
Donnie's now half-goat, my hair is half-terrier, and we're heading into the abyss where there's no teen interaction! Bye!
Oh, Debbie!
Debbie? Mom? Dad?
Donnie?
We're all a bit curious.
Have you ever seen a tiger up close?
- Close enough to pet.
- Oh, really?
Tigers, bears, Komodo dragons...
Once, we were in the Arctic and l hung out with this polar bear.
Seems my room-mate is making friends.
My friends!
- They're really gentle...
- Sarah, Eliza swam with whales.
- lsn't that lovely?
- Tell us more, Eliza.
Darwin! l know! Don't l look fetching?
Where was l? Swimming with dingoes...l mean dolphins...
Enough about me.
Anybody try the boiled cabbage? l'm going back for seconds.
Anyone else?
- Who's that girl?
- Never seen her before.
- ls she Eliza's friend?
- That's my monogram!
Who are you and why are you wearing my new blazer?
There's an ape in my uniform!
Give it back! Give it back!
- Did it escape from the zoo?
- Darwin, no!
Food fight, everyone!
Come back!
Girls! Girls! Food is for eating!
Food is for...
This is the best meal we've ever had!
Miss Thornberry, your grandmother will hear of this in the morning.
And when we revive her, l'm sure she'll be gravely disappointed.
Now, say goodbye to your pet...
...and come along!
Eliza, don't leave me in this place, l'll never last the night!
No offence. l'm sure you're very nice.
''Thunder'', is it?
- How horsy!
- l'll come see you in the morning, Dar.
Trot along, lassie.
Your friend will be fine with me.
Thanks, Thunder.
Miss Thornberry? Come along! l need a hot bath and a good meal.
You're in luck. They'll be bringing the hay round any minute.
- l'm to eat hay?
- Aye, and sweet crunchy oats, too.
Oh, that changes everything. l'm beginning to see why they call you Thunder.
- Never mind. Where's the bathroom?
- You're standing on it!
Did Mrs Fairgood make him go to the zoo?
- Where did he sleep?
- How did you smuggle him?
Darwin decided... l mean, it was easy.
Hiding him from Sarah, that's a different story.
Miss Sarah Wellington thinks she's the bee's knees!
Why would you ever come here, where it's so boring? l got into trouble. l snuck out...
There were poachers hunting...
- Poachers?
- With guns?
Go on, Eliza.
There were three cheetah cubs l knew. Like kittens, only wild.
We were running when we heard shots.
A man dropped from a helicopter on a ladder and...
...grabbed the one l named Tally. l tried to save him, but they cut the ladder and...l fell.
Tally was gone.
Poor Tally. l think he's alive. l just feel it.
This is terrible!
Can't we write letters or something?
- Let's have a bake sale!
- Let us help!
Thanks, but...
What's going on in my room?
Sarah, Eliza was just telling us the most awful story about...Tally.
Never mind. l've been filling out a report and am quite tired.
- You'll all have to go.
- Goodnight, Eliza.
Goodnight, Sarah.
'Night, you guys! l still can't believe you harboured a wild animal in my room...
There are peas in my bed!
Tally? Tally!
Tally! l knew you were alive.
Eliza, help me!
Tally?
Tally! l gave you this gift for a reason, Eliza.
Shaman Mnyambo?
You must not waste time.
You must go to your destiny. Go!
What do you mean?
Where am l supposed to go?
Shaman?
Tally is alive. Go save him, Eliza.
Go! Go!
Shaman Mnyambo's right. l have to go.
What are you doing? l have to leave.
- l'm calling Mrs Fairgood.
- No! You have to keep this a secret.
Do you have a credit card for tickets to Africa?
- l won't do this.
- My parents will pay you back.
- No one will know until it's all over.
- What's over?
You're acting so odd. l'm reporting you at once.
Sarah, please, it's a matter of life and death. l have to go now and l really need your help. Please!
Just think, you'll get the room all to yourself again.
Would you prefer aisle or window?
Darwin, wake up!
What? l've tried to keep track of the days, but they've blurred into months!
Dar, it's only been four hours. lt's certainly better than riding in the hold, but l don't understand...
Shh! l'll tell you after the plane takes off.
Fine!
Shh! Stop fidgeting! l can't help it, l've got hay in my skirt.
She has that hairy disease.
We're going to see a special doctor in Nairobi. l'll find you, Tally. l promise.
We'll be gone until after the eclipse.
Will you be all right with Donnie?
This will be the highlight of my young life!
That's the spirit, Poodles!
Dad, have you completely lost your ability to recognise sarcasm? l'm not sure l ever had it.
Stay close to camp. lf you're lucky, you might see a hyena roving about!
Excuse me, while l go find a container for my joy.
Very well, we'll wait right here.
Oh...that's sarcasm, isn't it?
You do that rather frequently, don't you?
Debbie, just how long is this sulking going to go on?
Another 35-40 minutes.
Then l'll start up again tomorrow.
Get some rest. l know it must be draining.
We'll call you on the short wave.
Be careful. And have a good time!
No problem. l'll take the Congo-Com for a spin.
Absolutely not!
But do have fun!
That is so wrong.
Help! The poachers... l've been shot!
- Darwin, get up.
- What?
Excuse me...
A rhino's been shot.
You have to let me off this train!
Hang on, we'll get help.
You'll be OK.
They shot me...at the river.
They were trying to take my horn, when l ran away.
Help! Help!
Please help me!
This rhino's been shot!
- Hold this, right here.
- ls he still alive?
Barely. But l think l can save him.
You're a very brave young lady.
We saw you jump from that train. l had to save this rhino...
That's the knife from the man who took Tally.
- Keep applying pressure.
- Sorry, l just...
- Thank goodness, the authorities.
- What happened here?
Poachers shot him at the river.
Find them.
They took a cheetah cub. l recognised their knife.
Call Jomo Mbelie!
- You know Jomo?
- Yes, he's friends with my father.
Tell him Eliza found the knife.
We were just at the river, there were no poachers. l'm Sloan Blackburn. We're studying the endangered wildlife.
We have to get this poor guy to our camp.
My wife, Bree.
She's a wildlife veterinarian.
We'll take him to the rhino sanctuary.
Eliza, they'll take care of him, don't worry.
Can we give you a lift? You shouldn't be alone with poachers around.
No, thanks. Our camp's not too far.
We have to get back to our work, but l hope we see you again.
Me, too.
Thanks for your help. Bye!
Come on.
We have to find those poachers.
We have to find your parents.
You saw what those poachers did.
- But if they're nearby, Tally is, too.
- No! lf those awful people see you again, they'll hurt you.
And l'm not going to let that happen.
You're right, Darwin.
We can't do this alone.
Hurry, we'll find my parents' camp. lt's not far, is it?
We'll get there...by morning. l wish we'd never left school.
Thunder said there'd be days like this.
This dude Jack plants these magic beans, 'cause he's hungry.
Then, a mondo beanstalk grows way up into the clouds.
Bushbabies! How annoying!
Jack, who's totally buff, climbs up the beanstalk and finds a golden goose, a golden harp and a big, scary...
...giant?
Donnie?
Donnie!
Donnie! Donnie!
Radcliffe! You never told me how to land!
- Grandmumsy?
- lt's all in the knees, Cordy!
- Colonel?
- You're looking well, Deborah!
Do we have a kiss for Grandpapa? l knew l shouldn't have brought the good china!
Debbie, dreadful news.
Your sister has run away from school.
Under cover of night...with Darwin!
Excuse me, did you say the monkey got to go to London?
Debbie, are you there? Over.
- Guess who's here?
- Don't alarm your parents.
She means there's no need for Marianne to blame her a minute earlier than necessary!
Sorry.
Eliza was seen boarding a train for the Congo. We'll take her back.
Debbie! Who's there?
Some cute bushbabies!
Did l just hear you call a wild animal ''cute''?
That's called sarcasm, dearest.
Sure, you can ride with us.
My owner will never know.
How did l end up here... amongst chickens?
Donnie, this may look like a shark cage, but it's a playpen. lt's where nice little boys play, when their sisters want peace and quiet.
Hey, Donnie! lf it isn't the boarding school dropout and her sidekick, Chimp-o!
- l need to talk to Mom and Dad.
- They're not here.
Talk to me and pretend l'm listening.
- Where are they?
- ln the jungle, filming.
- But the eclipse isn't until tomorrow.
- Whatever.
Fine. l'll call them on the radio.
Don't go in there.
- What are they doing here?
- Taking you back to England. l'm not going back. l came back to find Tally.
- l just need Dad's help.
- What's wrong with you?
You finally get a chance to escape our jail, instead you come back like some freaky homing pigeon, and wreck my chance of ever getting out of this place. l am not going to slow dance at my prom with some baboon!
Debbie, leave me alone!
You're not going to stop me!
Yes, l am!
Debbie, no!
Hey! Let me out of here!
Sorry, Deb.
Take it up with the warden.
Donnie! Bring me the key like a nice little animal boy!
Donnie!
Cordy! lt's the blitz!
You're dreaming, Raddie.
England is safe.
When l get my hands on that ungrateful, trouble-making, know-it-all sister...
Wow! lf l weren't so mad, this would totally rock!
Oh, man! Hello?
Both of my daughters are missing?
The good news is the chimpanzee turned up in England.
But never mind that now.
Debbie left a note:
''Don't freak.''
That's Deborah talking, not l.
''Took the Congo-Com to find Donnie who followed Eliza.
''She's going to some valley.
Later, Debbie.''
My children are in the jungle alone?
We'll find them, lovely.
Dad, are you there?
- Right here, my boy.
- You'll have to pick us up downriver. l'll give you our coordinates.
Can you triangulate a position?
They didn't call me Colonel for my chicken recipe!
Fire away! l'm driving around this sweaty jungle, looking for my sister, when l could be watching part two of Before They Were Teens.
Who smells? lt's completely overpowering my vanilla-ginger body splash.
Donnie!
Donnie?
Donnie!
Does this...human... belong to anyone?
Thanks. Hope he wasn't any trouble.
Not really.
But tell him when a gorilla is sleeping, he doesn't want a dung-beetle shoved up his nose!
We're hoping it's just a phase. l'm looking for my parents, two people on the way to Tembo Valley?
Two people?
Riding in those loud whirlybirds?
- Do you mean helicopters?
- lt might be the poachers!
Did you see them with a cheetah cub? l saw the whirlybirds land on the ground, and then people putting a fence across the valley.
A fence? What for?
Something's up. What's the quickest way to the valley?
Follow the river. Be careful.
Dar, get Donnie.
Donnie, this is no time for your games!
Don't force it, chimp. lt'll come out in its own good time.
As many as a thousand elephants will converge during the eclipse.
My desire to witness a natural marvel might have influenced Eliza.
She must've decided not to miss it.
She wouldn't come all the way from London just for that.
There's something else going on.
- l'm just afraid she'll get hurt.
- She'll be fine. They all will.
How do you know?
And don't say,
''Because they're Thornberrys.''
Because they've been raised by you.
And quite wonderfully, l might add.
Radcliffe is right.
Now, let's find them.
Eliza! Donnie! l have had enough of this! l am not in the mood!
Great! l'm turning into Mom!
Where are the lights on this stupid thing?
Get outta here, pork chops!
Hi...thanks. l don't normally look this bad, just so you know.
Have you seen a dorky girl with braces and a monkey and a wild boy?
Sorry, l do not understand. l know. l don't get it either.
You have no idea what kind of day l've been having.
My name is Boko.
Oh, sorry, that was rude. l'm Debbie.
Boko, you don't have a pre-moistened towelette on you by chance?
Who is that girl?
Why did she drive into the mud?
We have to help her.
Oh...no one speaks English. l am so grounded.
Look! A campfire! lt must be my parents!
Mom! Dad!
Bree? Sloan?
Eliza? What are you doing out here?
The poachers are here.
They put up a fence in Tembo Valley.
- Really? Did you see them?
- No...l mean, yes, l saw them. l have to find my parents.
They're filming the elephants.
That's why we're here, too, to count the elephants.
- lf we can find any, of course.
- Yeah...they're really hard to find.
- They only... Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
They stay in the forest except during the eclipse.
The poachers must've heard the legend.
They're after the elephants!
- What?
- They're planning to catch them.
They'll be a thousand out in the open.
We must call Jomo right away!
- No signal. Of all times!
- Can't you fix it?
Guys, let's stay calm.
We can't do anything about it tonight.
Tomorrow, we'll find Eliza's parents and use their radio.
The poachers won't go after the elephants before the eclipse.
But l'm worried about Tally, the cheetah cub l told you about.
Eliza, it's dark.
No sense getting lost in the jungle. l won't get lost.
Donnie, get back here! l wouldn't want you to go in there and make a mess.
You and your chimp and your little brother can sleep right here. l'd look so hot in this.
You must be hungry. Here.
Thanks. l'm starving.
- What kind of cereal is this?
- We get our food from over there.
Delicious!
Oh, thank you!
My soda!
Sorry. Do you want some?
Thank you.
Delicious. l'm late for the whole
''finding my sister'' thing.
- Why is your jewellery so loud?
- Pretty cool, huh? lt's waterproof, too.
Why don't you keep it?
Are you giving this to me?
Thanks for the skirt.
You did give me this?
- Boko give Debbie?
- Debbie give Boko?
Yeah! l'm so good at this communication stuff! l'll be fine, really. l know exactly where l'm going.
Bye! Bye, Boko!
Who put that vine there?
Bye, again! Bye!
Really, l'm leaving now.
Hi, again. l'm just a little turned around.
- Debbie!
- Boko, you can't come with me. lt's not that l don't like you.
And it's not about the height thing. l can't drag you into this family drama. l have to find my sister, and believe me, she is good at this jungle stuff.
You think this'll fit?
Donnie's gone. We need to find him.
The eclipse is in a few hours.
But Donnie's always missing, and l was dreaming about shepherd's pie.
Bree! Sloan! Have you seen Donnie?
Donnie? Sloan told you to stay out of there.
Bree? Sloan?
What is all this? l don't like this place.
We've got Donnie, now let's go.
What's that?
Something's in there.
Tally?
Don't worry, l'll get you out of there.
- Eliza!
- Oh, Tally!
- l knew l'd find you.
- Eliza, we have to get out of here.
- What do you mean?
- Hello, Eliza.
This cheetah cub...
Where did you get him?
- l picked him up on the savannah.
- You bought him?
No. l picked him up... right off the ground. l told Sloan he shouldn't cut that rope ladder. lt was you!
Yes. Thank you so much for returning my knife to me.
Oh, kitten.
You didn't drink all your milk.
How are you going to grow big enough to make me a coat?
You'll have to miss the solar eclipse.
Catch it on the Poaching Channel!
You built the fence!
Of course. Now here's a question for your famous father.
How many volts of electricity does it take to kill a thousand elephants?
Then, my brat sister ran away from boarding school without any consideration for me, after all l've done for her.
- Stop! l see something!
- You say something? lf it was just Eliza, l'd say, ''Go play in the jungle!''
But l am responsible for Donnie, and l take that very seriously.
Debbie! l don't see anything.
Brat sister.
Wow! You're good.
Maybe we can make it to Tembo Valley before lunchtime.
- Tembo Valley?
- Yeah. You know it?
Eliza, you're a little troublemaker.
First, you show up on my cheetah hunt, then save my rhino.
- He's not your rhino!
- Oh, really?
You knew the poachers had shot him at the river.
- Yet you were on a train at the time.
- l guessed.
Perhaps.
Now you arrive here, knowing about a fence no one witnessed being built.
So, my little troublemaker, who told you?
No one.
- Are your parents working with Jomo?
- They don't know l'm here.
- Who's your source of information?
- No one!
You know too much for a little girl. l've too much invested in this to let anything get in my way. lf you don't tell me who they are, you'll never see your family again!
Sloan, l hear someone coming.
What's going on? l don't like him! l saw them with firesticks and there was a loud sound.
Explosives?
We've got to get out of here.
- l'll help!
- Go, Tally, that's it!
Yes, get the cheetah involved again!
They got us into this mess.
- Don't blame Tally.
- l'm not.
Tally didn't sneak out or run away from school, or trust people who don't like animals!
- l thought they were like me.
- Can't you see no one's like you?
- The Shaman gave you a gift. Use it!
- Darwin, please! l think you don't know what to do with your powers!
For once in your life, just be quiet!
- Hi, can we help you?
- Yes. l'm looking for my sister,
Eliza Thornberry.
- Debbie.
- Debbie!
Let me go, you creep!
- Let her go!
- Certainly. lf you tell me who's your source of information.
There's no one. l just guessed all of that stuff.
The fence and the explosives. l never mentioned explosives!
You're lying!
What's he talking about?
- Tell me, or she goes over the edge.
- Get rid of her.
- She doesn't know anything about this.
- Who told you these things?
- l can't tell you.
- Eliza!
Stop! Wait! l'll tell you! l know these things because...
...l can talk to animals.
What has she done?
Sloan, let's get out of here!
Debbie!
Boko!
Please be all right.
Debbie, run into the woods!
- Where are you going?
- l have to get Tally.
Darwin, come on! lt's really gone.
You expect me to believe you freed a warthog who was a magic man who let you talk to animals, but you had to keep it secret or you'd lose your powers?
Well...yeah. l knew it! That's why you're always sneaking out with Darwin!
Tell that monkey that l don't appreciate it when he leaves pizza crusts under the seat cushions. Tell him!
Debbie, l broke the rule. l told about my powers... so l lost them.
Oh, my gosh! You did that for me? l can't talk to Darwin any more.
And the last thing l said to him was really mean.
Now l can't even tell him l'm sorry.
Eliza, l may not speak monkey, but l think he's trying to tell us about that waterfall!
We're here.
This must be the Tembo Valley.
Come on!
The eclipse is going to start soon.
- What happened?
- We have to get out of here.
Wow! Darwin really watches out for you, doesn't he?
Yeah...he's my best friend.
The elephants! lt's a trap.
They're all going to die, and l can't warn them.
But can't you make elephant noises or something? l can't talk to them. How can l help them? You don't understand!
Shaman Mnyambo told me that he gave me my gift for a reason. lt doesn't matter now. l lost it.
OK, enough with the ''poor me'' bit.
Are you just going to sit there?
What can l do? l'm just an ordinary girl now.
Since you were little, you dragged home birds with broken wings.
You didn't have special powers then!
You just...cared.
Trust me, you were never ordinary.
Bree, take us into the valley, l want to watch this.
Everyone, take your places! lt must happen within seven minutes.
- Do you see the girls or Donnie?
- No. But, Nigel...
...what do you make of that?
Poachers!
They're setting up explosives.
They're going to frighten the elephants into stampeding, right into that electric fence!
Marianne, take us down there.
Eliza, no! They'll stomp on you.
No, they won't.
Elephants know when you're trying to help them.
- lt's not too late to become ordinary!
- Debbie!
Boko!
Think this'll fit?
Stay here, l'll be back. l have to stop them somehow, make them turn around.
Turn around! You have to go back! l've got to get to the front of the herd.
Set off the first round of explosives now!
The wires have been cut.
Set off the second round!
Think of something quick!
Think of something!
Please! Stop! lt worked!
Oh, no!
How can l make you understand me?
What did Phaedra tell me?
Behind the ear!
We did it!
Let's get out of here.
- They're turning! Start shooting!
- But there's a girl there. l don't care! Take down the elephants! l'll take care of the kid. lt's all right, we're almost out of here.
- You will regret this.
- l don't care!
What you're doing is awful!
And what you're doing is stupid!
Shame you won't be here to help me carry out the ivory.
Oh, no! l can't get a shot from here. Go lower!
Eliza!
Shaman Mnyambo, l'm sorry. l messed everything up. l couldn't make them understand. lf l hadn't broken the rule, l could have saved them.
But you did save them.
See for yourself.
And you did this not with your gift, but with your heart. lf you can do this without your powers, you have a greater destiny than l've even known. l'm going to grant you your powers back.
You are? Really?
There is one condition.
About your sister... how well can she keep a secret?
Don't move! You're under arrest!
Take your hands off me!
We were trying to help the elephants.
Need a ride?
- Brat sister.
- l don't know where he got that.
Debbie, stop! There's Darwin! l know you think l talk too much.
So from now on, l'll quietly observe...
- Yeah. Like that'll ever happen.
- Eliza?
Did you just talk to me?
- Mom! Dad!
- Eliza!
Poppet!
You're going back to your family?
Yeah.
Oh, please, keep it.
You know...friend?
Friend.
Pretty amazing, huh, Dad?
The legend was right. lt was, indeed.
But l still wonder why they gather during an eclipse.
Maybe the elephants feel safe.
- Safe?
- Yeah.
Maybe because it's the one day that everything changes.
The little moon blocks the powerful sun, so maybe...
...maybe they have reason to hope.
Maybe these intelligent creatures believe that by standing together, as they have done for centuries, they may one day live without fear of man's greed. l don't know, of course, but l swear she's thanking you. l think so, too, Dad.
- Tally, do you see her anywhere?
- This is where we always played.
We'll find her.
Mom!
Tally? Tally!
Mom, l'm back!
Oh, my baby. l thought l'd lost you.
Akela, l should have listened to you. l'm so sorry. l know you are.
Tally's home now and safe.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Eliza! Cut the cheetah chatter and let's go!
- l gotta go.
- Bye, Eliza. l'll miss you guys. See you next time.
How am l gonna keep your secret?
Well, you have to. l agreed to a condition when l got my powers back.
You can never tell anyone my secret, because if you do...
...you'll turn into a baboon.
A baboon?!
The peacefulness of this congregation... l am not going to spend the rest of my life with a purple butt!
Cut!
These furless primates you see behind me are part of an untamed sub-species best known as...
...the Thornberrys. lf you leap awake ln the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memory upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star l believe the light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever
Forever
And though l can't guarantee
There's nothing scary hiding under your bed l'm gonna stand guard
Like a postcard of a Golden Retriever
And never leave till l leave you
With a sweet dream in your head l'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Loved his daughter more than l love you
Trust your intuition lt's just like going fishing
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
But you don't need to waste your time
Worrying about the market place
Try to help the human race
Struggling to survive its harshest night l'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Loved his daughter more than l love you l'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Loved his daughter more than l love you
Here on earth
Are the stars so far away?
Do they hear us crying?
Can they feel us when we pray?
Can we trust
And go where it takes us?
Do we choose?
Sometimes l wonder
Do we create our destiny?
Dreamers like you
Dreamers like me
We have the power in our hearts
Love is our bridge to the stars
You could be so happy
On this brand new beautiful day
You could be so happy
Like kids getting ready to play
You could be so happy lf you got somebody to love

Please forgive this brief interruption in our program.
Is that it, then?
What are you going to say to Grandma, eh?
Is it over, do you think?
Hmm?
We now continue with a musical interlude.
Ah!
In France this summer will take place an event of great significance.
Each Frenchman will become personally involved in crafting victory, if I call out to him, he calls out, "Go, Poupou!" all along the route of the Tour de France...
Vive la R√©publique.
Vive la France.
Ah.
Speaking to you directly from this 17th stage of the Tour de France the pack, the machine of muscles and steel, finally gets going.
But before the rubber tests the overheated paving-stones of Marseille, these young lads still have many obstacles to face.
Don't eat that, S√©bastien,
It fell on the ground.
...a fantastic escape by the yellow jersey, who devours Klaut and Glutman of the canned food factory from Frankfurt.
They'll have a hard time catching up on the spot where they already failed miserably last year,
When they really had to bite the bullet. if I may use such a metaphor.
How admirable this fierce endurance is
On the face of this great eagle.
The very top lies at an altitude of 1912 metres, the horrible Ventoux, an impressive scenery of white desert, under a burning sun.
They climb standing on the pedals,
Constantly watching their gear ratio,
It is hell.
But before they reach the finish, they work themselves into a sweat, and leave behind that musky smell,
That supporters know so well.
The pack sink into oblivion.
For some the bell already sounds
And they give up.
Those who can not really pound the pedals, lose pace, fall behind, vanish into nothingness.
Together with a dazzling speed comes the liberating descent to Marseille.
Keep it up, my boy!
Yeah!
Insurance company Dijon gives away a whole week‚Äôs free insurance for the best sprinter.
Yes, that's right, for free, for his bicycle.
My box! That's my box!
Give me back my box!
Is that your dog?
Is that your dog?
I don‚Äôt believe it! The nerve!
She now has my box and the dog!

Hello, I'm Mr. Conductor, and I'm going to tell you a story about trains, folks far apart and the magic railroad that brought them together,
Every story, like a railroad, has its heroes.
Meet Thomas, he's our number one hero.
Hello!
But he's running a little late today.
This is the island of Sodor where Thomas and his friends live.
It's at one end of my special universe.
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hello, James.
-I like helping out here.
By the invitation of
Sir Topham Hatt, of course.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
Practicing your numbers, Gordon.
That's a good engine.
I'm counting how many seconds late you are.
What does that sign say?
Hmm...
"Sodor Railway.
"Really reliable and right on time."
Signed, "Head of the railway,
Sir Topham Hatt."
But you weren't on time, little Thomas.
And you're being bossy, Gordon.
Please excuse me.
I'm meeting Mr. Conductor.
He's looking after us while Sir Topham Hatt takes a much needed holiday.
I think we can take care of ourselves.
Get out of my way!
I have unfinished business here and I wanna finish it fast!
Diesel 10's back!
Yes, ten out of ten for devious deeds and brutal strength.
The blast from the past who hates steam engines.
Maybe we do need
Mr. Conductor here after all.
On time!
At the other end of my universe, far away across oceans of time, up and over Muffle Mountain and hidden deep in a valley, is my hometown,
Shining Time.
# Every now and then
# There appears a sign
# That points just round the bend
# To a place you'll find
# Covered in clover
# The magic comes over you
# Showing up right on time
# This is your Shining Time
# Climbing through stars to
# Your own cloud nine
# Soft strokes of lightning
# Paint the skies brightening
# Up all your Shining Time
And by the way, I think you're going to help me and Thomas somewhere in this story.
If Diesel has unfinished business, there's sure to be trouble right around the corner.
Sandal, fly! Boo, fly!
Shoo, fly! That's it!
Better still, buzz off.
Botheration!
You weren't concentrating, Thomas.
Lucky for you that the buffers were there.
That's what buffers are for, to stop engines from crashing.
Why are you in the sheds, James?
I'm feeling a little blue.
Which isn't so hot when you're red.
I was naughty and Sir Topham Hatt told me to think about all the ways
I can be Really Useful.
Then I can come out again.
He's just trying to make this a better railway for steam engines.
He says, the harder we work, the less he'll need diesels to help.
Help you?
You'll always need help!
Because steam engines are cowardly, cranky, wornout hunks of metal who couldn't hurt a fly.
- No, we're not!
- Yes, you are!
- Aren't!
- Are!
- Now, I've come back to find a lost steam engine.
I'm gonna destroy her and dominate you!
And then you'll be nothing but useless scrap!
Right, Pinchy?
Big bully! Stinker!
We're Really Useful engines!
You won't dominate us and you won't destroy her!
We won't let you.
Neither will Mr. Conductor.
I'm off to fetch him now.
What lost engine?
There, Mutt, the paint job's finished.
I reckon Shining Time has the best welcome sign of any town in our valley.
I'm glad you agree.
Billy's old map sure helped a lot.
He's on his way back now, is he?
You hear that train whistle sooner than it hears itself.
Fine work, Patch.
Thanks.
Oh, I've been looking at your map.
What are these mysterious shadowy lines?
They look like straight railroad tracks, but I can't see any tracks around here, except the ones you travel on.
It's mysteries that make this land so...
Magical?
I better be off to Muffle Mountain.
I promised Mr. Stone that I'd clean his yard.
Does Burnett Stone ever give you a smile?
No, but he doesn't frighten my horse, either.
Which means,
I don't think he's a bad man.
I think he's just sad.
I didn't know that in
Muffle Mountain there was a secret that Burnett had shared only with his childhood friend, Tasha.
One day, Tasha, I'm going to drive this engine.
And I'll take you with me.
Promise you will,
Burnett. Promise!
I promise.
This engine was vital to the magic that held these worlds together, but only Burnett knew that.
Hello. Shining Time Station.
Manager Stacy Jones speaking.
Oh, yes, the 10:15 from
Pelican Falls to Shining Time is right on schedule.
-You're welcome.
The 10:00 to Lucy's Leap is leaving now.
Oh, Billy, I found this child's drawing in an old locker in the lost and found.
Look at the signature, Billy.
Burnett Stone!
It's hard to believe Burnett could have ever looked that happy.
Burnett had a wonderful smile.
And he loved railroading, too.
How did you find me here?
I found the entrance to your workshop ages ago.
But I would never tell anybody.
See that switch on the wall?
Flip it on.
I guessed there was something mysterious about this mountain.
Yeah. All mountains have their secrets, Patch.
Shouldn't surprise a kid like you.
Could I help you,
Mr. Stone?
Sure. You can help me dust her off.
This engine's name is Lady.
Why is she locked up?
She isn't.
She's safe from harm.
Long ago, I made a mistake as Lady's caretaker.
An evil diesel found Lady and threatened to destroy her.
He chased her and used up all her coal.
He made her go too fast and then he crashed her.
Then I brought her here.
I tried my best to fix her up but I've never been able to make up for the mistake I made.
And I've never been able to bring her to life.
To make her steam.
Patch, she's as precious as gold.
Pinchy, you captured the real me.
That's beautiful. I could cry.
- Boss?
- We're here.
Listen, you two.
I've got a job for you,
Splodge.
- Actually, it's Splatter.
- And Dodge.
I ain't got time to say both names!
Oh, well.
I've come back to find a steam engine.
That's easy.
Yeah, they're everywhere.
Not the one I want.
She escaped me once before.
As long as she exists, so do the others.
But if she can be destroyed...
Destroyed.
Did you say the destroyed?
Yeah, destroyed!
There's one problem.
Mr. Conductor's coming, and he won't let you destroy.
I can do whatever I want!
I'll get him, too!
With Pinchy!
Ow! Pinchy,
I hate it when you do that!
- Hello, Mr. Conductor.
- Hello, Billy.
Tool kit? Check.
Ticket puncher?
Check-check.
All aboard!
Just testing, Billy.
Mustn't let my conducting skills get rusty.
Important day, Mr. C?
It is a very important day!
I'm going to the island of Sodor.
It's the only place in my universe where I fit in size-wise.
Sir Topham Hatt has given me a big responsibility.
Diesel 10 is back and I have to make sure he behaves himself.
Excuse me, Billy.
I hope your visit goes well, Mr. C.
Thank you.
I must be responsible, reliable and...
Don't tell me.
Really Useful. I knew that.
Well, Thank you, Moby Dick.
I like my sparkle, too.
You know, gold really is your color.
Stacy, where did you find this painting?
In an old locker. It was done by Burnett Stone when he was a child.
I was told that he used to work on this railroad.
But he never leaves the other side of the mountain now.
You seem puzzled,
Mr. Conductor.
Well, I am puzzled.
This place looks like the island of Sodor but how would
Burnett Stone travel there without gold dust?
Sparkle's been the only way to make the trip since the lost engine disappeared.
Anyway, I just came to say goodbye.
I have to go now.
Right now?
Yes. I have to make sure everything's safe and sound on the island of Sodor just as I try to do here.
Like Stacy, Mutt sensed danger, he didn't want either
Billy or me to leave
Shining Time.
Old Smoky, you stay right here until I get back.
Ah, there you are.
Is something wrong here?
Ah!
I'm going to be late.
I'll get back as fast as I can.
I have to concentrate now, Mutt.
I'm suddenly having problems with my sparkle.
Mutt?
-Goodbye, Mutt.
-Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.
Mr. Conductor, where are you?
I know you live far away, but you always seem to get here on time.
Oh, Mr. Conductor!
Are you all right?
Yes, Thomas. But sometimes everything happens at once.
I have to see Sir Topham Hatt to get my orders right away.
The journey from Shining Time keeps getting bumpier and bumpier.
- A big bully Diesel is back.
- You had better be careful.
Sir Topham Hatt warned me about Diesel.
Don't worry, Thomas.
I'll just pop in and out with my sparkle wherever he goes and keep him in order.
I hope.
# Old MacDiesel had a plan
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
# A pinch-pinch here, and a pinch-pinch there
Here a pinch, there a pinch #
I crack myself up.
Tasha, the Conductor family has a little steam engine, with her own railroad, and has wonderful energy because of it.
But a diesel wants to destroy her.
And without her, the Conductor's universe will vanish.
The man with the sparkle told me that one day, one of his family will return, but until then,
"To guard her well, young Burnett."
But I didn't guard you well.
I just don't seem to understand about...
About magic anymore.
This is where
Burnett's granddaughter,
Lily, comes into our story.
She lives with her mom and dad in the big city, a few hours train ride from Shining Time.
She sees magic no one else has time to, like lovely reflections of light on a rainy day.
Soon, she was off to stay with her grandpa on Muffle Mountain,
Grandpa's been so sad since Grandma Tasha died and he never comes here to see us.
Well, maybe your visit will cheer him up. Hmm?
Did you get his present?
Here. I'm making him a friendship bracelet.
Honey, that's beautiful.
But I'd rather just stay here with you.
I know. Come here.
- I'm gonna go up this way.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
- You always say that.
See you in a minute.
You're coming with me to Grandpa's, Bluebird.
I know how much you like to travel.
Faraway on Sodor, the steam engines were confident, cheerful, and determined not to be bullied by Diesel.
Only James, who now felt
Really Useful too, was complaining.
- Wobbly wheels.
- Puffy pistons.
Thomas,
I should have collected Mr. Conductor!
James is right, little Thomas.
Collecting Mr. Conductor is an important job.
Important is big.
James is a big engine.
You, Thomas, are small!
Small, small, small.
Teeny, weenie, weenie.
And I am a big, blue engine who knows everything.
Bossy sprockets!
All that steam has gone to your funnel!
- There they are.
- We'll fix their wagons.
I'm no good at backing up.
Me neither.
What's important is to stand up on our own wheels to Diesel.
Diesel knows that the lost engine in the legend really exists.
- What engine?
- What legend?
An engine whose magic makes her more powerful than Diesel will ever be.
That's why he wants to find her.
Then we'd better find her first.
Leave it to the big engines,
Percy.
Little engines can do big things.
Especially when they have nice blue paint like me.
Hey, just watch what happens to that blue puffball...
When Harold the flopper chopper flies past here.
Right!
Routine fly-by, chaps. Hello.
The boss dumped sneezing powder everywhere.
Let's start laughing now.
Oh, sorry, fellas.
A bit of a dust up.
Love to stay and clean up.
Got to go. Bye.
Did you mean to look like that?
- No.
- Neither did I.
This must be
Diesel's doing!
Toot!
"Where were you?
"My wife said she couldn't miss our little holiday.
"We'll telephone to make sure you have arrived."
Signed, "Sir Topham Hatt."
Sir Topham Hatt.
Where were you?
Good afternoon, sir.
A real honor, sir.
Like my family before me.
And how is Lady Hatt?
Yes. Watch out for Diesel.
Definitely.
Keep an eye on Henry's health.
Certainly.
Yes, sir, the three R's, reading, writing and arithmetic.
I mean...
I will be responsible, reliable and Really Useful.
Yes, sir.
We will all get a good night's sleep.
Looking forward to a hard day tomorrow.
Goodbye, sir.
So, who dropped the ball then?
Oh, there you are.
I'd like a nice cup of hot cocoa.
Would you fellas care to join me?
No.
Go outside and play?
Well, I can understand that.
What do you think?
Why do you keep hitting him like that?
You need a time out.
Just a little sweeter, I think.
All right, Pinchy, my little bucket of badness, time to feast yourself.
Ah! Now that's better.
Cinders and ashes!
It's Diesel!
Oh, no!
Hello, Twinkle Toes!
I've got a plan and you're not in it!
-You can't catch me, Diesel!
- Losing your sparkle, huh?
- What perfect timing.
You won't find her here.
You're not clever enough to stop me.
Oh, yes, I am!
No, you're not. Is that...
That's right.
It's sugar, Diesel.
And if I throw this in your tank, it'll seize you up for good.
Make the most of tonight,
Twinkle Toes, because you won't like tomorrow!
Neither will that line of tin kettles!
Shut up, Pinchy.
Mr. Conductor, but what happened to your sparkle?
I don't know, Thomas.
I'll just have to sleep on that.
On your sparkle?
No, Thomas.
On the problem of what happened to it.
But, Mr. Conductor, without your sparkle or the lost engine, you can't travel here to help us anymore.
I'll solve the problem.
You just go to sleep now.
Easy for you to say.
Sparkle, gold dust, magic, railroad, buffers, lost engine.
The family told me, as long as there is a railroad, there will be harmony.
As long as there is gold dust, there will be energy.
You will never have to worry.
Yeah, sure.
Mr. C?
Mr. C!
Why aren't you here?
Why couldn't you travel anymore to the island of Sodor or back home here to us in Shining Time?
The magic is all gone.
What's going wrong with our railroad and why?
My universe is in danger.
I've got to find more gold dust!
Next morning,
Mutt traveled with Billy to the big city station.
Mutt was sure Lily could help her grandpa, and that together they could help me, but only if Lily met someone special at Shining Time first.
The train for Muffle Mountain will depart from Track 3, last stop, Muffle Mountain.
The train for Shining Time will depart from Track 4.
I don't suppose you know where Track 3 is, do you?
You do?
Well, why not?
-I hope you're right.
Mutt was feeling pleased with himself.
He had put Lily on the wrong train but he knew he had done so for the right reasons.
# I know how the moon must feel
# Looking down from the heavens
# Smiling at the silly things
# We put ourselves through
# Missing magic each day
# And not seeing the wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
# I know how the moon must feel
# When he makes someone happy
# That's the feeling I will feel
# When you smile at me
# I'll be floating on air
# I'll be beaming with wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
Left a bit... Ah!
Right a bit.
Up a bit!
There, James.
Tickle all gone now?
No. Still itchy.
Hey, Mr. C, why do you look so tired?
Is it because I'm red?
Diesel says red is a very tiring color.
But, Mr. C, red looks so nice against the snow.
It's not me, is it?
No, of course not, James.
Red is bright and cheerful.
- Oh, good.
- Just like my sparkle.
Or at least it was, and must be again!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to the windmill to search for something important.
Now off to work, please.
Okay.
Keep your steam up.
What happened?
Where's the windmill?
That's where I'm supposed to be.
Now I've completely lost my sense of direction.
Oh...
Now my gold dust really is all gone.
If I can't find the source for making more, the consequences will be bad.
I saw them in my dream last night.
My family never told me what to do in a gold dust crisis.
They only said,
"If you can't remember the clue,
"the windmill will remind you."
But where is the windmill?
And what is the clue?
- Smile, you steamers.
- It's a sunny day.
It's not sunny,
'cause Mr. C's not at the windmill. I looked.
I think his sparkle's all gone.
My smoke box doesn't feel sunny.
It feels stuffed up.
Nasty fumes from dingy Diesel.
And Diesel is after the lost engine.
And if he finds her,
I fear that will destroy us all.
What, even an engine as big as me?
Yes, Gordon, even you.
Say it, don't spray it, Thomas.
I've still got sneezing powder up my funnel.
Now I'm going to look for Mr. Conductor.
Let us get back to work.
That's what he would want.
How about a race, Thomas?
Sorry, Bertie. I can't today.
I have to be a Really Useful engine and solve some mysteries instead.
I guess that means I win.
Perhaps another day.
What's that?
What's this?
"I notice you left your thinking cap behind.
"Try these instead.
They're good for the brain.
"Gone fishing. Rabbit."
Well, well, well!
How very thoughtful.
Plane, drain.
Mountain, fountain.
That might be something.
I think I'll try the celery.
Sausage, bicycle.
Toothpaste, beach.
Wait a minute.
Beach.
Beach! That's it! That's it!
I have to find a bellflower.
I need to make a call.
# It's a summer Sunday and I'm under

That's my shell phone!
Junior is that you?
Oh, hi, Cous.
Are you in a tunnel?
This isn't a very good line.
Where are you?
Hmm... I'm in paradise.
I got on cloud nine, and here I am.
Listen to me,
You've got to come to the island of Sodor right now.
Now? But I'm waiting on the perfect wave!
Oh, no, you're not!
You're coming here.
You have to help me find the source of our family's gold dust.
What is the source?
That's the trouble.
I haven't a clue.
And I've used up most of my gold dust, too.
What?
Then go to
Shining Time Station first, and in my signal house, in the box under the staircase, you'll find my emergency whistle with the last of my supply.
Please take care of this and...
Don't talk to anyone about the buffers!
What buffers?
Shh!
This is a really bad line.
Hello!
My shell phone's not working properly.
You've got to come here right away!
I'm counting on you!
Hello?
I want my money back.
Shining Time?
What does that mean?
- Do you want me to get off here?
Where is everyone?
What have you brought me here for?
That's gonna leave a mark! Oh!
Maybe it's in here.
Oh, cake!
Ugh, that's not cake!
-How cute. Six little...
Five little glass figurines.
Ooh! Hello?
This is too much.
I've got to get back to the island.
I've got to get to cousin.
Hiya. Who are you?
I'm Lily. Who are you?
C. Junior.
Did I drop some sunglasses when I came in here?
I don't know.
Oh, well, I might as well use some more of this stuff.
See you, Lily.
What is this stuff?
The magic is gone.
Why did I take my gold dust for granted?
I can't help without my gold dust.
What is the source of my gold dust?
Is someone there?
Thomas, is that you?
Mr. Conductor?
-Mr. Conductor!
Oh, Mr. Conductor, where are you?
Thomas?
How could I possibly say that
I'm Really Useful now?
Excuse me. Are you Lily?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Stacy Jones.
I'm manager here.
Your grandpa's very upset.
You must've gotten on the wrong train.
I'll take you to Muffle Mountain.
Thank you.
Stacy, did you know my grandma?
My mother did.
She said Tasha was a wonderful dancer.
I think Grandpa liked to call Grandma "Lady."
Lady?
Yes.
I heard him say that name when they were talking.
I wish...
Oh, never mind.
Turn right here, you can't miss it
Stacy, I'm a little nervous.
Well, maybe your grandpa is, too.
It's been a while since you've seen each other.
Thanks a lot.
Hello, Burnett.
Stacy.
Hello, Lily.
Hi, Grandpa.
Have a good evening.
Thanks, Stacy. Good night.
You said, "I wish..."
I wish?
Oh, yes.
I wish you'd come back and see us tomorrow at Shining Time.
If your grandpa lets you.
Here, Grandpa.
This is a friendship bracelet.
Grandma taught me how to make one when I was little.
This one's for you.
Thank you, Lily.
As the sound of Lady's magic echoed through the night on Muffle Mountain, the engines on Sodor had her very much in their thoughts,
Thomas, I was thinking.
How does Mr. Conductor travel here?
By gold dust.
But if there' s a lost engine, maybe there's a lost railway, too.
Mr. Conductor's railway!
The journey gets bumpier and bumpier.
That's what
Mr. Conductor told me.
Oh!
He talked about buffers in his sleep!
Buffers are at the end of a railway.
I think that's how he travels here, on a secret railway.
Belonging to the lost engine!
Percy, you are clever.
Oh! My wheels are suddenly feeling very wobbly.
I think Diesel's around here!
I'm sorry, you two.
Diesel heard every word you said.
I'm going after him to see what he does next.
You'd better get the mail delivered.
You're very brave, Toby.
Diesel won't bother with an old engine like me.
He thinks I'm really useless.
# I've been working on the railway
# All the livelong day #
Who wants to work a livelong day anyway?
There he is.
Come in! Come in and join the party, Splodge!
Hooray!
We're gonna have a party.
I love parties.
Who's got the balloons?
What?
Correction.
Join the party that's over.
Just like Twinkle Toe's magic railway is gonna be over.
Hmm.
Gone, like the lost engine and the buffers that lead to her.
What are you gonna do?
That's a good question.
It's time to put Twinkle Toes' lights out.
Ooh.
This is a job for the boss!
I've got to delay him.
I've got to distract him. Hmm.
- It's the old teapot!
- Smash him!
- Pinchy, get back here!
- I hate it when you do this!
Good show!
Uh, Boss, did you mean to let the roof fall in?
All the way in?
I always mean what I do, you rattle traps!
Diesel was in a dump, but the steam engines were still right on track.
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# All the other engines
They'll tell you so
# He huffs and puffs and whistles
# Rushing to and fro
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# 'Cause the Fat Controller
He told him so
# Now he's got a workshop to call his very own
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's the one
# He's the number one
# Thomas the tank engine
# He's the Really Useful engine
# We adore
Morning, Henry.
What's the matter?
I've got boiler ache.
And I'm collecting one, two, three, four, five, six trucks of special island of
Sodor coal for you.
Oh, Thank you, Thomas.
Special coal will make me feel much better.
But I wish I could make Mr. Conductor feel better too, by finding him.
Hello, Thomas and your five coal trucks.
Five?
But I'm supposed to have six.
Hello, Percy.
Oh, Thomas,
I've been worried about you.
Bertie says you lost a coal truck today.
Yes. It disappeared when I was at the buffers near the little grotto.
Maybe those are the buffers that lead to the secret railway.
And the grotto is the lost engine's special platform!
Yes!
Percy, you protect those buffers from Diesel...
...and I'll find
Mr. Conductor.
- Because you're a brave engine, Percy.
Oh, I forgot.
- Hello, Twinkle Toes!
- Remember me?
Fat Hatt won't have much use for you looking like that.
Oh, I see you forgot to bring the sugar.
How careless of you.
Say hello to Pinchy!
Okay, Twinkle Toes,
I know about the buffers.
- That's what I saw in my dream!
- It's coming true!
My universe is starting to crumble!
And I know about the magic railway.
And when I find that engine, you and all those puffballs will be history!
Now tell me where the buffers are! Now!
-You got 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Too late, Diesel!
Did you put all this here for me?
You must've known that I was coming.
How kind of you.
Oh! I'm at the windmill.
That's what I call a perfect landing.
This must be the clue to unlock the source of the gold dust.
Where has the writing gone?
So, Boss...
How come you let
Twinkle Toes escape?
Oh, that!
Well, uh,
I did it on purpose.
I was testing him to see if he could escape.
- Liar, liar.
- Pants on fire.
All right!
Playtime's over, Splodge.
Uh-oh.
Now it's time for the next lesson, huh?
I call it
"How to stop being stupid."
That's gonna ruin my facial.
Oh.
Bet you can't climb that tree.
See?
-On my fire escape.
Hi. I'm Patch.
I'm Lily.
Do you live around here?
Yes.
My mom and dad run the stables.
- Morning, Patch.
- Good morning, Mr. Stone.
I'm riding into Shining Town.
Could Lily come with me?
- If she'd like to.
- I'd like to.
Sure, she can go.
Be back by sunset, Lily.
Do you wanna come, too?
I never go there now.
Bye, Grandpa.
So, have you ever ridden a horse before?
No.
I've always wanted to go this way.
We're following some shadowy lines
I've seen on a map.
They're like railroad tracks without any rails.
Well, Lady, what are we to do?
It all seemed so much easier when Tasha and I were children.
Junior?
Presto!
I'd given up on seeing you again.
What's blue, green and red and goes beep.
A parrot and you mean chirp-chirp.
No, trains. Talking trains.
And I'm off to see them right now in the island of
Sodor, and cousin.
But I overslept and I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Do you want to come?
Can we be back here by sunset?
I hope so.
I wanna get back to the beach.
- Okay.
- Good.
It's this way.
We'll take the shortcut.
-Hmm...
There's two of us.
Oh, well. That means
I'll have to use Cous' extra supply of gold dust.
It doesn't matter.
We'll have plenty more soon.
Can I take this little bit back for Grandpa?
Be my guest.
I'll take care of it for you.
Ready? Here goes.
You've grown bigger.
May be you're smaller.
I'm adjusting to my new surroundings.
This is the only place this ever happens to me.
Whoa!
A bit bouncy, isn't it?
-Conductor's railroad.
-Whatever.
We're traveling miles and miles to the island.
But I don't know if this railroad's gonna last much longer.
-It'll vanish like the engine.
The engine that used to travel on this railroad.
Cous and I never saw it.
We don't know what happened to it.
Hey, what's that doing there?
You ready, Lily?
Here are the buffers.
Now!
Where are we?
The island of Sodor, of course.
This way.
-Oh, bogus!
I think I'm allergic to grass.
It's a good thing
I like climbing things.
Grass.
What's that noise?
The trains. They talk.
We're just too far away to hear what they're saying.
Good morning.
Annie! Clarabel!
There's Mr. Conductor!
We found him!
Oh, bunko! It's Junior.
- Junior, look!
- It's Thomas!
Thomas, now, don't look so surprised. I know you haven't seen me since...
You stuffed party poppers down my funnel!
- We had a laugh.
- You did.
- You're talking to each other.
- Ah! First prize.
Lily, Thomas. Thomas, Lily.
Now, where's my cousin?
-Hi.
-Hello, Lily.
Welcome to Sodor.
Come on, Lily.
I'm very at home on trains.
Annie, Clarabel,
I'll send Percy back to fetch you.
We've heard that one before.
-Travel sickness.
What's that shining at the windmill?
Presto, Lily.
I think it's my cousin!
Mr. Conductor!
Mr. Conductor!
Thomas!
Thank throttles you're safe!
Come on, Lily.
Hey, Cous, what's up?
-No, Junior, I am not.
As a matter of fact,
I just landed here after escaping a heavy metal monster.
Junior, where have you been?
Is your sparkle back,
Mr. Conductor?
No, Thomas, it isn't.
But I do know the clue.
Stoke up the magic in the mountain...
Darn!
Dither!
Hey, Cous, you're looking terrible.
Why don't we get more gold dust
'cause I used yours up.
Then you can go back home and I can go to the beach.
Junior, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Uh-oh.
- I'll get that.
- I've got it.
Hello?
No, this is his cousin.
Give the phone.
Who's this?
Oh, hello, Hattie.
No, no. He's hanging around here somewhere.
Yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
No, he just wanted to be friendly.
No, he is not a dog.
Let's just say he's a puppy in need of a good trainer.
No, nothing to worry about, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Cous, this is Lily.
She's staying with Grandpa Stone.
Hello, Lily.
Hello.
- Junior?
- Whoa!
- What are you doing up there?
- Come down.
It's too windy!
This is just like the fun fair!
Give us two seconds.
Whoo-hoo!
Two seconds is all it takes for you to land in trouble!
- Ah-ha! Twinkle Toes Junior!
- Oh, no, my beach bag!
You won't be doing any surfing up here, Mr. Kahuna.
Really? Watch me.
Hang on tight, Moon Doggie!
Yee-haw!
Diesel's hijacked him!
What's gonna happen to Junior now?
My family's pretty good at getting themselves out of trouble. Eventually.
I don't know what eventually means but it sounds very, very long.
-I wish I knew.
I'm sorry.
She wasn't at the station when I went back for her.
It's okay, Patch.
We'll find her. Don't worry.
I am brave.
I am brave.
Thomas says I'm brave, so I'm brave.
Oh! It's not easy being brave.
Shiver my pistons!
There's Splatter and Dodge!
Oh! They found the buffers.
Oh, now what's going to happen?
- Howdy partner.
- Excuse me.
Oh, that's just nothing.
Ah!
That nothing was something.
These must be the buffers
Diesel's looking for.
Are we supposed to go through them?
Not we, you.
Not me, you.
This is a job for the boss.
We'll tell him tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow's good.
Oh,
I'd better hurry back and warn Thomas.
I was doing my best to keep Lily cheerful.
I knew she was worried about being late for her grandpa,
Mr. Conductor,
I was supposed to be back by sunset.
You know, Lily, perhaps your grandpa can guess where you are.
-Maybe.
Because I think he's been here himself, long ago.
And if he can help,
I do wish he'd hurry.
I haven't told Junior this, but soon he'll grow as weak as I am.
Junior said there used to be an engine that traveled on the magic railroad.
And if only we could find that we could still head back to
Shining Time.
Oh, that engine disappeared.
Never to be seen or heard from again.
I have to tell you something, Mr. C.
I've heard a train whistle and it sounded like it came from the mountain.
Mountain. I just remembered another part of the clue.
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain and the lady will smile."
But we need more information, Lily.
And I know that your grandpa could help if he would just believe that he could.
Lady?
She can whistle.
I've heard her.
Yeah, so have I.
It's because she's magic.
This must be the map of her magic railroad.
But the railroad's energy is fading away.
I sensed it when we were out riding.
Lily and I were traveling on the ground above it.
The railroad needs Lady but I don't know her special secret.
And I need to know it now more than ever.
-Yes, because of Lily.
So, Thomas, we must get Lily back to her grandpa now incase Diesel gets rid of the railway.
But how can Lily go without gold dust?
Only in the lost engine.
-Unless...
Thomas, will you please take Lily?
Through the buffers?
But what if I go on the railway and my wheels don't work?
-But what if, if...
- It will be for a while.
- And cold.
- Maybe.
- And how will
I get back again?
Because you're a
Really Useful engine and will find a way.
Then I'll try.
I promise
I'll get you home to your grandpa, Lily.
Follow me, partner.
Right this way to Bufferville.
- Just a walk in the park.
We're going through, Lily.
You're on your own from here on in, little buckaroo!
Little engines can do big things.
It is dark and cold and bumpy but I'm not afraid.
Oh, there's the missing coal truck.
Coal truck?
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain."
That's part of
Mr. Conductor's clue to his gold dust.
And, Lily, that's what you do with coal, stoke it up to make steam.
We're going to be really reliable and help
Mr. Conductor.
We're going back for that coal truck.
Buffers. Coal truck.
We're starting to solve the mysteries, Lily.
You're a Really Useful engine,
Thomas.
- Lily, where are we?
- Muffle Mountain, Thomas.
I think I feel a little dizzy.
I can't go any further.
My wheels won't let me.
Then I'll be back, Thomas.
I promise.
But I must find Grandpa.
It's getting windy up here.
Bust my boiler!
I've left the coal truck behind!
Where's Grandpa?
Can you take me to him?
- Jump up.
- I knew I could count on you.
Stop, wheels. Stop!
Whoa!
Grandpa!
Oh, Lily.
I'm so glad to see you.
There's this island with talking trains and they said you might have been there.
But Mr. Conductor's very sick and Junior's in danger and I had to leave poor Thomas behind.
Please help me.
I'd like to, Lily.
Nothing seems to work.
This is the lost engine from long ago.
Now we can go back to the island and bring
Mr. Conductor and Junior home.
I can't make her steam.
I've tried all the different coals in the valley.
Lady.
-Yes.
Coal. Special coal from the island of Sodor.
That's what Lady needs.
Patch, there's a coal truck up at the top of the mountain.
- Do you think you could get some?
- Of course I will.
I'm sorry, Lily and Cous,
I haven't been responsible, reliable,
Really Useful...
But I will be!
But I will be!
James!
So you've lost your sparkle, too, huh?
Bye-bye, Twinkle Toes.
Oh! It's empty.
Here we go.
Junior, what are we gonna do?
We'll think of something.
That's it.
I'll find you some more, Lily.
I promise.
But if I'm going to be any help at all, it's now or never.
I've got to use up the rest of this stuff.
- Are you ready?
- No, we're not.
James the brains, get us out of here.
Now we are.
What the...
- Bye, James.
- Bye, Junior.
Sorry I've been so long, Cous.
But better late than never?
Junior, we are all out of gold dust, aren't we?
Bankrupt.
Hey!
It's a beautiful day!
I mean we're down, but we're not out.
No, we're out...
But we are not down.
Did Grandma love Lady as much as you do?
Did she take a ride on her?
Grandma loved her because I loved her.
But she never took a ride on Lady.
I couldn't fix her in time.
Lily, look.
The railroad's getting its energy back.
Well, my Lady, the lights are all green for you now.
Green for glory.
- Tasha would have loved this journey.
- Yes, she would.
And she'd love it that you're with me now.
So, Burnett, you didn't forget about magic.
It's safe inside you.
Thomas!
You've found her!
And she's beautiful!
We're on the island of Sodor.
Stop, Grandpa.
Stop, Lady.
Hello, Junior. Hello, Mr. C.
Mr. Conductor, this is my grandpa.
I'm glad you were able to find your way back.
Junior, do you realize who this is?
I reckon this is one beautiful engine.
Oh...
This is the lost engine.
Oh, are we glad to see you.
Now we can go back to Shining Time.
Junior.
We won't make it back to Shining Time without the gold dust.
Without it, the magic can't exist.
Ah-ha!
There's the blue puffball!
And look who he's with.
Splodge, come and destroy.
No.
You do it yourself.
We don't like you.
- We mean that.
- Emphatically.
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.
Run, Lady. Quickly!
And I'm going to help you.
So am I, my Lady.
I'll not let you down again.
Who needs you, Splodge?
Watch out for the viaduct.
It's dangerous!
What's the matter?
Lady.
That engine's name is Lady.
- She's part of the clue to the source of...
...The gold dust!
Now I'll get you, Burnett Stone.
No, you won't, because the magic you refuse to believe in will get the better of you.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Right, Pinchy?
- Pinchy's hungry.
- Get back!
Come on, Lady.
Coming, Puffball.
Look out!
Here I come! Duck, Pinchy!
I like my lunch steamed.
Pretty fast for a puffball.
Well, Lady, this is your shining time, too.
I hope so.
Come on, Lady.
Little engines can do big things.
Well done, Thomas!
Well done!
Hey! Ooh! What's going on?
Oh! Hold it!
Puffball!
Teapot!
Tin kettle!
Oh, well.
Nice time of the year for a cruise.
But, Mr. Conductor, you still don't have your gold dust.
I think he will soon.
Wait a minute.
"Then watch the swirls that spin so well."
Swirls. Like the shavings around Lady when we were on the railroad.
- Is there anything else?
- Of course there is.
"So well."
A well means water.
Lily, put the shavings in with the water.
Go ahead, Lily.
Throw it up in the air.
Please! Please!
Now, Lily.
- Gold dust!
- Gold dust!
Yey!
Gold dust!
Lady, you're a really helpful engine.
And helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.
Come on, Mutt.
Let's look around.
Lily...
I think I promised you something.
Here.
Take some.
So, Cous, how else can I help?
You mean, you don't want to go back to the beach?
No.
Well, maybe for a holiday.
But I'm ready to work.
You got a job for me?
You know, Junior, there is a railroad.
-One or two.
-Sunny spells.
I'll take it.
What's the way?
This is the way.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
You're on your way back right now.
Splendid news.
I'll be at the sheds to welcome you.
Oh, yes, sir.
Everything is under control.
Goodbye, sir.
Well, see you in Shining Time.
Here, Grandpa.
I'd like you to have this.
Well, how sweet of you, Lily.
Here. Give me the bluebird.
I think we should share it.
Now we'll always remember our Shining Time together.
Have a great time.
Ah!
And so we've come to the happy end of our story.
But it's time for all of us to go home, just like Thomas.
I believe in the playground.
It's my favouritest place in the whole wild world.
But two yesterdays ago a bad thing happened when we was playing there.
Some big boys took my brother's binky and buried it in the sandbox.
Binky bye-bye.
They maked my brother cry.
So I said: "Dilly, this is a job for the Bobfather."
You come to me on the day of this wedding, and ask me to take care of the boys who made your brother cry?
No. Dil just wants a new binky.
That's it? A binky?
I don't get to squeeze no one's head or pull no one's hair?
- No.
- Binky, peeze!.
Dumb baby. Can't even make a good wish. All right, kiss my ring.
Go send the next one in, and tell him to bring a sponge.
Nine, eleven, twenty...
Chuckie!. You're not supposed to look at your feet when you're dancing.
But I gots to, Susie. They just keep getting all tanglied up.
Faster, Phillip!.
We gots to get to the peoples on top.
- I gots dibs on the feets.
- Phil, Lil...
The Bobfather wants to see you now.
I can't believe
Angelica saw that movie last night.
I can't mother and merger at the same time.
She only saw a scene or two.
It couldn't have made an impression.
Bobfather, we founded this in our crib.
That's what you get for wiping your boogers on Cynthia.
So that's where I left them!
Let's give a round of applause to this week's number one newly-weds:
Mr and Mrs Lou and Lulu Pickles!
Let's show these whippersnappers how it's done.
I didn't get these plastic hips for nothing!
Think you'll ever tie the knot again?
'Cause I got a cousin who's lookin'.
Big bones, broad shoulders...
And she can eat her weight in cheese!
Thanks, Betty, but cheese gives me hives. So does dating.
Boy, Lou and Lulu sure can boogie.
You're like family to me, Finster.
Name your wish.
Gosh, Bobfather,
I don't know what to wish for.
Just pick something already!
I don't mean your nose!
Come on, Chuckie.
Granpa Lou's throwing the gardener.
I'll take that binky.
There you go, Drooly.
It fell off a truck.
See, Dilly? You got your wish.
- I'm really happy for you, Pop.
- Yeah, Lulu's a great lady.
Yep, she's a keeper! 'Course, no one will ever replace your mother.
It's her love in here that helped this old geezer love again.
Now it's time for a special dance for all the kids and their mums.
Mummy just loves dancing with her handsome boys.
Angelica!
Wait, Angelica! I think I know what I want to wish for.
I'd kinda like to have a new mummy.
Sorry, Finster, game's over. Besides,
I'm wanted on the dance floor.
But that's my wish.
It's getting late, Chuckie.
What do you say we head home?
Chuckie, what are you doing up?
I was just looking through some of our old things.
Remember your Wawa?
Your mummy made it for you.
Oh, Chuckie, your mum was an amazing woman.
I bet she's in heaven right now looking down on us.
I've been missing her so much, Chuckie.
Maybe we could use a mummy's touch around here.
Huh, little guy?
You got to love the lnternet.
Behold the future of dating.
What are they doing?
My daddy's helping your daddy catch some dates in a net.
- What are dates?
- Big raisins that make you poop.
- What is it with you babies and poop?
- Where do you want us to start?
Wow! My own web page!
"Chas Finster.
Bureaucrat. Bachelor."
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Look, you already have 1 2 dates.
That's triple my lifetime record.
Look at this one. She loves sunsets, long walks on sandy beaches and "is not allowed in the state of Kentucky".
I don't know about this, Stu.
Let me put it to you this way.
Dates is for people like Mr Chuckie's dad who don't got no wife.
But why does Chuckie's daddy need a wife?
What I have to put up with!
'Cause if his daddy gets a new wife, then Chuckie gets a new mummy.
I'm really gonna get my wish?
Yeah, so long as you stay in my good flavour.
I didn't know she had a good flavour.
Guys! I'm gonna gets a mummy!
I bet she's gonna be clean and cuddly and nice.
- Sounds great, Chuckie.
- I hope she's not too clean.
Get off your derrieres and get this show on the road! Tout de suite!
I love the sound of panicked scurrying feet in the morning.
Don't you, Jean-Claude?
It moves me deeply, Madame.
That Reptar is a nuisance
He's a thorn in our side
The way things are going
Our village will be fried
That Stu Pickles!
I want that nincompoop inventor here within 24 hours, or another head will roll.
I'll take care of it personally.
Kira! Madame LaBouche wants her Pickles. Now!
Hello?
- Hello?
- Mr Pickles?
This is Kira Watanabe from EuroReptar.
Sorry to call so late, but the Reptar that you designed has broken down.
My boss is having a fit.
Reptar's a hit? That's great.
We need you to come to Paris on the next flight.
Paris. Oh yeah, the city of lights.
Madame kindly recommends that you...
Come with my family and friends?
Okey-dokey. Here...
HeLLo? Mr PickLes?
Are you stiLL there?
Hey, Dee, we're going to France.
Oh Stu, I'm too tired to dance.
France!
I'm going to France and you're not.
I already learned how to parsley-voo-francy.
Which, for your information, means "speak French".
No one likes a show-off, Susie.
We're headin' out, babies
There we go
Get your stubby legs moving
No time to pick your nose
We've got stuff to do
Let's take Spike too
We're on our way to France
Don't forget our underpants
We're heading out, babies
We're on our way
Here we go on a big exciting trip
We're heading up, up, up, up, up
Hang on to your diapies
Don't lose your bib
Get moving babies
I hope we're all packed
We don't know when we're gonna get back
No time to worry 'bout getting stinky
I hope you remember to pack your binky
We're taking off. Whee!
We're on our way to France, Paris
- How do you work this thing?
- I don't know.
I think I'm gonna scream.
Guess Robosnail thought he could fly.
Press a button, get a mummy!
I never saw a mummy button before.
Let's see what kind of mummy your button gots, Chuckie.
Hey, I wanted to press the button, Lillian!
You want the button, Phillip?
You can't handle the button!
Oh look, a toy that was already broken.
Unfortunately, the union forbids me from picking it up.
That's a job for your mummy.
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bread.
- Let's try again.
- No, let's not, Lillian.
I'll just wait for the Bobfather to bring her. Whenever that is.
Let's go ask her.
She just sneaked behind that curtain.
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Hi, Angelica!
For feet's sake! Can't you see this is the 'no dumb babies' section?
Sorry, but Chuckie was wondering when his new mummy was coming.
I'm...working on it.
And I almost had a good one, but I got so hungry
I had to sit down.
- Maybe you need a nap.
- Or cookies.
- Or cookies.
- And ice cream.
- Which happens to be in that kitchen!
- Be right back. Come on!
Where they going?
There's lots of neat stuff down here.
Like a hairy toothbrush, a 'tato chip.
Somebody must have losted their lunch.
Finster!
Look, Phillip, party hats.
Thanks a lot, diaper bags!
I smell a ripey diapie.
Come on, sweetie.
Time to get changed.
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum to make it all better
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum who will love me whatever
I want a mum to take my hand and make me feel like a holiday
A mum to tuck me in at night and chase the monsters away
I want a mum to read me stories and sing a lullaby
And if I have a bad dream to hold me when I cry
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum to make it all better
I want a mum that will last forever
I want a mum that will love me whatever
Forever
No one else is being picked up by a guy in a Reptar suit.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Welcome to Paris. I've been asked to take you directly to EuroReptarland.
Out of my way! The prettiest, smartest girl gets the front seat.
So why is she in such a hurry?
My tummy is all bubbaly.
Don't worry, Lil, I gots your baggie.
Lookie! Reptar's house!
Pokyo sure looks different on TB, huh?
Pokyo? Don't you know nothing?
This is Parrots!
You babies are as dumb here as you are at home.
Wee wee.
'Cept him.
He's speaking French already.
Welcome to EuroReptar.
Yeah, Reptarland!
Et voiLa!
Our Parisian pied-a-terre.
Pretty posh digs!
The beds are quite comfortable.
Yeah? Incoming!
So is the floor.
It's the most beautifullest potty
I ever seed.
I'm a diapie man myself.
A potty that squirts you back!
I don't know, you guys.
I squirt myself enough already.
We're off to the boutiques.
It's time to meet Ms LaBouche, the woman who made all this possible.
Shall we?
- It looks like you, me and the kids.
- Oui, oui, mon ami.
Come back!
Seems kind of odd to have a Japanese theme park in the middle of Paris.
It's a new century.
Just go with ""Le flLow"".
Bonjour. Welcome to EuroReptar.
And one of you must be Mr Pickles.
That would be moi. And this is my good friend Charles Finster.
- And this is my son, Chuckie.
- Hi, Chuckie. I like your bear.
What sweet children.
Is this your first time in Paris?
Well, France, yes. But I've been to Paris, Texas, a number of times.
Reptar's head!
Wonder if the Bobfather had anything to do with this.
Come on, Chuckie! It's a wadey pool!
- They look hungry.
- Must be lunchtime.
...just don't leave no fingerprints.
Where did those filthy little bookends come from?
What have you done to my priceless collection of koi fish?
I told you to get the piranha.
Call the dog catcher!
The exterminator! Do something!
Oui, Madame. Kira!
Come along, children.
Madame, Mr Pickles is here.
Oh, good. Send in the clown.
So, if it isn't the brilliant designer.
- I wouldn't say brilliant.
- Neither would l.
Let's take the babies to see the Princess Parade while they get better acquainted.
The kids would love that.
See this face?
I never want to make this face again!
Now get to work.
Sure. Mechanical expertise is my middle name.
Then your first name should be
"l have no".
Sorry to interrupt your episode, but it's the boss on the phone.
Monsieur Yamaguchi, so nice to see you.
I"m stepping down as president ofl Yamaguchi Industries.
I"ve begun a search flor my repLacement.
Splendid! I accept.
You are one ofl many under consideration.
But I have made millions for this company!
The candidate shouLd not be concerned onLy with money.
They must understand what it means to bring joy to chiLdren.
In flact, they themseLves must have the heart ofl a chiLd.
I must have one in a jar somewhere.
In fact, I'm engaged to a wonderful man with a baby thing all his own.
CongratuLations, Madame.
I Look florward to the wedding and seeing you with your new flamiLy.
We"LL discuss the promotion then.
Goodbye.
What now, Pinocchio?
Years of clawing my way to the top gone to waste.
Why am I not some child's tender mother?!
Why?! Why?! Why?!
Because you hate children and men find you to be a heartless shrew?
There has to be a spineless little man with a brat of his own out there.
Bonjour?
My chocolates are in her little
American stomach! Get them back!
- Open wide. Say, "aah".
- No, wait!
You have five seconds to come up with a reason why I should not lock you up for ever and ever.
Because I can stick five raisins up my nose, and sing real good and...
- For ever and ever is a long time!
- Tick tock...
I know where you can find a spiny little man with a brat of his own.
I think I just made a friend.
Isn't this neat, Chuckie?
There's something weird about a guy in a ponytail and a dress.
Golly, Kira, you're a natural.
I have a beautiful little girl to thank.
Kimi. She's almost two.
So's my Chuckie!
Not a girl, I mean, but you know...
Look! The Princess is coming.
Once upon a time there was a mighty dinosaur named Reptar.
Everyone ran away from him except the beautiful princess.
She was not afraid, because she could see that Reptar was not vicious.
He was lonely and unhappy.
So she promised to take care of him and keep him safe and loved for ever and ever.
For eber and eber...
My mummy says Mr Chuckie's dad is so desperate that he'll marry the first lady that plops the question.
Excellent! Now run along before you give me lice.
Hey! What do I get out of this deal?
- Why should I give you anything?
- I don't know...
I could accidentally tell someone why you want to marry Mr Chuckie's dad?
An extra scoop for cunning.
Tell Auntie Coco what you desire.
Let's see. Not much. Just my own float in the Reptarland parade with matching ponies and my own fashion show and to be the flower girl at your wedding.
And who said Americans are greedy?
I'll take care of it, Angelique.
Find out where our guests are dining tonight. Love is on the menu.
This place gots the biggest babies I ever sawed.
That's got to be one stinky diapie.
When I came to France,
I had dreams of bouiLLabaisse, crepe suzette, chicken cordon bLeu.
Well, I had dreams of eating with a fork. Pass the squid brains.
It's Karaoke time!
Well, do-re-mi!
Bad girl
Talkin' 'bout the sad girl
Bad girl
Talkin' 'bout the bad bad girl
- Eat all the cookies in plain sight
- Chewin'
- Pickin' on the dumb babies
- Always have to be right
They're so easy to trick and tease
'Cause they don't know a thing, baby
When I seed the magic sprinklies in my hand, I knowed she was the one.
You mean you want the Princess to be your new mummy?
Yup. She's everything
I've been wishin' for.
She's real nice, she loves Reptar.
And bestest of all, we could live happily forever after.
Stewart, what a surprise!
Everyone, this is Madame LaBouche.
MademoiseLLe.
Who is this devastatingly handsome man you are trying to hide from me?
That's my good friend Chas Finster.
Enchantee.
Bonsoir, MademoiseLLe.
Call me Coco.
And that adorable misproportioned ragamuffin must be your son.
Madame LaBouche!
- Hi, Kira.
- What?!
I'm sorry to interrupt, but these need your signature.
- Can you join us for dinner?
- You're much too busy, Kira.
That's too bad.
That must be Kimi!
- Who?
- My daughter.
Of course.
So, Kimi, do you and your mummy and daddy live in Reptarland?
Not exactly. It's just me and my mummy, and we live in Paris.
But I gets to come here all the time.
- You met the Princess?
- Sure. Lots of times.
She lives in that castle on that bowlcano and comes out between 'splosions.
Now we know where to find your new princess mum, Chuckie.
Chuckie?
Sorry, I stopped listening after 'splosions.
Would Kimi like to come to the park with me and the kids tomorrow?
What a coincidence! I planned to spend the day with her there myself.
- But, Madame! You never...
-...tire of taking care of Kimi.
So, it's a date!
It'll just be you and me and that adorable swarm of infants.
Wow! Robosnail!
I think I'm in love.
Hi, Robie.
Why didn't you follow my design?
I used paper clips and rubber bands for a reason!
I love their fries, but this is advanced robotics.
- It looks pretty complicated.
- Actually, it's not.
You just put on the gear, and anything you do, Reptar does.
It's so simple, a child could work it. Right, champ?
Sorry!
Did I say child? I meant young adult.
Bonjour, everyone!
- Ready to go, mon cheri?
- Let me just get Dilly settled.
And how is this precious gherkin today?
You're just a lawsuit waiting to happen, aren't you?
Mon cheri, I could listen to your fascinating health history all day.
I'll tell you about my sinus drainage when I get back from the restroom.
Would you mind holding Dil?
- Of course not.
- This should be good.
So, we meet again.
How delightful.
Kira! They're staring at me, and this child is leaking from the mouth!
- What do I do?
- Just smile and be nice.
Hello! You are not horrible.
Let go!
Do you know how much I paid for these lips?
I don't think Dil likes that lady too much.
Stop it, you dripping urchin!
I don't think she likes Dil too much, either.
She's not a very nice lady.
She's too pointy.
- He's crying. What do I do now?
- Comfort him. Gently bounce him.
According to Lipschitz,
Dilly just gave you a gift.
Why wouldn't he?
After all, children, they are my life!
I have that poem taped to the refrigerator!
- Pardon?
- "Children Are My Life", a classic.
"Dappled laughter, patting feet"...
"Joy and wonder, heaven's treat", it's one of my favourites!
"Joy and wonder, heaven's treat", it's one of my favourites.
Oh dear, they're getting fussy.
- Take them to Ooey Gooey World.
- Ooey Gooey World?
Ooey Gooey World! What a great idea!
Behind the couch is a Land ofl smudge
A home to wrappers, toys and fludge
Gummi bears, baLLs ofl hair...
Kira, remind me to eliminate whoever wrote this hideous song!
Look! No hands!
Look! It's so soft and squishiful.
Yeah, it's good stuff.
Let's stock up.
And eggsackly how am I opposed to find the Princess with my glasses all googlied up?
Here.
Thanks, I guess.
Look, the castle!
Let's go see that Princess, Chuckie!
They said to keep your hands and feet inside at all times.
- That didn't stop her!
- I'll show you the short cup!
Kimi, no! You guys!
- What are you waiting for?
- Great. Another Tommy.
Kimi! Madame, the babies are gone!
Finally. What? No!
Wait! Get them back before Wheezy finds out!
Security, we have an emergency situation!
Lifle is a party
Let"s get it started, get it started, get it started tonight
Lifle is a party
Get excited, you"re invited
There"s a party tonight
All this goo is giving me a diapie rash!

Lifle is a party
Let"s get excited, you"re invited
There"s a party tonight
Lifle is a party, oh yeah
I told you I knowed a short cup!
That was the longest short cup
I ever tooked.
Zere zey are!
- There's the Princess!
- lsn't she beautiful?
Oh, no! She's gone!
Go get her, Chuckie.
She's right inside.
You're right, Tommy.
I'm gonna do it.
But what if she doesn't like me?
Go ahead, Chuckie.
You'll never know unless you try.
Go ahead, Chuckie.
ALLez-hoop, little baby.
Ze babies have been apprehended.
On our way back to Ooey Gooey World.
At least we didn't have to walk back.
Look, mon cheri.
I think he likes me.
Oh, La! Ca va pas, non!
Chien! Va-t"en!
We're both lactose intolerant, love kids, and she finds bureaucrats fascinating.
- Who doesn't, you babe magnet!
- Just be careful, Charles.
- You shouldn't rush into anything.
- I won't, don't worry.
First I have to see how Coco and Chuckie get along.
He and I are a team, you know.
- Tommy?
- Yeah, Chuckie?
Do you think someone like me could ever learn to be brave
Iike you, my daddy and Reptar?
- Sure.
- But how, Tommy?
You could try thinking of something else next time you feel a-scared.
I tried that once, but I just thought of something scarier.
Why don't you try thinking about stuff that makes you feel good?
You mean like my Reptar nightlight or my Happy Hippo blankie or my favouritest moon rock?
Or... Or a new mummy?
Next time I see the Princess,
I'm gonna be brave.
Sweet dreams, Chuckie.
What's this? A gold inhaler?
Gee, most hotels just leave mints.
"Chad, you take my breath away."
"Forever yours, Coco."
"Chad"?

He makes bad guys say they"re sorry with the sight ofl his hand
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
- Here comes Chuckie Chan
MartiaL arts expert ofl ReptarLand
Go, Chuckie!
HeLLo?
Chuckie! You've got to get ready.
Angelica says we're gonna get to see the Princess in a show with Reptar.
- This could be your chance.
- I'm gonna meet the Princess?
I'm gonna meet the Princess!
Gee, Tommy, maybe I should take her a present.
Something real nice, so she knows how much I want her to be my mummy.
You want a princess to be your mum?
- What about Coco?
- Who?
Mr Chuckie's dad's girlfriend.
The Reptarland lady.
That lady's not the Princess.
I'm gonna get the real Princess for my mummy.
Listen up! I'm supposed to ride in my own parade on a float with pink tarnations and ponies and you better not mess it up for me!
I know somebody who needs a nap.
Viens ici. Viens ici.
Cheri, cheri, oui. C"est Ca.
Bon appetit, petit chiens.
The show's gonna start!
Who gots the cookies?
- Right here!
- Yum!
- Yeah, tasty.
- Looks like a booger.
Bonjour, mes amis.
Let me show you to your seats.
Thank you for the inhaler, Coco.
Whenever I wheeze, I'll think of you.
Who said
Americans are not romantic?
How is Coco's favourite boy?
He must be excited about the show.
Eating this goo is making my tummy bubbly.
I thought you could only do that in the bathtub.
Hi, Mr Chuckie's dad's girlfriend.
How's my float coming along?
We're waiting for the ponies.
I still get the float if Mr Chuckie's dad marries a princess and not you?
What?! Why do you ask?
'Cause... Well...
The Finster kid is planning on getting a princess for a mum.
Let's face it, lady, you're no princess.
Not a princess? Well!
- If the tiara fits, wear it.
- I smell trouble.
Oh, the Princess!
She's beautiful!
Reptar, he's no ordinary monster
He's a lizard with a heart of gold
Don't believe the lies you've been told
He's a fire-breathing child to me
I see sweetness when I look into those large yellow eyes
He's got a sensitive stare
One that can hypnotise
He may be rough on the outside
I hate it when they sing.
He's the kindest monster
I've ever met
See how nice his head stays on?
Reptar, I'll protect you
Reptar, I'll hold you
And I'll be there for you, Reptar and never go away
Reptar, I'll protect you
Reptar, I love you
I'll be there for you, Chuckie forever and a day
For eber and eber...
I'll be there for you
Wow, he's sharing Wawa!
Forever and a day!
Madame LaBouche?
- That lady's the Princess?
- She can't be!
Bravo!
Bravo! Isn't she talented?
Gosh, you guys, I think
Chuckie and I are both in love.
- Say brie!
- Brie!
Merci.
I'm delighted that you've met someone special here in Paris.
But aren't you rushing things?
Marriage is a big step.
Why wait, Deed?
They're two crazy kids in love.
My tummy's not been this happy in forever!
Looks like it's time for dessert.
Get us something good, Dilly.
Sure is gonna be great having my princess mummy.
- lsn't it?
- Of course it is, Chuckie.
Then how come I don't feel so good?
Well...
Maybe this thing is too tight.
Do you see those sticky fingers?
Jam-covered mouths?
Dirty little faces? Disinfect them!
What are you doing with that mangy thing? Give me that!
How dare you defy me!
You babies are in trouble now.
You are going to be mine, you will do things my way!
Jean-Claude, take those wretched dustmops away!
I will not have them ruining my wedding day!
- You babies will miss the wedding.
- And don't forget the big mouth.
My pleasure, Madame.
Take your hands off me, you big bully!
- I'm the flower girl!
- I feel your pain, Mademoiselle.
Unfortunately, you just got ""Le boot"".
But what about my float and my matching ponies?
- Madame LaBouche!
- Burn this hideous moth-eaten toy.
I never want to see it again.
Notre Dame, and move it.
You cannot go through with this.
- You don't love Chas or Chuckie.
- Which is which again?
I can no longer stand by and watch you destroy their lives.
I will tell Chas the truth, there's nothing you can do to stop me.
Except throw you out on the kerb.
Au revoir!
Looks like our little mouse is up for the chase. Step on it.
I'm sorry, guys.
If I didn't want a princess mummy so bad, we wouldn't be in this terrible place.
It's not so terrible.
I mean, at least we gots Reptar to keep us company.
I decided I don't want a princess mummy no more.
I don't need the magic and sparkly dust.
Alls I wants is a real mummy like you guys gots.
I want a mummy who smiles and talks nice to me and tucks me in at night and tells me stories.
And...who loves me.
Come on, Finster, don't cry.
I can't help it, Angelica.
I feel bad.
My daddy's marrying a lady who doesn't like me or my Wawa or my friends.
Actually, Finster, it's sort of my fault.
- What do you mean, Angelica?
- Let me see, where do I start?
Mr Yummyhoochie told the French lady you can't have joy without a heart.
She had one in a jar, but she needed a spiny man with a kid.
I said you wanted a princess mum, and she promised me a pony float, but she made it all up!
I helped that lady trick your daddy into marrying her!
You did? But...
Bad yucky! Bad!
Pipe down, Drooly!
Dilly's right! That's one of the worstest things you've ever done!
I know it was bad. Even for me.
Sometimes I just can't help myself.
I'm sorry, Chuckie.
You guys, I can't let that lady marry my daddy!
It's like you say, Tommy:
"A baby's got to do what a baby's got to do."
And we gots to stop that wedding!
How are you gonna do that, Chuckie?
Actually, I was hoping that you had an idea, Tommy.
Finally we get to see an authentic
Parisian landmark: Notre Dame.
You seen one church, you seen them all.
Wake me if you spot a hunchback.
I wonder where Jean-Claude is with the kids.
I can't start without my little guy.
What do you think you're doing?
Just practising tying shoes.
Children are so easily amused.
SacrebLeu!
Thank you for flying Air Angelica.
- I told you we could do it, Chuckie.
- If we could just find the door.
There's one.
Hey, you dumb babies, wait for me!
- Tommy, we forgetted Angelica.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
- We gots to go back.
- I don't know if I can, Tommy!
I barely know how to go forward.
Wait for me! Do you know how hard it is to run in a flower girl dress?
I'm opposed to be at that wedding!
Take me to the church!
Reptar's boogers look just like Angelica.
Hold on, Angelica!
Good catch, Chuckie!
This is not the parade I wanted!
Keep that Kira out until after the very last "l do"!
- Goodness! Here comes the bride!
- Without the Wedding March?
- Without the flower girl?
- Without Chuckie?
- Go, go, go! Start.
- Coco, Chuckie's not here yet.
- Darling, we'll tell him about it.
- I want to share this with my son.
That is what videotape is for.
Go ahead!
Bonjour, everyone.
I'd like to welcome the family and friends of Monsieur and Madame...
Let's begin!
- What you drawing, Kimi?
- It's a green thumb.
- It's a pickle with legs.
- It's Reptar.
- Right!
- No, I mean, it's really Reptar!
- How do we get out of here?
- I think it's that way.
No, that way. Or that way.
As long as you're sure.
Hiya, Reptar!
Kimi looks like a bug from here.
Let's pick her up!
I've never been on this ride before!
Hey, pipsqueak, get your own float!
Going somewhere, my reptilian friend?
You babies cannot hide from Jean-Claude, Super-Escargot!
Charles would like to recite a poem to his bride.
It's our favourite, remember?
I'll have you babies for lunch!
But not without the proper sauce.
- You want a piece of me, sluggy?
- Move over, pipsqueak!
I'll show you how it's done!
- Stop wobbling, Chuckie!
- Don't tell me, tell my feet.
My shell!
Stop, in the name of France!
Look, Chuckie!
I think they want us to stop.
So do l!
Okay then, don't stop.
"Squeaky giggles, wiggly toes"
"Teeny tiny button nose"
- "Rosy lips and soft wet kisses"
- What?!
Madame, the babies are on their way to the church.
What? You bumbling idiot, you disgust me!
Auntie sends her love.
Come on! Give it some gas!
No offence, but could somebody maybe open a window?
Okay. Hello, guys!
'Bout time you tinkleheads came to the rescue.
Tag! You're it!
Babies go round and round
I'll launch them from the ground
They will go flying now
Their mummies have a cow
Look, up in the sky!
- It's a nerd!
- It's a pain!
It's Angelica.
What's the big idea? Are you pottyheads trying to get rid of me?
That was the big idea.
Can you see the church?
There it is!
Chuckie, you're my hero.
Hang on, you guys.
I think I got a wedgie.
"Grasping fingers, dimpled chin"
"Pudgy bellies, velvet skin"
Enough poetry! Marry us now!
- Look, Chuckie, we're almost there!
- Yeah, there's the church.
Hello, my toddling tourists.
This is where your tour of Paris comes to an end!
We gots to beat Robosnail, or that mean lady's gonna be your mummy!
Over my dead potty!
En garde, babies!
Out of my way, slugface!
- You did it, Chuckie!
- Yeah, I did!
Now let's go save my daddy.
- For better or worse. Next!
- For richer or...
-...poorer! Sickness...
-...and in health.
Must we repeat everything?
Dear Lord, I skipped a section!
Hurry, Chuckie!
- Look what I found.
- Papie clips and bubber bands!
I'm coming, Daddy!
- Go, Chuckie, go!
- Hurry!
You can do it, Chuckie!
If anyone objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.
I gots to be brave.
I gots to be brave.
No!
Chuckie?
He said his first word.
He's talking!
No!
Chuckie! Chuckie!
It's okay, it's okay. Daddy's here.
And so is his new mummy.
Come here, little boy.
No! No! No! No!
Madame!
Our kidnapping plot has failed!
Ignore that unemployed fool.
Coco, the wedding is off. You are not the woman I thought you were.
Hey, lady! Looks like your plan to trick Mr Yummy-sushi didn't work!
Pretty flower girls should be seen, not heard.
I would like to hear what the little one has to say.
But listen good, 'cause I'm tired of telling this story.
That koo-koo lady told her boss she had a kid's heart in a jar, and she was gonna marry Mr Chuckie's daddy so she could be president.
- Listen, you traitor!
- Miss LaBouche, you are dismissed.
Dismissed?
But no one fires Coco LaBouche.
Coco LaBouche fires others!
Coco LaBouche is EuroReptar.
Off the gown, you revolting carpet mice!
Listen, lady! Nobody messes with my dumb babies 'cept me!
I see London, I see France!
I see Coco's underpants!
Take a picture! This is the last time you will see Coco or her underpants!
Bad dog! Bad dog!
Coco! Wait!
Go get him, Spike!
Looks like Spike found himself a little patootie.
Come here, my little pumpkin pies!
- Smile for the camera!
- What a holiday!
Chuckie? I have something that belongs to you.
Thank you, Kira.
Chas, I am so sorry. I wanted to tell you about Coco, but...
No, no, no, it's my fault, Kira.
I guess I got caught up in the romance of Paris.
I'm sorry, little guy.
"Oh, how my heart beats wild"
"each time I hold my precious child"
Wait! You know that poem?
It is my favourite.
And now the bride and groom wiLL cut the cake.
Be careful, Kira, the knife is very sharp.
Wasn't the wedding beautiful?
I'm glad I didn't have to return the toaster oven this time.
Let me put it this way, Bobfather.
We've been back home for a bunch of yesterdays, and you still haven't delivered the goods!
You gots your mummy wish, so what do I get, Snotfather?
Angelica, you show him no aspect!
You can't talk to him like...
Angelica...
You come to me on the day of my daddy's wedding to ask me for Cynthia Chateau and the matching ponies and a bunch of this stuff that I can't never get you.
There you are! Come on, the grown-ups are giving away all the cake!
Cake? Game over!
Wawa's a really nice bear.
Thanks. My old mummy gived it to me.
- Do you ever miss her?
- Sometimes.
But then I 'member that she's up there watching me from heaben.
I guess I'm lucky. I got two mummies to look after me now.
There's my little guy.
Kimi? Sweetheart?
May I have this dance?
Chuckie, would you like to dance with your new mummy?
Let me at that cake!
Hey, lady, ever hear of a thigh blaster?
Cynthia! That frosting flower has our names bitten all over it!
Who do you babies think you are?
I'm Tommy, and this is Lil...
- And she calls us dumb.
- Give me that cake right now!
- Good frow, Dilly.
- Prepare to meet your caker!
What you doing?
Hey, Susie!
Cakey!
Well, Tommy, I guess this is how it's gonna be from now on.
1964, a crucial moment in American history...
Lyndon Johnson is re-elected to the presidency by a landslide,
The New York Worl√îs Fair introduces a bright new future.
And after five scintillating years on the air...
Presto!
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show is abruptly cancelled.
- Cancelled?!
- Cancelled?!
Uh, sorry about that, boys.
A lothas changed in 35 years.
Velcro has replaced the zipper.
Sneakers have lights on them.
The Cold War is over.
And The Rocky and
Bullwinkle Show... is still cancelled.
Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, once the beloved home of Rocky and Bullwinkle, had been a thriving cartoon town.
Nowit was crippled by years of reruns.
The beautiful
Frostbite Falls Forest... decimated.
The once majestic falls above Veronica Lake...
...devastated.
While the narrator... tha√πs me... down on his luck and out of a job, was forced to move in with his mother where he was reduced to narrating the events of his own life.
"With the speed and dexterity astonishing in a woman of her advancing years,
Mother bastes the chicken, tosses the salad, and mashes the potatoes."
Oh, sonny, shut up!
Ow!
And in a little house at the top of a stump forest,
Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves, were forced to subsist on ever-diminishing residual checks from reruns of their oldshow.
World famous television stars whose adventures once took them all over the globe, now their exploits were just a memory.
Yes, it was a melancholy time indeed.
Rocky the flying squirrel hadn't flown in years.
Wha√πs the point?
I guess the world just doesn't need us anymore, Bullwinkle.
Say, where are you going?
All this exposition is wearing me out.
I'm going for a walk in the woods.
But, Bullwinkle, there aren't any woods anymore.
You don't have to tell me.
I'm the chairman of the Frostbite Falls Society for Wildlife Conversation.
You mean wildlife conservation.
What did I say?
You said,
"wildlife conversation."
Somebody's going to start talking about these things.
Yes, even their wordplay had become hackneyed and cheap.
No, it was always like this.
But times were just as tough half way across the drawing in the former Soviet satellite of Pottsylvania.
Where Rocky and Bullwinkle's archrivals,
Boris and Natasha, and their fearless leader...
Fearless Leader... were cooking up their latest scheme for taking over the world, when their plans were crushed by the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Wha√πs going on?
But, while the citizens of Pottsylvania rejoiced in their new found freedom...
Yay!
...Fearless Leaderand his cohorts went underground, where upon they embarked upona terrifying plan, a plan that would take them to a strange new land where the line between cartoon and reality is so thin, tha√πs i√πs hard to tell one from the other.
A place where with the right special effects, it might just be possible to break through... to the otherside!
It was a beautiful and smoggy day at Phony Pictures Studio, where an ambitious junior executive named Minnie Mogul was busy searching for a hot new script.
Too intelligent.
Too intelligent.
Hello, Minnie.
Holy mackerel!
Who areyou?
Three ofthe most terrifying villains in the history of children's television.
How do you do?
Nice to meetyou.
What do you want?
We were wondering, how would you like toproduce the Rocky andBullwinkle movie?
I'd love to.
I love it.
What is it?
I√πs classic American cartoon from early '60s.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, Minnie... we're stuck in reruns.
You're looking for a project.
Maybe we can help each other out.
This contractgives youallrights to The Rockyand
Bullwinkle Show.
All you have to do is sign right here andyour fiirst producing endeavor is as goodas gold.
Wha√πs the matter?
I can't sign a contract that will help three ruthless villains take over the world.
I just can't.
Why not!?
My pen's out ofink.
Use mine.
Okay.
And then through the miracle of computer-generated digital technology...
Minnie reached into the televisionset and signedthe contract.
But when she tried to pull the contractout... the expensive animated characters were instantly converted into evenmore expensive motionpicture stars.
Hey... how did that happen?
We're attached to the project.
But even though thepun was weak, the contract was ironclad.
And the three villains walked out of the studio and into the real world, while Minnie marched straight into the offiice of Phony Pictures' C.E.O.,
P. G. Biggershot.
But unfortunately for her, when she pitched her project to the powerful executive, she ran into an unexpected snag.
I don't like moose pictures.
So while Minnie's motion picture plans were stymied, back in Frostbite Falls,
Bullwinkle got a rare flash of inspiration.
It is kinda hot in here.
I've been inspiring for hours.
- Hey, where areyou going?
- I'm going to the White House, to talk to the president about the trees.
So Rocky and Bullwinkle set off on the road to Washington.
I don't know, Bullwinkle, it looks a little jammed.
Horsefeathers!
How bad could it be?
Rocky:
Look at all the red tape!
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm sure the president will send for us after all the letters
I wrote him.
Why, I bet any second now... or two... or three... or four... or two... or three... or four...
There the matter seemed destined to rest... until six months later, in Washington, D. C., when idealistic, warm hearted, and beautiful FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy, was summoned to the office of hard-boiled FBI director,
"Cappy" Von Trappment.
Agent Sympathy, given all your bungled assignments in the past,
I suppose you were wondering why I picked you for this mission.
Yes, sir.
Sympathy, allow me to be frank.
Thisjob requires the ideal FBI agent... someone tough, someone hard-bitten, someone emotionless.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir. Tough!
Hard-boiled! Unemotional!
Good.
Are you familiar with
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show?
Oh-hh!
I mean... ahem...
I've heard of it.
171/2 short minutes later...
Cappy:
Mr. President, this is a regular networkTV station.
Announcer:
PresidentSignoff, standing firm lyin the middle of the road.
But lookwhat happens when we switch to cable...
For the last six months, a cartoon villain from the old
Rocky and Bullwinkle Show named Fearless Leader has been buying up every single hour of cable programming in this country, forming asingle gigantic network called RBTV, or "Really Bad Television."
According to our sources, three days from now
Fearless Leader plans to broadcast TV shows so terrible, they'll turn anyone who watches them into a mindless zombie, incapable of independent thought.
Totally different than regular TV.
The RBTV broadcast starts at noon on Saturday.
By 8:00 that night,
Fearless Leaderwill have hypnotized enough viewers that he can go on the air and make the whole country vote for him as president.
Well... tha√πs no good...
No.
No, I mean...
I want to be president again.
Yes.
We all know that, sir.
Can't the Pentagon do something about this?
Any recommendations?
General Foods?
General Store?
General Admission?
We can't think ofanything,
Mr. President.
Can't the FBI do anything, Cappy?
We've already sent three crack agents to infii ltrate
RBTV...
They've disappeared.
I√πs almost as if there were a mole in the White House.
Tha√πs just ridiculous.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President, our only chance is to call on those two gallant heroes... who successfully foiled
Fearless Leader's schemes forworld conquest... backwhen he posed a threat in the 1960s.
If anyone can stop him, they can.
Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Rocky and Bullwinkle, sir.
Sympathy, you've got exactly 46 hours... to get Rocky and Bullwinkle to New York and shut down
Fearless Leader's broadcast.
Thank you, sir.
I won't fail.
Just be careful.
We've already lost three ofour best agents.
So good luck.
Oh, sir, just one thing...
How do I get Rocky and
Bullwinkle out ofreruns?
I don't know.
Fearless Leader and those other two got out somehow, didn't they?
Figure it out!
And, Sympathy, remember, we only care about results.
Within the hour, Karen was enroute to LosAngeles.
She was determined to give the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie the green light.
Rocky:
Wha√πs happening?
Cobs and shuckins, Rock!
The president must be beaming us to Washington!
Tha√πs not the president,
Bullwinkle.
Tha√πs agreenlight from Hollywood.
Those TV people mus√πve changed their minds.
Whoa!
Goodbye, sonny!
Narrator:
I'llbeback forhiatus, Ma!
Bullwinkle:
Hang on, Rocky!
Narrator:
Mama!
Oof!
Hokey smoke!
Areyou all right?
Yeah, but I think we're on the wrong show.
Look how well they drew that girl!
I√πs you.
I√πs really you!
Rocky... and Bull...
Bull...
- Bull...
- I believe the word... you're searching for is "winkle."
Bullwinkle.
Hey, what network areyou from?
I'm not from any network.
Agent Karen Sympathy, FBI.
Listen, you guys.
I've been sent here because...
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out ofhere fast.
Quick!
Le√πs go to a commercial!
What is this,
PBS?
Come on!
Le√πs go!
- Hold it right there, lady!
- Just a second!
Er... this way!
Hey, wait for me!
Ow!
Ow!
Bullwinkle, I don't think we're on television anymore.
Bullwinkle, can you rappel?
Sure! I've been repelling viewers foryears!
Never mind.
Get on my back.
I'll carry you down.
What about Rocky?
He's a flying squirrel.
He'll manage.
Er...
Bullwinkle:
Aah!
Ooh!
Hurry up, Rocky!
Fly down!
Just like old times.
Aaah!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Rocky! You okay?
Sure, just out ofpractice.
Moments later...
Agent Sympathy, can I ask you something personal?
Didyou watch ourshow?
Did I watch your show?
I lovedyour show!
- You did?
- Sure!
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to have adventures like you guys.
Tha√πs why
I joined the Bureau.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Really?
But that little girl doesn't exist anymore, Rocky.
They don't want her kind in the FBI.
I do exist! I do exist!
Let me out!
- There's something in your eye.
- No, there's not.
Ow!
All right, we need to get to New York and stop Fearless Leader's broadcast within 40 hours.
Rocky:
Waitaminute!
Why don't we take an airplane?
Because then it wouldn't be a road movie. Whee-ee!
Karen:
We don'tknow how, but Fearless
Leader, Boris and Natasha escaped from the cartoon world into the real world.
- So the president sent me to...
- Ofcourse!
The president got my letters about the trees!
What trees?
The Frostbite Falls Forest.
I knew he would respond.
- Look, we don't have time...
- Bullwinkle, this lady isn't here about the trees.
- She's from the FBI.
- FBI?
Didn't they take our show off the air?
- You mean the FCC.
- Didn't they like it either?
Look...
Can you believe we used to get paid for this routine?
Would you listen to me, please?
Finally, in a crisis of conscience,
Karen decided to tell... an untruth.
Okay, you're right.
The president sent me because he wants you to head... the... er...
Committee for Animated
Wildlife Preservation.
Ooh!
Okay?
Tha√πs not whatyou said before!
I was building up to it.
Gee, what kind ofmusic is that?
- Hip-hop.
- Okay... but I'd still like to know what kind ofmusic it is.
Tha√πs funny, the radio's off.
Oh, tha√πs just Bullwinkle.
His antlers pick up everything.
Bullwinkle, cover up your nose!
Okay. I was just gettin' jiggy with it.
They sure don't have music like that in Frostbite Falls.
Agent Sympathy, have things changed a lot in the last 35 years?
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
Karen:
Just you waitandsee.
As dawn broke over the City ofAngels, our valiant protagonists boldly rocketed toward the beckoning horizon toward the beckoning horizon of a strange new three-dimensional world, and the unimaginable perils that lay on the road ahead.
While on the otherside of the country, at Fearless Leader's headquarters,
Really Bad Television...
Fearless Leader:
My fellow Pottsylvanians, this is the quality control.
It will enhance or degrade the quality of what ever you run through it.
If the input show is bad enough, the quality control will exaggerate its mind-numbing properties... until the audience is completely hypnotized.
So, Badenov, these shows had better be terrible!
Don't worry,
Fearless Leader.
We are ready to test the machine.
Ready to test machine!
Put on your protective glasses!
Put on protective glasses!
Fearless Leader:
Badenov, proceed with the test!
Badenov, proceed with test!
Sometimes, i√πs not so easy being Fearless Leader.
Announcer:
Coming toyour TV, brand new exciting shows of the highest fun!
So, if adventure is your best ingredient, try the action with...
Clever Spies Crush the Enemy On Monday!
And the laughter never gets away... with Three Funny and Wacky
Spies & Their Horse,
Who Will Also Be a Spy.
It works!
Yeah!
Silence!
I√πs a message from my mole at the White House!
Moose and squirrel!
Moose and squirrel.
How many times in the past have they stood between me... and my dreams ofglory?
How many times have they foiled my plans... with their bungling interference?
Er... 28?
Quiet, idiot!
They must never reach
New York alive.
I want you to destroy them personally.
After 30 years of waiting, one more chance to crush moose and squirrel!
Oh, Fearless Leader, you are so good to us!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... until now!
What about in that movie,
RogerRabbit?
Shut up!
This is totally different!
There has never been a way to actually destroy a cartoon character... untilnow!
This is the computer degenerating imagery.
Show them, Sydney.
The "computer degenerating imagery" or C.D.I., as I like to call it, is totally user-friendly.
Just index the binary codes of the animated image you're gonna degenerate and the C.D.I. 'll dismantle the digital image on your film stock. 'Kay?
Bring in the test subject!
No, no!
Oh, this is what
I was afraid of.
I've been tricked!
Please, don't send me there.
Please don'tsendme there!
Now I know what happened to my friend Freddy the Ferret and those cute little bunnies...
Okay, now all you gotta do is type in an address and send him where all worthless cyberjunk ends up... the Internet!
Let go of my paw.
You broke my nail!
Aah!
So, tha√πs all there is to it.
Here's the manual and she's all yours.
I assumeyou're both computer literate?
We don't need computerweapon to kill moose and squirrel!
We've been trying to kill moose and squirrel for 35 years.
And we've never even come close.
Exactly.
Andso, armed with the C.D.I., and a truck load full of really silly cartoon weaponry,
Boris and Natasha set off to blast Rocky and Bullwinkle from the face of the Earth, and immediately got stuck in traffic.
While back at RBTV...
Dear Diary, soon the presidency will be mine.
As for this FBI agent,
Karen Sympathy,
I will deal with her the same way I dealt... with the three agents before her.
At the moment oftruth, she'll be plugged directly into the quality control current and turned into a helpless... mindless... vegetable.
Vegetable.
...A barrel ofmoney
Maybe we're ragged and funny
Bullwinkle:
But we'll travel along
Rocky:
Singing a song...
Karen:
Youknow, lusedtobe justlikeyouguys.
Cheerful, optimistic.
But if there's one thing
I learned in the FBI, i√πs that life is not a cartoon.
Whoa!
Look out!
Whoa!
Aah!
Out ofthe car!
Wha√πs the rush?
All right, I'm going,
I'm going!
Are you all right?
Ofcourse.
Guess I should have figured.
Boris:
Butnotforlong!
Hey, Rock.
They look kind offamiliar.
Yeah! Haven't we seen those two somewheres before?
Wha√πs with the cannon?
I√πs traditional!
Run!
Karen:
Boris Badenov!
I've seen you on TV.
You're a crooked, creepy, no-good rotten worm.
Oh, thank you.
You're slimy, sneaky, sleazy...
Please! You'll turn my pretty head.
You're asadisticspy anda... and a... really, really bad person!
Stop!
You're embarrassing me.
Where is boom?
Boris, darling, maybe i√πs time to update our technique.
Fearless Leader!
We're so happy you called!
Haveyou liquidated moose and squirrel?
Did you use the C.D. I?
Yes?
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Er...
Then who else are you talking to?
Are you talking to me?
Well, I'm the only one here... soyou must be talking to me... and you are lying!
Now catch moose and squirrel and next time use the C.D.I. On them!
Rocky:
ButKaren, we can'tride to therescuein astolen truck.
Yeah!
Why couldn'tyou steal something with bucket seats?
Bullwinkle!
Just kidding, Rock.
I√πsjust not right.
I√πs not right?
What are you talking about?
They wrecked our car!
They were trying to kill us!
But we're supposed to be the heroes.
Rocky, i√πs not 1964 anymore.
You're in the real world now.
Rocky's right, Karen.
And two rights don't make a wrong.
Bullwinkle, tha√πs not what you mean.
You mean two rights do make a wrong?
No!
I always thought two rights made a U-turn.
I don't know how much more ofthis I can take.
Well, le√πs fii nd out.
Two U-turns make a circle, two circles make a figure eight, two figure eights make a butterfly...
Look, all I want from you guys are results. Okay?
It was their first fight.
Andso, racked with internal conflicts, they made their way across the Great Divide and onto the great plains.
Bullwinkle:
Hey, look at that, Rock!
What a strange looking town!
Andwhile Bullwinkle ponderedthemodern world, severalstates back,
Boris andNatasha... were still tramping along theroad.
Ifonlywe had a helicopter.
Butsince they were in themiddle ofthe desert, there was obviously no chance whatsoever of finding a helicopter.
Boris...
Look!
Oh, damn!
Nevermind.
Natasha, quick.
Natasha:
Whatluck!
Great googly moogly!
Holy cow!
What the?
Hey, listen, gol-darn it!
Tha√πs the third time this month.
I'm sick and tired of shopping for helicopters.
Boy, ifl had a missile,
I'd blow your buns right out ofthe sky!
Yes, Boris and Natasha were back in business, but they had no way of discovering the route our heroes had taken...
Hey!
You can'tdo that!
Interstate 1, just outside Red Bait,
Oklahoma, darling.
- Cheaters.
- Thankyou!
And high above our unsuspecting heroes...
Natasha:
- Statepolice?
- Yes, ma'am?
This is FBI Agent
KarenSympathy...
All right,
I'm sorry I yelled.
Butyou don't understand.
I can't mess up this time.
"This time"?
Was there a last time?
Tell us about yourself, Karen.
Le√πsjust say
I've made... mistakes.
Look, I can't blow this one.
The whole world depends on it, and I can't do it withoutyour help.
Agent Sympathy, you can count on
Bullwinkle and me.
- We won't letyou down.
- No.
Thanks, you guys.
You know,
I'm glad Cappy picked me for this mission.
I think we're gonna make a great team.
- Huh?
- Oh, no.
And just as this sentimental moment had mercifully come to a close, our heroes were pulled over by two state troopers and a cameraman from the hit TV show, and a cameraman from the hit TV show,
Made Up Stories From the Real Highway Patrol.
Step out of the vehicle with your hands up, please!
I√πs okay, Officers,
I'm with the FBl...
Step out of the vehicle now!
Hey, Rock, your face is all blurry.
So's yours.
This truck matches the description... ofa vehicle reported stolen outside Red Bait, Oklahoma, just a couple ofhours ago.
You are under arrest for grand theft auto and for impersonating
FBI agent, Karen Sympathy.
I am FBI Agent
Karen Sympathy!
Like fun you are.
We both know Agent
Karen Sympathy... has a heavy
Pottsylvanian accent.
We heard her on the radio.
But she really is with the FBI!
Yeah, and I'm really john Goodman.
Le√πs get in the car.
Just one minute, Officer!
Wherever she goes, we go.
Yeah, tha√πs right.
We're a team!
Well, she's going off to the federal pen... to break rocks for the next fiiveyears.
Okay, well, don't forget to write.
I guess we could always appear atyour trial... as animated character witnesses!
No!
Rocky, Bullwinkle... i√πs your duty to get to New York by 8:00 PM tomorrow.
Rocky:
Karen, we can't leaveyounow.
Hey, I'm an FBI agent, remember?
I'll straighten this out, and catch up with you later.
But we've never been in the real world before!
Oh, you'll do great.
I know it.
Hey!
What about our faces?
Oh... sorry.
Wait, you can't just leave them on the side ofthe road like that.
They don't even know where they are.
Don't worry, ma'am.
They're animals.
They'll forage.
Bullwinkle:
C'mon, Rock, time's a-wastin'!
We owe it to Karen to see the president about the trees!
Trees?
Bullwinkle, we have to go to New York.
We don't have time to get to Washington!
This is no time to worry about getting the washing done.
Not "washing done."
Washing-ton!
A ton?!
Well, that is a lot oflaundry.
Bullwinkle, that joke just won't wash!
Well, you can't blame me for drying!
I think I'll fly ahead.
Butit was just no use.
Faced with the utter hopelessness of their predicament, the razor-sharp mind of Bullwinkle quickly formulated a daring plan.
Help! Help!
Somebody please help!
Help!
So on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
I thought you said we were in Oklahoma.
Would you like to narrate this movie?
No.
And so on they walked, two lone figures... making their way through a foreign and hostile live-action landscape.
They walked until their thumbs ached, but no one wanted to take a chance... ona 6'7" talking moose and a flying squirrel who couldn't fly.
I could f-fly if I had to!
Whoa!
Ow!
Kinda makes you feel discouraged.
Maybe we should be a little more aggressive.
Stop!
This movie's gettin' kind of...
Don't say it!
Two-dimensional.
Yes, things were beginning to look mighty dark... for our intrepid heroes...
It is gettin' kinda hard to see.
Bullwinkle, he means our situation.
Oh!
Wait a minute, boys, there's a couple of headlights.
I think i√πs...
Yes! Yes!
It was a couple of fresh-faced college students... named Martin and Lewis.
Come on, Rock!
I√πs a convertible!
All right, buckle up now, fellas.
Yeah, safety fii rst!
So where doyou boys go to school?
We're undergrads at Wossamotta U.
Rocky and Bullwinkle:
Wossamotta U!
My old alma mater!
Bullwinkle was a big football star at Wossamotta U.
- Quarter-buck!
- I thoughtyou looked familiar.
Where are you fellows coming from, anyway?
Thankyou!
We've been on the road, looking for America.
Lewis:
We've been looking forAmerica all day.
Martin:
We just can't find it.
Lewis:
Man, we're exhausted.
Bullwinkle:
Gee, fellas, perhaps you've been looking too hard.
Maybe America is all around you... in a thousand different beautiful manifestations.
Wouldn't you say so, young people?
Yeah, right.
Rocky, haven't we passed this town before?
Following ominously above them in the Midwestern sky,
Boris conceived a sinister plan.
Flying ahead to Wossamotta U... the two villains made asizable donation to the college... in Bullwinkle's name... prompting the college president to bestow upon Bullwinkle... an honorary moosters degree.
And when moose is at podium for acceptance speech,
I'll be on water tower with C.D.I.
There was only one problem...
Wossamotta U. Had no watertower.
Can't even find water fountain.
Their entire scheme seemed to be on the verge ofcollapse, until they hit upon an incredibly ingenious plan...
Together:
What?!
Dawn brokeat 6... 00AM.
The day of Fearless Leader's deadly broadcast... had finally arrived.
And there was Karen, toiling away under the watchful eyes ofa tall, blond, incredibly handsome,
Swedish-American prison guard named Ole.
Several states away, our hitchhiking heroes were doggedly making their way to New York, but little did theyknow they were driving... straight into Boris Badenov's sinister snare.
Heavens to Betsy!
The car is sticking its tongue out at me!
No, i√πs not.
I√πsjust a fax.
- A what?
- A fax!
Don't you guys know about faxes?
Yeah, don'tyou know about E-mail?
Sure. A fax is a little red critter... that steals geese and chickens.
Half of them are males and the other half are e-males.
No, i√πs a way of transmitting computer-generated information across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Well, I was close.
Lewis:
Oh, hey! I√πs for you.
Hokeysmoke, Bullwinkle!
Wossamotta U. Wants to give you an honorary degree.
And the ceremony is today!
Bullwinkle, we don't have time to go.
We've gotta get to New York!
Oh, woe is me!
I must have my degree!
I'll put it on the wall... for everyone tosee.
I guess if i√πs in the name of education...
Oh, it was a happy day at Wossamotta U., scene of Bullwinkle's football triumphs years ago.
Gee, it looks so different.
Everything's in the same place, but...
Well, Wossamotta U.'s been a live-action university since the show went into reruns back in '64.
I thought the buildings looked a lot more realistic.
Say, whereyou guys been all this time, huh?
Reruns.
You know tha√πs never gonna happen to us, right?
Well, anyway, there's still a lot... ofanti-cartoon feeling on campus these days.
Hokey smoke,
Bullwinkle!
I√πs some kind of demonstration.
What are the kids protesting these days?
Is it a civil rights march?
Not really...
Is it an anti-war rally?
No, not exactly.
Tell 'em, fellas.
I√πs a anti-moose march.
Yes, itseems that araging controversy had broken out among the students that very morning over the decision to give
Bullwinkle an honorary degree...
Gee, Bullwinkle,
I guess i√πs true.
You can't go home again.
Why, Rocky!
Whatever doyou mean?
Wossamotta U. Is home!
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Look! There's the animated freak now!
My fans!
Bullwinkle, these aren't fans.
This is an angry mob.
Butin the face of danger, our insipid hero... bravely made his way through the angry crowd.
You mean "intrepid hero," don'tyou?
No-oo...
Hundreds of miles away, in RedBait, Oklahoma, it was time for the prisoners' daily helping of disgusting slop.
ButKarenSympathy hadsucceededin making Ole, the simple-minded but incredibly handsome prison guard, fall madly in love with her.
Presently, Karen promisedto let him take her to the movies ifhe would help her break out of jail.
Could we hold hands in the movie theatre?
Of course we could, Ole.
But how would we eat our popcorn?
Well, we could eat our popcorn with one hand... and hold hands with the other.
But what ifl want a soda?
Look...
I'm sure we can work this out.
Good morning, students.
Today Wossamotta U.
Honors one of our own...
As the students vented their collective spleen at Bullwinkle,
RocketJ. Squirrel anxiously surveyed the raging crowd for signs of danger.
And suddenly, his sharp little eyes picked out the terrifying figure of Boris Badenov near the top of the watertower.
Hey! That guy's not a college student!
...that we present this honorary degree... to Bullwinkle J. Moose.
Good morning, children!
Today's lecture is about trees.
Bullwinkle, look out!
I√πs a trap!
ButRocky's voice couldn'tcarry overthestridentshouts ofthestudentbody.
With no alternative in sight,
Rocky tried one more time to summon up those faded aeronautical skills that had once made him a household name.
But just then, Boris managed to turn on the C.D.I.
Aha!
Yes, it looked like curtains for Bullwinkle...
Got to... save...
Bullwinkle!
Rocky:
Whoa!
"Bad command or fii le name.
Press any key to continue."
Which one is "any" key?
Rocky:
Look out!
Oh, no!
With asingle blow,
Rockysent the C.D.I.
Hurtling through thesky... where upon Boris single-mindedly reached out to catch the catapulted computer, forgetting as he did, one vitally important piece of information...
I ain't a cartoon no more.
Aahh!
Darling!
Ow!
Rocky:
Mayday!
You like me!
You really like me!
I guess I've lost the knack.
I'll never fly again.
Yes, without trees, where would the birdies live?
Forced to migrate to the cities, they would take jobs away from local pigeons.
Bullwinkle, they're listening!
Yes, Bullwinkle's speech was soinane... that thestudents couldn'tunderstand a wordhe was saying, andconsequently found nothing to object to.
So RockyandBullwinkle bade a fondfarewell to thehallowedwalls ofWossamotta U.
Don't forget to write, oldbuddy.
Bullwinkle, who are you talking to?
I don't know, but i√πs like talking to a wall.
I want to thank you fellas for bringing unity back to this troubled campus with your ludicrous remarks.
Martin and I would like to wish you guys luck against
Fearless Leader.
Yeah, and we would come help you guys, but... we don't wanna get hurt.
Yeah, man, we're not going near him.
Yeah, until we metyou guys, we almost totally lost faith in America.
Lewis:
Youknow, andwe lostfaith in our car.
I used to think our carwas really cool, but now i√πsjust always dirty.
And running low on gas.
Yeah, but since we met you guys, we love it again.
Yeah, the car is totally back.
So, as a gesture of our appreciation, we want you guys to have it.
Yeah, so, take the car.
Really?
I√πs yours.
Whoa!
Rocky:
Gee, fellas, thanks.
Yeah, thanks!
You do know how to drive, right?
Please!
What moose can't drive a automobile?
Rocky:
Oh, brother!
Never said I could drive it well.
Andjustas Rockyand
Bullwinkle got back on the road,
Boris and Natasha emerged from the student infiirmary, ready foraction.
Meanwhile, in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma...
Ole, why don't you go get the tickets, and I'll park the truck?
Gosh, Karen!
I've never had so much fun in my whole life.
I√πs like...
I√πs like there was always a little boy trapped... somewhere inside me, and now that I've met you,
I can finally let him out.
Please, two for the love movie.
There you go.
Tack.
Now, tha√πs not verynice.
Shut up.
As for Rocky and Bullwinkle, they were gently motoring along an Illinois interstate...
Hey, Rock, there's that same town again!
Areyou sure we're going the right way?
Bullwinkle, look out!
Whoa!
Rocky:
Sorry!
Bullwinkle, we're not going to Chicago!
We are now.
We are now.
As our heroes found themselves racing toward Chicago, little did they realize that only a few miles behind...
And back in Cow Tip,
Oklahoma, the only person in this movie more clueless than Bullwinkle faithfully waited for Karen to get back from parking his truck.
But our heroine was already passing through Indiana... where she was about tomake an ominous discovery.
Announcer:
For watching miserable people suffer in daytime, i√πs The Jenny Spy Show.
Are you sorry that you called her fat?
Yes! Yes!
Oh, no!
Not already!
Yes, Fearless Leader's hypnotic broadcast... was already underway.
Announcer:
You are watching premiere broadcast of RBTV.
Ah, I love my RBTV.
Fearless Leader!
The zombombidor shows that 30% of despised, decadent Americans are already total zombies!
Good!
I'll address the nation at exactly 8:00 PM
Eastern standard time.
Back at the RedBait
Prison Farm,
Karen's daring escape had not gone unnoticed.
Meanwhile on the bustling boulevards ofChicago,
Illinois,
Rocky and Bullwinkle were about to discover they had considerable troubles of their own.
There they are!
Motorist #1:
Hello!
Motorist #2:
Look out!
Smush them!
Duck!
Well, mercy me!
Excuse us!
Bullwinkle!
Mamma mia!
I√πs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
And you thought
I couldn't drive.
Bullwinkle!
Look out!
Hold her steady, poopsie.
Is time to say goodbye... to moose and squirrel.
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!
Hasta la vista, baby!
Boris:
Hey, poopsie... wha√πs happening?
I think you degenerated wrong special effect.
And while Rocky and Bullwinkle were making their getaway,
Boris and Natasha were still high above the Chicago streets, but with one small difference.
Boris and Natasha:
No helicopter.
And as luck would have it, a travelling mattress salesman just happened to be passing bybelow.
Matresses for sale!
How do I do it?
Volume!
Ouch. Oy.
Now tha√πs a soft mattress.
Temporarily outofdanger,
Rocky and Bullwinkle breathed a sigh of relief.
At the same time,
Boris and Natasha were forced to rent... an econoclass Chevy Metro from the Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company in order to resume the chase.
This slight delay gave our heroes the opportunity to effect a not her beautiful, if implausibly coincidental, reunion.
Whoa!
Whoops.
Hey, you lunatic!
Why don'tyou watch whereyou're...
Rocky!
Bullwinkle!
Karen!
Guys, I missed you so much.
I was so worried about you...
I didn't mean to...
I mean...
Good work,
Agents Rocky, Bullwinkle.
Lookit, we have six hours to get to New York.
- The Big Apple!
- Bullwinkle, please!
RBTV is already turning people into zombies.
But Karen, why aren't you injail?
Oh... er...
I was pardoned.
Freeze! Freeze!
Must be some kind of clerical error.
Officer:
You're under arrest.
Keep your hands high above your head!
Andjust to think...
I√πs the opening of moose season.
I√πs the opening of moose season.
Bailiff:
The states of California,
Arizona, NewMexico,
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio, versus KarenSympathy,
Rocket J. Squirrel and BullwinkleJ. Moose.
Judge Cameo presiding.
Who speaks for the defense?
BullwinkleJ. Moose, attorney at law.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
The defendants are charged with grand theft auto:
One count; breaking outofjail... one count, .
Impugning the character of a prison guard...
- Ooh!
- One count... reckless driving:
Four counts; talking to the audience...
- What?!
- Five counts, .
Criminally bad punning:
18 counts.
And three dukes and seven earls!
Make that 19.
Hey! Hey!
Counselor, call your first witness.
Yes, Your Honor.
As our first witness, the defense calls...
Karen Sympathy!
Oh, please, no.
Doyou, Karen Sympathy, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so helpyou God?
I do.
Ha!
A little late!
Oh!
Ms. Sympathy, isn't it true that when our convertible was destroyed in Monument Valley... the first thing you did was to steal... somebody else's truck?
Um...
That depends on how you legally defii ne the word "steal," because I believe...
And didn't you escape from prison... by telling that poor trusting prison guard that you would let him takeyou to the movies?
Well, I thought we might have time ifwe went to a matinee...
Isn't it true you never meant to see a film at all?!
Yes... i√πs true.
And didn't you tell
Rocky and me... that you got out of prison because you got a pardon?
Yes...
Yes...
I did do that!
Isn't it true you have no respect for the law or anything else?
No!
I was just trying to complete my mission!
I was only supposed to care about results!
And how come Rocky and me are still cartoons... and Boris and
Natasha aren't?
I don't know!
I didn't write the movie!
I'm only one ofthe characters!
Your witness, Counselor.
What are the teams again?
Bullwinkle, you're supposed to be the defense attorney.
You just proved we're guilty.
Yes, but now our consciences are clean, and the healing can begin.
Your Honor, i√πs time the court showed the world that no quarterwill be given to celebrity defendants.
- Celebrity?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you say celebrity?
Where are myglasses?
Oh, my Gawd!
Oh, my Gawd!
I√πs Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Oh, my God!
I love, I loveyour show!
Your Honor!
And you,
Mr. District Attorney,
I'd like to point something out to you in the penal code, section C, paragraph22.
"Celebrities are above the law."
This case is dismissed.
Moments later, our heroes were back on the road, with a mere three hours to get from Rabid Froth, Ohio to New York.
Three hours!
If only we had an airplane.
Hokey smoke!
Look!
Gosh!
Another wild coincidence.
Afternoon, folks.
Together:
Hi!
You got any planes left?
Well, le√πsjust kinda give a look-see...
I thinkwe have one left.
They've got tobehere somewhere, Boris, darling!
Keep the change!
Oh! This is gonna get my stepson a new trial.
Boris:
Bingo!
Natasha:
Goody! Goody!
Hey! Hey!
Y'all can't get in there.
She won't hold the weight!
You'll never reach the end ofthe runway.
The wings will come off.
Oh, God!
Oh, crap!
Boris pushed the little Metro for all it was worth...
We've got them, Boris, we've got them!
They've got us, Rocky, they've got us!
But at that very moment,
Boris and Natasha's rental agreement suddenly expired and they were immediately blockaded... by the dedicated agents ofthe
Cheapo Rent-A-Car Company.
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you can do it!
You old bird!
Come on!
Come on!
Although Boris and Natasha tried feverishly to complete the necessary paperwork...
Look!
It was too late.
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
That certainly was a close one.
Le√πs just hope this thing makes it all the way to New York.
Where did we go wrong, Boris?
We tried to blow them up.
We tried to have them arrested.
We tried to degenerate them.
We tried to smush them.
Yes, and we never even came close.
Oh, Boris, what are we doing, darling?
We been trying to catch moose and squirrel... ever since we first got drawn.
We tried to stab them, shoot them, smash them, smush them, crush them, bash them, mash them and they don't even know our names.
I'm tired ofall this, Boris.
I don't want to be spy no more.
Le√πs faceit, darling, we suck.
We can never catch moose and squirrel.
Boris... don't you want to have little Boris? Hmmm?
Little Natasha?
Wouldn't it be wonderful?
We could rent cottage by sea of Pottsylvania and teach them how to lie, and cheat and be rotten.
They would be worst children in world!
They'd be monsters.
It would be awful!
We could be so happy.
Telephone.
Hoboy.
Saved by bell!
Well, Badenov, did the C.D.I. Work?
Oh, it... it works all right!
So moose and squirrel are dead, then?
Well, is funny you should ask...
Yes, Fearless Leader!
We killed moose and squirrel!
Excellent!
Wait there for my private jet.
I want you both beside my side for the big broadcast.
- Natasha...
- Yes, darling?
Why did you tell him that?!
Because, Boris!
Moose and squirrel can't reach New York... by 8:00 PM in that little plane.
And what ifthey did?
So what?
How could they stop us now?
Practicallywhole country is zombifiied!
We've won, Boris!
We've won!
Just the way
I planned it!
On their way to New York, our heroes were soon to discover... that old Jeb was right.
She won't pull up, we're too heavy!
Rocky, can you fly Bullwinkle down?
I don't think so,
Karen.
He's a huge moose!
I beg your pardon!
I'm as trim as a young fawn!
You weigh 400 imaginary pounds!
Yeah, but i√πs all "mooscle."
Bullwinkle, can you fly an airplane?
What moose can't fly a aeroplane?
Rocky, you'll have to fly me down.
I can't do that, Karen.
I can't fly again!
I've lost the knack.
Bullwinkle, take the controls.
Okay.
Listen to me, Rocky.
- You can do this.
- I can't!
- I knowyou can do this.
- I just can't!
This is everything you taught me since I was a little kid.
All you have to do is believe in...
Rocky:
Karen!
Look out for the sign!
Aaah!
Here goes n-nothing!
Gotyou!
Rocky!
Uh-oh!
Together:
Bullwinkle!
Never said
I could fly it well.
See you in New York!
Hang on, Karen!
Hang on!
If I couldjust...
Rocky!
You're flying!
- You're flying!
- Yes, I am!
I certainly am.
Look at me!
I'm flying!
New York City, here we come!
Yahoo!
Yeah!
What a day, a year, a life it is!
You know
Well, you know you had it coming toyou
Now there's not a lot I can do
Dreamer
A stupid little dreamer
So now you putyour head in your hands, oh, no!
Whoo!
Boris, darling, how can you be so rotten?
When I stop moose and squirrel from saving country,
I don't kid around!
Karen looked upon the brave little squirrel with a new admiration.
However, she couldn't help but wonder, were they too late?
Soaringprecipitously overRockefellerCenter,
Karen and Rocky found the entire city of New York completely zombifiied.
Rocky, whatever you do, don't look at the screen!
Touching down outside RBTV, the daring duo was soon to discover that something else was terribly wrong.
Where's Bullwinkle?
The speech starts any minute!
I knew we shouldn't have lefthim.
Bullwinkle and I have never been apart in 35 years!
Quick, Rock, follow me.
Come, Natasha.
Follow me to Fearless Leader.
Go! Go!
Oh, Fearless Leader!
We're back!
You are so-oo happy to see us!
Well, Fearless Leader, he did it!
Boris Badenov is now offiicial number one killer... ofmoose and squirrel.
Excellent, my faithful minions!
Excellent!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail to the black and the blue!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Sneaky and crooked,
Through and through...
Down with the good guys,
Up with the boss,
Under the sign of the triple cross! Hey!
Hail, Pottsylvania!
Hail, hail, hail!
Thankyou, Fearless Leader!
Well, no one can stop my broadcast now!
FBI! Freeze!
No one but these chocolate-chewing idiots!
All right, I want anyone in this room... who's a Pottsylvanian spy to putyour hands up now!
That means you, too,
Fearless Leader!
Let me see your hands!
All right,
Agent Sympathy.
We don't want anybody to be hurt, now do we?
And whatever you're holding, drop it!
Gladly.
Don't look, Rocky, i√πs a trick.
I√πll turn you into a...
Rocky!
Rocky?
Oh-hh!
Peek-a-boopsie!
Fearless Leader:
Well, Agent Sympathy,
I have waited manyyears to face an enemy
I could respect... and I'm still waiting!
No, that was just a little joke.
But I'm afraid that you and this flying rodent have reached the end of the road.
Now get ready for a taste of
Pottsylvanian hospitability.
Tha√πs ability to put you in hospital, darling.
Andso, Rocky and Karen's onlyhope in the whole wide world was BullwinkleJ. Moose.
In other words, they didn'thave aprayer.
For Bullwinkle hadmanaged to miss New York altogether and had flown instead to Washington, D. C.
Gee, New York sure has changed a lot since my day.
They even moved the White House here.
Couldn't fii nd the brakes.
Well, as long as I'm here,
I might as well talk to the president about the trees!
Anybody home?
With onlymoments left before thebroadcast,
Fearless Leader hadreleasedRocky... from thegrip ofzombifiication sohe could... share.
As foryou, my friends, we have planned... something quite special.
We are hooking you directly into the quality control.
As soon as we g olive, the current will pass throughyourbrain and you will be turned intoahelpless, mindless vegetable.
But don't worry... it won'thurt.
At least, I never heard a complaint from the other vegetables.
I think your ecognize your three missing colleagues from the FBI?
Help us! Help!
I'm sorry, Rocky,
I've really done it this time.
Don't worry, Karen, you need the most faith when things look the most hopeless.
Thanks, Rocky.
And, Karen... this is pretty hopeless.
Look, we don't care what you do to us... just leave America alone!
Ah, America...
I'm proud of you, Karen.
Listen,
Fearless Leader:
If there's one thing this plucky squirrel has shown me, i√πs that you have to be who you are, no matter how much pressure there is to change!
Yay!
Anddespite this inspiring vindication ofKaren's innerchild,
Fearless Leader was unimpressed.
So Karen, Rocky, andthe entire nation... werepoisedon thebrink ofunimaginableperil.
And there is no one...
I said no one... who can stop me now!
Or, in fact, was there?
Soyou see,
Mr. President, all the trees in
Frostbite Falls are gone.
The birds have no place to put their things.
The children have no place to build their tree house.
I built them a stump house, but they say i√πs just not the same.
Please help when you have time.
But Gorka, the horse has swallowed the transmitter!
Not again!
They certainly enjoy theirTV at the White House.
Bullwinkle!
Don't watch!
Bullwinkle!
Oh, no!
Notyou, too!
Not a bad show, eh, Mr. President?
Yes, cheap as itmayseem... anditcertainly does seem cheap...
Bullwinkle's head was so thick that Fearless Leader's mind-numbing programming had absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.
Come here!
At least one thing hasn't changed!
TV's as good as ever!
Bullwinkle, allow me to be frank.
Okay, Frank, allow me to be
Bullwinkle.
I'm Cappy
Von Trappment, FBI.
I thoughtyou said your name was Frank.
- Shut up, Bullwinkle!
- Okay, Frank.
As we speak,
99% ofthe country is slobbering in front ofthe television.
- Wha√πs so strange about that?
- Listen to me!
We haven't heard from Karen,
I think she and Rocky... are in terrible danger.
You've got to get to New York!
I thought this was New York.
No, Bullwinkle, tha√πs Washington out there!
Tha√πs Washington!
Really?
Where's that little white wig he always wears?
I√πs no use.
Fearless Leader's speech starts in less than two minutes.
There's no way anyone could get there in time now.
Oh, butterballs!
If only there were some way of transmitting computer-generated animated characters across great distances in the blink of an eye.
Bullwinkle!
Tha√πs it!
It is?
Yes, i√πs our only chance!
We're gonna E-mail you to Karen in New York.
Well, okay, but don'tyou think... she'd rather get flowers?
Just shut up and hold on!
- Okay!
- One... two... three!
And squeezing into the scanner drive...
Bullwinkle found himself inside the presidential computer.
Butback atRBTV,
Fearless Leader's deadly countdown hadjustbegun.
And tha√πs when Bullwinkle snapped into action.
Look, Frank, solitaire.
I'm sorry, Bullwinkle, we don't have time for that!
With the coolagility ofajungle cat, our heroic moose grabbed the corners of the E-mail envelope and hung on for the ride ofhis life.
Eight, seven, si-i...
While time stood virtually still at RBTV,
Bullwinkle surfed the information super highway onhis way tosave the day.
Look, I'm hangin' four!
S-S-Surf's up, dude!
Hang on, Rocky!
I'm coming!
Bullwinkle found himself inside the RBTV computer...
Five...
Computer:
You've gotmail!
...with only seconds left to spare and no idea how to get out.
Four!
Bullwinkle, hurry up!
Click on something!
- "Mine sweeper"?
- Three...
Print! Print!
Andusing his brain,
Bullwinkle activated the 'print"icon... but was hein time?
One...
Fearless Leader!
My fellow Americans.
Say hello to Fearless Leader!
Hello-oo!
You are tired, America.
You are getting verysleepy.
Your mind is mush.
You need help.
Yes, America, you need me to run your country.
Youreallyneedme!
So vote forme asyourleader!
Vote for Fearless Leader!
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
I will vote for Fearless Leader.
Yes, America, I will bring order to the government.
This country will finally have a president you can respect.
Look, i√πs moose!
And no sooner had Bullwinkle emerged from the printer than his might yantlers momentarily jammed the quality control signal, reversing the vegetation process and bringing Karen and Rocky miraculously back to life.
Fearless Leader:
Yes, eversince I was a little sketch growing up in Pottsylvania,
I dreamed of ruling the world.
Fearless Leader, moose is loose!
Get them!
Go! Go!
Now, where were we?
Yes. I always knew
I would rule the world someday.
Tha√πs exactly whatl'm going to do.
Ouch!
So vote for Fearless Leader and make a little boy's dream come true.
We will vote for Fearless Leader.
Once I am elected, there will be an end to chaos.
There will be discipline.
Because I'm going to run this country... like a well-oiled machine...
I guess you could call me a neat freak, but we all have our little foibles...
That tingles!
...l'll be the president.
And with a single voice,
America will say...
Aaah!
Come on, Rock!
Wrap it all up!
Okay, Karen!
Bullwinkle, finish the speech!
Ahem...
Good evening, America.
Bullwinkle Moose here, saying...
Forgot my line.
Just tell 'em to turn off the TV and vote for whoever they want.
Turn off yourTV and vote for whoever you want!
And whoever wins the election, replant the forest in Frostbite Falls!
And sure enough, all across America,
RBTV viewers turned off their sets and faced the diffiicult question of who they actually wanted to vote for.
And the moment the machine had been destroyed, the three vegetables from the FBI immediately resumed their human form.
Thanks, Agent Sympathy.
Freed at last from
Fearless Leader's evil grasp, even the Pottsylvanian spies rejoiced.
Well, we won't be needing this anymore.
Yeah!
Oh, that reminds me!
I should E-mail that nice Frank an dthank him for his help.
Bullwinkle, no!
Ooh!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Andso the three villains were launchedup into the Internet, where they wouldbe heardfrom nomore.
Aaaaaugh!
And so it came to pass that the election took place as planned.
Yes, Rocky and Bullwinkle were stars once again.
RBTV changed its name from "Really Bad Television" to "Rocky and Bullwinkle
Television."
Wha√πs the difference?
Sir, there's one thing
I still don't understand.
Why did you pick me for this mission?
I mean, I'm clearly not FBI material.
FBI material is what gets thejob done, Ms. Sympathy.
If you needed an agent to work with a cartoon moose and squirrel, who would you send?
Someone tough, hard-boiled and cynical?
Or one ofthose soft, squishy, lovey-dovey, idealistic types?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir...
I think.
Affirmative.
Oh, by the way, good work.
Well, I really want to thank you guys for everything.
And I really...
Well, I really...
I'd really like to say that I thinkwe made a great team.
I'd really like to say... that I think we made a great team.
And if it hadn't been fo ryou,
I never would have learned...
And if it hadn't been for you,
I never would have learned...
That what you believe in when you're young, can still be true when you grow up.
Please don't make me say that.
You gotta say it!
Who is she talking to?
You got me, Rock.
That whatyou believe in when you'reyoung, can still be true when you grow up.
Anyway... thanks for the adventure.
So long.
Where areyou going?
Um... the movies.
Ofcourse!
The movies!
Hi. Um... sorry I'm late.
Oh... tha√πs okay.
And as Karen and Ole finally went to the movies, back in Frostbite Falls the president carried out the post-hypnotic suggestion to replant the animated trees.
Mama!
Sonny boy!
Meanwhile, all was well with our heroes.
Rocky was his oldself again...
Aw, I'll never forget our trip to New York to visit
President Washington!
Andso was Bullwinkle.
Yes, glad to be homein their revitalized little town,
Rocky the flying squirrel took a well-deserved joyride through the sunny skies of Frostbite Falls!
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
When you're feeling like you're...
Out of touch
All alone and lost
And drifting through the night
Just think back toyounger times
And you'll fii nd the light
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All thatyou believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you
If you're lookin' out
On stormy skies
And empty fiields
Afraid to give it one more try
See yourself above the clouds
Spread your wings and fly
See the world for a while
Through the eyes of a child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams you carry on lmagine what could be
If you just believed in you
When you were young
Who did you wanna be?
What is stopping you
From that dream?
This is whoyou are
Don't be afraid
The child in you will never fail
The power to believe is yours alone
No one can ever take that child away
See the world for a while
Through the eyes ofa child
You will see so much wonder
In your days
All that you believed
When you were small
Are still the dreams
That guide us all
The mirror shows you've grown
But reflects the child in you lfthere's one thing I could
Say toyou
It would be to try
To makeyour dream come true
You can do almost anything
If youjust believe...
If youjust believe...
If only, only, only
You believe...

{4373}{4464}NARRATOR: Our story begins|In difficult times.
{4465}{4524}England is threatened|with war
{4525}{4559}and many men have been asked
{4560}{4615}to leave their families|to protect their country.
{4642}{4706}I'll be home|before you know it. I promise.
{4707}{4784}Now, now. What's all this?
{4785}{4841}I want to go with you.
{4842}{4944}I need you here to take care|of your mom and Danny.

{5409}{5451}MAN: Drive off
{5783}{5854}NARRATOR: But the war|lasted much longer

{5909}{5970}Bombs fell from the sky

{9181}{9242}I don't like planes and bombs.
{9243}{9296}Is that what it is?
{9297}{9426}For a moment, it sounded|like cannons on a pirate ship.
{9427}{9497}[Gasps] You're right!
{9498}{9547}It's Captain Hook!
{9548}{9577}Uhh!
{9578}{9662}A hero! He's coming!

{10247}{10290}Yippee!
{10290}{10318}[Rustles]
{10319}{10398}Socks. Two of 'em.
{10399}{10503}Jane, dear, how very practical.
{10504}{10586}Got them a size large|so he can grow into them.
{10587}{10640}[Sighs]
{10641}{10742}Look, Danny, Pan and Hook, see?
{10743}{10770}[Wendy imitates Hook]|Curse you, Peter Pan!
{10771}{10802}Oh, Mother.
{10803}{10859}I want to hear|a Peter Pan story!

{10898}{10926}Shh! Nanatwo!
{10927}{10972}WENDY: All right, then.
{10973}{11065}How about the time|Peter and the Lost Boys...
{11066}{11164}captured Hook's ship|right from under his nose?
{11165}{11211}DANNY: Ooh That's a good one
{11212}{11276}WENDY: It was late|one misty evening
{11277}{11317}and Hook was sure once again...
{11318}{11362}that he'd found|Peter's hide out.
{11363}{11426}Hook and his blood thirsty crew|went ashore
{11427}{11494}leaving the Jolly Roger|unguarded.
{11495}{11608}That's when Peter Pan arrived
{11609}{11690}He and the Boys|slipped aboard
{11691}{11786}and there they found it--|Hook's remarkable treasure
{11787}{11820}DANNY: Wow
{11821}{11858}WENDY: Peter told|the Lost Boys they'd hide it
{11859}{11937}and Hook would have to hunt|them down to get it back.
{11937}{12020}It was all a great game|for Peter, and then
{12021}{12096}from out of the mist,|he was there--
{12097}{12137}the evil Captain Hook
{12138}{12212}A fierce and ferocious|sword fight was fast underway.
{12213}{12240}[Thunder]
{12241}{12293}Ha ha!
{12294}{12343}-[Gasps]|-[Whines]
{12344}{12404}-Give up, boy!|-Never!
{12405}{12433}WENDY: And at that moment
{12434}{12481}a shimmering magic|covered the ship.
{12482}{12518}DANNY: Tinker Bell
{12519}{12574}WENDY: Yes|And the Jolly Roger
{12575}{12612}Lifted into the sky
{12613}{12684}as Peter and the Boys|escaped with the treasure!
{12685}{12713}[Bonk]
{12713}{12754}[Sputters]
{12755}{12862}Aah! You've not seen|the end of me, Peter Pan!
{12863}{12958}HOOK: I'll get you for this|if it's the last thing I do!
{12959}{13001}WENDY: So you see, Danny
{13001}{13045}Hook will never win...
{13045}{13093}as long as there's faith...
{13094}{13156}trust, and pixie dust.
{13157}{13217}Poppycock!
{13217}{13273}Aah! Slow down,|you old codfish!
{13274}{13348}[Gasps] Oh, my notebook!
{13349}{13385}-[Thunk]|-Ow!
{13385}{13413}JANE: Daniel!
{13414}{13449}DANNY: Come on, Jane
{13449}{13490}We'll beat old Captain Hook|together!
{13491}{13589}Daniel, please.|I've no time for fun and games.
{13590}{13618}You used to.
{13619}{13689}You got to be the very first|Lost Girl ever.
{13689}{13727}That was a long time ago.
{13728}{13825}Yeah. Back when you were fun.|Nnhh!
{13826}{13871}Nnhh!
{14095}{14182}JANE: Honestly, Mother, I don't|know why you fill his head...
{14183}{14222}with those silly stories.
{14223}{14273}But they're not silly, Jane.|They're--
{14274}{14302}[Knock on door]
{14330}{14396}Take care of Danny, will you?
{14397}{14436}[Knocks]
{14437}{14484}Go on. I'll be right there.
{14603}{14633}Yes?
{14634}{14676}Evacuation, mum.
{14677}{14742}Your children are scheduled|on the morning train.
{14743}{14879}[Gasps] So soon?|But I haven't even told them.
{14880}{14959}The sooner the better,|if you ask me. Good night, mum.
{14960}{15055}WENDY: Yes. Uh...good night.
{15098}{15176}[Whines]
{15598}{15646}WENDY: Jane, dear.
{15647}{15736}Will you promise me something?
{15737}{15791}Promise you'll|watch over Danny...
{15792}{15819}whatever might happen.
{15820}{15850}What?
{15851}{15949}[Sigh] You and your brother|are going away for a while.
{15950}{16003}Away? Where?
{16004}{16092}WENDY: All the children are|being evacuated to the country.
{16093}{16142}It's so dangerous here...
{16143}{16191}but you'll be safe there,|both of you.
{16192}{16233}I'm not going!|I'm staying here!
{16234}{16299}WENDY: But dear,|an order has been issued.
{16300}{16335}Every child must go.
{16336}{16387}But Daddy said|that I'm supposed to--
{16388}{16455}I know, dear, but you|can take care of Danny.

The city of Townsville...
...is in some serious...
...serious, serious trouble!
Day after day...
...crime, lawlessness and evil are running rampant.
Its citizens have lost all hope.
They are utterly helpless and in desperate need of a true hero.
But who?
Is there no one who can help this forsaken town...
...and make it a better place?
Fear not, fair viewers, for there is a man, a man of science...
...a forward-thinking man, who looks back to a sweeter time...
... when there was spice to life, and everything was...nice.
I must profess, sir...
... this man holds the ingredients to Townsville 's salvation!
This man, known simply as:
The Professor.
Hi!
What's your name?
My name is Professor.
Professor Utonium. Hello!
Hello, Professor Utonium.
It's very nice to meet you.
It's very nice to meet you too.
-What are your names?.
-You made us, so shouldn't you name us?.
Okay. This is so cool!
Well, now, let's see.
Because of your directness and opening right up to me, I think I'll call you...
...Blossom.
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly!
That's it! You'll be my little...
...Bubbles.
So we have Blossom, Bubbles and...
...Buttercup. Because...
...it also begins with a B.
And together you are three perfect little g--
Gifts! Birthday! It's your birthday!
I should get gifts!
Wow! I wanted to make some kids
I could teach right from wrong...
...and in turn, maybe they'd do good for this town, and now I can!
All I gotta do is be a good parent.
Note to self:. Good parents don't leave kids alone.
Sugar, spice and everything nice.
Who knew that's what girls were made of!
I can't believe I made perfect girls!
Three normal little gi--
You should be careful when coming down the steps! You could get hurt.
Hey, are these for us?.
Thanks, Professor!
-Hey, thanks!
-Yes, Professor! Thank you.
This is the best gift ever...
...Dad.
Yes, it is.
Okay, girls, now watch me.
I think you missed a spot.
I'll go wash up, then we'll bring in the furniture.
Girls, wait! You should let me--
Help?.
This looks pretty good.
What do you think?.
-I think it's a little dark.
-I like it dark.
-Some windows might be nice.
-Yeah! I could see some windows.
Right about here.
I'll call a contractor tomor--
Or that works too.
Who's hungry?.
-Ready?.
-Ready!
Go!
Okay, girls. Time for--
Bed.
-Wake up, girls! Time for school.
-What's school?.
This is school.
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane...
...and this is where kids come to learn. See?.
You wanna play?.
Do you think they'll be okay?.
I'm new at this parenting thing, and I wanted to meet you...
...because they're really special.
I mean, really special...
...and I just want to make sure they'll be okay. Do you think they'll be okay?.
They'll be just fine, Professor.
We'll see you at noon.
Okay. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.
Okay, class. Take your seats.
-Can Blossom sit with us?.
-Can we sit with Bubbles?.
Can Buttercup sit here?.
The girls can sit right in the middle, so they'll be next to everyone.
Now, let's begin!
Hello, Professor.
Right on time.
Your girls are outside with the others.
Oh, no! Look at this mess.
I knew the girls would be a handful, but I'm so sorry.
What, this?.
This is what happens when you put 20 kids in one room.
Your girls were perfect.
Perfect, normal, well-behaved little girls.
-Nothing out of the ordinary?.
-No. Like what?.
-That was sweet!
-What's the point of this game, anyway?.
Tag! You're it!
Everyone's running from her like she's been infected!
-Maybe she's a freak.
-Yeah, and they hate her!
-You're it!
-Tag! You're it!
Oh, no! I've been affected!
-All right, what's going on here?.
-I've been affected!
You're not infected, it's just a game.
-lt is?.
-Yeah.
-A game?. Neat!
-Yeah, how do we play?.
Okay, look, it's very simple.
Bubbles, tag me.
Come on, it's okay.
All right, now I'm it.
And all you gots to do to play is tag someone else, and they're it.
By the way, you're it!
Awesome, I'm it! What do I do?.
What do I do?.
Just tag someone else, and they're it!
Time to put it into overdrive,
Bubbles!
Tag! You're it!
I'm gonna tag you guys now.
You missed us!
-Tag! You're it!
-No! No, I'm not!
Tag! You're it!
Tag!
Missed me!
No, you're it!
Tag!
I'm it?.
Tag!
Tag! Got you!
-Got you!
-Missed me!
Girls, no! Wait!
Can't catch me!
Oh, no!
Subway, huh?.
Tag. You're it.
There they--
Here she comes!
Suckers.
Tag. You're it.
You know, I've got a nice car.
-You're it.
-No, you're it!
Hey!
She'll never find us up here.
Do you hear something?.
Run!
Tag! You're both it!
Hey!
-We can't both be it.
-Why not?.
-Tag.
-What?. I can't be it twice!
-Why not?.
-Okay then.
Tag. Now you guys are it.
-Tag.
-Tags.
-Hey, no tag backs! Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-Tag!
-You're it!
-You're it!
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Mayor, the town is being destroyed by three girls with freakish powers.
This is a very serious situation.
What action should we take?.
-Tag, tag!
-Tag, tag, tag!
Don't worry. We have the situation under control.
-Oh, boy.
-I know, sir.
-Oh, boy.
-You tell them, Mayor.
Townsville will not stand for this.
Mayor?. Hello?.
City being destroyed?.
-Where are you going?.
-Oh, boy.
Mayor, where are you going?.
We're in a serious pickle.
Exactly.
Girls, no!
Hello.
Hello.
The usual, Cucor.
I have a fine vintage for you here.
Picked fresh today.
Oh, boy!
Girls, girls, are you okay?.
Tag! You're it, Professor!
Okay, girls. Girls, it's almost bedtime, okay?. Girls?.
Come on, Professor, you're it.
You gotta catch us.
Yes, I suppose I do, don't l?.
Got you, you little bunny.
Help! I got caughted!
Blossom, watch out!
You're the sole survivor!
No way, Professor!
You can't catch me.
Yes, I can because the game's over, and it's your bedtime.
Now come up here so we can catch you.
Well now, three little girls had a very busy day today, didn't they?.
Yeah, it was fun.
We met lots of kids.
-And we learned things.
-And we played tag!
I'm glad you had so much fun because tomorrow will be busy too.
Put your nighties on and get in bed.
We need to talk about something.
-Okay, everybody in?.
-Yep, what's up, Daddy-o?.
Well, it's your super powers.
I'm not sure how to say this...
...but I don't think you should use them in public anymore.
Why?.
Well, your powers are very special and unique...
...and although we have a lot of fun doing things in the house...
...out in Townsville, people don't understand how special you girls are.
And unfortunately, people often get scared or angry...
...when they don't understand something special or unique.
That's silly.
I think so too, but nonetheless, take it easy with the powers tomorrow.
Just give Townsville a little time to understand your specialness, okay?.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-People are nice. Things will be fine.
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up when school gets out, okay?.
Okay, but don't worry, Professor.
Things are gonna be fine.
Girls, we didn't know if you'd be joining us today.
Take your seats.
I'm sorry to say there won't be any recess for a while...
...due to all the reconstruction.
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have any lights or water for a while.
And a broken refrigerator means snack-time is out...
...so let's try to ignore all the workmen and noise and such...
...and get right to work, shall we?.
Girls, can you recite the alphabet for us?.
Girls?. ABCs?.
A, B, C, D.... E!
Hey, galldang it!
You done darn broke my board.
Flamdanggling consarglers.
F....
Almost time to pick up the girls.
Better motor.
That's him, boys!
He's in cahoots with the evil pickle-cart killers...
...cucumber crushers, vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers!
Why, it's not kosher! It's--
Let it go, Mayor. Let it go.
-Are these your babies?.
-Yes, but they were just playing.
They're really very good little girls.
And I need to pick them up from school.
I understand, sir...
...but we want you to come downtown with us to ask you a few questions.
You guys, my kids.
I really ought to pick them up.
I can't just leave them there...
...alone.
He's not coming. He hates us.
He totally hates us.
No, he probably just got held up, or maybe the car broke...
...or maybe he forgot...
...or maybe he hates us.
Come on, let's try and find our way home.
We're not supposed to use our powers.
Come on, girls.
The cause?
Three super powered little girls.
Should manufacturing super powered children be illegal?
A great travesty has befallen our beloved city.
I was easing the seat back when this atomic punk flies in with no warning.
The devastation? Devastating.
It should be illegal.
Used to be a time when you could buy an honest pickle.
They were lighting up the sky.
Estimated dollars in damages?
A whopping 25 million.
I'm offended just looking at them.
The kind that you can only find at a pickle cart.
Now Jamie's crying.
-Well, it seems that--
-Hatred is running rampant for--
-Those mutant, bug-eyed--
-Pickle-cart killing--
Freaks. Back to you, Linda.
They are little freaks, aren 't they?
With more on this subject is--
Get them out. We don't need them.
We don't need them.
We interrupt this program for a news flash.
Arrested in connection with the tag incident...
...was the scientist responsible for creating the girls, Professor Utonium.
Upon incarceration, the Professor made this statement:
Please, just let me go.
My girls, they need me.
They don't know I'm in jail.
What if they try to go home themselves?
They can't find their way if they don't fly.
Please, they're only little girls who are probably cold, scared...
...and maybe even lost.
Well, it' s official.
I have no idea where we are.
Well, I can't say it's been the best day.
But it probably couldn't get much worse.
Hey, it's okay. Maybe there's a box we can get in around back.
Come on.
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes.
What's the matter?.
Did somebody get lost?.
Wow, thanks!
Hey, wait! Come back.
Hey, guys, over here.
-Hi. What's your name?. I'm Blossom.
-Buttercup.
And I'm Bubbles.
Go away, please. Do not look at me.
We just wanted to thank you for saving us from those gangsters.
That was amazing with the trashcan lid.
It was all: swoosh, bang, splash, bam, boom.
Yeah, you rock.
No, please. I dare not listen...
...for I have been lashed by harsh tongues for too long.
Alas, my little ones, I do not rock.
For l, Jojo, am a monster.
You're not a monster.
Monsters are evil.
Anybody who would save us like you did is so not evil.
You're no monster, mister.
You're just really dirty.
Please. You're just trying to make me feel better.
But my pain is not for you to understand.
Besides, how could you?.
For you are pure and innocent and, most certainly, loved.
How could you know what it is to be cast out...
...into a world that only offers misery?.
How could you know what it's like for people to fear and despise you...
...for the very things that make you special...
...because you don't fit in, because you are...
...a freak?.!
Because...
...we're freaks too.
-What amazing powers!
-No, they're terrible.
-I bet everyone hates them.
-Yeah.
-And they hate you too.
-Yes.
I am in the same boat.
This brain is full of brilliant ideas.
But will anyone listen?. No.
Nothing in this gray matters.
So, what's the point?.
Jojo, don't be sad.
Our dad says people get angry when they don't understand...
...something special or unique.
If you just give people time, they'll start to understand your specialness.
Yeah. You just gotta believe in yourself.
If I construct my Help-the-town- and-make-it-a-better-place machine...
...people will come to understand my specialness?.
I'll do it, but I'll need your help.
Jump in, take this device into the volcano.
We need to harness the energy of the Earth's core for power.
-What are you talking about?.
-The plan.
-What plan?.
-Our plan.
-To do what?.
-To make the town better.
-What?.
-You know.
We will build the Help-the-town- and-make-it-a-better-place machine.
Everyone will see our special abilities are good. They will love us.
Remember?. It was your idea.
Oh, yeah. But use our powers?.
-Yes.
-No way.
-Come on.
-No.
We're never using our powers again.
Girls, don't be sad.
Your powers are great.
You just gotta believe in yourself.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.
-Now what do we do?.
-We construct the superstructure.
Look. Can't you see our plan is working?.
Our work is proceeding as planned.
At last, our lives will be better.
At last, we will be accepted.
At last, our greatest work is comple--
-Oops.
-What's wrong?.
Well...
...there is one last teeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy thing we still need.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.
Now what do we do?.
Well, because you've done so good...
...I've got a special surprise.
-Worthless.
-Lame.
-Stupid.
-Okay.
-Better.
-Almost.
Awesome!
Come, girls, our work is fin--
I mean, time to go.
But, Jojo....
-We haven't seen the gazelles.
-Or the crocodiles.
Or the unicorns. Just one unic--
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped this.
I thought the zoo kept all the animals in cages.
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady.
Don't listen, Bubbles.
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen.
All of you, deafen yourselves to their heartless words.
They do not know it is their saviors they are speaking to.
They are unaware your actions will have helped change their world forever.
Because we have helped the town and made it a better place.
-You think they'll be surprised?.
-Oh, yeah.
Will they still be mad at us for playing tag?.
No, they'll have forgotten all about that.
Will they love us?.
Yes.
-Really?.
-Would I lie to you?.
-I'm so excited!
-We'll show them!
Hey, where's--?.
Professor!
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible, terrible parent.
You must hate me for not picking you up from school, but it's not my fault.
It's this town. They've gone crazy.
It's like they've never seen kids playing before.
I knew your powers would take some getting used to. But jail?. Lawsuits?.
Angry mobs?. What's next?.
Don't worry, Professor. Things are gonna get better. We promise.
-Today's the day.
-Today's the day!
Today's the day!
-Today's--
-The day.
-What to wear?.
-What to wear?.
That's nice.
Professor, wake up! Wake up.
-Wake--
-Up. Wake up, my brothers.
-Wake up and seize the--
-Day!
-The day?.
-Yeah, the day when we--
Show Townsville just what our powers can really do.
What?.
We're gonna show Townsville just what our powers can really do.
-We did something really good.
-That's gonna really--
Help!
Well, we met this guy.
With powers like us.
Who was also hated by everybody.
But he had this great idea.
To help the town.
And make it a better place.
-That way the town would accept us.
-We did something to help.
So we used all our powers.
And abilities.
And his ideas.
-To help everybody.
-City of Townsville...
-It's gonna be so cool.
-...I'd like to take this moment...
-You're gonna be so proud.
-...to thank the little people...
Everyone's gonna love us.
...who helped to make this day a smashing success.
We did really goo--
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup,
I couldn't have done it without you.
-It's their fault!
-I knew they were no good!
What happened?.
This isn't making the town a better place.
Yes, it is, for me. The hobo formerly known as "Jojo" is no more.
From this day forward,
I shall be known as:
Mojo Jojo!
For too long, apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man.
Well, the time has come to oppose that thumb...
...and take hold of what is rightfully ours:
The world!
Professor, we didn't want this.
-Liars.
-Fibbers.
You've doomed us all.
Please, Professor.
Please believe us.
I don't know who to believe.
I thought you were good.
No!
Yeah! All right!
I rock!
I rock so hard.
For l, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...
...in my first, greatest and most brilliant plan ever.
And l, Mojo Jojo, shall be...
...king of the planet of the apes!
You shall be king?. Preposterous.
What?. How dare you.
For it is I who is the one most suited to be ruler.
Those are my clothes.
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme.
No Ojo. Mojo.
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence of the oppressive Orango-tank.
-Hold on.
-Oh, no!
-I shall get a grip on the situation.
-You better not.
As l, Rocko Socko, seize control and rule.
-Wait!
-l, Baboon Kaboom...
...with my Baboom-bot, will be the bomb.
And if you don't like it...
...you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs.
That's classy.
Gangway! For we, the Gogo Po-Trol...
...form a chain of command that will take hold of your world.
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad, for you are all wet behind the ears.
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out, for I don't give a--
Watch your mouth.
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching, symbolize chaotic calamity.
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos, shall rain on your parade because...
...we're the spit.
My name is Hacha Chacha
And here is my schpiel
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal
Spreading out bananas far and wide
And fixing up the folks
For a slippery slide
Pretty catchy.
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble...
...with a destructive force known as the tormato.
-Tormato?.
-Tormato.
-l, Killa Drilla.
-l, Bonzo Bango.
-l, Rolo Ovo.
-l, Cruncha Muncha.
-l, Wacko Smacko.
-l, Pappy Whappy.
No!
Do not continue with your ramblings.
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed.
I am the king, supreme leader and dictator.
Your plans are my plans because you made plans and my plan was to make you.
I plan to rule the planet, not to have my plans plan to stop me.
I am your creator, I am your king.
I am Mojo Jojo. Obey me!
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk.
He duped us.
He planned it all along, and we fell for it.
And now, everybody hates us even more.
What are you doing?.
What does it look like I'm doing?.
I'm building a house because now we have to live here.
-Live here?.
-Yeah, don't you see?.
This can be the bedroom, and this is my bed.
That can be your bed over there.
I don't wanna sleep on a rock!
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed
Bubbles into the school....
Look, she speaks.
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted on walking home...
...so we could run into the biggest liar in the universe!
We weren't allowed to use our powers, and you know it!
Look, it's Miss Goody-Goody.
We weren't gonna get people to stop hating us by breaking rules.
Yeah. And using our super powers...
...to make a Help-the-town-and- make-it-a-better-place machine...
...was following rules?.!
-I didn't see you putting up a fight.
-Well, you're gonna now.
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be in this stupid mess.
You stupid!
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup.
Because you know I'll kick your butt.
No, because I know--
Never mind.
I'm not fighting with you, and I'm not talking to you ever!
Well, prepare yourself for a long silence, girl...
...because we're gonna spend the rest of our lives here, thanks to you.
At least I got me a bed.
Blossom?. Buttercup?.
Do you hear that?.
No!
Blossom, what should we do?.
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take responsibility for our mistakes...
-...and go help everybody.
-lt sounds like they're hurting.
Who cares?.
-What do we do?.
-Nothing.
-Girls!
-Professor!
Professor! Professor! Professor!
Help!
Bubbles, wait!
-Good job, but we've gotta save--
-The baby!
Holy....
-Hey, what about--?.
-The dog!
-You'll be safe now.
-Here you go, miss.
-Thank you.
-Come on, Bubbles, let's--
Save those people.
Wait! This isn't my baby.
Good dog.
Can we find the Professor now, please?.
Oh, man!
Now stay!
Doggone it!
Okay. You should be safe here.
This is hopeless!
I know. There's too many monkeys.
What can we do?.
Get your hands off him, you darn dirty ape!
I didn't mean it!
It was an accident!
He wouldn't let go!
And the dog.
That stupid dog, and then the monkeys, and he--
I couldn't-- He couldn't--
Oh, man!
Buttercup!
You're a genius!
-I am?.
-She is?.
Yeah. The one way to stop the monkeys, save the town and find the Professor...
...is to use our powers to--
Better yet, watch!
-Wow!
-That was amaz-- Hey!
Gross! Cut it out.
Come on, girls. Let's put an end to this gorilla warfare.
Good one, Bubbles.
-Girls--
-Shut up! I was afraid of this.
They've returned and found out what their powers can really do.
Come. You will make a good "Power-proof" vest.
-None of those monkeys had Professor!
-Where could he be?.
Take a good guess!
Come on, girls! We've got one last monkey to get off our backs!
Not so fast...
...Mojo Jojo!
Look at the little heroes here to save their daddy!
No, girls! Save yourselves!
-Sorry, Professor!
-We can take this chump chimp down!
Nothing he can do can stop us!
That's better.
It's good you little freaks know when you're beaten.
Now if you'll excuse me, l, Mojo Jojo, have a town to take over!
I have a world to rule!
I have to seize control of an area...
...and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking!
Even if it means...
...taking extreme measures!
-You wouldn't!
-I would!
Professor!
Now I am more Mojo than before!
Now, as I was saying before
I was so rudely interrupted...
...I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...
...in my first, greatest and most brilliant plan ever!
And l, Mojo Jojo...
...shall be king!
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
Now let's get out of this town!
-It's no use.
-We already tried running away.
We have to fix the problem we helped start.
You said to give everyone time to understand our specialness.
Well, now it's time for everyone to understand. Especially Mojo!
Surrender now, and we'll go easy on you!
Down here!
Oh, my! You're actually trying to stop me?.
That's so cute!
-Try, nothing!
-We will stop you!
Who are you calling "cute"?.
Okay, let's play!
Buttercup!
-Good job, girls!
-That more Mojo is no more!
Girls!
Somebody's mad.
Look out!
Oh, no, look!
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down!
I have an idea. Come on!
-Do you think he's finished?.
-No, but you are!
Fools! You dare to challenge me?.
Attempt to defeat me?.
Try to destroy me?.!
I, who saved you from certain death?.
After all I've done for you, you betray me?.
And why?. For them?.
The ones who hated you....
Have forsaken you?.
Can't you see?. None of them will ever understand you as I can.
For we are kindred spirits, whose powers spring from the same source.
So, girls, do not make me destroy you.
For we are smarter, we are stronger!
We are invincible!
We have the power!
We are superior to them!
And we shall rule!
All we have to do is work together.
Girls, join me.
No!
We'd never join you, and it's because we are stronger.
-Because we are invincible.
-Because we have the power!
We have to protect them from you!
-It's you who has to be feared.
-Because you are a monster!
You are evil!
And you are...
...it!
Curses!
Girls, you were right!
We should stop Mojo, and I know how!
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X!
It'll do away with his powers!
I'm so sorry for doubting you. You are good little girls, and I love you!
We love you too!
-And we're really sorry.
-We messed up really bad.
-But we're ready, Professor.
-Ready?.
To take the Antidote X to get rid of our powers.
If it wasn't for them, none of this would have happened.
And maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls.
No!
Don't do that...
...because that was pretty cool, with the....
Girls, I think what the Mayor is trying to say is...
...we're sorry, and thank you.
Yes, that was super, just super!
-Amazing!
-Fantastic!
-Wonderful!
-Stupendous!
You rock!
Thank you.
That was awesome!
You were all flying and running!
And then, laser eyes!
Then, bam!
And then-- And then, bam, you punched that guy! Remember?.
Yeah, that was great.
You know, this town stinks.
And I was wondering if, maybe sometime...
...we could, like, call you to save the day or whatever.
Can we, Professor?.
Well, I don't know....
Okay, but only if it's before your bedtime.
Help!
Sugar, spice and everything nice.
These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl.
But Professor Utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix:
Chemical X.
Thus Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were born!
Using their ultra super powers, they've dedicated their lives...
...to fighting crime and the forces of evil.
And so for the very first time, the day is saved, thanks to:
The Powerpuff Girls!
Hey, that's a good name for them.
Powerpuff Girls, yeah!
I like that. Wonder if they will.
I'll run it by them.
Powerpuff Girls!
EMILY ELIZABETH: Clifford!
Clifford!
You and me
Tearing down the pavement
Racing to catch up with
No one else but
You and me
Hurry up, boy, we're gonna be late for the carnival.
Only going where we started being
You and me
You and me
You and I was me
You were you
That's just how it works
Let's go! Full speed ahead!
Sometimes, one and one makes one
Whoa!
And that's just what it does
That's just what it does
You and me
Splashing through the sunshine
Hiya, Clifford.
Laughing at another funnier than
You and me
You
And
Me
You and me
Hello, Mrs. Diller.
How are you and your little puffball,
Cleo, tonight?
Oh, you know us.
We just love the rides and the excitement of the carnival.
And you?
You know us guys.
We just love the food.
Right, T-Bone?
No kidding.
Come on!
I'll race you.
CLEO: Hiya, Clifford.
Hey, Cleo. Where's T-Bone?
Well, he was right behind me.
Whoo!
Hi, Clifford.
Hey, T.
You having a good time?
Yeah. This place is the best!
I know.
So what's next, guys?
The roller coaster?
How about the bungee drop?
No way.
I'm through with rides.
EMILY ELIZABETH: Come on,
Clifford.
Hey, how about this?
Well, at least nothing's moving.
Come on.
I can't wait.
CLEO: Shh.
It's starting.
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Larry Gablegobble.
And I'm proud to present to you the most amazing animals you'll ever see under one roof!
And now, I present to you a powerhouse pooch, a muscle-bound mutt, that ripped-up rover, Rodrigo, chihuahua of steel!
Don't let his size fool you, folks.
He may be small but this pup packs a punch.
Ooh.
Hah!
Are we having fun yet?
Okay, I'd like to present our next act, featuring another courageous creature.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for Dirk, the extreme dachshund.
Come on, people, let's give it up for that daredevil, Dirk.
And now, the grand finale.
I'm proud to present to you,
Dorothy, the daring cow, starring in High-Wire Heifer!
You can do this.
You've done it before.
Keep your head up, eyes on the sky, don't look down, don't look down, don't look down.
I ask you, is she not udderly cow-rageous?
This is so lame!
This is so...
Amazing!
And now, if that isn't daring enough,
I proudly introduce the star of our show,
Shackelford, the high-flying ferret!
Catch, Shackelford.
That's my girl, Dorothy, you're doing real good.
Just don't look down.
Oh. (GASPS)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Steady, girl, steady.
This acting is just brilliant!
Yah!
Whoa!
Steady.
Whoa!
Is this thing supposed to happen?
Dorothy, keep them closed!
Listen very carefully.
Shackelford.
Don't look down.
I got you, Dorothy.
Got you.
Uh-oh.
It's all right, everybody.
It's all under control, folks.
No need to panic.
Wow!
That was really...
Amazing!
They were unbelievable!
They were stupendous!
They were...
Really good.
You said it, T-Bone.
Hey, let's go back and get their autographs.
Or we could get them to sign something for us.
Great idea.
Hey, guys, you gave it a great try.
I'm proud of you.
Dirk, that ollie was wicked.
And, Rodrigo, your powerlift has potential.
Dorothy, your act brought down the house.
And you, Shackelford, the shining star of the show, you were the best.
Uh, Larry.
Back in a while, gang.
What do you think P.T. wants?
DOROTHY: He probably loved the show so much that he wants us to start doing two shows a night.
DIRK: Definitely.
P.T.: This is not a personal decision, Larry.
It's a business decision.
You know why I'm here.
So, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
Your show is failing.
All I'm asking for is a little more time, P.T.
Larry, we've had this conversation a hundred times.
If you take back the tent and this bus, where would my animals live?
You haven't made a dime in years.
My carnival is not a charity.
The show's gotten better.
That's not my point.
I know how much you care for them.
I know how much your animals need you.
I'm all they've got.
Larry, I just don't think
I can give you any more time.
All I need is three more weeks.
Three weeks?
What can you do in three weeks that you haven't done in three years?
Come here, I'll show you.
Watch this.
GEORGE: Introducing
Tummy Yummies
Pet Talent Contest.
I'm George Wolfsbottom,
CEO of the Tummy
Yummies Corporation and this is my daughter,
Madison.
Howdy, y'all.
We're looking for the most talented pets in the country.
Think your animal has the stuff?
My talent scouts might too.
You and your pet could win fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies.
So, keep an eye out for us.
And we'll keep an eye out for y'all.
That's it?
That's your plan?
Yeah. Pretty good, huh?
Larry, how do you even know this contest is for real?
It's been everywhere.
Check this out.
What's this?
It's a magazine ad.
The final competition is in three weeks.
I just know my animals can pull it off.
Three weeks? Okay.
Three weeks.
After that, the bus, the tent, everything goes back to me.
Understand?
Thanks, P.T., you're a real friend.
Or a real fool.
Fame, fortune, lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies.
Man, oh man, oh man, oh man, have I got news for you!
What's that?
This, my dear Dorothy, is our destiny.
Huh. Density. Cool.
It's a contest that we are going to win.
What kind of contest?
Oh, a contest for talented, unique, amazing animals.
Hey, like, that's us!
I'll bet our show can win it.
We are amazing, aren't we?
Totally.
With our current act, no.
Reality check, guys.
We need to think outside the cage.
We need something new, something that people have never seen before.
Are you with me?
We need something big.
Hey, I need something big,
I need something, something big.
Hello, there.
Please. Please, not me.
Please.
I'm just a ferret.
There's no good meat on me.
I don't wanna eat you.
No?
Then, what you want?
Just your autograph.
My what?
All of yours, if you don't mind.
You guys are incredible!
There you are.
What's your name?
Clifford.
And this is Cleo and T-Bone.
Love the show. Phenomenal!
Super-duper-rific!
CLEO: You must all lead such exciting lives.
Well, I don't think that we particularly...
Of course we do.
Between the shows, the travel, the crowds of adoring fans, yeah, it's pretty cool.
ALL: Wow!
How about you guys?
You in the biz?
Well, I don't like to brag or anything, but it's often been said that I do have, oh, you know, talent.
Yeah, yeah, I kind of picked up on that vibe.
So, would you all be interested in joining our cast?
What!
What!
You mean, be in your show?
That's just the beginning.
I'm talking about TV.
Have you guys ever heard of Tummy Yummies?
Oh, it's my favorite!
Well, check this out.
They're having a talent contest in three weeks.
The winners get fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies.
Wow.
I can go grab Larry right now and sign you up.
It's no problem.
Oh, thank you, but we could never...
Just pass up an offer like this.
Clifford,
T-Bone, doggy conference, outside, now please.
We'll be right back.
Guys, I think we should consider this.
What!
I'd never leave
Emily Elizabeth.
Or Sheriff Lewis.
And what about Mrs. Diller?
You'd really miss her.
Gee.
I hadn't thought about that.
It's just...
It all seems so exciting.
So, is there a problem?
Sorry, guys.
Sounds like fun.
We're sticking around here.
But thanks anyway.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey, man, wait.
Take this little souvenir with you.
And in case you change your mind, we'll be with P.T.'s carnival tomorrow night on the mainland.
Thanks.
Well, take care, you guys.
I'm sure we'll see you again next year.
DIRK: Okay.
Okay, sure thing.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
(SIGHING) Oh.
So close yet so far.
Good morning, Clifford.
How are you, boy?
Ready for breakfast?
I'll be down in a minute.
Okay, pal?
There you go, boy.
Tummy Yummies.
I'll be back with more.
Would you look at the size of that dog's breakfast.
Morning, Mom.
Morning, Dad.
Morning, sweetheart.
Morning, Clifford.
Good morning, Morris.
You know, I just don't know how you do it year after year.
Do what?
Feed that dog.
Look at him.
He's got one big appetite.
MR. HOWARD: Big? It's huge.
How much does he eat a year?
Well...
Clifford eats quite a lot.
I can't imagine trying to keep up with that appetite.
I'll bet he eats more in a week than all the pets on Birdwell
Island eat in a year.
MR. HOWARD: Well, yes, but...
He's like a bottomless pit.
Why, he'll eat you out of house and home.
Well, I wouldn't...
Feeding him must be a big problem.
MR. HOWARD: Problem?
Well, it isn't always easy.
MRS. HOWARD:
Well, that's for sure.
But we love Clifford.
He's one of the family.
MR. HOWARD: Clifford packs quite an appetite.
MR. BLEAKMAN: How much does he eat a year?
MRS. HOWARD: Clifford eats quite a lot.
MR. BLEAKMAN: Feeding him must be a big problem.
How can you afford to feed that dog?
He eats so much.
Problem?
Well, we mortgaged the house.
The winners get fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies.
That's it!
CLEO: Hey, Clifford, how's it going?
Hey, that ad.
Where's that ad from
Larry's Amazing Animals?
Over there. Why?
What do you need that for?
I'm a problem.
Mr. Bleakman said so.
I eat too much and they can't afford to feed me.
What?
Maybe you misunderstood them.
I'm always misunderstanding things.
You don't say.
No, T-Bone, I heard them loud and clear.
I'm gonna join Larry's show and win that
Tummy Yummies contest.
And leave Emily Elizabeth?
Not forever.
Just long enough to win a lifetime supply of food.
Clifford, are you sure?
I mean, maybe if you waited...
I can't wait, T-Bone.
First thing, tomorrow morning,
I'm leaving.
Goodbye, you guys.
Bye, big guy.
Bye.
Hey, boy.
You get a good night's sleep, okay?
I love you, Clifford.
One more?
Okay.
You're the best, Clifford.
You've gotta get lost if you wanna get found
Gotta wind up to get unwound
Things only look up from down below
And I...
Goodbye, Emily Elizabeth.
I'll come back to you soon.
I promise.
It only gets better after it gets worse
Happy ever after needs a scary part first
You've got to fall off to get back on
And I can't come home until I'm gone
Hey, not so fast, big guy.
We're not gonna let you go on a great big adventure without us.
You guys would do that for me?
Are you kidding?
We'd do anything for you, Clifford.
Yeah.
And, anyway, we'll be back soon. Right?
Faster than you can say Tummy Yummies.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Absolutely.
Positively.
Come on, let's get a move on!
My fans are waiting.
I call front.
Hey, hey! This is my spot.
You were in front the last time.
Was not!
Was too.
Was not! Was not!
Too. Was too!
Was not!
Okay, okay.
We'll take turns.
My turn first!
Good morning, Cliff...
Clifford?
Hmm.
I wonder where he is?
What in the world?
Oh, my.
BOTH: Whoa!
Music, coming up.
Today's weather calls for another sunny day.
Not a cloud in the sky.
Temperatures expected...
What's the matter with those guys?
They look scared.
Maybe they saw a shark in the water.
(GASPS) And to think, we were just out there.
Ooh.
Wait, look at all the cars.
Wow.
All the people.
Huh?
WOMAN 1: That's the biggest dog I've ever seen.
MAN: That's a dog?
WOMAN 2: Is it a dog?
Mary, will you get me the Chief?
MAN: Watch it, watch it.
These people are acting really strange.
What's up with them?
I think it's us, that's up with them.
Huh?
I think they're scared.
Of what?
Of me?
I'm afraid so, big guy.
But once they get to know me...
No time for that now, come on.
Now what?
We need a plan.
Okay, who has a plan?
Hello, I do, of course.
Are you sure?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Well...
Don't answer that.
Stick close and follow me.
Ready, guys?
Ready.
Whew!
Well, that worked well, don't you think?
What was the plan again?
Any luck?
Nope.
Did you go by the lighthouse?
Check.
The park?
Double check.
I talked to Mrs.
Diller and Sheriff Lewis, they said Cleo and
T-Bone are missing too.
Weird.
It's like they're not even on the island anymore.
I think you're right.
Look.
Where do you think he went?
I don't know.
But I do know, he's with Cleo and T-Bone.
I don't get it.
Why would they leave?
I wish I knew.
Can we rest for a minute?
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry guys, it's just that if we don't catch up to the Carnival tonight, we'll never find them.
You know, a catnap wouldn't hurt.
Can dogs take catnaps?
We can't rest here.
I gotta stay outta sight.
Hey, why don't we stop over there, where that carnival is shutting down?
BOTH: Carnival!
Over there, see.
Woo-hoo!
Guys, what about me?
Wait, I found it first.
This thing won't shut.
Okay, gang. Plan number B, we gotta pack all over again.
Holy cow, you guys are back.
Yeah.
Amigos!
We never thought we'd find you guys.
So, bitten by the showbiz bug after all, huh?
Uh-huh?
Yes.
I knew it, no one in their right mind can resist the glow of the spotlight. (GASPS)
You, you...
Uh-oh.
What is it?
You've got tags.
Larry will never take you if you already have a family.
We're all strays.
He only takes in strays.
What? These old things?
They're from, like, five owners ago.
We've had these for years.
Well, I just got mine last...
Zip it.
Oh!
These old things?
We just keep 'em to fool the dog catcher.
Yeah, yeah, smart.
Okay now, don't move.
I'll go get Larry.
Okay, fantË∞©stico.
Finally, a girlfriend.
I'm so excited.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
We'll make friendship bracelets and trade lip gloss.
And bake snickerdoodles.
Cool.
Okay, okay, Shack.
Show me what's so important.
I don't believe it.
He's huge.
We could sure use a big red dog at our show, eh, Shack?
Hmm.
Need a home, guys?
Well, hey, welcome to the family.
Whoa.
And, Shackelford, good job, pal.
You always come through for us.
And that loveable, little mutt, went on to fame and fortune as the star of his own movie.
Benji.
The first of four feature films as well as subsequent TV movies and even his own television series.
I'm such a softy for that story.
No one knew his craft like Benji.
He's the reason
I'm in the business.
Isn't showbiz great?
Huh? Oh, yeah, really great.
The best.
It's a good thing we're having such a good time and we're not homesick or anything.
Yeah, right. Right.
Hmm.
Talent contest.
Tummy Yummies?
Mom!
We put the aah in amazing
Aah
The A in amazing
The A in amazing
The z-z-zing in amazing
We're stupendous
We're stupendous
We're tremendous
We're tremendous, too
We got talent
We've got talent
We've got tricks
We've got tricks
So, get your tickets and get your kicks
Come on, step right up, get your kicks
Larry's Amazing Animals
Larry's Amazing Animals
Well, looks like our work here is done.
Now, I've got some tickets to sell, gang.
We're gonna pack 'em in tonight.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Is it our turn yet, huh, huh?
No, no, you guys come in at the end.
LARRY: Star of our show...
That's my cue.
You three, just watch and learn.
The famous, irrepressible, sensational Shackelford.
The high-flying ferret.
Oh, please, let this go well.
LARRY: That's Shackelford
All right, Dorothy, you're doing real good.
Gravity is your friend.
Steady.
Watch it, watch it.
DOROTHY: My fault!
Gotcha.
Oh, no.
Let's go.
CHILD: What's that?
Oh!
MAN: Hey!
Cool, dude.
Why, ladies and gentlemen, it's Big Red to the rescue.
BOY: Awesome!
Hmm. Beginner's luck.
Yay!
Cool, man, that was like, way rad, Big Red.
That's our Clifford.
The greatest.
Oh. You're my hero, Clifford.
Thank you.
Aw, thanks, I was just helping, that's all.
Hey, well done,
Clifford, my man.
That was one lucky break.
We were all a tail wag away from disaster.
Good stuff, good stuff.
But, let's not let that happen again, right team?
We can't depend on an accident to save the show.
So, Dorothy, Dorothy,
Dorothy. You know, you're my girl, right?
And I now that soon, you are going to really master this act that we've been over a hundred times.
You just need to practice and not look down.
Don't look down, don't look down.
Right, Shackelford.
And you, Dirk, ever heard of too much of a good thing?
Well, now you have.
Gotta ease up on the throttle.
Does that thing have a downshift?
But bro, I got a need for speed.
You need not end up in the audience, every show.
What about me Shackelford, how did I do?
Oh! You, my little amigo, need to focus on keeping those weights up, up, up.
Instead of down, down, down.
You almost flattened me like a tortilla.
PerdË¥∏n.
CLIFFORD: Shackelford?
Did we do okay?
Okay? Yes.
You did okay.
We all did okay.
But, "Okay" is not enough.
"Okay" does not dazzle.
"Okay" does not delight.
And "Okay" does not, I repeat, does not win contests!
We need to be...
Fantastic!
That was truly amazing.
That was our best show ever.
Big Red, you stole the show.
If you guys keep up what you did out there tonight, we'll be sure to make it into that contest.
And thanks to Big Red,
I bet we can win it!
Thanks, pal.
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have Big Red.
Do we get the Tummy
Yummies soon?
Hello, I'm calling to report three lost dogs.
The first one is extremely friendly, red, and he's as big as a house.
No, I am not crazy!
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I know we will.
Thanks, Mr. B.
Help!
Hi, Dorothy.
Uh-oh.
Sorry, I didn't mean to surprise you.
Don't worry, it's not the first time this cow's been tipped.
You sure you're all right?
Oh, I'm just...
I'm...
Can I tell you a secret?
Sure.
I have this little problem with heights.
Really, you do?
Well, I know it's hard to believe.
I mean, I make it look so easy out there, but it is not.
I mean, I get scared when I'm up there, and then I mess up, and now I'm all worried that I'm going to ruin our chances to win the big contest and everyone will be so disappointed, and I just feel awful.
Well, back home, whenever Emily...
Who?
Whenever a friend of mine felt bad,
I'd give her a ride.
A ride always helped make her feel better.
A ride? Really?
Well, can I try?
Sure, hop on.
Can I trust you with my secret
Hold it tightly in your hand
Don't go showing anybody
I don't think they'd understand
You never dropped anybody, right, Clifford?
Get my head out of the sand
Hey.
Well, I guess I'm kind of scared
I knew that you would understand
And if my secret's safe with you
I will feel safe with you
This is great!
See, I thought it might help you feel better.
This is exactly what I needed.
I'm really high up and I'm not scared.
I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!
I'm not scared anymore
DOROTHY: Moo!
Holy...
Cow!
Moo!
Big Red, first you saved the show and now you helped Dorothy.
You really are amazing.
Oh, it's a big time
Tremendously enormous
It's a grand time
Enormously humongous
It's a huge time
I'm saying sizable
A big time for making it big
Oh, it's a big time
Volcanically gigantic
Oh, it's a great time
Gigantically titanic
It's a large time
It's bigalicious
It's a big time for making it big
So put away your little plans
'Cause now we're living large
The times too tall for big and small
We're large and we're in charge
Oh, it's a big time
The opposite of tiny
It's a grand time
Not talking teeny-weeny
It's a huge time
Ain't pocket-size it's a big time for making it big
So put away your baby boots
It's time for bigger shoes
Take a stride that's double wide
To 10-foot headline news
Oh, it's a...
Mammoth
Monumental
Massive
It's a big time for making it big
It's a big time for making it big
It's a big time for making it big
There, that about does it.
Hey, guys, come here.
Dorothy, Shackelford, come over and have a look.
Ta-da!
Isn't it great?
Pretty good, don't you think?
Thanks to all of you, this show has become better than I ever imagined.
Who'd have thought we'd come this far, this fast?
I guess you knew though, huh?
That big dog makes a big difference.
Mr. Gablebottom?
That's Gablegobble.
Gable like Clark,
Gobble like turkey.
Congratulations.
I'm a representative of Mr. George C. Wolfsbottom,
CEO of the Tummy
Yummies Corporation.
You've been chosen to compete in our National
Animal Talent Contest.
Where? When is it?
Tomorrow night, Shangri-Large.
This is it, you guys.
This is the big...
This is the big break we've been waiting for.
We're gonna make it.
I've got to call P.T.
Where's Shackelford?
He's got to hear this.
Hey, Shackelford.
Hey! You missed the big news.
Always with the big.
A guy from Tummy Yummies told Larry we get to perform in the contest tomorrow night.
Fame, fortune and
Tummy Yummies, here we come.
Oh, yay!
What's the matter?
Aren't you happy?
Happy? Oh, I'm happy for you.
After all, isn't this what it's all about?
You, you and your Tummy Yummies?
Yeah, that's exactly what I've been hoping for.
You know,
I wonder what's bigger.
You or your stomach.
What do you mean?
You heard me loud and clear.
Tummy Yummies! Tummy Yummies!
Now do I get my Tummy Yummies?
Where are my Tummy Yummies?
Am I there yet?
I need my Tummy Yummies!
Sound familiar?
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, pal.
I'm the one who's sorry.
I should have never asked you to join up with us anyway.
We were all better off without you.
Hmm.
Hmm.
EMILY ELIZABETH: Clifford!
Clifford!
CLEO: Clifford!
There you are.
Where were you?
You missed a great rehearsal.
Yeah.
Check out our new trick.
Ta-da!
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, spit it out.
I'm going home.
We're all going after we win the contest tomorrow.
Right?
No. I'm going home now.
What?
Clifford?
What about the contest and the lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies, and helping Emily Elizabeth?
I miss Emily Elizabeth and I'm going home.
But Larry and the animals need you.
Shackelford said they were better off without me.
But that's not true.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to them.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Are you guys coming with me?
Of course! Yeah, we're a team, right?
Yeah, we gotta stick together.
Birdwell Island, here we come.
Goodbye, fame.
Goodbye, glamor.
Goodbye, Amazing Animals.
LARRY: Big Red!
Big Red!
Poofy! Little guy!
Yoo-hoo!
Where are you?
Hey, guys.
I can't find Big Red,
Poofy or Little Guy.
I think they left us.
They didn't even bother to say, "Later, dude."
Why would they do that?
Hmm. Good question.
Any idea why they'd leave,
Shackelford?
What's it matter, anyway?
Huh?
Just goes to show you who your friends are.
Like I always say,
"You've got to go with what you got."
I never heard you say that.
We were fine before Clifford.
Yeah, but fine doesn't win contests.
Bad news, guys.
It looks like they're gone.
I hope they're all right, wherever they are.
Look, gang,
I know everyone's upset.
This isn't the way we would've wanted it, but the show must go on.
We're going to Shangri-Large, and we'll find them after the show.
Emily Elizabeth, here I come.
It's gonna be great to be back home, isn't it, T?
Yeah.
It's too bad we're not going back with the Tummy Yummies though.
Well, at least we're going back to where we're appreciated.
Right, Cleo?
Right.
I thought they were pretty nice to us.
That Larry sure was a great guy.
He took good care of everyone.
Yeah, he sure did.
Too bad.
Now they'll never win the contest.
No Clifford, no Cleo, no way.
But, sure they will.
Are you kidding?
They'll never win without you.
They don't stand a chance.
Hey, gang, take a look at that.
Shangri-Large!
Whoo-hoo!
We made it. Tummy Yummies, here we come.
Nothing can stop us now.
Uh-oh.
Oh, no. Please, no.
No, no, no, not again.
Don't do this to me.
Not today.
Please, please, please, baby.
Sit tight while
I check it out.
I'm sure it's nothing.
That sounded bogus.
It's just the thingamajigger.
You see...
Not so bad.
Great, just great.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, at least things couldn't get any worse.
Hmm.
Don't worry, guys.
Hey, don't worry, here I come.
Hey, look.
We're moving.
Yeah, backwards.
Oh, boy.
Oh!
What the...
Woo-hoo!
Big Red to the rescue!
Clifford, amigo.
DOROTHY: Clifford.
Hey, guys! Welcome back.
Hi, Dorothy.
CLEO: Hey, girlfriend.
Thank you for coming back, Clifford.
It really means a lot to us, and even to Shackelford.
I'm not so sure, Dorothy.
Listen, I know that he was pretty harsh to you yesterday.
I think he was just feeling replaced by you.
Replaced?
How? All I wanted to do is help.
I know. I know, Clifford.
It's not your fault.
He's just not the most secure ferret in the world.
But he means well.
Whatever, Dorothy.
Wow!
Rock on, dude!
And now...
Ladies and gentlemen, before we present the final act,
I'd like to introduce the man who made this incredible show possible.
Daddy.
Madison.
What is it, honey?
Have you made up your mind?
No. They're all lame.
And now, without further ado,
Mr. George C. Wolfsbottom.
I'll be right back, sweetie.
Remember, you promised.
Now we're talkin'!
Whoo-ee!
That's a whole lotta red!
And now, for our final act of the evening, a traveling animal show that has toured all over the country.
Ooh!
Let's give it up for
Larry's Amazing Animals.
Ta-da!
That dog is incredible.
He's humongous.
Never seen anything like him.
Clifford!
Hello? Oops.
Hello?
Yes, I know.
I saw it, too.
My little puffball on TV.
And the winner of The Tummy
Yummies Talent Contest is,
Larry's Amazing Animals!
Yes! We did it!
We did it.
You did it. You guys.
You guys are the best.
Good boy.
I could have never done it without you.
Can we get your autograph?
WOMAN: One over here.
One over here, please.
LARRY: Well, here you go.
Hey! Hello!
Who do I make this out to?
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Thank you, Gablegobble.
For what?
For signing the contract.
What's going on?
What is this?
That, partner, is our deal.
But you didn't give me a chance to...
Gablegobble, listen to me.
You just won the contest.
I didn't even read it first.
Shouldn't I know what's in it before I sign it?
GEORGE: Don't you want fame?
Well, yes.
Fortune?
Of course.
And a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies?
Yes.
Then a deal's a deal.
Mano a mano.
You and your animals will be living it up in The Wolfsbottom
Royal Suite.
We'll discuss the details later.
In the meantime, enjoy the best the hotel has to offer.
Hear that, gang?
We did it!
We hit the big time.
They like us.
They really, really like us.
Uh, uh...
Guys? Guys, where's Big Red?
Stop!
Stop!
Big Red.
Don't worry, guys.
This isn't over yet.
Contract or no contract,
I'm going to get Big Red back.
No matter what.
Daddy, you did it. You did it!
He's absolutely huge.
He goes with my collection perfectly.
Yeah, he's something, all right.
He's got to be the biggest dang dog
I've ever seen.
And he's mine, all mine!
I've even got the perfect name. Clancy.
Duty calls, sweetie.
Come on, Clancy.
Come see my collection, boy. Come on!
Hmm.
The world's biggest dollhouse, check.
The world's biggest carousel, check.
And now, the world's biggest dog, check!
Isn't that great.
You're gonna love it here.
Everything's just your size.
Okay, Clancy.
Let's play pony ride!
Yahoo!
Go, Clancy, go.
You guys, relax.
I'm calling Wolfsbottom.
We'll get Big Red back before you know it.
Party time
Party up a good time
Party time
Hot like Hollywood time
Check it out. A waterbed.
Woo-hoo!
Sure beats a lumpy seat in the back of a bus, huh, gang?
Ooh!
Finally, the sweet smell of success.
Ooh.
Or is it snacks?
Snacks galore, and it's all free!
Who wants popcorn?
Hey, Dorothy. Look, girl, non-dairy creamer.
No thanks, I'm not hungry.
Rodrigo, mi hermano.
Guava cactus, baby.
Your favorite.
No, gracias.
What is wrong with you guys?
You should be happy.
I don't know, Shackelford.
It just doesn't seem right without Clifford.
Again with Clifford?
Clifford's the best.
He believed in us.
Yeah, he should be here with us, man.
He made me feel so dainty.
All he cared about was the food.
He was only in it for the eats.
Once he won it, he was out of here.
He didn't care about us.
He was in it for himself.
Everything that dog did was just for himself.
He did it for Emily...
Huh?
Uh-oh.
Who is Emily...
Emily Elizabeth!
She's his owner back on Birdwell Island.
But you said you didn't have families.
You said these tags were fake, and you only use them to fool the dogcatcher.
Why would you make that up?
Because you said
Larry wouldn't take us in if we had owners.
Clifford really needed to win that dog food to help Emily
Elizabeth and the Howards.
We had no other choice!
Oh, man.
So all Big Red wanted was to help out his family.
I messed up, guys. I...
I guess it's not your fault.
You just didn't know.
But now I do.
Let's go.
Where?
To see a man about a dog.
You dognapped Big Red and I want him back.
GEORGE: Well, that's too bad, because Clancy just loves his new life of luxury.
He's a Wolfsbottom now.
Hey, buddy.
What's the matter?
You have owners?
We have a dog to fetch.
EMILY ELIZABETH: Hello?
Are you by chance, the owner of a very large, very red dog?
Morning.
Howdy.
Who are you here to see, sir?
I'm Larry Gablegobble, and I'm here to see
Mr. Wolfsbottom.
What about?
Uh. (LAUGHS)
Well, it's about your...
Your lawn.
You know,
I could make it greener.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
But I only need a minute.
So much for plan A.
Mmm-hmm.
Then it's time for plan double-A.
Double-A?
Amazing Animals.
Cleo, special connecting cable.
Got it.
Dorothy, auxiliary transport system.
Got it.
Dirk, grapple hook.
Dude, pshaw.
All right, team.
This is it.
This is not a contest, it's the real thing.
We're going to do this to save our friend, Clifford.
Are you with me?
ALL: Yeah!
Then let's get ready to rumble.
All righty, let's move, people.
Go, go, go, go!
We're in.
Follow the master.
Ha.
Locked!
Up there.
Psst-psst.
Shackelford!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to spring you out of this palatial prison.
Hmm?
Uh...
I mean, we came to get you out of here.
And, well, because,
I had you all wrong and
I wanted to say how really, really sorry I am.
No, no, no!
Okay, come on now, no time for that.
We got to go.
Yes.
Hey! Good to see you, Clifford!
Hey, Clifford!
Good to see you.
Could we please get out of here?
Come on.
Uh-oh.
Hold it right there!
Hey!
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
This way.
Go, go, go!
The kid's got her own theme park.
Hit the lights.
Get them!
Uh-oh.
They spotted Rodrigo.
We got to get a move on.
I got the big guy cornered.
No, I don't.
He's getting away!
We got you now.
Hey!
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on, after him!
Hang on, guys.
There they are. Get them!
Come on, Red. Move.
Woo-hoo!
Huh?
Yeah!
We have you surrounded.
Cowabunga!
Good going, gang.
Woo-hoo!
Ahh!
Gablegobble!
What are you doing with my dog?
EMILY ELIZABETH:
That's my dog!
Who are you?
I'm Emily Elizabeth, and Clifford belongs to me.
Clifford!
Oh, Clifford.
I've missed you so much.
I love you, boy.
Emily Elizabeth.
I'm sorry, but a deal's a deal.
Daddy.
What is it, sugar?
Let her keep him.
Clancy belonged to her first.
It's only fair.
But, sweetie?
And the Tummy Yummies.
All right.
You and your animals won that contest fair and square.
You all deserve it.
Put her there.
Thanks.
Yeah!
Mr. Gablegobble, thanks for calling and explaining everything to me.
And thanks for taking care of Clifford.
The pleasure was all mine.
We love Big Red...
I mean, Clifford.
We're really going to miss him.
Well, Big Red.
Thanks for everything, boy.
I get to keep my family because of you.
Aw.
Bye, guys. I'm gonna miss you.
We'll miss you, too.
Hey, Clifford.
Thanks for being such a good pal.
Thanks for rescuing me.
We'll always be friends, right, big guy?
Right.
Hey, hey. Cut that out.
We'll be back next year.
Hey, guys. Sorry, but we got to head out.
Goodbye, you guys.
We'll miss you.
Bye!
T-BONE: Goodbye,
Amazing Animals.
Hey, boy.
You're the best, Clifford.
Guess who's back?
EMILY: All right!
Thanks, Clifford.
We're back.
Hey, it's Clifford.
(LAUGHS) Woo!
It's Clifford!
Hi, guys!
You're too fast.
There.
Aah.
Spotless.
Hi, Mr. Bleakman.
Oh, Clifford!
It's good to have you back.
Bye!
{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{1338}{1426}You better have a look at this, sir.
{1449}{1509}- Commercial flight.|- No. Too fast, sir.
{1515}{1605}- One of our own?|- Air Force has nothing scheduled.
{1611}{1691}We've got ourselves a bogey.
{2086}{2198}Orange Leader to Delta Group,|anticipate visual contact...
{2204}{2271}now.
{2277}{2329}Holy cow pie!
{2335}{2383}Hi. Nice antiques.
{2389}{2450}Gotta blast.
{2456}{2545}Fusion mix, stable. Engines cycling|at one million gigajoules.
{2551}{2589}Cool. We didn't blow up.
{2595}{2630}Great.
{2636}{2717}Jimmy, I think they want us to pull over.
{2723}{2788}No time for that, Carl.|Stand by with the satellite.
{2794}{2874}OK. What do I do again?
{2880}{2919}You're the deployment system, Carl.
{2925}{3010}As soon as we clear the atmosphere,|you just throw it.
{3016}{3145}- Right.|- Prepare to leave the atmosphere.
{3176}{3250}Sorry about the toast, dear.|I had to make it in the oven.
{3256}{3326}- I can't find our toaster anywhere.|- Looky.
{3332}{3417}This oven toast is brilliant,|sugar booger.
{3423}{3496}And your yolks are|absolutely perfect, too.
{3502}{3548}Run away with me, my love.
{3554}{3612}OK. But we'll have to take my car
{3618}{3688}because your transmission|needs a new compression cuff.
{3694}{3736}Whatever.
{3742}{3782}This is a good one. Quack, quack.
{3788}{3846}Would you call Jimmy?|He's going to miss the bus.
{3852}{3891}Jimmy, breakfast!
{3897}{3941}Time to come down!
{3947}{4014}# Down, down, down, down, quack|Down, down, down, down, quack
{4020}{4065}Up, up, up.
{4071}{4174}Engaging pulse rockets now!
{4186}{4273}- No!|- Now?
{4449}{4505}Is this supposed to happen?
{4511}{4560}Come on. Think.
{4566}{4650}Think. Think.
{4806}{4828}Brain blast.
{4834}{4906}Give me your lunch.
{4931}{5004}Thanks, boy.
{5305}{5394}Don't try that at home.
{5495}{5610}Must engage stabilisers.
{5672}{5717}Now, just a quick stop at my house.
{5723}{5827}I don't know, Jimmy. I gotta get|to school on time. Besides, you...
{5833}{5946}- Right. Gotcha.|- No, I didn't mean... Jimmy!
{5970}{6021}- See you in homeroom.|- OK.
{6027}{6151}Fasten your seat belt, Goddard.|It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
{6704}{6783}Well, what do you know,|the chimney fell off again.
{6789}{6881}Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
{7033}{7092}James Isaac Neutron.
{7098}{7144}I see you up there.
{7150}{7259}How many times have we told you|not to launch yourself off the roof?
{7265}{7326}Probably nine. Exactly nine.
{7332}{7390}They say repetition is good|for a developing brain.
{7396}{7444}Then what do you think you're doing?
{7450}{7544}Last night I got a message from space,|but it was garbled in the ionosphere,
{7550}{7640}so I had to launch a communications|toaster... I mean, satellite.
{7646}{7714}- And then when I tried...|- Well, message from space. Wow.
{7720}{7769}Don't encourage him, Hugh.
{7775}{7886}Jimmy, we've repeatedly told you|not to talk to strangers.
{7892}{8013}But, Mom, I'm on the verge of contact|with an advanced alien civilisation.
{8019}{8090}I don't care how advanced|they say they are, Jimmy.
{8096}{8188}If your father and I haven't met them,|they're strangers. Right, Hugh?
{8194}{8312}Well, except for policemen.|They're there to help you.
{8460}{8551}You've got to admit that is pretty neat.
{8557}{8657}But very unsafe, honey. That's bad.
{8940}{9051}Deactivate pants.
{9267}{9362}Engage, Gingivitis 2000.
{9677}{9729}Robo-Barber prototype, engage.
{9735}{9784}Online.
{9790}{9848}Ta-da.
{9854}{9934}You rock.
{9955}{10039}You go, girl.
{10155}{10239}Shoe-Bot!
{10667}{10751}Bye, Goddard.
{10766}{10895}- Wait! I'm here!|- Goodbye, son. Have a good day.
{10901}{10989}Goddard, not on the porch.
{11036}{11079}Hey! Hey, wait!
{11085}{11212}Seems like the perfect opportunity|to try out the Super Bubble Gumobile.
{11218}{11295}"No, Jimmy, don't try it. It's too soon."
{11301}{11411}Nonsense. All great inventions|need a test run.
{11632}{11711}All right!
{12139}{12206}Hello!
{12212}{12314}- Right here.|- Hey, look. Neutron's got another one.
{12320}{12437}Nice invention, Nerdtron. Too bad|somebody already invented the bus.
{12443}{12497}Hey, guys, I've got it down this time.
{12503}{12659}Internal combustion's such old science.|Bubble travel is the way of the future.
{12704}{12805}I guess trees are, like, the brakes.
{12941}{12982}Hello?
{12988}{13020}Jimmy?
{13026}{13102}Carl.
{13171}{13215}Careful!
{13221}{13291}Hey!
{13339}{13410}- Thanks.|- That's what I'm here for.
{13416}{13490}- What a day, huh?|- Look at the bright side, Carl.
{13496}{13580}The worst is behind us.
{13589}{13664}And my fossil-to-chromosome ratios|clearly demonstrate
{13670}{13739}that female dinosaurs,|like this plesiosaurus,
{13745}{13803}were the stronger and|smarter of their species.
{13809}{13875}But, so what else is new?
{13881}{13957}After class I'll be happy|to demonstrate how boy dinosaurs
{13963}{14051}got their butts kicked by|girl dinosaurs on a regular basis.
{14057}{14153}Excuse me, but the mandible crest|of Cindy's alleged "plesiosaurus"
{14159}{14270}is that of a male megalosaur, as defined|by the Congress of Palaeontologists.
{14276}{14359}Those findings were inconclusive,|and you know it, Neutron.
{14365}{14401}Hello! Miss Fowl,
{14407}{14541}what is the standard for research|on these extra-credit reports?
{14549}{14721}Yes, well... Let's move along|to "show and tell" now, shall we?
{14726}{14768}This is Ultra Lord.
{14774}{14921}Sheen, this is the seventh week in|a row you've shown Ultra Lord in class.
{14927}{14991}Miss Fowl, this one is different.
{14997}{15079}This "Purple Vengeance" version|with power fists and nuclear knees
{15085}{15194}is a rare, never-been-seen condition,|making it highly collectable.
{15200}{15327}Never been seen, huh? Well, then,|how do you know it's even in there?
{15491}{15556}No!
{15562}{15658}Hey, Jimmy, wanna see a frog?
{15666}{15790}- That looks great, Carl.|- Thanks. What are you drawing?
{15796}{15880}Flycycle modifications for Goddard.|Second prototype.
{15886}{15941}Prototype, huh?
{15947}{16024}- Well, you know, that looks good, too.|- Thanks, Carl.
{16030}{16168}Carl! Would you please share|with us your "show and tell"?
{16174}{16230}OK.
{16236}{16289}This is my inhaler.
{16295}{16372}It provides fast-acting relief|of bronchial swelling
{16378}{16434}due to asthma or allergies.
{16440}{16523}One touch of the button and...
{16559}{16642}- I can't see!|- Thank you, Carl.
{16648}{16737}All right. Next we have...
{16743}{16819}Nick!
{16940}{16989}Yes, Nick.
{16995}{17070}You are a tad tardy again.
{17076}{17123}Oh, my. Am I?
{17129}{17264}It took me a little while to copy my|mom's handwriting for this late note.
{17284}{17338}Your "show and tell", please.
{17344}{17376}How's it goin'?
{17382}{17475}You know, I don't really|do "show and tell".
{17479}{17600}Yes, that's right. Thank you, Nick.
{17607}{17688}- Did you drop this?|- Yes. Well, I...
{17694}{17773}My dropped pencil.
{17779}{17910}Jimmy, we eagerly await|another one of your
{17916}{18021}interesting "show and tells".
{18027}{18113}As a matter of fact,|I brought my latest invention.
{18119}{18184}Behold. The Shrink Ray!
{18190}{18290}What's the matter, Neutron?|Aren't you short enough already?
{18296}{18342}Funny, Cindy.
{18348}{18454}But this device is more suited to shrink|something as vast as space itself,
{18460}{18545}like, say, your mouth.
{18630}{18691}Help me. Help me. I'm so tiny.
{18697}{18765}Just like Jimmy's brain.
{18771}{18819}So much for the Nobel Prize.
{18825}{18860}Children, that's enough.
{18866}{18927}Better luck next time.
{18933}{18984}It worked this morning.
{18990}{19046}I like your useless shrink ray, Jimmy.
{19052}{19155}Well, it's probably just|a programming error.
{19233}{19317}Oh, my.
{19421}{19505}Back! Back! Leviathan!
{19532}{19568}Come on, Jimmy.
{19574}{19694}Some of the greatest inventors started|as complete, hopeless failures, too.
{19700}{19744}- Yeah.|- Well, thank you, Carl.
{19750}{19794}I feel better, I think.
{19800}{19844}- I'm glad.|- That's good.
{19850}{19934}Hey, Retroland Theme Park.|Check it out.
{19940}{20006}Meet Ultra Lord. Live!
{20012}{20099}Look, it's the state-of-the-art,|bone-warping gravity ride.
{20105}{20144}I can hang out with Ultra Lord.
{20150}{20205}And there's a petting zoo.
{20211}{20306}- Well, look at this.|- No, meet Ultra Lord live.
{20312}{20384}Llamas and capybaras.
{20390}{20452}Who cares? Meet Ultra Lord live.
{20458}{20518}Yeah, but I'm gonna touch a llama.
{20524}{20595}Guys, we have got to go to|the grand opening tonight.
{20601}{20633}Yeah!
{20639}{20748}Yeah. But my folks won't|let me stay out after dark.
{20754}{20800}Well, it is a school night.
{20806}{20939}Pukin' Pluto, there's gotta be something|we can do. It's the grand opening.
{20945}{20999}- Sneak out.|- What?
{21005}{21074}You heard me, dweebs. Sneak out.
{21080}{21153}Yeah, but my parents sorta told me...
{21159}{21232}Parents. What, are you guys|gonna be kids forever?
{21238}{21289}What your parents|don't know won't hurt 'em.
{21295}{21410}But, Nick, sneaking out|is so barbaric.
{21416}{21498}Whatever, Neutron.|But there's only one opening night,
{21504}{21640}and anybody who matters|is gonna be there.
{21712}{21770}What d'you think, Jimmy?
{21776}{21863}Nick has a point.|There is only one opening night.
{21869}{21931}Think, think, think, think, think.
{21937}{21999}Well, according to the|{y:i}Newville Journal of Medicine,
{22005}{22076}monkeys are easily influenced|by positive reinforcement,
{22082}{22131}e.g. The giving of a banana.
{22137}{22213}And since human and monkey DNA|only differ by two per cent,
{22219}{22271}the same principle|should work on our parents.
{22277}{22319}My dad's allergic to bananas.
{22325}{22400}It's not the bananas. It's the principle.
{22406}{22445}It's called psychology.
{22451}{22505}All you have to do is butter 'em up.
{22511}{22567}Give it a try. I'll call you guys later.
{22573}{22644}We go to Retroland tonight!
{22650}{22734}Yeah!
{22801}{22867}- Watch out!|- Hey!
{22873}{22957}Hold on!
{23198}{23250}I know.
{23256}{23350}Excuse me, are you|through with that? Thanks.
{23356}{23440}A few oysters.
{23489}{23567}One lump of coal coming up.
{23568}{23647}- Thanks, Gus.|- Hi, Jimmy.
{23653}{23733}Excuse me.
{24039}{24089}Jimmy, is that you, dear?
{24095}{24174}Yeah, Mom. I'll be in in a second.
{24180}{24256}DNA match confirmed.|Welcome home, Jimmy.
{24262}{24331}Eliminate school smell.
{24337}{24412}- Normal odour restored.|- Thank you, Vox.
{24418}{24472}You're welcome.
{24478}{24594}Warning. Entry tube|closed for maintenance.
{24621}{24732}- Thank you, Vox.|- You're welcome.
{24784}{24843}Here, Goddard. Here, boy.
{24849}{24933}Here, Goddard.
{24952}{25035}Hey, look what I brought ya. Aluminium.
{25041}{25097}Do you want it? Do you want it? Huh?
{25103}{25154}Sit.
{25160}{25244}Roll over.
{25261}{25345}Play dead.
{25434}{25557}Mental note: Fix bug|in obedience program.
{25639}{25724}Good boy.
{25773}{25874}OK, Goddard,|let's check the experiments.
{26236}{26300}The invisible hamsters|are looking great...
{26306}{26378}I think.
{26384}{26496}Let's see how|the girl-eating plant is doing.
{26590}{26627}Nice choice.
{26633}{26713}As usual.
{26758}{26818}The latest burping-soda formula.
{26824}{26916}A guaranteed one burp per sip.
{27070}{27154}Excuse you!
{27266}{27349}You know, there's still no reply|to our satellite message.
{27355}{27394}Jeez, it's been a whole day.
{27400}{27483}You'd think we would have heard from|an alien civilisation by now, huh?
{27489}{27575}Well, come on, Goddard.
{27673}{27725}Say "Aah".
{27731}{27798}Add a little sand.
{27804}{27879}And in you go.
{28027}{28120}I'm just an old lump of coal
{28126}{28200}But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
{28206}{28221}Oh, yeah
{28227}{28278}Jimmy.
{28284}{28327}Hi, Mom.
{28333}{28390}Jimmy, you scared|the bejabers out of me.
{28396}{28449}Sorry about your bejabers, Mom.
{28455}{28518}And might I add|how lovely you look today.
{28524}{28591}- I'm covered in transmission fluid.|- Exactly.
{28597}{28678}And might I say,|filth never looked so good.
{28684}{28749}Yes, well, how was|"show and tell" today?
{28755}{28842}Was OK. But first, happy birthday, Mom.
{28848}{28899}Jimmy, these are beautiful.
{28905}{28972}But, sweetie, it's not my birthday.
{28978}{29018}It's not? Well...
{29024}{29162}Then whatever will I do with these|lovely pearls and priceless earrings?
{29168}{29236}- These can't be real.|- But they can.
{29242}{29319}And they are!
{29347}{29416}And all these fabulous gifts|and prizes could be yours
{29422}{29478}if you know the correct answer|to this question.
{29484}{29580}- Please may I go to Retroland tonight?|- No, it's a school night.
{29586}{29689}Thank you so much, Mother.|And might I say...
{29733}{29784}- Did you just say no?|- Yes.
{29790}{29822}- Yes!|- No.
{29828}{29854}- No?|- Yes.
{29860}{29897}- Yes!|- Jimmy...
{29903}{29973}But all my friends are going.
{29979}{30053}And anybody who matters|is gonna be there, Mom.
{30059}{30142}I matter and your father matters|and you matter.
{30148}{30214}But you're not going.|Maybe we can go next weekend.
{30220}{30369}Wait. I'm sure there must be something|else in here to change your mind...
{30457}{30541}No, Jimmy! Look out! Look out, Jimmy!
{30593}{30645}Jimmy, be careful.
{30651}{30735}Mom, get me out!
{30755}{30843}- I didn't do it!|- Stop, drop and roll! My goodness!
{30849}{30924}Goddard.
{31026}{31096}OK, Jimmy. That's the last straw.
{31102}{31190}We have told you time and time again|about playing with rockets.
{31196}{31315}But, Mom, it's technically not a rocket.|It's more of a jet-pack-type thing.
{31321}{31381}I don't care what type thing it is.
{31387}{31481}You just climb those|stair-type things right now.
{31487}{31575}Your father will have a few words|to say to you when he gets home.
{31581}{31617}It's not a rocket.
{31623}{31702}- March.|- Mom...
{32278}{32353}Yes.
{32364}{32427}The king, he loves his little orthgot.
{32433}{32560}Yes, he does. Yes, he does.|Yes, he does.
{32575}{32619}Yes, he does.
{32625}{32787}Sire, my King, it appears to be|some type of alien transmission device.
{32803}{32890}Tell me, when did it become acceptable
{32896}{32976}to approach|my royal throne unannounced?
{32982}{33018}Yes, of course, my King.
{33024}{33109}- Space him!|- I assure you that...
{33269}{33357}Wait!
{33409}{33451}I missed it.
{33457}{33525}- Can I, can I, can I space another?|- No.
{33531}{33588}- Please, brother.|- I said no, Ooblar.
{33594}{33732}- Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please...|- I would love for that to stop.
{33743}{33789}What have we here?
{33795}{33964}As the king's assistant, I am the official|checker of new things to be checked.
{34006}{34068}It's all right. It's all right. I'll handle this.
{34074}{34154}Hello!
{34163}{34234}What galaxy are you from?
{34240}{34298}- Ooblar.|- Where is your leader?
{34304}{34418}Ooblar, stop it. It's toast.
{34437}{34482}Hello, toast.
{34488}{34596}I greatly admire your ship.
{34602}{34692}Beginning transmission from Earth.
{34732}{34783}Greetings from planet Earth.
{34789}{34876}I'm Jimmy Neutron and|you're an alien life form.
{34882}{34937}- I welcome the opportunity...|- What a big head.
{34943}{35102}...for the mutual exchange of scientific|knowledge and universal brotherhood.
{35115}{35176}This here is my dog, Goddard.
{35182}{35270}And this that you're looking at|is my room. That's where I sleep.
{35276}{35365}And this is my mom and dad|right here. Mom, Dad.
{35371}{35456}Freeze that image.
{35516}{35562}They look...
{35568}{35655}delicious.
{35661}{35757}The search is over!
{35974}{36038}But, Dad, all my friends|are gonna be there.
{36044}{36146}I know, son, but if all your friends were|named Cliff, would you jump off them?
{36152}{36208}I don't think you would.|You see, Jimmy...
{36214}{36258}Jimmy. Jim, Jim, Jimmy.
{36264}{36366}Jim, James, son, let me|tell you a little about rockets.
{36372}{36423}They're big-people things, son.
{36429}{36570}And you just can't go around playing|with big-people, fiery, flying things
{36576}{36624}because that's what rockets are.
{36630}{36699}Rockets are flying things.
{36705}{36797}Well, I hope this talk has helped.
{36858}{36919}And, by the way,|Mom says you're grounded.
{36925}{36984}Sorry.
{36990}{37120}What good is it to be a genius if you|can't even go out on a school night?
{37126}{37184}Goddard, options.
{37190}{37262}Apologise. Your parents love you.
{37268}{37298}Next.
{37304}{37363}Create a time capsule.|Escape to the future.
{37369}{37438}That'll take too long. Next.
{37444}{37488}Build Goddard a female poodle.
{37494}{37586}Goddard, this is serious.
{37589}{37625}Sneak out.
{37631}{37731}That's it. Barbaric problems|call for barbaric solutions.
{37737}{37821}Phone, please.
{37825}{37860}Carl, it's me.
{37866}{37926}You get permission? Me neither.
{37932}{38011}It turns out parents|don't understand psychology.
{38017}{38104}Tell Sheen to meet us|at Retroland in one hour.
{38110}{38185}We're sneakin' out.
{38191}{38281}Halt! Hold it right there!
{38322}{38401}Jimmy's awfully quiet up there, Hugh.|Do you think we were too tough?
{38407}{38506}- No, I don't think so, dear. No.|- Maybe I should check on him.
{38512}{38647}Now, now. I'm sure he's just|reflecting on the error of his ways.
{38653}{38746}Dealing with it in a mature,|responsible manner.
{38752}{38851}"Mom says you're grounded."|Take that.
{38873}{38921}It's working now.
{38927}{39004}OK, Goddard, you know what to do.
{39010}{39071}Good boy.
{39077}{39161}See you later, Goddard.
{39227}{39326}Jimmy's a big boy now.|Don't you worry, sugar.
{39332}{39387}- I suppose you're right.|- Yeah, sure.
{39393}{39460}I was a kid once. I remember|being grounded a whole week
{39466}{39581}and not being allowed to go|to my best friend's bachelor party.
{39586}{39692}- Well, what did you do?|- Actually, I snuck out.
{39711}{39798}- You don't think that Jimmy...|- No, no.
{39804}{39852}Besides, how's he gonna sneak out?
{39858}{39925}It's not like he can just|walk right out the front door.
{39931}{40010}That's true.
{40156}{40245}Retroland, here I come.
{40434}{40505}Libby, you're breaking|my concentration.
{40511}{40607}Hey, I gotta choose a ring|that fits my personality.
{40613}{40715}Yeah! Here we go! Here we go!
{40739}{40798}Tell me what it is|you're supposed to be doing again.
{40804}{40908}T'ai Chi, while drinking Purple Flurp.
{40913}{41029}T'ai Chi promotes wellness,|relaxes and rejuvenates the body.
{41035}{41118}Whereas Purple Flurp,
{41124}{41175}being 98 per cent sugar,|creates tension
{41181}{41243}and a temporary rush of energy|and mood swings.
{41249}{41332}I figure if I do them together,
{41338}{41457}I achieve perfect balance.
{41569}{41634}It's better than the poster.
{41640}{41735}Gentlemen, this will be a night|we shan't easily forget.
{41741}{41845}I don't know what "shan't" means,|but let's go.
{42536}{42625}Do you promise to use your powers|for good and not evil?
{42631}{42657}Yes, Ultra Lord.
{42663}{42864}Now, Counterpart, take this Ultra Mask|and lead the fight for justice.
{42918}{42990}Is this kid with anyone?
{43008}{43092}Go, Carl.
{43299}{43348}Now that's what I call a ride.
{43354}{43438}Let's go.
{43648}{43707}This is way beyond awesome.
{43713}{43803}Just think if you boneheaded|dweebs had listened to your parents,
{43809}{43943}you'd be home in bed|instead of riding this monster.
{44137}{44182}I tell you, he's fine.
{44188}{44239}Just a quick peek, Hugh.
{44245}{44298}There. Now, what did I tell you?
{44304}{44349}Jimmy, are you awake, dear?
{44355}{44422}Yes, Mother. I am awake.
{44428}{44524}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{44530}{44633}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{44738}{44809}Honey, I know you're upset.
{44815}{44871}We don't like to punish you.
{44877}{44961}You're such a special boy.
{45732}{45835}According to this, we should encourage|Jimmy without overindulging him.
{45841}{45922}OK. What does it say about rockets?
{45928}{45997}- Is there someone in the kitchen?|- Our kitchen?
{46003}{46087}I didn't hear anything.
{46165}{46260}Honey, did you leave|the green light on?
{46276}{46324}Jimmy?
{46330}{46393}Jimmy?
{46449}{46529}You're not Jimmy.
{46530}{46588}Hugh?
{46594}{46639}Hugh, are you all right?
{46645}{46713}Hugh?
{47611}{47687}- Was that so cool, dude!|- Yeah! That was great!
{47693}{47747}- Mind-bending!|- Yeah!
{47753}{47817}Hey, my pants are almost dry.
{47823}{47891}Hey, Jimmy, I never thought|I'd say it, but here goes.
{47897}{47964}You know what?|That Nick is not such a bad guy.
{47970}{48066}- Are you kidding? He's a genius.|- He's a genius!
{48072}{48127}- No offence, Jimmy.|- None taken.
{48133}{48219}Actually, I find his insights on how|to deal with one's parents refreshing.
{48225}{48312}Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if our folks|all disappeared for a while?
{48318}{48350}Yeah.
{48356}{48401}Hey, a shooting star.
{48407}{48506}Cool. You get to make a wish. Lucky.
{48512}{48553}What should I wish for?
{48559}{48624}I know what I'd wish for.|I'd wish for no more parents.
{48630}{48702}That way we could do whatever|we wanted, whenever we wanted.
{48708}{48784}We'd be free.|We could have fun all the time.
{48790}{48871}Yeah!
{48898}{48952}Liftoff in five,
{48958}{49048}four, three, two...
{49054}{49128}We have liftoff.
{49134}{49215}Abort mission. Abort mission.
{49221}{49283}Goddard, wake mode.
{49289}{49397}All right. Come on, boy.|Race you to the kitchen.
{49450}{49496}Beat ya.
{49502}{49582}Hey, Mom, did you get|any more Purple Flurp?
{49588}{49665}Mom!
{49701}{49751}"Dear son/daughter,
{49757}{49829}we have gone to Florida|for an extended vacation."
{49835}{49882}"Love, your parents."
{49888}{49955}Yeah. My parents went to Florida, too.
{49961}{50003}That's weird.
{50009}{50059}From the look of it,
{50065}{50127}I'd say a lot of parents are gone.
{50133}{50171}Well... Did...
{50177}{50253}- Did they all go to Florida?|- Maybe they went to get juice.
{50259}{50376}I don't digest pulp well.|It makes me bloaty.
{50382}{50478}Goddard, scan for adult life forms.
{50531}{50673}Just as I thought. There are absolutely|no adults anywhere within radar.
{50679}{50743}They're gone. The whole city.
{50749}{50789}No parents.
{50795}{50873}No parents.
{50879}{50970}No parents!
{51098}{51182}Excuse me.
{51185}{51230}I'm letting out the cold.
{51236}{51339}I'm peeing in the shower.
{51342}{51442}Llama, llama, llama!
{51521}{51590}I'm walking up the down escalator.
{51596}{51720}# My clothes don't match! I'm out|in public and my clothes don't match!
{51955}{52071}I'm still doing it. Go, go, go.
{52099}{52230}Welcome to the Candy Bar. Whoopee|cushion or non-whoopee cushion?
{52244}{52328}Jimmy!
{52389}{52473}What'll it be, boys?
{52503}{52631}- We'll have what he's throwing.|- Excellent choice.
{52723}{52807}Hang on!
{52814}{52887}No skiing in the halls.
{52893}{52995}Don't make me get the protractor.
{53680}{53735}Morning, Goddard.
{53741}{53814}My head. What a night.
{53820}{53896}I'm stuffed now. I couldn't have ano...
{53902}{54054}OK, one more. I'm gonna have one more|and then that'll be it.
{54057}{54151}What a battle. Are there any survivors?
{54157}{54218}Help me.
{54266}{54316}I remember my first time.
{54322}{54406}Shake it off, Neutron.
{54411}{54486}I gotta get home. Mom and Dad|might be back by now.
{54492}{54576}Come on, Goddard.
{54734}{54802}We interrupt this programme|to bring you this report.
{54808}{54862}Hey, knock it off, Arnie.
{54868}{54950}"Trouble in Paradise."|That's what some kids are saying
{54956}{55047}in the aftermath of yesterday's|"Mom and Dad are gone" celebrations.
{55053}{55089}Here's Courtney Tyler.
{55095}{55197}What started as an awesome day|has become, like, a real bummer.
{55203}{55254}- Help us!|- I don't know how to make lunch.
{55260}{55324}- I want my parents.|- Somebody hold me.
{55330}{55411}I was playing on the teetertotter
{55417}{55599}and the next thing I knew I was|on the ground and my knee hurt.
{55610}{55687}Reports of tummy aches,|owies and constipation
{55693}{55761}have reached epidemic numbers|over the past few hours,
{55767}{55850}with little indication of slowing down.
{55856}{55986}And so we were gonna see|who could eat the most cotton candy.
{55992}{56068}And I won.
{56074}{56187}I want my mommy.
{56204}{56284}So, there you have it.
{56290}{56378}I want my mommy, too.
{56485}{56569}Mom? Dad?
{56789}{56905}What kind of parents|take off and leave their kid?
{56938}{57027}And they didn't even say goodbye.
{57118}{57213}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{57219}{57319}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{57328}{57385}We only do what we do|because we love you.
{57391}{57478}Maybe we can all go to Retroland|next weekend, the three of us.
{57484}{57566}What about my fabulous dog Goddard?
{57572}{57656}Sure. Your fabulous dog Goddard, too.
{57662}{57701}Well, good night, son.
{57707}{57758}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.
{57764}{57848}We'll see you in the morning.
{57888}{57919}OK.
{57925}{57987}So they said good night.
{57993}{58045}"In the morning"? Hey, wait a minute.
{58051}{58124}Play back the last part again.|Audio only.
{58130}{58211}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.|We'll see you in the morning.
{58217}{58297}There. Why would she say that|if they weren't gonna be here?
{58303}{58406}Come on, Goddard.|We're going to the lab.
{58410}{58455}It's just as I thought.
{58461}{58556}The serifs and kerning on the note don't|match Mom and Dad's handwriting.
{58562}{58615}This note's a fake.
{58621}{58669}What is it, boy?
{58675}{58759}The Long-Range Space Scanner.|It detected something.
{58765}{58875}Filtering out background|radiation and... There it is.
{58881}{59022}Jumping Jupiter!|The Earth's been visited by aliens!
{59028}{59117}OK, so me, you and a dog
{59123}{59211}are gonna battle|an alien civilisation, right?
{59217}{59320}- By ourselves?|- He's a good dog. Aren't you, boy?
{59326}{59437}The last time we tried this, we couldn't|even break free of the atmosphere.
{59443}{59521}I know, I know. But I recalculated|the thrust-to-fuel ratio
{59527}{59613}and I've adjusted|the engine accordingly.
{59619}{59715}- I can fix that.|- Neutron.
{59762}{59863}- What is it?|- An angry mob.
{59931}{60020}In times of crisis, intellectuals|are always the first to go.
{60026}{60131}Well, they don't look angry.|They look like they're about to barf.
{60137}{60240}Let me go. You're messing with powers|far beyond your mortal comprehension.
{60246}{60285}OK, Neutron.
{60291}{60395}Ultra Freak here says you really know|what happened to all our parents.
{60401}{60505}Hey, how you doin'? I didn't say nothin'|about our parents being abducted...
{60511}{60632}- Where's my mom and dad?|- Hey, what's the matter?
{60638}{60725}Goddard, star map 72, please.
{60751}{60813}Right about there.
{60819}{60899}Long-range sensors picked up|these ion trails, indicating the route
{60905}{60962}for whatever intelligence|abducted our parents.
{60968}{61023}They lead us somewhere|in the Orion star system
{61029}{61118}three million light years away,|so we'll need to leave by Friday.
{61124}{61189}OK, that gives us about two days|to collect the plutonium,
{61195}{61289}design and test our fusion engines and|build our fleet of interstellar warships.
{61295}{61335}We'll also need to bring snacks.
{61341}{61418}Any questions?
{61487}{61551}Are you sure about this, Neutron?
{61557}{61620}Well, the data seems|to support this hypothesis.
{61626}{61731}Never argue with the data.
{61737}{61809}OK, Neutron, here's the lowdown.
{61815}{61907}You get us to those|kidnapping alien scuzzballs,
{61913}{61966}and I'll take it from there.
{61972}{62055}We're getting our parents back.
{62398}{62481}OK, Ben, that's good. Let it down slow.
{62487}{62571}Two more turns, Emma. Not too tight.
{62599}{62683}Yup. Tape adhesion is|within operational limits.
{62689}{62735}What? Cindy?
{62741}{62811}Cindy, what did you do to|that intergalactic starship?
{62817}{62913}We thought that the deep recesses|of space could use a feminine touch.
{62919}{62960}What do you think, Jimmy?
{62966}{63018}Yeah, it's OK, I guess.
{63024}{63067}You kinda ruined it though.
{63073}{63153}Hey, Jimmy, do these fusion reactors|need fuel rods?
{63159}{63250}Come on, Sheen. It's not rocket|science. You just have to...
{63256}{63327}Actually, I guess it is rocket science.
{63333}{63421}- No fuel rods, Sheen.|- OK.
{63467}{63562}And for the final touch...
{63728}{63837}Good work, everybody.|We're ready for intergalactic travel.
{63843}{63908}Neutron, this is gonna work, right?
{63914}{64005}- Yeah, Jimmy. What if it doesn't work?|- It will work!
{64011}{64057}I'm 95 per cent sure it will.
{64063}{64098}- 95?|- Yeah.
{64104}{64176}Yeah, and the other five per cent?
{64182}{64231}We blow up.
{64237}{64265}But just a little.
{64271}{64351}Look, a 95 is still an "A".
{64357}{64471}Yeah, I can deal with that.|I never got a 95 in my life.
{64477}{64630}You heard the man. Stop sucking|your thumbs and let's light this candle.
{64736}{64810}Goddard, initiate launch sequence.
{64816}{64857}Make sure seat belts are fastened
{64863}{65016}and remember to keep your hands and|arms inside the vehicles at all times.
{65986}{66047}Come on, everybody. Get in formation.
{66053}{66092}Carl, you're too low.
{66098}{66191}Come on, you stupid butterfly.
{66307}{66395}Go, Counterparts! Go!
{66398}{66480}Hang on. We're passing|through the stratosphere.
{66486}{66539}Now the mesosphere.
{66545}{66599}Entering ionosphere.
{66605}{66712}Now I know why they all end in "phere"!
{66718}{66855}This is it, baby.|Engaging pulse rockets now.
{66917}{67010}Come on, come on, come on, come on.
{67627}{67693}Look, Goddard.|The wonders of the universe.
{67699}{67869}We are witnessing celestial events|no person, or dog, has ever seen.
{67871}{67960}It's incredible.
{68122}{68183}Beautiful, isn't it, Nick?
{68189}{68289}Yeah, yeah.|Wake me when we get there.
{68290}{68334}Hey, Jimmy.
{68340}{68415}D'you think we can|rotate shifts after a while?
{68421}{68512}Hey, we'll switch.
{68621}{68702}Hey, this astronaut food isn't too bad.
{68708}{68788}That's toothpaste, Carl.
{68800}{68853}Minty.
{68859}{68959}- Hey, what's happening?|- Meteor shower.
{68965}{69044}Evasive action.
{69236}{69361}I do so relish these times of peril.
{69819}{69898}- That was close.|- Look out!
{70047}{70096}We've gotta find shelter.
{70102}{70165}Asteroid bearing 236.7 degrees.
{70171}{70255}Come on!
{70792}{70889}So then these three filmmakers|find all these sticks in the trees
{70895}{70939}shaped like stick people.
{70945}{71048}And the girl filmmaker starts crying|and her nose starts dripping.
{71054}{71158}And they don't have any tissue at all.
{71164}{71194}None?
{71200}{71236}None.
{71242}{71336}So then they start to hear|really scary noises
{71342}{71406}and voices coming from outside.
{71412}{71473}So they leave the tent.
{71479}{71526}Don't leave the tent!|Don't leave the tent!
{71532}{71637}Oh, yeah, Carl. They leave the tent|and they follow the voices,
{71643}{71741}when from out of|the darkness comes the...
{71758}{71898}Man, that was so choice.|You should have seen your faces.
{71898}{71975}Did they really leave the tent, Nick?
{71981}{72069}Hey, there's a red giant.|And that's a white dwarf.
{72075}{72161}You can relate, huh, Neutron?
{72206}{72250}Hey, Jimmy, what's the matter?
{72256}{72366}Listen, in case you haven't noticed,|I'm not exactly the tallest guy around.
{72372}{72431}Shorty, squirt, small-stuff, shrimp.
{72437}{72479}It gets to you after a while.
{72485}{72533}And next year there'll be dances.
{72539}{72639}What girl'd dance with a guy who looks|like he should still be in Gymboree?
{72645}{72738}I didn't think we liked girls yet, Jim.
{72744}{72811}We don't. We don't. No. Not yet. No.
{72817}{72861}However, one day, Carl,
{72867}{72985}an influx of hormones we can't control|will overpower our better judgment
{72991}{73083}and drive us to pursue|the female species against our will.
{73089}{73180}Stop talking like that, Jimmy.|You're gonna give me nightmares.
{73186}{73226}Listen, I wouldn't worry, Carl.
{73232}{73346}I have a feeling puberty is|light years away for you and me.
{73406}{73498}You know, we should have|never wished on that star, Jimmy,
{73504}{73596}cos I miss my folks.
{73602}{73687}My mom used to|tuck me in bed every night
{73693}{73785}before she was abducted by aliens.
{73791}{73884}Before my dad was abducted by aliens,
{73890}{73943}he would always read me to sleep.
{73949}{74052}Before my mom was inducted by aliens,
{74058}{74195}she would rub my tummy|and she'd sing...
{74246}{74292}- What?|- Nothing.
{74298}{74389}Come on, you guys.|We gotta keep our heads.
{74395}{74479}We'll find 'em.
{75268}{75332}What is it, boy?
{75338}{75417}Sensor sweeps reveal|many advanced cities and...
{75423}{75497}ion energy signatures. That's it!
{75503}{75602}We've found it. I repeat: We've found it.
{75624}{75689}Nick, we'll contact you|as soon as we find the parents
{75695}{75740}so you can kick some alien buttocks.
{75746}{75861}- Piece of cake.|- OK, scouting party, follow me.
{75867}{75961}I'll be back, Nick.
{76140}{76217}Wow. What is that?
{76735}{76847}Wow. They've evolved beyond the need|for mere conventional bodies.
{76853}{76947}They must be an advanced species|millions of years ahead of us.
{76953}{77103}Wow. When I sneeze, it looks like|an advanced species, too.
{77208}{77297}OK, they're this way.
{77338}{77427}Right this way, sire.
{77435}{77547}Ooblar, these humans look so scrawny.|Hardly very appetising.
{77553}{77595}Are you sure they're yummy?
{77601}{77652}I assure you, my slimy sovereign.
{77658}{77706}Poultra will be quite pleased.
{77712}{77795}Humans are mostly water|with a crunchy, bony centre.
{77801}{77846}Think nuts and chews.
{77852}{77907}- There they are.|- What are they doing?
{77913}{78057}- What are those things on their heads?|- It looks like a mind-control device.
{78063}{78112}Mom. Dad. Dad!
{78118}{78160}It's me. Jimmy. Over here.
{78166}{78233}Jim, Jim, Jim, Jimmys,|James, James, Jim.
{78239}{78338}Big, fiery, flying Jimmy. Hi, Jimmy.
{78344}{78443}Some dream, huh? Attack of the big|egg people. I think I've seen this one.
{78449}{78588}No, Dad. You're wearing a mind-control|device. Take yours off. Hurry!
{78614}{78664}- Dad?|- Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
{78670}{78754}Dad, no, no, no. Sh.
{78764}{78831}Jimmy, your dad's like|a mind-control duck man.
{78837}{78889}- Let's get outta here.|- Let's go.
{78895}{78998}Come back. Join us, Jimmy. Join us.
{79163}{79297}Well, well, if it isn't the littlest|rescue party. How cute.
{79303}{79351}Hello, itty-bitty humans.
{79357}{79420}You let us go, you big ball of phlegm.
{79426}{79509}That's no way to talk to the king.|He is the royal phlegm.
{79515}{79563}- Ooblar.|- Sorry, sire.
{79569}{79668}I think it's only fair to warn you that|if you don't release us within 24 hours,
{79674}{79799}an army of trained combat specialists|is poised to destroy your entire planet.
{79805}{79845}- Really?|- Really.
{79851}{79962}Oh, my. Our entire planet.|Whatever shall we do?
{79968}{80085}Do you mean this army|of trained combat specialists?
{80091}{80196}- Hey, it's Nick. Hey, Nick. Oh, man...|- Nick!
{80202}{80286}Get your grubs off me, egghead.
{80293}{80372}Don't look so surprised.|We're an advanced alien race.
{80378}{80441}What did you expect?
{80447}{80493}What do you want with our parents?
{80499}{80577}It's not what I want.|It's what Poultra wants.
{80583}{80642}- Who's Poultra?|- Poultra is our god.
{80648}{80733}The mightiest,|most ferocious creature in all...
{80739}{80845}I get tired of answering this. Roll tape.
{80868}{80987}Hello and welcome to our special|edition of "Poultra: God of Wrath".
{80993}{81116}- Brought to you by Goo...|- Commercials. Hate them.
{81122}{81173}Welcome back. If you're watching this,
{81179}{81279}chances are your friends and/or|relatives are about to be sacrificed
{81285}{81370}to the Mighty Poultra,|which is a great honour indeed.
{81376}{81453}And very painful.
{81485}{81581}And this year's human sacrifices|feature something very special:
{81587}{81624}Actual humans.
{81630}{81706}And it's all thanks to Jimmy Neutron.
{81712}{81862}Greetings from planet Earth. I'm Jimmy|Neutron and you're an alien life form.
{81868}{81929}You know, without the coordinates|you gave us,
{81935}{82002}we never would have found|your puny little planet.
{82008}{82117}For such a tiny earthling, you've been|a very big help, Jimmy Neutron.
{82123}{82201}Guards, throw these minuscule vermin|into the dungeon
{82207}{82335}until they're of worthier size, and give|Mr Neutron the presidential suite.
{82341}{82417}What?
{82533}{82628}Isn't this a funny-wunny little toy?
{82658}{82725}Get it off me! Get it off!
{82731}{82800}Take this infernal thing to the lab|and have it torn apart.
{82806}{82908}Yes, great saliva-armed one.
{82911}{82964}- Hold it. Move along.|- Goddard!
{82970}{83035}Move!
{83619}{83694}So, it was Neutron all along.
{83700}{83740}I mean, he got us into this.
{83746}{83838}Hey, Jimmy, didn't your parents|ever tell you not to talk to strangers?
{83844}{83890}That's rule number one.
{83896}{83958}Come on, you guys. Give him a break.
{83964}{84013}Jimmy didn't mean to ruin our lives
{84019}{84098}and get our parents eaten|by a giant space monster.
{84104}{84223}She's right. We need to ask ourselves|"What would Ultra Lord do?"
{84229}{84336}Let's think about that, Sheen. Maybe|sit on a shelf because he's a doll!
{84342}{84402}He's not. He's an action figure.|There's a difference.
{84408}{84506}Come on, Nick. Let Sheen talk.|Maybe he's onto something.
{84512}{84566}What would Ultra Lord do, Sheen?
{84572}{84612}Well, in episode 224
{84618}{84773}he fried the zeebot's brain with his|heat-seeking infra-thought. It was cool.
{84783}{84831}Well, I'm convinced, folks,
{84837}{84906}that's pretty much|the stupidest thing I ever heard!
{84912}{85024}No. This is the stupidest thing|you've ever heard.
{85034}{85077}You are such a baby.
{85083}{85160}Leave me alone. You're picking|on me because you're insecure.
{85166}{85239}Jimmy, you there?
{85245}{85305}Look, don't listen to them.
{85311}{85357}They're just scared.
{85363}{85405}Are you OK?
{85411}{85486}Yeah. I'm fine.
{85492}{85606}Don't be so hard on yourself.|We'll get out of this.
{85607}{85683}OK, so you made a mistake.
{85689}{85752}Beating yourself up|isn't gonna fix anything.
{85758}{85884}You know, I was the smartest kid|in school until you came along.
{85890}{85972}And I admit you know more|about some things than I do.
{85978}{86048}But I know one thing|that you don't seem to get,
{86054}{86145}and that's that we're never|getting outta here without you.
{86151}{86212}So why don't you buck up, mister,
{86218}{86278}and put that big brain of yours|back to work?
{86284}{86433}Nick can handle the fighting stuff,|but first we have to get out of this cell.
{86446}{86558}Cindy, why are you being|so nice to me?
{86564}{86655}Because there's a bunch of kids|in here that need you.
{86661}{86753}And I do, too.
{86852}{86992}I am never complaining|about my parents again.
{87009}{87078}We didn't even get our one phone call.
{87084}{87166}That's it!|Libby, let me see your cellphone.
{87172}{87224}OK, but I don't think my service plan
{87230}{87287}covers anything|outside our solar system.
{87293}{87414}- Who are you calling?|- A friend of mine.
{87452}{87498}All right, little Earth doggy.
{87504}{87628}Ooblar is going to take you apart|into tiny little pieces.
{87634}{87714}All right?
{87795}{87879}Hey, give me that!
{87881}{87925}Fine. We'll use this one then.
{87931}{88011}No, no, no, no, no. No!
{88017}{88113}Would you stop that? Those are mine.
{88316}{88401}That's not funny! Stop it!|And give me my things.
{88407}{88481}Come on, boy, pick up.
{88493}{88580}Good. Good.|Perhaps we'll get somewhere.
{88586}{88667}Goddard, you're OK.
{88674}{88787}I miss you, too, boy.|Listen, what's your situation?
{88852}{88891}Evil scientist, huh?
{88897}{89016}OK. I got an idea.|Put me on speaker, Goddard.
{89033}{89168}Danger. Danger. You have initiated|self-destruct sequence alpha.
{89174}{89228}That's my bad. Back in you go.
{89234}{89300}Self-destruct sequence|is now engaged.
{89306}{89376}No, no, no, no, no! I put it back in.|You understand me?
{89382}{89480}This unit will yield a 50-megaton|nuclear blast in exactly ten seconds.
{89486}{89571}- That's not good!|- Please clear a 30-square mile area.
{89577}{89631}Thank you and have a nice day.
{89637}{89703}- Ten, nine, eight...|- No, back up!
{89709}{89768}...seven...|- Mother!
{89774}{89833}Is he gone, boy?
{89839}{89946}Great. Lock on to this signal|and get here as fast as you can.
{90104}{90160}Halt. Who goes there?
{90166}{90191}The guard.
{90197}{90247}By order of the esteemed King Goobot,
{90253}{90345}it is my great privilege and honour|to mercilessly exterminate you.
{90351}{90455}Think. Think. Goddard, play dead.
{90686}{90740}Good boy, Goddard. Good boy.
{90746}{90798}Guess I'll make that bug a feature, huh?
{90804}{90844}- Good dog.|- Way to go!
{90850}{90913}- You're a good robot.|- Come on! Let's get the others.
{90919}{91001}Nice work, Jimmy.
{91033}{91096}Hey, Cindy. Thanks.
{91102}{91264}If you ever tell anyone I was nice to you,|you'll wind up looking like that guy.
{91264}{91360}Let's go, Neutron.|It's egg-scrambling time.
{91366}{91461}- Wait for me, Nick.|- Come back!
{91464}{91535}Please?
{91782}{91874}Bring out the humans.
{92185}{92292}Come on, it's showtime. Everybody out.
{92621}{92707}Kick it!
{93169}{93254}- Look, you guys. A football game.|- I don't think so, Carl.
{93260}{93344}Goddard, bino-scope mode.
{93554}{93603}Wow. What a lame half-time show.
{93609}{93692}They're making our parents|dance so lame.
{93698}{93805}No, my dad really dances like that.
{93856}{93950}- The festival is starting.|- Our parents! They'll be eaten!
{93956}{94033}Nobody eats my parents|unless I say so!
{94039}{94095}Come on.
{94101}{94218}Begin the incubation.
{94309}{94389}Come on, Nick.|Show them what you're made of.
{94395}{94432}Halt.
{94438}{94493}Hey, cool spear.
{94499}{94549}You really think so?|I guess so because...
{94555}{94646}Mind if I try?
{94656}{94697}No, no, no!
{94703}{94781}My hero.
{94787}{94890}- Come on, everyone.|- Get 'em, Nick. Come on!
{95334}{95373}My hero?
{95379}{95434}OK, we need another plan.
{95440}{95530}Probably a Nick-less one.
{95659}{95736}Poultra! Poultra!
{95742}{95817}Poultra! Poultra!
{95823}{95921}Citizens of Yokus,|I, King Goobot the Fifth,
{95927}{96039}give you sacrifice.
{96192}{96289}That's a big chicken.
{96464}{96548}What do we do now?
{96858}{96942}Think. Think.
{97084}{97119}Brain blast!
{97125}{97187}OK, everybody, listen up.|We don't have much time.
{97193}{97243}I've got to make it to that control tower.
{97249}{97340}Cindy, Libby, keep the guards busy|until Sheen arrives with the ship.
{97346}{97422}OK, I heard the ship part,|but was that "Sheen get the ship"?
{97428}{97459}Yeah, yeah.
{97465}{97558}There's a transport ship in that airfield|big enough to carry all of us out.
{97564}{97647}- I need you to get it here fast.|- But I don't have a driver's licence.
{97653}{97728}- I have no hand-eye coordination...|- Sheen, ask yourself,
{97734}{97810}what would Ultra Lord do?
{97837}{97876}I accept this responsibility,
{97882}{97966}understanding the consequences|that you've bestowed against me.
{97972}{98021}Poultra, din-dins.
{98027}{98126}Yummy, yummy. Foodie, woodie.
{98162}{98243}This is it, people. These crummy|aliens stole our parents.
{98249}{98327}It's time to show them what we're|made of. We're tough! We're mean!
{98333}{98384}Darn it, we're carbon-based life forms.
{98390}{98482}- Now, who's gonna kick buttocks?|- The carbon-based life forms!
{98488}{98584}Yeah!
{98644}{98690}What is this?
{98696}{98804}- Stop those kids.|- After 'em.
{98861}{98936}Cindy, Purple Flurp.
{98942}{99032}Dragon whips her tail.
{99244}{99328}Let's dance.
{99482}{99532}Yeah, Jimmy.
{99538}{99600}Come on, boy.
{99606}{99697}- Jimmy!|- Carl, "show and tell".
{99703}{99772}Come here, you.
{99778}{99862}I can't see! I can't see!
{99884}{99988}You want some? You want some?|You want a piece of me?
{99994}{100078}I didn't think so.
{100225}{100297}Munchy-crunchy time.
{100303}{100387}There you go.
{100387}{100462}- Fetch, boy.|- Hey, hey, give me that.
{100468}{100564}- Come back here, you!|- Everybody up.
{100737}{100806}Hey, nice party. Gotta blast.
{100812}{100866}Neutron.
{100872}{100949}OK, let's move out.
{100996}{101104}Guards, vaporise the Earth brats.
{101193}{101277}Hurry, head for the exit.
{101294}{101357}- Hey, where's Sheen?|- I don't know.
{101363}{101440}Stop them!
{101738}{101830}All right, Sheen!
{101834}{101953}Your ship awaits, Captain Jimmy.
{102227}{102302}Ooblar, protect!
{102388}{102423}Pooh.
{102429}{102511}Everybody to the ship!
{102529}{102599}Poultra, quickly.|Your dinner's getting away.
{102605}{102707}- OK, keep up. Let's get out of here.|- Come on!
{102846}{102919}We gotta do this quick.|Launch positions.
{102925}{102981}Temperature optimal.|Engaging plasma coils.
{102987}{103107}- Jim, I think we better leave now.|- Countdown! Ten, nine, eight...
{103113}{103185}One!
{103423}{103546}- To my ships.|- And can someone bring me a bucket?
{103604}{103713}Jimmy, here they come!
{103784}{103855}Time to discipline the naughty children.
{103861}{103926}Open fire.
{104172}{104270}OK, who wants fried chicken?
{104793}{104873}So, Neutron, now it's just you and I.
{104879}{104935}All weapons online.
{104941}{105011}Ultra Lord is not afraid of chickens
{105017}{105101}He is not afraid...
{105135}{105210}He may be a little bit|afraid of chickens
{105216}{105266}This thing's too slow. I can't outrun 'em.
{105272}{105339}- Incoming message.|- On screen.
{105345}{105407}You see, Jimmy, you can't win.
{105413}{105479}All of your friends and family|would be safe at home,
{105485}{105559}if it wasn't for one little problem. You.
{105565}{105676}- Little?|- Now you all must die!
{105682}{105765}Little, huh? I'll show you little.
{105771}{105809}Cindy, take over. Come on, boy.
{105815}{105934}What are you doing?|Is this one of those macho things?
{105940}{106059}I know we haven't field-tested this|feature yet, but we've no choice, buddy.
{106065}{106149}Goddard, flycycle!
{106334}{106441}Would you look at this? I do believe|he's going to ram us, Ooblar.
{106447}{106544}Remind me to clean|the windshield later.
{106608}{106676}You steal my parents,|you threaten my dog...
{106682}{106723}Itsy-bitsy Jimmy Neutron.
{106729}{106793}He does look a bit small and silly,|doesn't he, sire?
{106799}{106876}You attack my friends|and you made fun of my size.
{106882}{106937}- Tiny, tiny.|- So, so tiny.
{106943}{107092}Well, I may be small,|but I've got a big brain.
{107217}{107280}Not tiny!
{107302}{107376}Can't we call this whole thing|a mistake and go back to your plan -
{107382}{107497}rendezvous for universal|brotherhood and whatnot?
{107700}{107766}You've not seen the last of us,
{107772}{107856}Jimmy Neutron!
{107890}{107944}You look marvellous|sunny-side up, sire.
{107950}{108033}That's no yolk.
{108040}{108113}All right, Jimmy! Good job!
{108119}{108268}Orbiting around Jimmy's big head.|Estimated time to ear: Seven minutes.
{108383}{108451}So, I guess I can't|call you short any more.
{108457}{108609}Don't worry. I'm sure there are all kinds|of other insults you can come up with.
{108740}{108811}Let me tell you,|as soon as we get home,
{108817}{108910}we're going out dancing!
{108966}{109004}Ultra Dad!
{109010}{109090}Ultra Son!
{109102}{109137}Dad! Daddy!
{109143}{109192}Hey, Neutron.
{109198}{109254}Nice job.
{109260}{109344}Thanks.
{109351}{109444}I've got that for you, dear.
{109496}{109541}Mom, Dad,
{109547}{109635}I should have listened to you|when you said don't talk to strangers.
{109641}{109752}See, I guess I thought I was smart|enough to do everything on my own -
{109758}{109806}that I didn't need you.
{109812}{109860}But I was wrong.
{109866}{109907}I love you guys.
{109913}{109970}We love you too, Jimmy.
{109976}{110048}Having a genius for a son|may not always be easy,
{110054}{110103}but it's always interesting.
{110109}{110153}You make us so proud.
{110159}{110198}You sure do, son.
{110204}{110283}You know, not every family|gets to ride in an alien spaceship,
{110289}{110385}hurtling through the universe at warp|speeds, millions of miles from home.
{110391}{110525}- We thank you for that.|- You gotta admit, that is pretty neat.
{110649}{110703}There you are, gentlemen.
{110709}{110750}- Freeze!|- It's OK, Carl.
{110756}{110830}- It's just breakfast.|- I knew that.
{110836}{110901}I don't remember|buying this brand of soda.
{110907}{111001}- No, no, Mom... Mom, you...|- Jimmy, it's just soda.
{111007}{111091}Mom, no!
{111093}{111185}Goodness! Excuse me.
{111191}{111242}Boy, it's a scorcher out there.
{111248}{111320}- Thanks, honey.|- Hugh!
{111337}{111424}Well, at least it's coming out|of the attic, not the basement.
{111430}{111466}Hugh!
{111472}{111553}Mom!
{111680}{111780}James Isaac Neutron...
{113300}{113331}Onward, Mr Wiggles.
{113337}{113431}We reach the cafeteria by dawn.

-[Scoffs]
[Indistinct Muttering]
Uh, Tulio!
-Excuse us, for one moment, please.
-Tulio, look!
-El Dorado, the city of gold.
-[Sighs]
This could be our destiny, our fate.
Miguel, if I believed in fate,
I wouldn't be playing with loaded dice.
-Hmmm. [Chuckling]
-Not with the face. No, no, no, no, no.
-No! No! No!
-[Whimpering, Panting]
I said one more roll!
My map against your cash.
-Hmm?
-[Dice Clattering]
-All right, peewee. You're on!
-Not with those!
This time we use my dice.
Ehh, got a problem with that?
[Whimpers] No.

[Gasps]
Your dice are loaded!
What?
You gave me loaded dice?
[Grunts]
-He gave me loaded dice!
-[Crowd Murmurs]
-Guard, arrest him!
-You dare to impugn my honor?
He was the one who was cheating!
Arrest him! He tricked these sailors and took their money!
-Oh, now, I'm the thief?
-Yes.
Take a look in the mirror, pal!
Oh, you better give them that money back, or I'll--
-En garde!
-En garde, yourself.
I will give you the honor of a quick and painless death.
But not with that. Ha!
I prefer to fight fairly. Aha!
-[Growls]
-Well, any last words?
I will cut you to ribbons,
-fool!
-Such mediocrity.
Let your sword do the talking.
-I will.
It will be loquacious to a fault!
-Ha! Take that!
[Both Grunting]
-You... mincing, fencing, twit.
-Ah, you fight like my sister.
I fought your sister.
That's a compliment.
-Braggart!
-Heathen!
-[Man] Kill him!
-Not the face. Not the face.
[All Gasping, Clamoring]
Ladies and gentlemen, we've decided it's a draw.
[Miguel]
Thank you all for coming.
-You've been great. See you soon.
-Adios!
-Congratulations. You're very good.
-No. That was good.
-Very--
-[Snort]
-[Gasping]
-[Mooing, Snorting]
-We should have kept our swords, I think.
-Y-Yeah.
-[Snorting]
-[Tulio Whispering]
Yeah, I've got a plan.
-What is it?
-Uh, well-Uh, you...
-pet him, and... I'll...

[Chorus] Ol√©
[Groans]
[Fabric Ripping]
[Both Grunting]
-Uhh--
-Ohh--
-I'll bet we can make that.
-[Men Shouting]
-[Guard] There they are!
-Two pesetas says we can't.
You're on!
[Both Yelling]
-[Miguel] You lose!
-[Coins Jingling]
-[Miguel]Ohhh!
-[Tulio] Whoa! What's happening here?
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.
[Muffled Grunts, Groans]
Okay, Miguel, we gotta move fast.
-On three, we jump out and head for the dock.
-Good. Good. Excellent.
[Together]
One, two, three--
-[Both Grunting] Th-Three!
-[Creaking]
-[Both Straining] Three! Ohh!
-[Creaking Continues]
[Straining]
Three!
[Tulio]Uh, you ready?
Ah, okay. One more. Let's go.
[Together]
One, two, three!
-[Fly Buzzing]
-[Wind Whistling]
-Excuse us.
-Okay. We're outta here.
-Who ordered the, uh, pickles?
-[Sailor Laughing]
[Grunting]
Cortes!
-My crew was as carefully chosen as the disciples of Christ.
-[Cracks Knuckles]
-And I will not tolerate stowaways.
-[Gulps]
You will be flogged.
And when we put into Cuba to resupply,
God willing, you will be flogged some more... and then enslaved on the sugar plantations... for the rest of your miserable lives.
To the brig.
All right!
Cuba!
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Whistling]
-[Chuckles]
-[Nickers]
Hey, Altivo!
Ah-ta-ta, not for you!
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.
-[Gasps]
-[Banging]
[Banging Continues]
So, uh, how's the--
How's the escape plan coming?
All right.
All right. Wait!
-I'm getting something.
-Yeah.
Okay!
Here's the plan.
-In the dead of night, you and I grab some provisions,
-Mm-hm. hijack one of those long boats, and then we row back to Spain like there's no ma√±ana!
-Back to Spain, yeah?
-Yeah.
-In a rowboat.
-You got it!
Great. Sensational.
And that-that's your plan, is it?
-That's pretty much it.
-Well, I like it.
-So, how do we get on deck?
-Umm.
In the dead of night, you and I grab some provisions,
-hijack one of those longboats--
-Uh, great.
Okay, what's your idea, smart guy?
Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Don't ask me that! You're the one with the plans.
-[Horse Whinnying]
- Wait, I-I have an idea.
Uh, come on. Give me--
Give me a boost.
Hey, Altivo.
Altivo.
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.
-[Hooves Clattering]
-You have to do a trick for me first.
Huh?
[Sputtering]
All you have to do is find a pry bar.
A long piece of iron with a hooky thing at the end. Yeah?
-Miguel, you're talking to a horse!
-[Hooves Clattering]
That's it, Altivo, find the pry bar.
-Yes, find the prybar.
-[Whinnying]
-He can't understand "pry bar."
-[Clattering Continues]
He's a dumb horse.
There's no way--
[Whinnying]
Well, it's not a pry bar.
-[Wind Howling]
-[Ship Creaking]
-[Gasps]
-[Nickers]
Oh, Altivo.
Oh, thank you, old boy.
Listen, if we can ever return the favor--
For Pete's sake, Miguel, he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.
Come on, before he licks you to death.
-Adios.
-[Whinnies]
Shh, shh. Shh.
Quiet, please.
-What's the matter with him?
-Oh, he wants his apple.
-Well, give it to him before he wakes the whole ship!
-[Bellowing]
-Fetch!
-[Whinnying] Huh?
[Snoring]
[Gasps]
Hmm?
[Hoof beats Clatter, Stop Abruptly]
-Huh?
-Huh?
-[Whinnying]
[Whinnying]
-Altivo!
-Huh? Miguel!
[Yelling]
-Altivo, I'm coming!
-Miguel!
Just hang on!
I'm right here, old boy!
-Have you lost your mind?
-Help is coming!
[Gasps]
Ho-o-ly ship!
[Miguel, Tulio] Whoa!
[All Gasping]
-Loop the rope under the horse!
-Yes!
On the count of three, pull back on the rope.
-What? [Gasps]
-Three!
-[Tulio] Pull!
-[Grunting]
Tulio!
Hey, it worked!
Did any of the supplies make it?
-Well, uh, yes and no.
-[Crunching Sound]
Ohhh, great!
Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get--
Excuse me.
Were you going to say "worse"?
-No. No.
-No? You're sure?
-Absolutely not.
I've revised the whole thing.
-Okay, because--
-[Tulio] Yeah, we're at least in a rowboat.
-We're in a rowboat, exactly.
[Miguel]
You miss nothing.
[Grunting, Groaning]
-[Grunting, Groaning Continue]
-[Whinnying]
[Yelling]
-[Groaning]
-[Gasps]
[Together] Ahh!
[Coughs]
[Smacking Lips]
[All Sobbing]
Tulio, did you ever imagine it would end like this?
-The horse is a surprise.
-[Nickers]
Any... regrets?
Besides dying?
Yeah.
I never... had enough... gold.
My regret, besides dying, is... our greatest adventure is over before it began, and no one will even remember us.
Well, if it's any consolation, Miguel, you... made my life... an adventure.
[Sobbing]
And if it's any consolation,
Tulio, [Sniffles]
-you made my life... rich.
-[Sobbing Continues]
[Scoffs, Sputters]
[Both Sobbing]
[Shuddering Gasp]
[Moans]
-[Gasps] Is it?
-Hmm. [Gasps]
It is! It's-It's--
It's-It's-It's--
[Both] It's land!
-[Both Screaming]
-[Whinnying]
All in favor of getting back in the boat, say "aye."
-Aye!
-Aye! Go!
-[Nickers]
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!
Miguel!
Hello!
Tulio!
We've done it!
-What's that? The map?
-It's all right here!
You still have the map?
The whistling rock!
The stream!
You kept the map, but you couldn't grab a little more food?
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:
It could be possible.
And it is!
It really is... the map to El Dorado!
[Panting]
-You drank seawater, didn't you?
-Oh, come on!
I'm not coming on!
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle for a million pesetas!
-How about a hundred million?
-What?
I just thought that, after all, since El Dorado is the city of gold--
-What's your point?
-You know, dust, nuggets, bricks, a temple of gold where you can pluck gold from the very walls.
But you don't want to go, so let's... get back into the boat and row back to Spain.
-After all, it worked so well last time.
-[Gibberish] Wait!
Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,
-and then we go back to Spain.
-And buy Spain!
-Yeah!
-That's the spirit!
-Come on, Tulio.
We'll follow that trail!
-What trail?
The trail that we blaze!
[Nickers]
That trail that we blaze!
-[Mutters]
-[Whinnies]
Oh, no, you don't.
Yeow! Your horse bit me in the butt!
-[Chittering]
-[Hissing]
Look out new world
Here we come
-Brave, intrepid
-Charge!
And then some
Pioneers of maximum audacity
Whose r√©sum√©s show that we are just the team
-To live where others merely dream
-What are you looking at?
-Building up our head of steam
-Whoa!
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus] On the trail
On the trail we blaze
-Dinner is served.
-Hello.
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la
The promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold a child
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
[Chorus]
On the trail we blaze
The trail we blaze
Is road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be fainthearted
We are part of a sumptuous grand design
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
[Creaking, Crackling]
-On the trail we blaze
-[Yelling]
[Yelling Continues]
[All Grunting]
[Groaning]
Hmm.
-[Snaps Fingers]
Miguel. Miguel, wake up.
-[Moans]
-We're there. Oh, yeah. We found it.
-We found it? Oh!
Fantastic!
Where is it? How far?
-Right here! Here.
-Where? Behind the rock?
-No, no. This is it.
-[Stammering]
Give me that!
This ca-What?
-Apparently, "El Dorado" is native for...
-[Muttering]
"great, big... rock"!
[Echoing]
Hey, but I tell you what, I'm feeling generous, so you can have my share!
You don't think Cortes could've gotten here before us and--
And what?
Taken all the really big rocks?
-The scoundrel!
-Tulio, you--
We have to think about this.
We've come all this way,
-and we-we-we should really, you know--
-Get... on... the horse!
[Sighs]
No, no, no, not with the face.
Stop.
[Clears Throat] Looks like there's a pass right over there.
[Panting] Ohh!
[Panting Continues]
-[Grunting, Gasps]
-[Whinnying]
-[Men Shouting]
-[Both Gasping]
-[Both] Hyah!
-[Whinnying]
-[All Gasping]
-[Snorting]
[Gasping, Grunting]
[Chuckles] I've--
Uh, hello. Is this your rock?
Sorry. We were just looking.
We're, uh--
We're tourists!
Tourist.
-[Clears Throat]
-We-We lost our group. May we go now?
-[Gasps]
-[Chuckles] Spears.
[Grunts]
[Nickers]
[Chittering]
Hey! Hey!
-[Chittering]
-[Bird Calling]
[Bird Calling Continues]
[Sighs Dejectedly]
[Whistling]
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Oh, my--
[Miguel]
It's-It's--[Gasps]
[Both Whispering]
El Dorado.
-[Giggling]
-Oh!
[Chittering]
-[Chuckling]
-[Children Giggling]
[Whispering]
[Chanting]
[Whispering]
Mmm. Ah!
[Chattering]
[Sighs] Well, it was nice working with you, partner.
Tulio, I just want you to know...
I'm sorry about that girl in Barcelona.
-So-You-You, f--
-[Man]Behold!
As the prophesies foretold, the time of judgment is now!
[Both Gasping]
Citizens, did I not predict that the gods would come to us?
Hmm.
[Chuckling]
My lords, I am Tzekel-Kan, your devoted high priest and speaker for the gods.
Hey.
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?
-Huh? I am Miguel.
-[Murmuring]
-And I am Tulio.
-[Murmuring Continues]
And they call us Miguel and Tulio!
[Tzekel-Kan] Your arrival has been greatly anticipated.
My lords, how long will you be staying in El Dorado?
-[Whimpering]
-Aha! I see you've captured this temple-robbing thief.
-How would you have us punish her?
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
My lord, I am not a thief.
See, the gods sent me a vision... to bring them tribute from the temple to guide them here.
My only wish is to serve the gods.
-Release her, don't ya think?
-[Villagers Gasp]
-[Grunts]
-Then you will begin by returning this... to its rightful place.
[Chittering]
-My lords, why now do you choose to visit us?
-[Scoffs]
Enough!
You do not question... the gods!
That's right!
Do not question us, or we shall have to unleash our awesome and terrible power!
And you don't want that!
-Well, yes! We do!
-You do?
Of course we do!
Visit your wrath upon this nonbeliever!
Show us the truth of your divinity!
-Divinity! One moment.
-[Chuckles]
Miguel, you know that little voice people have... that tells them to quit when they're ahead?
-You don't have one!
-Well, I'm sorry. I got carried away!
-Way away!
-Maybe we should tell the truth and beg for mercy.
Are you nuts?
We'd be butchered alive!
Yes, but they're getting suspicious.
-And if we don't come up with so me mega-cosmic event--
-[Rumbling]
-[Altivo Whinnying]
-[Chittering]
I'm trying! I'm trying! I can't think with all these distractions!
-You-Horse--
-Think horse. Think, think, think.
I'm on the verge of--
Stop! [Echoing]
[Coughing Sound]
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Crickets Chirping]
[Villagers Chanting]
-[Chanting Continues]
-Don't make me start it up again,
'cause I will.
[Chanting Continues]
O mighty lords!
Come.
Let me show you to your temple.
All right!
Temple.
Step aside.
[Villagers Murmuring]
[Panting]
[Grunting]
[Panting Continues]
[Sputters]
To commemorate your arrival,
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare a glorious feast for you tonight.
Which would you prefer?
-Both.
-Both.
-[Together] Both.
Both is good.
-My lords.
-My lords.
And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar.
Happy New Year.
[Chuckles]
-Hey!
-Hey. Hey.
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
[Whinnying]
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.
-[Tulio]
It's an entire city of suckers.
-[Miguel Laughing]
We just have to keep this up long enough... to load up on the gold and then get the hell out of here!
Tulio, we'll be living like kings!
-Miguel and Tulio!
-Tulio and Miguel!
-Mighty and powerful gods.
-Gods.
-Hello.
-[Both Gasping, Whimpering]
-[Laughing]
-Depart, mortal,
-before we strike you with a lightning bolt.
-Mmm. Mmmm!
[Humming]
Beware the wrath of the gods! Begone!
[Clicking Sound]
Save it for the high priest, honey.
You're gonna need it.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel, it's not working.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel! We've been caught.
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?
-How?
-Well, if you guys want the gold, then you don't want to get caught, right?
-You're going to need my help.
-[Scoffs] What makes you think we need your help?
-"Ck-ck." Are you serious?
-[Whinnies]
I-What-We--
Okay. So, uh, who are you?
-Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
-[Laughs] No angle.
-I want in.
-In?
-On the scam.
-[Chuckles]
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a--
-Why?
-So I can get out.
I thought she just said she wanted in?
She wants in so she can get out.
Aha! Got it.
[Chuckles]
-W-Why?
-Think you're the only ones who dream of better things?
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons, and I've got mine.
Let's not make it personal, okay?
-It's just business.
-[Both] Oh.
So when you guys are ready to go back to... wherever you came from,
-I'm going with you.
-[Laughs]
No!
Don't think so.
[Coughs]
-[Whistling]
-All right. Fine.
After all, I'm sure you know... the proper rituals for blessing a tribute, the holiest days on the calendar--
Oh, and of course you know all about Xibalba.
[Chuckles]
Okay? Good luck.
-See you at the execution.
-[Gibberish]
Wait! Ho--
Would you-Hold it.
-[Chuckles] Deal?
-Hmm.
-Deal.
-Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means you'll want these back?
-How'd you get those?
-Where was she keeping them?
-Call me, Chel, your new partner.
-Uh,
-that's partner-in-training.
-[Humming]
Now, put these on.
Your public's waiting.
[Continues]
-[Chel Giggling]
-Do you mind?
No.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Giggles]
Right. Uh, excuse me.
-[Grunting]
-Bye.
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call this place "Chel Dorado."
[Chuckles]
She's whoo--
-Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
-What?
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?
Ju-Ju-Just for a second imagine that you have one.
What would it be saying about Chel?
-[Purrs]
-No. No. Listen.
-We are partners.
-We are partners.
-We have a plan, remember?
-Get the gold. Go back to Spain.
Yes! And we are pretending to be gods.
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?
-Listen carefully.
-[Gasps]
-Chel is off-limits, hmm?
-Bravo! Chel is off-limits!
Shake on it.
-Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
-[Both] Mmmm.
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.
We must avoid giving in to temptation.
-Gods. Oh. This is gonna be tougher than I thought.
-Tulio, relax!
All you have to do is smile, act godly and follow my lead.
[Gasps]
[Gasps] Big smile.
Like you mean it.
A-one, two, three.
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
-[Groaning]
-Tulio, what are you talking about?
There again they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in
-The interim
-Interim, interim
It's me and him
Oh, my God!
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those prayers and those salaams
And who am I to bridle
If I'm forced to be an idol
If they say that I'm a god
That's what I am
What's more if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see us being sacrificed
-Or stuffed
-You have a point there.
Very good thinking.
-So let's be gods
The perks are great
-Yeah!
-El Dorado on our plates
-Thank you.
Local feelings should not
-Be rebuffed
-Never rebuffed
I never rebuff a local feeling
No, my friend
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet
-That's our advice
-It's great advice!
Be a symbol of perfection
Be a legend
Be a cult
Take their praise
Take a collection
As the multitudes exalt
Don a supernatural habit
-We'd be crazy not to grab it
-You got it!
So sign on two new gods
For paradise
Par-a-dise
-[Continues]
-[Chattering, Laughing]
-[Screeching]
-[Drunken Whinnying]
[Fades, Ends]
[Both Snoring, Mumbling]
-[Metallic Clattering]
-[Both Gasping]
Good morning, my lords!
-He's back!
-Oh, no.
And now it's my turn!
-The gods have awakened!
-[Cheering]
Whoa!
[Groans]
Mm-hmm.
-[Grunts]
-[Whimpering]
-Hey, Chel, what's going on?
-It's not gonna be good.
Thank you.
This city has been granted a great blessing.
And what have we done to show our gratitude?
A meager celebration.
-The gods deserve a proper tribute!
-[Crowd Gasping]
-Hmm.
-Hmm.
The beginning of a new era, the dawning of a new age... demands... sacrifice!
-[All Gasping]
-[Gasps]
-I don't like this.
-Tulio, we've got to do something.
[Groans]
-[Groaning]
-[Yells]
[Tulio]Stop!
Hmm?
-This is not a proper tribute!
-[Moaning]
-[Crowd Gasps]
-You do not want the tribute?
No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.
Uh, it's just that, uh--
Tulio, tell him.
The stars are not in position for this tribute!
Like he says, the stars--
Can't do it.
Not today.
Ah.
Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.
-Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive--
-Hmm.
My lords, may the people of El Dorado offer you our tribute.
[Crowd Gasping]
[Gasps]
[Gasping Continues]
My lords, does this please you?
-[Sighs]
-Yes, very nice.
-Certainly acceptable.
-Yes, lovely. It'll do.
The gods have chosen!
To Xibalba?
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-No. No.
[Together] To Xibalba!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Oh, great.
[Cheering Continues]
Hey, Chel, um, what are they doing?
They're sending it to Xibalba, the spirit world.
-The spirit world.
-I'll take care of it.
[Clears Throat]
Um, excuse me, Chief.
The gods have changed their minds about Xibalba.
They wish to bask in the reverence that has been shown them.
Stop!
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-They wish to bask!
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Humming]
Nice going.
[Chuckles]
Smile while you can.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
[Evil Chuckle]
-[Tulio]Ai-ai-ai.
-Tons of gold for you, hah
-And tons of gold for me, hoo
-[Together]
Tons of gold for we, ah
-Not bad for a day's work, eh?
-Not bad at all.
We just became richer than the king of Spain. [Laughing]
You know, speaking of kings, the chief and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.
Buenos d√≠as!
Listen, all we have to do... is keep playing the one against the other.
You know, do a little god dance, chant some mystic mumbo jumbo, dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors and then get the hell back to Spain.
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna get all this back to Spain?
Ummm--
-A boat?
-[Tulio] Yeah.
Um, we really hate to be ascending so soon, but, uh, some urgent business has come up--
-family matters-and it's just a bit--
-Yeah, family.
Badda-bing, budda-boom, you know what I mean.
Oh, we expected you to be staying with us... for the next... thousand years.
Well, as we say in the spirit world,
-there's your plan and then... there's the gods' plan.
-Mm-hmm.
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...
-kind of in a horizontal pattern at first.
-[Chuckles]
And then we're gonna go vertical, uh, as we get further out to sea.
Hmm. To build a boat large and glorious enough... would take... about a week.
-A week? Hmm.
-Um--
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.
But-But for the gods, uh, three days.
Uh--
Well, if that's the best you can do.
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened with so much tribute, you could leave sooner.
-Hmm?
-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.
-[Tulio]No, three days is not fine.
-[Chel Humming]
-This is a real--
-Mmm.
-these-these are the ones-problem.
-Oh. Thank you.
-Miguel, how are we gonna keep this up for three days?
-[Yawns]
You worry too much.
No, I worry exactly the right amount.
You can never worry too much.
We just have to lie low.
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's--
No! Don't even move!
-Tulio--
-You're moving!
-A little, but-Come on.
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-[Stammering] Stay!
-I gotta-I--
-[Groans]Just... stand there!
-I just--
For three days?
-[Clatter]
-Yes! Exactly.
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?
All right.
We lie low.
No, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.
Great! Good. Okay.
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.
-[Giggling]
[Kissing]
Oh, yum, yum, yum.
[Kissing Continues]
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah!
-You know, you really shouldn't miss it.
-I know.
But I-I couldn't.
Go ahead.
I'll cover for you.
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-[Tulio Singing, Indistinct]
-So, what happened to Altivo?
-I don't know.
Tulio goes for paradise
-Hey, what happened to Miguel?
-I don't know.
Oh, my God! He's gone!
Miguel's gone!
He's loose!
What am I gonna do?
Oh, no, no!
[Sobbing]
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.
[Groaning]
Oh. Ooh.
[Moans]
-Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, down, down, down.
-[Humming]
-No! No! Big trouble.
-[Gasps]
[Chuckling] Whoa!
Look, sweetheart, we're in the middle of a con here, walking the razor's edge.
On the one hand, gold!
On the other hand, painful, agonizing failure!
[Clears Throat] I can't afford any tempta-uh, distractions.
So, I'm sorry.
So sorry.
[Sharp Inhale] But perhaps another time? Another place, hmm?
[Chuckles]
Too bad. I'm free now.
I'm... not really sure
I trust you.
Mmm, I'm not really asking you to trust me.
-Am I?
-Whoo.
'Kay.
[Moans]
Ooh, yeah.
[Chirping]
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Hey, where is everybody?
They've been cleared from the streets, my lord, so the city can be cleansed, as you ordered.
-Cleansed?
-Yes.
So the Age of the Jaguar can begin,
-as you ordered, my lord.
-[Man]Get back in!
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop that!
-[Guard]Move!
-Hey, stop that!
What are you doing?
Stop that!
But, my lord, anyone who disobeys your orders... must be punished, as you ordered.
It seems I've been giving a lot of orders, haven't I?
Tzekel-Kan has made your commands clear, my lord.
Really?
-Here's an order: Take the day off.
-Huh?
-Are you all right?
-[Panting]
-Here.
-[Whimpers]
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.
[Random Notes]
[Tuning]
[Continues]
-[Whinnies]
-Hey, Altivo. There you are.
-[Gasps]
-[Strums]
[Playing A Tune]
-Oh.
-Oh.
[Both Chuckling]
[Murmuring]
[Continues]
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
I love you
I love you
Without question
I love you
I'd believe in anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
Oh, I love you
[Chuckles]
[All Chuckling]
[Whinnies]
Hmm. This is not what I expected.
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.
[Chuckling]
How do I look?
Oh, uh-Well, you--
Oh, shut up.
-[Tulio Gasps]Oh! Whoa!
-[Chel Humming]
-[Tzekel-Kan]My lord?
-[Gasps]
-Hello?
-The high priest.
-Ow!
[Gasps] What's he gonna think if he finds one of the gods like this with me?
Uh, lucky god?
J-Just-Just-Just--
[Groans]
-Hello?
-Whoa!
Oh, Tzekel-Kan!
-What brings you here?
-I-I-I-I-I humbly request an audience with you, my lord.
-Yes, what can I do for you?
-My lord, I have just seen
Lord Miguel out among the people.
-Really?
-If I may be so bold as to offer some advice.
-All right. Shoot.
-[Clears Throat]
My lord, you are perfect.
[Chuckles]
Oh, well. Go on.
But in your perfection, you cannot know how imperfect humans are.
-Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.
-[Hissing]
They are as untrustworthy as rats, stealing and cheating with no remorse.
Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!
Stop it!
That's disgusting.
They're beyond disgusting!
-Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
-Then we're in agreement.
I'll begin the necessary preparations immediately.
Do you wish to have your victims bound to an altar, or would you prefer them free-range?
-[Mutters]
-And will you be devouring their essence whole... or piece by piece?
Tzekel, you've lost me.
My lord, these people will not respect you if they do not fear you.
And, of course, we'll make them fear us by--
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied
-The history of the Age of the Jaguar will be written in--
-Ink?
-Blood!
-Blood! Oh, right.
Of course. I should probably consult with Lord Miguel.
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh, blood issue right away.
Excuse us, won't you?
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
Finally... we're connecting.
[Horse Whinnies]
[Nickering]
This way.
-[Chief Laughing]
-[Chuckling, Panting]
[Grunts]
-What do you think you're doing?
-[Chuckles] Lying low.
[Grunts]
Look, change of plans.
-We have to grab what we can carry and get out of here now!
-What? Why?
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants--
-This is unacceptable!
-Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.
The gods should not be playing ball like this!
-Well, exactly!
-This is how the gods should play ball!
-[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-Well, don't blame me.
-I blame you.
What is the object of this game, pray tell?
You've gotta knock the ball through the hoop.
-What hoop?
-That hoop.
-[Cheering Continues]
-That's impossible.
-We're gonna lose.
-Gods don't lose.
[Rumbling]
[Men] Heep-ha!
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors are the finest ballplayers in the city.
-[Grunting, Gargling]
-Fifteen mere mortals against two gods.
[Both Gulp]
-I realize it's a bit uneven,
-[Warriors] Heep-ha! but I do hope they'll challenge you enough to make the game... interesting.
-Play ball!
-[Crowd Cheering]
Crush them into the dust.
[Chuckles]
-Enjoy.
-[Crowd Chanting]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-[Rumbling]
-[Chanting, Cheering Continue]
-[Yells]
-[Gasps]
-D'oh. D'oh.
-[Murmuring]
[All Grunting]
My lords, were you not supposed to put the ball into play?
Ohh!
[Chuckles]
Well, no, no, no, no, no--
We were merely demonstrating the, um, traditional, uh, first avoidance maneuver.
Ah.
I've never heard of such a thing.
Excuse me.
Who invented this game?
-Why, the gods, [Chuckles] of course.
-[Chuckles]
I'm warning you, don't push your luck with this guy.
But, Tulio, we're the gods.
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Grunts]
Tulio!
The hip! The hip!
[Groans]
-[Panting] This is impossible.
-[Grunts]
-[Cheering]
-[Groaning]
-[Horn Sounds]
-Excuse me?
-Heep--
-Haaa!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
[Both Groan]
-[Warriors Chanting]
-[Footsteps Rumbling]
[Chel]
Foul! That was a foul!
[Chanting Continues]
-[Squeaks]
-[Gasps]
[Warrior]
New ball!
[Both Panting]
How long does this go on anyway?
The game is over when the shadow touches this line.
-We need a miracle.
-No, we need to cheat.
-[Warriors Shouting]
-[Crowd Cheering]
[Chittering]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Horn Sounding]
-[Both] Huh?
-[All Grunting]
Hey!
-[Laughing]
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Both] Ol√©!
-[Crowd Chanting, Indistinct]
-[All] Huh?
-[Women Cheering]
-Hmm.
Yes! [Laughs]
-Who's the god?
-You de god.
-No, you the god. Fine.
-No, you de god.
[Giggling]
Y-Yeah! Yeah!
[Coughs]
Guys, it's here!
It's right here with me!
-[Both Gasp]
-[Altivo Whinnies]
[Gasping]
-[All Gasping]
-[Chittering]
Mmm.
[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-I love this game! [Laughing]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
-Well done, partner.
-Yes! Yes!
-My lords, congratulations on your victory.
And now, you will, of course, wish to have the losing team...
-sacrificed to your glory.
-[Crowd Gasping]
[Groaning]
Not again.
-Look, Tzekel-Kan,
-Uh, Miguel?
-forget the sacrifices.
-Miguel.
We don't want any sacrifices.
But all of the sacred writings say that you will devour the wicked and the unrighteous.
Well, I don't see anyone here who fits that description.
[Scoffs]
Well, as speaker for the gods, it would be my privilege to point them out.
The gods are speaking for themselves now!
This city and these people... have no need for you anymore!
[Grunts]
There will be no sacrifices!
-Not now, not ever!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Get out!
-[Gasps]
-[Scoffs]
-[Cheering Continues]
[Gasps]
[Low Growl]
Mmm. As the... gods... command.
-[Laughing]
-[Crowd Cheering]
Whoa! Who-o-oa!
Hey, not bad for my first commandment, huh? [Laughs]
Miguel, the little voice--
[Stammers]
Yeah, fine.
Do you know why the gods demand blood?
-I don't know.
-[Grunts]
Because gods don't bleed.
It's time to take the future into my own hands, and this city will be cleansed.
Even if I have to do it myself.
-Uh, how?
-[Grunts]
There are dark magics here... and power... and--
Ooh. My, my, my, my, my.
It's not called the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.
[Snickering]
This'll be a delightful way to bid the false gods... good-bye.
[Workers Shouting]
Hmm.
-Adios, muchacho!
-[Chuckles]
-[Chuckles, Gasps]
-[Birds Chirping]
[Pleasurable Moan]
[Workers Shouting]
-Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
-Nice?
-Yes, nice.
-But?
Um, but, uh, is it really fit for the gods?
-My lord.
-[Chuckles]
I have been around boats, believe me, and that, um-- the pointy, tall, um-- the-the-the-the long up and down thing--
-The mast?
-The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.
Well, look at it. [Stammering]
There's not nearly enough, uh, um, rope.
-Rope?
-Yes, rope. Exactly my point.
Vertical ascension requires a lot more, uh, rope.
-My lord. [Chuckles]
-And look at this. [Grunting]
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
This doesn't look at all secure.
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but all in all, it is a complete do-over.
Hmm.
You know, Lord Miguel, if you wish to stay, you only need to say so.
-You mean... forever?
-Of course.
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.
We're-We're partners.
Big plans in the other world, huh?
Yep. Big plans.
Well, then,
I better go get some more rope, huh?
Oh, Chief, um, forget about the rope.
Um, my mistake.
Hey, to err is human.
-[Tulio]Half?.
-Mm-hmm.
[Laughing]
I don't think so.
I-I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll let you come back to Spain with us, like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you, mmm, ten percent?
[Chuckles] You know, maybe I won't go to Spain with you and take a third.
Ohh! [Chuckling]
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.
Oh, like you don't want me to want to go to Spain.
-I want you to want... what you want.
-Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm. Go on.
All right.
Cards on the table.
Uh, I want you to come to Spain with me and Miguel.
Mostly me.
Especially me.
Only me.
Forget Miguel.
[Chuckles] Well, as long as that's what you want.
-Me too.
-Okay.
Deal?
-Deal. Mmm.
-[Plate Clattering]
[Hoof beats]
[Gasps]
"Forget Miguel"?
[Sniffling]
Well, forget Tulio.
[Nickering]
[Humming]
Well, is it ready yet?
Ooh.
Ah! [Sniffing]
Ahh! Hmm.
-It seems to be missing something.
-[Humming]
Ah, that's it.
-It needs more... body.
-[Grunts]
[Gasping]
[Hysterical Laughter]
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
-[Growling]
-Do... as I command!
-[Tzekel-Kan Laughing]
-[Jaguar Laughing]
-The gods deserve a proper tribute.
-[Chittering]
-Stop! There will be no sacrifices!
-[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
That kid does you better than you do.
[Sighs]
Some send-off, huh?
We're finally at the "go back to Spain and live like kings" part.
[Children Laughing]
[Nickers]
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Well, isn't king kind of a step down from god?
What? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Miguel, we can't stay here.
[Chuckling]
We have a plan, remember?
How about... we forget the plan?
Hmm?
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
[Roaring Continues]
[Both Screaming]
[Evil Laughter]
Now everyone will know the truth of your divinity.
[Shouts]
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
I'm okay!
I'm still okay!
Come on! Get on!
[Whinnying]
-[Chel Screams]
-[Tulio, Miguel Shout]
[Tulio] Altivo, hyah!
-[Whinnies]
-Whoa!
-[Tulio Shouts]
-[Nickers]
-[Groans]
-[Whinnies]
-[Grunts]
-[Both Grunt]
Tulio!
Hey, over here, you big Tzekel-Kan cat creep!
-[Growls]
-Altivo, get Chel out of here.
[Whinnying]
-[Roars]
-[Both Yelling]
Duck!
[Roaring]
[Panting, Yelling]
Who-o-o-oa!
[Both Gasping, Yelling]
Move! Move!
-Jump!
-[Roaring]
[Both Yelling]
[Both]
Who-o-o-a!
I know what you are, and I know what you are not!
And you are not gods!
Y-You're not a god?
You lied to me?
[Clears Throat]
-How dare you!
-Hey, it was his stupid plan!
-What?
-Oh, oh, oh.
My plan was that we should lie low!
But your plan was to run off and be all
"Oh, look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."
-That's not true!
-No? Who are you kidding?
You're buying your own con!
At least I'm not dating mine.
I-Ooh, low blow.
Listen, Mr. High and Mighty, we'd both be sailing out of here with a mountain of gold...
-if you had just listened to me!
-[Grunts]
Well, now you've got all the precious gold and Chel.
So what do you need me for?
Well, maybe I don't need you anymore.
Well, then, why don't you just go back to Spain, and I'll stay here, and we'll both get what we want!
-That's... fine with me, pal!
-Fine with me too!
-Ooh.
-Fine!
-Ouch.
-Okay!
-[Evil Chuckling]
-[Both] All right!
Tie him up!
-[Roaring]
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
-Whoa.
-[Roaring Continues]
-[Both Gasp]
-Jump!
[Both] Whoa!
[Gasps]
[Both Yelling]
No-o-o-o-o!
[Gasping, Panting]
-[Sword Clangs]
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
-[Whinnies]
[Shuddering]
My lord.
Where did you get this?
[Chuckling]
That was good, huh?
[Grunting]
[Cheering]
-[Cheering Continues]
-Hey, a little help, please?
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!
-I've decided to stay.
-Oh, this is wonderful news.
What a glorious day for El Dorado.
Lord Miguel has decided to live among us!
Tulio!
-Is everything okay?
-[Cheering Continues]
Everything is... fine.
[Wind Howling]
There isn't much
I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'll always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
-Beckoning the great divide
-[Grunts]
Ask no questions
Take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
All I know is all we had
Is over
Said and done
Friends never say good-bye
[Chorus]Friends
Never say good-bye
[Chattering]
Ha!
[Villagers Laughing]
Ahhh! Whew!
-Mmm.
-Friends never say good-bye
-[Children Giggling]
-[Man] Take care.
-[Child] We'll miss you!
-Thank you.
-Never say good-bye
-[Nickers]
[Groans]
-[Groans]
-[Chuckles]
-[Giggling]
-Friends never say
Good-bye
[Chorus]Friends
Never say good-bye
Well, good luck.
Yeah. You too.
Never
Say good-bye
[Nickering]
[Nickering Continues]
-[Villagers Gasping]
-Whoa.
-Whoa, boy, what is it?
-[Loud Nickering]
[Man Shouting]
-[Explosions]
-[Chattering]
-Cortes.
-My lord, what is it?
Chief Tanni!
Chief Tanni!
-Approaching the city... is an army of strangers.
-[Weapons Firing]
We are safe here.
They'll never find the gate to the city.
But, sire, they are being led by Tzekel-Kan.
He survived!
Warriors, prepare yourselves for battle!
[All Shouting]
Chief, you cannot fight them!
Then how can we stop them?
We can't.
-Hmm.
-[Firing Continues]
Uh, one moment, please.
-Okay, here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Uh-huh. And?
-Here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Okay.
-Got that. And? Tulio!
-Well, here's the "goat," and here's the "bate."
[Shouts]
-[Chittering]
-[Gasps] That's it.
We'll crash the boat into the pillars.
That's it? I mean--
But-[Scoffs]
-What about the gold?
-Well-[Sobbing]
[Whiny Voice] Chief!.
[Clears Throat]
[Normal Voice] Chief.
I've got a plan.
[Villagers Shouting]
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!
[Whinnying]
It better be there, for your sake.
[Sighs]
Okay, Chief, on my signal!
Ready! Hit the pillars!
-Now!
-[Shouting Continues]
-[Rumbling]
-[Gasps]
[Weapons Firing]
-They're breaking too fast!
-Tulio, the sail!
[Grunting]
[Grunting Continues]
It's stuck!
[All Grunting]
-[Both Shout]
-[Gasps]
They're not gonna make it. Altivo!
[Nickering]
-[Whinnying]
-[Shouts]
-[Whinnies]
-Are you crazy?
[Yelling]
Get off the boat, Miguel, or you'll never see the city again.
I know. You don't think I'm gonna let you have all the fun, do you?
Come on.
We've got a wave to catch.
-[Yelling]
-[Whimpers]
-Get out of the way!
-Huh?
Hold on!
-Whoa!
-[Whinnies]
We're gonna have to hit it broadside!
That's your plan?
But the gold!
-I know!
-[Gasps]
Just turn the boat!
On impact, everybody jump!
[Gasping, Groaning]
[Coughing]
[Panting]
We made it.
It worked.
[Chuckling] It worked.
-Wait. Get down!
-Ouch. Ow.
-There they are.
-[Men Shouting]
[Gasps]
No.
You lying heathen.
There's nothing here at all.
No. Wait. Wait.
[Grunts, Gasps]
-Men, seize him!
-What?
There is no El Dorado here.
Onward, men.
[Groans]
-[Gasps]
-[Chittering]
Wait! No, wait!
Wait!
[Echoing]
-[Sputters]
-[All Laughing]
-Yes!
-Now, that was an adventure.
Yes. Yes, it was.
And, um,
-[Sobbing] it was so much gold!
-[Chuckling]
-I'm fine.
-Good.
-Let's go.
-[Sighs]
Partner.
Partner.
Hey, guys, come on!
You don't wanna stay here forever, do you?
-But... we don't have a map.
-We don't have a plan.
Well, that's what makes it interesting.
You're right!
What are we waiting for?
Let's follow that trail!
-[Whinnying] Hyah!
-[Groaning]
-Oh, the sweet unfolding
-Come on, boys!
-Of an antique mystery
-Hey, Altivo!
-All will be revealed
-Sit, boy! Sit!
-Chel, we're not on the horse!
-[Chel Laughing]
On the trail we blaze
[Chittering]
[Snorting]
[Twittering] Uh-Uhh.
Eh! [Crunch]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again
Someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Some day soon
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-[Vocalizing]
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Someday soon
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
-I love you
-[Chorus Vocalizing]
-I love you
-[Vocalizing Continues]
Without question
I love you
-The more I want
-[Chorus] The more I steal
-The more I steal
-The more I hold
The more I hold
The less is real
-All worldly things
-I follow blind
-I follow blind
-In hope, not faith
In hope, not faith
Was paid in kind
The line is drawn
The change is made
I come to you
I'm not afraid
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
I love you

Yes, Marlin.
No, I see it. It's beautiful.
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view... you didn't think you'd get the whole ocean, did you?
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
You better believe they did... every single one of them.
You did good.
And the neighborhood is awesome.
So, you do like it, don't you?
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.
But, Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable... with the great schools and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space?
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about.
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.
They'll wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.
You'll wake the kids.
Oh, right, right.
Aw, look. They're dreaming.
We still have to name them.
You want to name all of them right now?
All right, we'll name this half Marlin Junior... and this half Coral Junior.
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo... but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Junior.
Just think, in a couple of days...
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.
What if they don't like me?
- Marlin.
- No, really.
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.
What?
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.
Well, I remember.
"Excuse me, miss..."
"can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip?"
You got a little closer because it was wiggling.
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.
Where did everybody go?
Coral, get inside the house.
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.
Just get inside...
You, right now.
No!
Coral!
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
There, there, there.
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.
I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...
Nemo.
First day of school!
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.
I don't want to go to school... five more minutes.
Not you, Dad, me.
- OK?
- Get up, get up.
It's time for school, time for school.
All right, I'm up.
- Nemo!
- First day of school!
Nemo, don't move.
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.
- You feel a break?
- No.
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.
- Are you woozy?
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two, three...
That's all I have?
You're OK. How's the lucky fin?
- Lucky.
- Let's see.
Are you sure you want to go to school this year?
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.
Come on, Dad, it's time for school.
Forgot to brush.
Do you want this anemone to sting you?
- Yes.
- Brush.
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.
- Where?
- There.
Right there. And here and here.
All right, we're excited.
The first day of school.
Here we go.
We're ready to learn to get some knowledge.
What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.
First, we check to see that the coast is clear.
We go out... and back in.
And then we go out... and back in.
And then one more time... out and back in.
And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?
No, and I don't plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.
Sandy Plankton from next door... he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.
He says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.
After I'm done talking to the shark, OK?
Hold on. Wait to cross.
Hold my fin.
Dad, you're not going to freak out... like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
That snail was about to charge.
I wonder where we're supposed to go.
Bye, Mom!
I'll pick you up after school.
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!
Come on, we'll try over there.
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?
Well, look who's out of the anemone.
Yes. Shocking, I know.
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.
- Bob.
- Ted.
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish.
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, actually, that's a common misconception.
Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.
All right, I know one joke.
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...
He doesn't walk up, he swims up.
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place, and then the sea cucumber...
Well, they... I'm mixed up.
There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them were walking, so forget that I...
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!
All right, you kids!
Where'd you go?
Dad, can I go play, too? Can I?
I would feel better if you'd play on the sponge beds.
That's where I would play.
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.
Hey, what'd I do?
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?
It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell.
Especially when
I twirl them like this.
I'm H-2-O intolerant.
I'm obnoxious.
Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones
Let's name the zones of the open sea
Mr. Ray!
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.
Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic
All the rest are too deep for you and me to see
I wonder where my class has gone?
We're under here!
Oh, there you are.
Climb aboard, explorers.
Oh, knowledge exploring is, oh, so lyrical
When you think thoughts that are empirical
Dad, you can go now.
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.
Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?
An anemon-none.
A nemenem-menome.
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.
I find if he's having trouble swimming...
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.
Dad, it's time for you to go now.
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group.
OK, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion... to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.
Aw, man!
Bye, Nemo!
Bye, Dad!
Bye, son!
Be safe.
You're doing pretty well for a first-timer.
You can't hold on to them forever, can you?
I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off.
They got to grow up...
The drop off?
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?
Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?
Hey, Marty, calm down.
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy.
Pony boy?
For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.
Pity.
Let's name the species, the species, the species
Let's name the species that live in the sea
There's
Porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three
Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma
And some fish like you and me
Come on, sing with me.
Just the girls this time.
Oh, seaweed is cool
Seaweed is fun it makes its food
OK, the drop off.
All right, kids, feel free to explore... but stay close.
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.
An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...
Come on, let's go.
Come on, sing with me!
There's porifera, coelenterata
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three
Hey, guys, wait up!
Cool.
Saved your life!
Aw, you guys made me ink.
What's that?
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.
He said it was called a butt.
That's a pretty big butt.
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.
OK.
Beat that.
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?
My dad says it's not safe.
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?
You were about to swim into open water.
No, I wasn't...
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up...
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.
No, I wasn't.
This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.
You know you can't swim well.
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.
OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two.
No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean...
Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are.
You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nemo!
I hate you.
There's
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things.
He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised.
I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.
I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking.
I'm not saying you're not looking.
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!
Nemo!
What do you think you're doing?
You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does.
Get back here!
I said get back here now!
Stop! You take one more move, mister...
Don't you dare!
If you put one fin on that boat...
Are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!
He touched the butt.
You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo.
That's right.
You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...
Big...
Daddy! Help me!
I'm coming, Nemo!
Get under me, kids!
Oh! No!
Dad!
Daddy!
Oh! Nemo!
Nemo!
Nemo, no! Nemo!
Nemo! Nemo! No!
No!
Nemo! Nemo!
Hold on.
Oh, no.
No. No, it's gone. It's gone.
No, no, it can't be gone.
No, no! Nemo!
Nemo! Nemo!
Nemo! Nemo!
No!
Nemo! Nemo!
No! No, please, no!
No, no!
Has anybody seen a boat?
Please! A white boat!
They took my son!
My son! Help me, please.
- Look out!
- What?
Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.
There, there. It's all right.
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.
Where? Which way?
It went this way.
It went this way. Follow me.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much.
No problem.
Hey...
Wait!
- Will you quit it?
- What?
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?
You got a problem, buddy?
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?
I'm scared now. What?
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?
What? You're showing me where the boat went.
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.
It went this way. Follow me.
Wait a minute.
What is going on?
You already told me which way the boat was going.
I did? Oh, no.
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny.
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.
See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.
Where are they?
Can I help you?
Something's wrong with you... really.
You're wasting my time.
I have to find my son.
Hello.
Well, hi!
Name's Bruce.
It's all right. I understand.
Why trust a shark, right?
So, what's a couple of bites like you... doing out so late, eh?
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.
Great!
Then how'd you morsels... like to come to a little get-together I'm having?
You mean, like a party?
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.
Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...
Oh, come on, I insist.
OK. That's all that matters.
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.
Anchor! Chum!
There you are, Bruce. Finally.
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.
We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still starving.
We almost had a feeding frenzy.
Come on, let's get this over with.
Right, then.
The meeting has officially come to order.
Let us all say the pledge.
I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine.
If I am to change this image...
I must first change myself.
Fish are friends, not food.
Except stinkin' dolphins.
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin."
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?"
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...
Bring a Fish Friend.
Do you all have your friends?
Got mine.
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?
Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend.
That's all right, Chum.
I had a feeling this would be a difficult step.
You can help yourself to one of my friends.
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum?
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.
Hello, Bruce.
It has been three weeks since my last fish.
On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.
Right, then. Who's next?
Pick me, pick me.
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.
Come on up here.
Hi. I'm Dory.
- Hello, Dory.
- And well...
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.
All right, anyone else?
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?
Me? I don't have a problem.
Oh, OK.
Denial.
Just start with your name.
OK. Hello.
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.
I love jokes.
I actually do know one that's pretty good.
There was this mollusk... and he walks up to a sea cucumber.
Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...
Daddy!
Nemo!
Nemo! Nemo! I don't get it.
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.
No, no, no, no. He's my son.
He was taken by these divers.
Oh, my. You poor fish.
Humans... think they own everything.
Probably American.
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.
What do these markings mean?
I never knew my father!
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.
I can't read human.
We got to find a fish that can read this.
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.
That's mine. Give it to me.
Gimme!
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?
I'm so sorry.
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?
Dory, are you OK...
That's good.
That's good.
Intervention!
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!
- Food!
- Dory, look out!
I'm having fish tonight!
Remember the steps, mate!
Just one bite!
G'day. Grr!
There's no way out!
There's got to be a way to escape!
Who is it?
Dory, help me find a way out!
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.
"Es-cap-e."
I wonder what that means.
Funny. It's spelled just like "escape."
Let's go.
Here's Brucey!
Wait a minute. You can read?
I can read?
That's right. I can read!
Well, then, here.
Read this now.
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.
Don't fall off the wagon!
Oh, no, it's blocked!
No, Bruce, focus.
Sorry about Bruce, mate.
He's really a nice guy.
I need to get that mask.
You want that mask? OK.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Quick, grab the mask!
Oh, no. Bruce?
What?
Swim away! Swim away!
Aw, is the party over?
Nice.
Dad?
Daddy?
Barbara.
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?
And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls.
OK.
Hello, little fella.
Beauty, isn't he?
I found that guy struggling for life... out on the reef, and I saved him.
So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet?
I think so.
We're ready to roll.
Bubbles!
My bubbles.
He likes bubbles.
No!
Bonjour.
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.
Do you know where my dad is?
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.
Pet store?
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.
- Ebay.
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.
The ocean. The ocean?
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!
- Oui.
- Clean him!
Oui.
- Ocean.
- La mer. Bon.
Voila. He is clean.
The big blue. What's it like?
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.
If there's anything you need, just ask your Auntie Deb.
Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Flo.
Hi. How are you?
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.
We got a live one.
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?
Root canal... and by the looks of those x-rays... it's not going to be pretty.
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.
He seems to favor that one lately.
I can't see, Flo.
You're getting a little too...
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.
He's using a Hedstrom file.
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!
There I go.
A little help, over here.
I'll go deflate him.
All right. Go ahead and rinse.
Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place.
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?
Root canal... a doozy.
Root canal?
What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus.
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.
The dentist took him off the reef.
An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh?
Sorry if I ever took a snap at you.
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.
Hey! No, no, no, no!
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.
Come on, go. Go on, shoo!
Aw, the picture broke.
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.
She's going to be eight this week.
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.
She'll be here Friday to pick you up.
You're her present.
It's our little secret.
Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up...
I'm going to see a man about a wallaby.
Oh, Darla.
What? What's wrong with her?
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.
She's a fish killer.
I can't go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.
Daddy! Help me!
Oh, he's stuck.
Nobody touch him.
Nobody touch him.
Can you help me?
No. You got yourself in there.
You can get yourself out.
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.
Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.
I can't. I have a bad fin.
Never stopped me.
Just think about what you need to do.
Come on.
Perfect.
- Yay!
- You did it!
Good squirming.
From the ocean... just like you, Gill.
Yeah.
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.
So, kid, you got a name or what?
Nemo. I'm Nemo.
Nemo. Nemo.
Are you gonna eat that?
Careful with that hammer.
No, no.
What does it say? Dory!
A sea monkey has my money.
Wake up. Get up. Come on.
Come on!
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!
Look out! Sharks eat fish!
Dusty.
The mask. Where's the mask?
No! No, not the mask!
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!
Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot
La la la la la la it just keeps going on, doesn't it?
Echo! Echo!
Hey, what you doing?
It's gone. I've lost the mask.
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!
That was my only chance of finding my son.
Now it's gone.
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do?
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming
What do we do? We swim, swim
Dory, no singing.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho
I love to swim
When you want to swim
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song.
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.
Dory, do you see anything?
- Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.
Are you my conscience?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me...
Do you see anything?
I see a... I see a light.
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.
What is it?
It's so pretty.
I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me.
I want to touch it.
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna swim with you
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna be your best friend
Good feeling's gone.
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!
- The mask!
- What mask?
OK, I can't see a thing.
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.
Read it!
I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.
That's great.
Keep it right there.
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.
Mr. Bossy. "P."
OK. "P. Sher..."
"Sher... P. Sher..."
P. Shirley? P..."
Oh. The first line's
"P. Sherman."
"P. Sherman" doesn't make any sense!
OK. Second line. "42."
Don't eat me. Don't eat me.
Light, please!
"Walla... walla..."
Waah! Waah! Waah!
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!
- "Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
- Duck!
I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
I died. I'm dead.
We did it, we did it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
No eating here tonight, whoo!
Eating here tonight
No, no, no, eating here tonight
- Dory.
- You on a diet
Dory! What did the mask say?
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered what it said!
I usually forget things, but I remembered it!
Wait. Where is that?
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.
Raar!
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!
Nemo.
Nemo
Suivez-moi.
Follow me.
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho
Hahoo ho ho wahoo ha hee
Ha ho wahee ha ho ho ho
Hoo!
State your name.
Nemo.
Brother Bloat, proceed.
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie... to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.
We want you in our club, kid.
- Really?
- If... you are able to swim through... the Ring of Fire!
Turn on the Ring of Fire!
You said you could do it.
The Ring of Fire!
Bubbles, let me... Oh!
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!
From this moment on, you will be known as Sharkbait.
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!
Ba-ba-do.
Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.
So, what are we going to do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do... we're gonna get him out of here.
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?
We're all gonna escape.
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.
Sorry, but they just never work.
Why should this be any different?
- Because we've got him.
- Me?
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing.
We need you to take a pebble inside there... and jam the gears.
You do that, and this tank's gonna get... filthier and filthier by the minute.
Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank... and when he does, he'll take us out of the tank... put us in individual baggies... then we'll roll ourselves down the counter... out the window, off the awning... into the bushes, across the street... and into the harbor!
It's foolproof. Who's with me?
- Aye!
- Aye!
I think you're nuts.
No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer.
He's fine. He can do this.
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?
Let's do it.
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
If you ask where I'm going...
I'll tell you that's where I'm going.
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Excuse me.
Hi. Do you know how to get...
Hello? Wait. Can you tell me...
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.
I need to...
And they're gone again.
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Why do I have to tell you over and over again?
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it...
OK, all right.
Here's the thing.
I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself.
OK.
You know, alone.
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.
But I don't want you... with me.
Am I...
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.
I just can't afford any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays.
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.
You mean...
You mean you don't like me?
No, of course I like you.
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.
It's a complicated emotion.
Don't cry. I like you.
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?
I don't remember. Were you?
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...
Do you guys know how I can get to...
Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you.
Hey, hey. You like impressions?
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.
So what are we? Take a guess.
I've seen one of those.
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.
- Wait, wait...
- It's a swordfish!
Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.
Where's the butter?
It's on the tip of my tongue!
- Lobster.
- Saw that!
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.
- Clam!
- Close enough!
Oh, it's a whale of a tale
I'll tell you, lad...
They're good.
Will somebody please give me directions?!
"Will somebody please give me directions?!"
I'm serious!
"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!"
"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"
Thank you.
Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back!
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?
While they're doing their silly little impressions...
I am miles from home with a fish that can't remember her name!
I bet that's frustrating.
Meanwhile, my son is out there.
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?
But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.
Well, I'm helping you.
Wait right here.
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?
No, no. He's a good guy.
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
Sydney? Oh, sure!
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!
Oh! Hey! They know Sydney!
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?
You want to follow the E.A.C.
That's the East
Australian Current.
Big current. Can't miss it.
It's in... that direction.
And then you follow that for about...
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
About three leagues?
That little baby will put you right past Sydney.
- Ta-da!
- That's great!
Dory, you did it!
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.
Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing.
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.
Trench... through it, not over it.
I'll remember. Hey, hey!
Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.
Nice trench.
Hello!
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.
Come on, we'll swim over this thing.
Partner.
Little red flag going up.
Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it.
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written all over it.
I really, really, really think we should swim through.
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.
Look! Something shiny!
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!
Boy, it sure is clear up here.
Exactly. And look at that... there's the current.
We should be there in no time.
Hey, little guy.
You wanted to go through the trench.
I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine.
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.
Come here, little Squishy.
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!
Shoo, shoo! Get away!
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.
Hey! How come it didn't sting you?
It did. It's just that...
Hold still.
I live in this anemone... and I'm used to these kind of stings.
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.
But now we know, don't we... that we don't want to touch these again.
Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.
Don't move.
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!
Boing! Boing!
Dory!
You can't catch me
Don't bounce on the tops!
They will... not sting you!
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.
- A game?
- Yes.
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.
Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins!
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!
Wait! Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em!
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!
Gotta go faster if you want to win!
Dory!
Boing, boing, boing!
Wait a minute! Dory!
Whee!
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.
But we're having fun at the same time.
I can do this. Just be careful.
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!
I don't think so!
Give it up, old man.
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?
- Hungry?
- Yeah.
'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!
Duck to the left! Right there!
The clownfish is the winner!
We did it! Look at us!
Dory?
Oh, no.
Dory! Dory!
Dory!
Dory!
Am I disqualified?
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...
That's it!
- Wallaby Way...
- Stay awake!
Stay awake! Stay awake!
Stay... awake!
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.
Wake up. Nemo...
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?
Yeah.
You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.
He's not looking for me.
He's scared of the ocean.
Peach, any movement?
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.
Keep on him.
My first escape... landed on dental tools.
I was aiming for the toilet.
Toilet?
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.
How many times have you tried to get out?
I've lost count.
Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid.
It does things to you.
Bubbles! Bubbles!
Potty break! He grabbed the "Reader's Digest."
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.
Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I'll talk you through the rest.
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.
Nicely done!
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!
Here comes the pebble.
Ptoo.
Now, do you see a small opening?
Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.
Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!
Gill, this isn't a good idea.
He'll be fine. Try again!
OK.
That's it, Sharkbait.
Nice and steady.
I got it! I got it!
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!
Now swim up the tube and out.
Oh, no! Gill!
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!
Get him outta there!
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!
Help me!
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!
I got it!
Pull!
Gill, don't make him go back in there.
No. We're done.
Dude.
Dude.
Focus, dude. Dude.
Oh, he lives. Hey, dude!
What happened?
Saw the whole thing, dude.
First, you were all, like, "Whoa!"... and then we were all, like, "Whoa!"... and then you were, like, "Whoa."
What are you talking about?
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.
Awesome.
Oh, my stomach.
Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, OK?
Just waxed it.
So, Mr. Turtle...
Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father.
The name's Crush.
Crush? Really?
OK, Crush. I need to the East Australian Current.
E.A.C.?
Oh, dude.
You're ridin' it, dude!
Check it out!
OK, grab shell, dude!
Grab wh-a-a-at?!
Righteous! Righteous!
- Yeah!
- Stop!
So...
What brings you on this fine day to the E.A.C.?
Dory and I need to get to Sydney.
Dory! Is she all right?
Oh, little blue.
She is sub-level, dude.
Dory! Dory! Dory!
Dory.
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!
There you are!
Dory?
Nice wave!
Up you go!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.
That was so cool!
Hey, Dad, did you see that?
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?
You so totally rock, Squirt!
So give me some fin.
Noggin.
- Dude.
- Dude.
Oh... intro.
Jellyman, offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.
Apparently, I must've done something you liked... dudes.
You rock, dude!
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.
The little dudes are just eggs.
We leave 'em on a beach to hatch... and then, coo-coo-cachoo... they find their way back to the big ol' blue.
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.
But, dude, how do you know when they're ready?
Well, you never really know.
But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha.
Hey, look, everybody.
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!
Go on. Jump on him!
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!
Mr. Fish, did you die?
Sorry, I was a little vague on the details.
So, where are you going?
You see, my son was taken.
My son was taken away from me.
- No way.
- What happened?
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.
Aww! Please?
Please?
Well, OK.
I live on this reef a long, long way from here.
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.
And my son Nemo...
See, he was mad at me.
And maybe he wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on him.
I don't know.
Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.
So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into... three ferocious sharks.
He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up!
Golly, that's amazing.
And then dives thousands of feet... straight down into the dark.
It's wicked dark down there.
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?
And the only thing they can see down there... is the light from this big, horrible creature... with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...
So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.
Which means that he may be on his way here right now.
That should put him in Sydney Harbor...
In a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna stop at nothing... till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.
That's one dedicated father, if you ask me.
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Would you just shut up?!
You're rats with wings!
Bloke's been looking for his boy Nemo.
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Whoooa...
Mine?
Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor.
Brilliant!
Is he doing OK?
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...
It's OK. I know who you're talking about.
Gill?
Gill?
Hey, Sharkbait.
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.
I was so ready to get out... so ready to taste that ocean...
I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there.
Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.
All right. Hey, hey, hey...
What the...
That's one way to pull a tooth.
Darn kids.
Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister?
Hey.
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean...
- looking for you.
- My father? Really?
He's traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish...
Sharks? That can't be him.
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?
Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!
I heard he took on three.
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!
After you were taken by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat like a maniac.
Really?
He's swimming, giving it all he's got... and then three gigantic sharks capture him... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!
He ties this demon to a rock, and what's his reward?
He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!
Now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the E.A. C... and the word is he's headed this way right now... to Sydney!
What a good daddy!
He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.
He's swimming to the filter!
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!
Sharkbait!
No!
You got your whole life ahead of you!
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!
Get him out of there!
Come on, kid! Grab the end!
Sharkbait!
- No!
- Can you hear me?
Nemo! Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Sharkbait, you did it!
Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs!
That took guts, kid.
All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours... before Darla gets here.
This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time... but we have to help it along any way we can.
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.
Everybody else, be as gross as possible.
Think dirty thoughts.
We're gonna make this tank so filthy... the dentist will have to clean it.
Good work!
All right, we're here, dudes!
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!
Where? I don't see it!
Right there!
I see it! I see it!
The swirling vortex of terror?
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.
OK, first, find your exit buddy.
Do you have your exit buddy?
Yes!
Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!
OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.
There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out!
Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it!
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!
You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying!
Say the first thing again.
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!
That was... fun!
I actually enjoyed that.
Hey, look, turtles!
Most excellent!
Now turn your fishy tails around... and swim straight on through to Sydney!
No worries, man!
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?
See ya later, dudes!
Bye, everyone!
Nemo would have loved this.
Hey! Crush, I forgot!
How old are you?
150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!
I gotta remember that.
- We going in there?
- Yep.
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
Yep. We're gonna just swim straight.
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
Dory...
Boy, this is taking awhile.
How about we play a game?
OK.
OK, I'm thinking of something orange... and it's small...
- It's me.
- Right!
It's orange and small...
It's me.
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.
And it's orange and small and white stripes...
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have definitely seen this floating speck before.
That means we've passed it before... and that means we're going in circles... and that means we're not going straight!
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.
We'll figure it out up there. Let's go!
- Hey! Relax.
- What?
Take a deep breath.
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.
Fine. Who do you want to ask, the speck?
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.
Let's see. OK, no one there.
Nope. Nada.
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.
I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions... it could ingest us and spit out our bones!
What is it with men and asking for directions?
I don't want to play the gender card right now.
Let's play the "Let's Not Die" card.
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.
How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?
Dory, you don't fully understand...
Come on. Trust me on this.
All right.
Excuse me! Little fella?
Hello! Don't be rude. Say Hi.
Ha. Hello.
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.
Sydney! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?
Come on, little fella. Come on.
Dory, I'm a little fella.
I don't think that's a little fella.
Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK.
Maybe he only speaks whale.
Mooo! Weee neeed...
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?
Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying!
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.
He's not coming back.
You offended him.
Maybe a different dialect.
Dory!
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?
It doesn't sound orca.
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.
- Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!
Move, Dory, move!
Look at that.
Would you look at that?
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.
Jacques, I said no cleaning.
I am ashamed.
Look! Scum angel!
Bubbles! I love the bubbles!
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?
9:00 and cue dentist.
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.
OK, here we go. Here we go, OK.
Little Davey Reynolds...
Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
Bloat, that's disgusting!
Tastes pretty good to me.
- Urrrp!
- Eww!
Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...
Here he comes!
Crikey. What a state.
Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?
I've gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank!
We're gonna be clean!
You ready to see your dad, kid?
Of course you are.
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there... in the harbor waiting for you right now.
Yeah.
Here comes the big one.
Come on! You gotta try this!
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?
We're in a whale, don't you get it?
- Whale?
- A whale!
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!
A whale. I speak whale.
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!
Hey... you OK?
There, there. It's all right.
It'll be OK.
No. No, it won't.
Sure it will. You'll see.
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.
That's a funny thing to promise.
What?
You can't never let anything happen to him.
Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.
What's going on?
Don't know. I'll ask him.
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?
I think he says we've stopped.
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?
Oh, no. Look what you did.
The water's going down.
It's going down!
Really? You sure about that?
Look! Already it's half empty!
I'd say it's half full.
Stop that! It's half empty!
OK, that one was a little tougher.
He either said we should go to the back of the throat... or he wants a root beer float.
Of course he wants us to go there!
That's eating us!
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?
Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!
- OK. Heee...
- Stop talking to him!
What is going on?
I'll check. Whaaat...
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!
You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo!
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!
He says it's time to let go.
Everything's gonna be all right.
How do you know?
How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?
I don't!
We're alive!
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!
Sydney! Sydney again!
You were right, Dory!
We made it!
We're gonna find my son!
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!
I wish I could speak whale.
All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.
- Right!
- We can do this!
Morning.
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!
The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.
The tank is clean!
But how?
Boss must've installed it while we were sleeping.
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?
I can't hear you, Peach.
The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water purifier... that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish.
Stop it!
The Aquascum is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?!
Scan? What does that mean?
Temperature... 82 degrees...
PH balance... normal.
Nice.
Curse you, Aquascum!
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.
Then what are we gonna do about...
Darla!
Stay down, kid!
False alarm.
My nerves can't take much more of this.
What'll we do when that brat gets here?
- I'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!
Swim down! Come on, kid!
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!
- That's it!
- What the...?
- Yay!
- Good work!
Gill!
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.
Gill! Don't let me go belly-up!
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.
I promise. You're gonna be OK.
Darla!
Do any of these boats look familiar to you?
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.
Duck!
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast!
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?
What? What?
Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle.
Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.
Yeah, right. Yeah.
Don't everybody fly off at once.
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?
Love a duck!
I gotta find my son Nemo!
Nemo? He's that fish!
The one that's been fighting the whole ocean!
I know where your son...
Wait! Come back! Stop!
Dory, keep going! He's crazy!
I got something to tell you!
Mine.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?
Mine?
Because
I can take you to your son.
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.
He's orange with a gimpy fin on one side.
That's Nemo!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Fasten your seat belts!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Everybody hold on!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Too loud! Too loud for me!
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!
Darla, your uncle will see you now.
All right, let's see those pearly whites.
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.
And a piranha's a fish, just like your present.
I get fishy, fishy
Oh, no. Poor little guy.
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!
Must've left your present in the car, sweetie.
I'll go and get it.
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?
He's gonna get flushed down the toilet.
- He's gonna get out of here!
- He's gonna get flushed!
What a smart little guy!
Oh, no! Not the trash can!
Nemo! No!
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?
- Dentist!
- He's over there!
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!
What the...?
Darla, sweetie, look out!
Hold still!
Easy! Easy!
Hold still!
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!
Nemo.
Oh, my goodness.
Gotcha! Keep down!
Nemo!
Daddy?
Out with you! And stay out!
Daddy?
Fishy?
Fishy! Wake up!
Oh, no!
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!
Why are you sleeping?
- Hurry!
- Bloat!
Ring of Fire!
Fishy!
Crikey! All the animals have gone mad!
Aaah! Get it out!
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!
Fish in my hair!
Gill!
Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hi.
Go get 'em!
- He did it!
- Yay!
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.
Fishy!
Daddy!
I'm so sorry.
Truly, I am.
Truly, I am.
- Hey.
- Dory... if it wasn't for you...
I never would've even made it here.
So, thank you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait. Where are you going?
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.
Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now.
No. No, you can't.
Stop!
Please don't go away.
Please?
No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.
And if you leave, I just...
I remember things better with you.
I do. Look... P. Sherman, 42...
I remember it.
I do. It's there.
I know it is because when I look at you...
I can feel it.
I look at you and I... I'm home.
Please...
I don't want that to go away.
I don't want to forget.
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Yeah, that's it, fella.
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.
Too right, mate!
Oh! I got a live one here!
Have you seen my dad?
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!
You let him go!
Hey! Hey!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.
I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.
Hey, we can look together.
I'm Dory.
I'm Nemo.
Nemo? That's a nice name.
- Dad!
- Dad!
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!
Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney.
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Nemo!
It's you! You're Nemo!
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.
And here you are! I found you.
You're not dead.
And your father... Your father!
You know my father?!
Where is he?
This way!
He went this way. Quick!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey!
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.
But I'm not tellin' you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me.
Mine.
All right! I'll talk!
He went to the fishing grounds!
Hey, look out!
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.
Dad! Dad!
Nemo?
- Daddy!
- Nemo?
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!
Dory? Nemo!
Daddy!
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!
Look out!
Oh, my...
Help! He-e-elp!
- Dory!
- Come on!
Help! Help!
Help! Get us out!
No, no, no! Dory!
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!
No, I am not gonna lose you again!
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!
I can do this.
You're right.
I know you can.
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!
Tell all the fish to swim down!
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!
Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
Swim down together!
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Swim down!
Everybody swim down!
Come on, you have to swim down!
Down! Swim down!
Swim down! Swim down!
Don't give up! Keep swimming!
Just keep swimming!
That's it!
It's working!
Keep swimming! Keep swimming!
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Come on, Dad!
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
Almost there! Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
- Oof!
- Hey!
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!
Oh, no. Nemo!
Nemo?
Nemo?
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.
Daddy?
Oh, thank goodness.
Dad... I don't hate you.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm so sorry, Nemo.
- Hey, guess what?
- What?
Sea turtles... I met one.
And he was 150 years old.
- Yep.
Sandy Plankton said they only live to be 100.
Sandy Plankton?
Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy Plankton?
He was 150! Not 100!
Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!
Climb aboard, explorers.
The sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says...
"With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!
- Sweet!
- Totally.
Seriously, Marty.
Did you really do all the things you say you did?
Pardon me.
Hello.
Don't be alarmed.
We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...
Not food! Bye!
Hold on, here we go!
Next stop... knowledge!
Bye, son! Have fun!
Bye, Dad!
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.
Love you, Dad.
I love you, too, son.
Dad? You can let go now.
Sorry. Go have an adventure.
Good-bye! See ya later, dudes!
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!
Bye, Dad!
Bye, son.
Barbara, I don't understand it.
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee... and it breaks!
I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put 'em in bags, and...
Where'd the fish go?
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!
- You can do it!
- That's it.
Just a little further.
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!
Come on, Peach!
Now what?
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
Somewhere, waitin' for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships
That go sailin'
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
She's there watchin' for me if I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'll go sailin'
It's far
Beyond the stars
It's near, beyond the moon
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there soon
We'll meet
Beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailin'
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there soon
Oh, we'll meet,
I know we'll meet
Beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailin'
No more sailin'
So long, sailin', sailin'
No more sailin'
Good-bye, farewell, my friend
No more sailin'
So long
Sailin'
No more sailin'
No more
Farewell
Auf wiedersehen
Adieu to you and you
No more sailin'
No more
No more sailin'
No more, no more
No more sailin'
No more
One more time
No more sailin'

There are many Pokemon in the world that nobody's seen yet, and are known only from legends.
This book has many such Pokemon, drawn from the author's imagination.
The one you're searching for is this one, right?
Yes. Papa's been always looking for the mysterious Pokemon, "Unknown".
I...
I like this one here.
The Pokemon of Illusion, Entei.
Me's favourite.
Entei's strong and kind, just like you, Papa.
Papa's like Entei, huh?
I hope so.
All right! Papa's Entei!
It's Entei!
All right, let's go!
A mail?
It's probably for you.
You should hurry and look at it.
This is John.
Boss, we found clues relating to Unknown in the ruins.
Please come as soon as possible.
Clues relating to Unknown?
I figured you'd have to go to work.
Sorry, Me.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Papa...
Good night, Me...
It's here, Dr. Sully.
This writing's unlike anything we've seen before, but it's safe to assume it's about Unknown.
Incredible.
You're likely the only one who can make any sense of this.
What's...
The Unknown...
Boss?
Boss?
Dr. Sully?
Doctor!
The young miss is truly alone now...
Are you back, Papa?
Me-chan...
Young miss...
Papa...
Did you send me mail?
Unknown?
Papa...
Are these for me?
I feel lonely, Papa...
Unknown...
Wanna play with me?
What's...
- Young miss!
- Those are Unknown!
Hey!
Papa...
Papa... come back...
Were you the one who called me?
Entei?
I am... Entei.
Papa... You're Papa, right?
You became an Entei and came back, Papa!
Papa...
I am Papa...
If that is your wish.
Away from his home in Masara Town,
Satoshi and his friends aim to enter the Johto League.
Their journey continues today.
You're a Pokemon Trainer, right?
Yeah. I'm Satoshi, from Masara Town.
I want to be a Pokemon Master.
I'm Takeshi, miss.
What's your name?
I'm Lynn.
Well? Want to battle?
Well?
What are you gonna do, Satoshi?
Obviously, it's common courtesy to accept a battle!
Thanks.
Show me your power as a Trainer!
OK!
Let's battle!
OK!
OK! Let's move on!
OK!
Together, we'll be all right!
OK!
Though the wind's changing
OK!
That dream won't!
Up 'til now, we've been going on in a daze and although we hadn't noticed
The key to the door leading to the new world is in getting something unknown
Golden Smile and Silver Tears
Delight and frustration are always changing faces and making everyone stronger!
OK!
Follow mel!
OK! If we cry out in triumph, we can't lose!
OK! Even if we break through the wall
OK!
This journey won't end!
Though I'd begun to give up there was no reason to do so
The morning sun burns brightly on my journey and asks me
"that much is fine, right?"
Golden Sun and Silver Moon
The sun and moon are always changing faces and protecting everyone!
Therefore...
OK!
Swallow your fear!
OK!
A prideful move, "Bravado!"
OK! Though I don't know their names or voices
They're waiting for me!
I'll face them some clay!
Let's go!
OK!
Open the next door!
OK!
A prideful move, "Recklessness!"
OK!
We cry and laugh together
My friends are fine!
I believe in my friends!
OK!
You guys are pretty strong.
We've gotta train more.
No, we had some trouble too.
This was your 5th fight this week.
Aren't you tired?
Yeah...
Lynn-san, would you happen to know where the nearest Pokemon Center is?
There's one just past this forest, in Greenfield.
By "Greenfield", you mean...
The place known as the number one vacation spot for girls in Johto?
Bingo!
I'm going there too.
Greenfield...
A green field of peace.
The wind that blows through it can calm the hearts of both people and Pokemon.
I want to go there at least once!
The number one vacation spot for women.
Lots of girls...
Greenfield"s just past that hill.
It's a good thing we chased Pikachu all the way here.
We reached the sought-after Greenfield, but... what's this?
Green?
More like light.
So is this some sort of treasure?
Pearls before swine.
Or somethin' like that...
- That's right!
- Sonansu!
You came out on your own again?
Get back in there.
Junsa-san...
- Ready?
- OK.
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.
Greenfield, a town known for its lush green, has been turned into a deep and dark atmosphere, which not even 100 soldiers can penetrate.
We believe this may be related to the disappearance of Prof. Sully Snowdon, but we cannot confirm it.
Sully Snowdon?
Dr. Sully was known throughout the world for his research on legendary Pokemon.
Wasn't Dr. Sully one of your students, Dr. Okido?
He was indeed a splendid student.
On that note,
I was sent his article in a mail...
- Those are...
- Unknown.
Unknown?
Dr. Okido, have you seen what's on TV?
Just saw it. I was just about to go over to the scene.
I'll go too!
You knew Sully-kun too, didn't you?
His daughter's still very little, so I'm worried.
Got it.
Go get ready to leave.
Yes.
Those taking action have just arrived at the Greenfield Pokemon Center.
We've been waiting for you, Dr. Okido.
Doc...
Oh, Pikachu!
- Mom!
- Oh, Satoshi.
- What? You guys are here, too?
- It's been a while, Dr. Okido.
I figured you'd come.
- I see you've been doing well, Satoshi.
- You too, mom.
Papa...
I want a Mama, too...
If that's what you wish, Me.
Long ago, Dr. Sully used to study under Dr. Okido.
Didn't you say he used to help you with your homework?
Yeah.
He visited Masara Town a few times since...
I see, it was him back then.
That's Dr. Sully's house.
I'm really worried.
Geez...
What's wrong, Pikachu?
What?
A Pokemon?
It's the first time I've seen one of these.
Who are you?
Mama...
You are... Mama.
You are Mama!
I am... Mama...
I am... Mama.
Hey, wait!
Mom, Pikachu!
Get lost!
Pikachu, you all right?
Don't go, Satoshi!
You don't know what's in there!
Why? Why mom?
I brought her...
The one you wished.
Mama...
Mama!
I am... Mama...
Mama, it's me, Me.
Me...
Mama...
Now I can be with Papa and Mama forever.
Yes.
If that is what you wish.
Your world keeps growing.
It's pretty...
If you're happy, then I'm happy.
The Pokemon that kidnapped Satoshi's mom?
That's Entei.
Entei?
It's known only from legends.
There's one more thing about this case.
Another mysterious Pokemon.
You mean Unknown, right?
Then one you've been researching.
Unknown is within these ruins...
I see...
It's as I thought.
Eyewitnesses on Greenfield, the source of the crystalisation, state that the legendary Pokemon
Entei has kidnapped a woman.
- Mama! Wait!
- However, details are still unknown for now.
We are broadcasting live as a bulldozer is being called to break through the crystals!
You can't!
Don't destroy it!
Dr. Sully's disappearance, this mysterious crystalisation. Even Entei's appearance.
All of this was caused by the Unknown.
There doesn't seem to be any other possibility.
A mail?
Papa and Mama came back to me.
I'm happy.
I want things to stay as they are!
Nobody come in!
Me-chan...
She must be safe, since she could send me a mail...
But it's odd.
Isn't her dad missing?
Yeah.
And by "Mama... "
It's puzzling.
Your back's so big, Papal
- Having fun?
- Yeah.
I can't wait for them to solve the puzzle!
Will you come with me, Pikachu?
Wait, Satoshi!
I'll go, too!
Don't leave me behind!
Kasumi, Takeshi...
What...?
Satoshi-kun, take that Pokegear with you.
Lynn-san...
You might as well have a way to communicate with the Pokemon Center, right?
I'll tell Dr. Okido about it for you.
Thanks.
Water doesn't seem to crystalise...
Yeah, so if we follow the river, we should reach the Snowdon home.
Those guys never give up.
Aiming for outer space, we're Team Rocket!
Going from above is better than from below.
And our goal is the castle's treasure!
This rocks!
What?
- Isn't that the thing we saw on TV?
- Entei, right?
This suc...
Isn't it cruel to dump us like this so suddenly?
Well, we managed to get in...
But what is this place?
There doesn't seem to be any treasure here.
Besides, you'd keep a treasure with you constantly.
- Then the treasure's in that tower?
- But how would we get there?
We have to go down, then back up...
Going down and up again...
- Isn't there an elevator?
- Of course there ain't one.
Who was that?
Nobody.
We're the only ones here.
We can see our house in there, Mama!
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes...
Something resembling a flame was just spotted above the Snowdon home, but we can't confirm it.
The rescue squad's set to arrive tomorrow morning, but...
Hm?
Is that a... Pokemon?
All right, Fushigidane and Chicorita.
Use Vine Whip!
Togepy, stay still for a while, okay?
Satoshi?
What do you think you're doing?
Um, actually...
It looks like someone's trying to get in our home...
Satoshi...
- That's too dangerous!
- What is, mama?
Nothing...
The thing on his back is a Pikachu, right?
Ah! He has a Fushigidane and a Chicorita, too!
Is he a Pokemon Trainer, Mama?
Yeah...
Maybe he has other Pokemon, too!
Right, Papa?
Papa?
Good work, guys.
Thanks to you too,
Fushigidane and Chicorita.
You really came through for us!
Are you guys all right?
Lynn-san?
Satoshi, you were just on TV!
Sorry, Dr. Okido.
But I...
I'm not going to tell you to come back when you're already there.
Just save your mom and hurry back!
Right.
Satoshi-kun, this is John.
Did you see any Unknown?
- Not yet.
- I see.
According to Dr. Sully's research,
Unknown can sense the feelings of others.
What do you mean?
They can sense the feelings in the hearts of humans, and turn them into reality.
The feelings in the hearts...?
The Unknown are reacting to what they're feeling from Me-chan's heart.
I'm sure that crystal tower was created from the Unknown reacting to her heart!
Hinoarashi, Flamethrower!
All right!
One more time, Flamethrower!
- Good job, Rokon!
- All right, let's swap fighters!
Water Gun!
All right. Now, Pikachu.
Let's go, guys.
Hitodeman, good work!
Great job, Waninoko.
What?
Is this the power of the Unknown?
The one that Dr. Okido warned us about?
Probably.
Either way, we've got to keep moving!
What's going on?
It's the world that the Unknown created from Me-chan's heart!
This is...
Ouch, oww!
And here I thought we'd finally reached the bottom...
Are these Pokemon?
I dunno, but we're better off not goin' near things we know nothin' about!
Well, yeah, but we have to go through here to reach the other tower!
Then we'll just have to sneak by!
- Quietly...
- Quiet steps...
- Stealthy steps...
- Soft steps...
- Quiet steps...
- Stealthy steps...
Looks like the guy from before and his friends got inside the house.
Should I kick them out?
I want to face them in a Pokemon battle!
- But can I do it?
- You can.
If that is what you wish.
That's right! I can do it!
I'm still little, but...
When I grow up...
I can do it, right?
This is the first time
I've been in a Pokemon battle!
You can do it, Me.
I can do it, right?
Entei?
You're Pokemon Trainers, right?
What about it?
Want to battle?
I don't know who you are, but I don't have the time right now.
You're so boring.
Hey, Entei!
Where'd you take my mom?
Only me and my parents are here!
- That's right.
- What?
Satoshi...
Your name is Me, right?
Oh, you know who I am?
Me-chan's supposedly much smaller than that!
This is Me-chan's world, as created by the power of the Unknown.
That girl can make anything.
And she can be anything!
No way...
Are we gonna battle or not?
All right!
- I'll be your opponent, miss!
- All right.
Takeshi?
Entei came from up there.
So your mom should be there, too.
Let's go, Satoshi.
Finding your mom's our first priority!
Let's go, Pikachu!
We'll use three Pokemon.
You're free to switch out at any time.
Understood.
Go, Zubat!
I'm counting on you.
Mokoko, go!
Zubat, use Supersonic!
It's working!
Zubat, Wing Attack!
Here it comes!
Dodge it!
Good job! Here it comes again, use Headbutt!
Now! ThunderShock!
Return, Zubat!
You did your best...
We did it!
That was amazing, Mokoko!
The match just started.
Go, Rokon!
Then here.
How about this one?
A Himeguma, huh?
A cute Pokemon for a cute lady.
It's not just cute.
DynamicPunch
Himeguma, Explosive Punch!
Quick Attack
Rokon, Lightspeed Strike!
Himeguma, Fury Swipes!
Pokemon created from Me-chan's heart...
They're not just for show... they're strong!
Soft steps, quiet steps...
Is there really a treasure in a place like this?
What are you on about?
We can't go back empty-handed now!
Return, Rokon!
- You're pretty strong!
- You too.
But I'm training to become the world's #1 Pokemon Breeder!
A Trainer needs to raise his Pokemon well.
Good point.
You're right!
Yeah, that smile!
That's a nice smile!
You're a strange one.
Gomazo, Rollout attack!
Just because it's small doesn't mean you should let your guard down!
Is this picture book yours?
Yeah.
- Papa read it to me all the time...
- I see...
You can have it if you want, Mama...
Me-chan, have you always been alone?
Did you feel lonely?
A little...
But it's all right now.
Mama and Papa are here...
So, who's gonna battle me now?
Then, Takeshi...
Me will never lose.
Is Entei an illusion too?
- I want to battle a stronger Trainer.
- What?
- Leave this to me, Satoshi.
- And you are?
The world's most beautiful girl, Kasumi!
At one point,
I was to be Hanada Gym's Leader!
- You're a Gym Leader?
- Don't look down on me.
You don't have to be an adult to be a Gym Leader?
You can do it.
You can do anything.
That girl's real body is probably with your mom!
Hurry up to where she is!
I'm from Hanada Gym, so I'll be using Water-types!
Then I'll use
Water-type Pokemon, too.
I see.
You can do anything here, huh?
Let's battle!
Here I go!
Kingdra, please!
Go, My Steady!
All right!
Use Headbutt now!
Tosakinto, Fury Attack!
Tosakinto, you did your best...
We did it, we did it!
This one's next.
Not bad.
This makes no sense.
Don't think about boring logic, just act!
Aimin' for outer space, we're Team Rocket!
Just keep aimin' higher!
Or somethin' like that.
Tackle!
Mantine, Whirlpool!
He's trapped!
Bubble Beam!
Hitodeman, Rapid Spin!
- Well?
- Amazing!
Take Down Mantine,
Charge attack!
Hitodeman, Tackle!
This is fun!
This is so fun!
Seeing you laugh makes me happy.
Thank you, Papa.
Satoshi...
- Are you all right, Mom?
- I'm fine.
But you're still risking yourself as much as always.
It's because I'm your son.
Me-chan?
And the Unknown?
Aren't they here?
If you mean the Pokemon that brought me here, he left a while back.
That was Entei.
This tower and Entei were created from Me-chan's heart, by the Unknown.
No way...
Either way, we've got to leave.
Right.
Wake up...
Wake up, Me-chan.
What's wrong, Mama?
Listen, Me-chan.
I'm not your real mother.
I'm Satoshi's mama, not yours.
Do you remember me, Me-chan?
We met in Masara Town.
Please, come with me.
Mama...
You can't stay here!
No...
No...
No!
Mom... Mom!
- Are you OK, Mom?
- Yeah...
Over here, mom!
What's wrong, Me?
Papa, that boy wants to take Mama away!
- Satoshi!
- Mom! Mom!
Leave her and go!
I'd never do that!
She's my mother!
She's Me's mother here.
- You don't get to decide that!
- Get out.
If you don't leave on your own,
I'll make you leave!
We'll see about that!
Waninoko, I choose you!
- You intend to defeat me?
- I won't lose to an illusion!
Waninoko, Water Gun!
I'm an illusion, you say?
Nonsense!
Return, Waninoko!
If water won't work, let's try fire!
Go, Hinoarashi!
Hinoarashi, Flamethrower!
Return, Hinoarashi!
He's strong...
Do you still think I'm an illusion?
You're an illusionary Entei created by that girl's heart!
No...
No!
I'm an illusion, you say?
I'm...
I am...
This girl's father!
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Me-chan, do you remember?
Your real papa and mama?
Me-chan!
We made it!
Here too?
- A battle?
- With us right in the middle...
Pikachu!
Lizardon!
You came, Lizardon!
Thank you!
Satoshi!
Are you all right?
What is he?
- My friend.
- Friend?
My Pokemon are all friends that I made during my journey!
Friends...?
It doesn't matter how many you have!
- We too...
- ... are your friends!
Takeshi! Kasumi!
I'm gonna say this before you ask "What's that?"
- Musashi!
- Kojiro!
And Nyarth!
We're your friends from Team Rocket!
Team Rocket?
Why are you...?
Actually...
Somehow...
...our hands just reached out.
We've been around each other for a while.
Come on, Me-chan.
Come with us.
My friends are here!
Go away!
Lizardon!
Papa!
Do you really think you can be
Me-chan's real father?
As long as she wishes it,
I will be Me's father!
Me!
Lizardon, Flamethrower!
One more time, Lizardon!
Papa!
Lizardon, Fire Spin!
Entei, please!
Listen to me!
If you really care about Me-chan, then listen to me!
You can't stay here with that girl!
It's just wrong!
Even if it is wrong,
I will grant Me's wishes!
Lizardon!
If you keep her here, she'll always be alone!
Lizardon...
This is the end!
Stop it!
Stop, Papa... No more!
No more!
I lost to you, Me-chan.
Your Gomazo's Rollout was really strong!
Your Mantine's Whirlpool, too!
You could be a Gym Leader one day!
After a battle's over, those of us who love Pokemon...
We're all friends.
Let's go outside.
- Even if you fight when outside...
- You can make friends.
Lots of them.
Let's go, Me-chan.
It's warm...
Papa?
I became your father to make you happy.
If your happiness lies in the outside world...
I...
- Wha...?
- What now?
This way!
Lizardon, take care of Me!
Hang in there!
Everybody hurry!
- What's going on, doc?
- It's the Unknown!
They can't stop their power now that it was unleashed!
The crystalisation's even spreading here!
Satoshi, you have to stop the Unknown from running wild!
The crystalisation's spreading further!
Even the Pokemon Center's being engulfed by crystals!
Run away!
- Y-Yes!
- Hurry!
These are the Unknown...
How do we stop them?
There's a barrier protecting them!
Lizardon, you go!
We did it!
I'm counting on you, Pikachu!
Thunderbolt
100.000 volts!
Are you all right, Pikachu?
This is really bad!
There ain't no treasure here, let's go home!
Guess you're right...
Excuse us...
We're blocked!
Somebody do something!
Please stop, Unknown!
Me.
I'm glad...
That I got to be your father.
The last thing I can do for you...
...is to get you out of this place!
I was born from your dreams.
So if you believe in it, there's nothing I can't do.
Papa...!
Me...
Me!
Me, you have to believe in Entei!
That your Entei can't lose!
Good luck, Papa!
Me...
Me!
Me...
Me!
Papa...
Thank you for calling me Papa.
I'll go back to your dreams.
Papa...
- This is the real...
- Greenfield!
It's beautiful!
Hey, is everybody safe?
Dr. Okido!
Thank you...
Let's go meet them, Me-chan.
Everybody was worried about you!
- Come on.
- Yeah!
Me-chan!
Young miss!
Well? What do we do now?
The police are down there.
We can't go down...
That's right!
Sonansu!
In any case...
That's one less lonely girl!
But there's another in here!
A young lonely girl.
Musashi!
A young, lonely man.
Kojiro!
Next one's always alone!
Me, as the wind blows in Greenfield!
Even if you're alone, we're your friends!
Whatever the reason...
This rocks!
Before long, the rain will stop falling.
Someday, the clouds will disappear.
Lift your face, and you should hear my voice calling you
Since shining tears point to a smile
Someday, someone will be given wings for this sadness
Rub your cheeks, let the sunlight rain on you
You remembered to smile, right? You've replied o someone's voice with it, right?
Since a small smile points to happiness
One day, you'll be wrapped up in that pleasure.
When you get wings that make sadness go away, a rainbow is born
From a lonely color towards a warm color.
This is the gradation of feelings
Anywhere there's a warm glow...
What's real solitude actually like?
There's nothing to say,
since you should already know...
If you come across a day when someone sheds their tears,
That time around, let's grant wings for that sadness
When you get wings that make sadness go away, a rainbow is born
From a lonely color towards a warm color
This is the gradation of feelings
Anywhere there's a warm glow...

Be very very quiet.
I‚Äôm hunting rabbits.
I am a duck bent on self- preservationum.
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!
Duck season! Fire!
Hold everything.
''Daffy gets blasted.''
Page 7: ''Daffy gets blasted.''
Page 8: ''Daffy gets blasted again! ''
What's the matter with you people?
We can't do this kind of stuff anymore.
Brothers Warner... show biz legends like me shouldn't have to play stooge... to that long- eared, carrot- chomping, overbite- challenged- -
What's up, doc?
Bobby, how's the wife?
Great nose job, Chuck. Thanks, girls.
Good rug, Mel. Never would have guessed.
- Pardon me.
- The pleasure is mine.
Fellas, I think Daff's right.
Maybe I'll take a vacation.
Go visit my 542 nieces and nephews.
Mr. Duck, excuse me, I‚Äôm sorry.
I don't see how we can have a
Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny.
Oh, my heavens, no.
You couldn't have a movie without Bugs Bunny.
If you don't mind me asking, whose glorified personal assistant are you?
Kate Houghton, Vice President, Comedy.
Right.
Kate did Lethal Weapon Babies.
Finally, a Lethal Weapon that I can take my grandchildren to.
Gentlemen, check your phones.
Our latest research shows that Bugs Bunny is a core asset... that appeals to male and female, young and old throughout the universe... while your fan base is limited to angry fat guys in basements.
Yeah, but.... Come on, fellas,
I‚Äôm thrice the entertainer the rabbit is!
Fine, it's hilarious... but moviegoers these days demand action heroes, like me!
Top that, rabbit.
So, it has come to this, has it?
I‚Äôm afraid the Brothers Warner must choose... between a handsome matinee idol... or this miscreant perpetrator of low burlesque.
Whichever one's not the duck.
That's the stuff from my office.
- You don't have an office.
- Not anymore.
Symbolically, this is bad.
Please, brother. Other brother?
Icy she- wolf? Help me, please.
I‚Äôm too moist and tender to retire.
- Let me escort you out.
- Wait!
I haven't tried toadying, kowtowing, or butt- kissing yet.
I‚Äôm still begging here!
Freeze!
Can I try that again?
No, thank you. We'll call you.
Hey, D.J. How did your tryout go?
Well, let's see.
I can say I made an impression.
Your father can get you a job anytime he wants to.
I know, but I don't want that.
I'd really rather earn it, sir.
- Mr. Warner mentioned you this morning.
- He did? What did he say?
He said don't forget the TurtleWax.
What about animation?
I could do cartoons.
Dead duck walking.
- Morning, Mr. Bunny.
- Very hot now.
And I do voices. Listen.
- Excuse me.
- ''Fetch the stick, boy.''
''What a maroon.''
''You can't handle the truth.''
Some grip, lady.
I need you to eject this duck.
- Lady, this is Daffy Duck.
- Exactly.
- Not anymore. We own the name.
- Yeah?
You can't stop me from calling myself....
- What do you know?
- You fired Daffy Duck?
No, I didn't. I did. They did.
You just were following orders.
You know what? You don't know me.
You're Kate Houghton, you're the VP of Comedy. Go figure.
You drive a red 1988 Alfa Romeo.
Good engine. Little under- driven.
I know this because you nearly ran me over last week.
Anyway, about that duck, you want me to get rid of him still?
- Duck, yes. Eject the duck, please.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
- He's gone.
What are you waiting for, backup?
Shabby job so far, constable.
Quick! After me!
Now you're gonna pay for that one.
Come here!
- Dress Inspector!
- Look out!
One side, Spartacuses.
- Come on.
- Daffy, stop!
Cut him off at the pass, boys.
All units in pursuit of little black duck.
Well, that's just cheating.
Don't follow me.
That's not right. Cut!
That's lunch, everybody!
- That airbag cost a lot of money.
- I‚Äôm okay.
Good morning. Batman, you good?
All right.
My chariot awaits.
Yes!
Bat- lights. Bat- conditioning.
Bat- stereo.
To the Duck Cave.
Now what are you doing?
Stay away from that Batmobile!
- I‚Äôm allowed to steal. I‚Äôm a celebrity.
- Tell it to the judge!
- Feeling pretty good about yourself?
- I am.
- You bested that dastardly duck?
- I did.
You're gonna offer your catch to the pretty executive?
Indeed.
Miss Houghton!
Get out of the way!
Look out!
What do you know? I found Nemo.
I think she likes you.
Your father would be so ashamed of you.
But I was.... lt was....
At first, they told me to lose the stutter.
Now they tell me I‚Äôm not funny.
It's a pain in the butt being politically correct.
You're telling me.
What kind of performance do you call that?
You made me sound like a total space cadet, man.
I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.
I was trying to be real to your character.
If you, like, goof on me in the sequel,
I‚Äôm coming after you.
And I'll give you a Scooby Snack!
There are some areas of the script
I think we need to address.
There's no heart, no cooperation, nobody learns anything.
Daffy learns not to stick his head in a jet engine.
- He's gone.
- No, Daffy always comes back.
I just tell him how much I need him.
We hug, we cry,
I drop something heavy on him, I laugh.
The duck is history, okay?
So the question is... how can I help you reposition your brand identity?
Answer: We team you up with a hot female co- star.
Usually...
I play the female love interest.
About the cross- dressing thing? ln the past, funny. Today, disturbing.
Lady, if you don't find a rabbit with lipstick amusing... you and I have nothing to say to each other.
Look, I‚Äôm trying to be nice... but I was brought in to leverage your synergy... and I am not going to let you or some wacky duck- -
Daffy.
Wacky, daffy, nutty, fruitcake, crispy over rice, it doesn't matter.
Well, these matter.
And this.
And they say we get Daffy back.
Right, boys?
- We want Daffy!
- Bring him back!
We love Daffy!
Little Damian.
Hey, Granny.
Hi, Tweety.
How was work today?
Eventful.
What a nice young man.
Guess who? So did you miss me?
I‚Äôm glad I was fired. ln a few days, they'll be kissing my befeathered rump... begging me to come back. But I won't.
Did I miss the part where I invited you in?
I'll be too busy accepting numerous, multiple offers.
Every studio in town....
Who am I kidding? My career is over.
Perhaps I was being too polite. Get out!
I'll starve. I'll have to eat envelope glue.
Wait, a sushi bar.
No!
- Daffy.
- Yes.
Leave my father's house. Now.
You live with Daddy?
Yeah, so?
Just, you know, kind of temporarily.
I've hit rock bottom.
I‚Äôm hanging out with a security guard who lives with his father.
My grease and gravy!
Your dad is Damian Drake.
- The super spy.
- He's an actor who plays a spy.
- And that? That was his I Spy Award.
- Ingenious.
An actor playing a super spy as a cover for being a super spy playing an actor. ln fact, I'll bet this whole dump is a super spy lair.
Nothing is as it seems.
You're probably protected by an invisible force field right this minute.
The force field- penetrating apple.
Just feel free to continue your delusional ranting... while I answer my....
Remote?
Hello?
- Son?
- Dad?
What are you doing in the painting?
I wanted to keep you out of this, but there's no one else I can trust.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you shooting a movie or something?
A new Damian Drake movie? Cool.
Come to Las Vegas.
Ask Dusty Tails for the Blue Monkey.
The Blue Monkey? What's a Blue Monkey?
A diamond. A very special diamond.
Find Dusty Tails.
Dad, you need me to call the police or something?
- No police.
- Dad, are you all right?
I‚Äôm sorry I never told you this before, but I....
- Dad?
- Diamond? I‚Äôm rich!
- I've joined the leisure class.
- I gotta go save my dad.
Your dad, yeah.
So count me in. A spy caper.
Double agents, exploding bikinis, tigers hanging from helicopters!
I'm through with show biz!
From now on,
I‚Äôm gonna live the adventure.
- Next stop, Las Vegas.
- I'll take my dad's old car.
- A super spy car. Let's ride.
- This isn't a spy car.
Your dad is a spy. Ipso ergo, a spy car.
I used to deliver pizzas in this car.
Secret pizzas?
A spy pie, maybe?
Fine, be that way.
But it's definitely a spy car!
A little help here?
Ducks.
You know how I know it's a spy car?
Because it looks absolutely nothing like a spy car.
I don't think this routine is gonna work without Daffy, but....
Action.
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.
- Rabbit season.
- Wait a minute.
See, I told you this wasn't gonna work without- - 
Pain. Agony!
You're fired.
What?
- But you- -
- You got rid of our best duck.
You can't fire me.
My films have made $950 million!
- That's not a billion.
- Nope. Not a billion.
Okay.
All right.
I think we can all agree that the decision to get rid of Daffy was a poor one.
But it's time to move on.
And by move on, I mean reversing course and getting Daffy back.
By Monday.
I will have Daffy back on Monday.
That went well.
Listen, doll face, if I know Daffy, he's already hit the road by now.
It's good to stretch.
I‚Äôm getting tired of throwing you out of the car.
That's my plan in a nutshell.
Now, listen, if we run into anything that requires super spy skills... like cracking wise, smooching dames, you better leave that to me.
However, if we have any security guarding needs....
Very funny, duck. I‚Äôm not a security guard.
For your information, it's just a job.
It's what I do for money.
What I really do is....
I‚Äôm a stuntman.
- You? A stuntman? Please.
- I am !
Did you see those Mummy movies?
I‚Äôm in them more than Brendan Fraser is.
No, he couldn't stand that.
One day he decides that, ''No! The Bren- master does all his own stunts! ''
Listen, muscles, if this heap ever makes it to Vegas, I'll do all the stunts.
Duck here.
- Daffy, old chum, how the heck- -
- Cram it down your rabbit hole.
I think I can get you your old job back with less of a pay cut than usual.
So not interested.
I‚Äôm off to Las Vegas with my new sidekick D.J... to match wits with spies and showgirls.
It's a little adventure I call:
''Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey.''
And you're not in it.
Blue Monkey?
Blue Monkey?
It's a little adventure I call.
'Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey. '
This is unacceptable!
We cannot have 9- year- olds working in sweatshops making Acme sneakers... not when 3- year- olds work for so much less.
But, sir, they require naps.
Put double espresso in their sippy cups.
What's next on the agenda?
Where's my people? What's coming up?
What's the next thing?
Thank you, Bob.
Grave news, my friends.
Direct your attention to the video screen.
Cable, input, VCR, satellite.
Input, satellite, tape, menu, rewind... power, on. lt seems that Damian Drake's son knows about the Blue Monkey... and he is on his way to Las Vegas.
He must not find the location of the diamond before we do.
How is the interrogation going?
He's about ready to crack, boss!
Cable, input, VCR and satellite, off.
We cannot let the good guys win this time, people.
We must capture this son of a spy... and we must locate the diamond... and use its powers for our own diabolical ends!
- Copy that to all departments.
- I didn't quite get that.
Didn't quite....
Something about capturing the son of a spy... and using the diamond's power for our diabolical ends.
Be sure and use the laugh.
I like the laugh. Don't you?
- And what is your name?
- Mary.
Well, Mary... how'd you like to do a little kissing later?
That's what they all say at first.
Soon the ACME Corporation will tower over all of creation!
All of creation!
Wait a minute.
- Yes?
- What about the duck?
Extra crispy.
Hello?
D.J., I‚Äôm not here to fire you again.
I just want to know if that duck told you where he was going.
- Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
- Why are you torturing me?
What have I ever done that....
Great.
I just fired the son of our biggest star.
This has been a career- making day, Kate.
First you get rid of the duck that everybody hates... but then, of course, they all want him back.
And worst of all, you get into a big fight with Bugs Bunny... who you revere and who you've tried to model your life after.
I hate to see a grown man cry.
Especially when it's a girl.
Listen, toots, would it stop the waterworks... if I told you Daffy was going to Las Vegas with that guy D.J.? lt might.
Well, then, how's about we travel in style in this?
Las Vegas, Jeeves.
Taking you to Las Vegas.
You've got no music in your soul, sister.
I am aware of that, yes.
He sure went for all the extras.
What a maroon.
Don't touch anything.
This is Damian Drake's car- -
- Let's see.
- No!
What does this one do?
Shaken, not stirred, sir.
It's 5:00 somewhere.
- If you touch one more thing- -
- I‚Äôm about to defy you.
- Now you done it.
- Arms at your side, please.
Formalwear activated.
You clean up nice, kid.
No!
Las Vegas!
Smell that, D.J.?
That's the sweet aroma of money, glamour... and busload upon busload of senior citizens.
Cool it, duck. This could be dangerous.
Right, we find Dusty Tails, save your dad, get the diamond... apply kung fu liberally as needed.
Under no circumstances are you to allow...
the young Mr. Drake and his duck cohort out of the casino in one piece.
- ls that clear?
- Okay.
You want the varmints and what they come for.
I got you. But what's in it for old Sam?
I got you.
Did you know that Dusty Tails sang the theme song to six Damian Drake movies?
I know. He's my father.
- Your dad is Damian Drake?
- Yes!
I‚Äôm kidding, relax. We did that.
I say, listen up, y'all.
Please put your greasy, buffet- shoveling hands together...
for our next act.
If you've heard her before, you're not here now.
So, I say, let me introduce you...
to Miss Dusty Tails.
Dusty!
Can I talk to you?
What the....
What?
Dusty, I gotta talk to you.
- I‚Äôm Damian Drake's son, D.J.
- What?
How do I know it's you?
You are Damian's son. ls there someplace we can talk?
- Excuse me, I have to change.
- Okay, toots, hand over the diamond.
- He brought a goose?
- It's duck, thank you.
- Hi.
- You again.
Listen up, you darn imbeciles!
We gotta get them varmints and what they come for!
- And then we blast them?
- Then we blast them.
Now if I were a giant diamond, where would I be?
Well, not there.
- My dad's in trouble...
- Not here.
...and he said that
I should ask you about the Blue Monkey.
- So then you know?
- Definitely. Yes.
I figured something must have happened when he didn't show up.
I‚Äôm sorry, but that's what comes with being a spy.
So, you're a spy, too?
The pop diva thing?
That's just one side of me.
I also work for the Agency.
Professional assassin.
It's really hard trying to juggle the two sometimes.
I don't know what I'll do when I have kids.
Do you know how hard it is to find a nanny with advance weapons training?
How many galoshes died to make that little number?
What about this Blue Monkey?
Your father was assigned to track it down before the chairman could.
The diamond has supernatural powers. lt would be a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands.
I was supposed to give him this.
This is not a king- sized diamond.
This is a queen of diamonds.
What kind of sick joke is this?
- Can I have that?
- Very funny.
That is so sweet.
You trying to take over for your father.
These evil forces? They're bad people.
Relax, sister. I don't know the meaning of the word ''fear.''
Say your prayers, duck!
Fear: noun. A state of terror.
Incoming!
This mission needs years of experience and training.
Maybe. I ain't got time for that right now.
I gotta go save my dad.
Don't lose that card. It's important.
After him, boys!
Easy on the feathers.
Come back here, you card- carrying coyote!
Dadburn slapstick clich√©!
Faster! Climb like my life depended on it.
You run, I'll steer.
Right! I mean, left. Your other left.
That's what I‚Äôm talking about! ls that all you got?
That's gonna leave a mark.
That's not boxing. Bite his ear!
Left and a right and a left and a right- left!
I‚Äôm gonna come up on you.
I'll take that playing card.
- After it, stunt boy.
- Man.
Jump!
All right, when I say, place your bets, gentlemen.
Money plays, loser stays.
Everyone's a.... Not everyone.
Here's my money. Now play.
- Card, sir?
- Hit me.
Don't you want to look at your cards first, son?
Boy's about as sharp as a bowling ball.
- Hit me.
- No, hit me first!
I said await your turn, sir.
Hit me.
No, hit me, fragnabbit!
- He's the boss.
- You son of a- -
Card, sir?
Hit me.
Twenty- one, a winner!
Let's go!
''And then they made their heroic escape! ''
I say we do Cirque du Soleil and call it a night.
How about the Liberace Museum?
All right, let's see what this baby can really do.
Now, that's an interesting feature.
Come back, you absconders!
Watch yourself, ma'am.
I love this rug.
- Come back here, you varmints!
- Run. Move. Go.
Nice car.
Don't hit me.
It's a modified Chevrolet with a big 24 on the side.
Out of the way, fancy boy.
I‚Äôm a- commandeering this here clown car.
After them, boys!
Shotgun!
Rag- flagging ragtag sidekicks!
Slow down, will you? I‚Äôm waddling here.
Come back, you darn idiot galoots!
There's gotta be 314 hotels and 142 casinos in Las Vegas.
We are never going to find that duck.
Daff never misses a cue.
- What's up, duck?
- Don't you start with me.
Excuse me.
You!
- You.
- Him.
- Her.
- Them !
Out of my way!
Dagnabbit!
- You are in big trouble, mister.
- Agreed!
Out!
What are you doing, kidnapping me?
Stop the car.
This is my adventure, bub.
Coming through.
What brings you to Las Vegas?
You ran out of people to fire in L.A.?
You stole my duck.
- Your duck? I belong to the world.
- You know what? You can have him.
Dynamite? Who has dynamite?
Welcome to my world.
Hang on.
Throw it out the window. Throw it out!
- But innocent people could be hurt.
- Throw it out the window! lt will send the wrong message to children.
Didn't he used to be behind us?
We're having duck tonight, boys.
Just a suggestion, but all those in favor of not hitting that wall say ''aye.''
- Aye!
- Mother.
Taking you to Mother.
Look, a shooting star.
Quick, everybody make a wish.
You know, I‚Äôm beginning to think that this one is the spy car.
What?
ETA to Mother, 10 minutes.
Please return your seatbacks to their full and upright position.
So, what are your plans now, if I may ask?
Daffy will save us. He's the hero.
All right, bucktooth. Stick a carrot in it.
Everybody calm down, all right?
I can handle this.
Sell my Warner Brothers stock.
I got an inside tip that Bugs Bunny is about to die.
Out of gas.
What? lt doesn't work like that.
Thanks, toots.
- Carrot?
- No, thanks.
You really think that playing card is going to help you rescue your father?
Yeah, I do.
You know this all sounds insane, right?
I remember the first time
I saw your dad in the movies.
So breathtaking.
Your hair smells nice.
- You say something?
- No, just saying good night.
I‚Äôm telling you, Daffy...
I heard the Warner Brothers say you were their best duck.
Flattered though I may be, flattened I will not... in order for you to get the laughs.
It's all.... And then....
- And your tail is on fire.
- Exactly my point.
No, really, your tail's on fire.
Daff, you're accident- prone.
What am I talking to you for?
All you have to do is munch on a carrot, and people love you.
I need you to move my 12:00 appointment up to 2:00 and then back to 1 1 :00.
Then just cancel it.
And I need you to get a helicopter and....
No, don't put me on hold.
Oh, God.
I can't die out here.
This wasn't the plan.
After this comedy...
I promised myself
I would only do real movies... about the human condition crammed with social relevance.
There's nothing but a big rock for 10 miles in that, that... that, and that direction.
I say we go that way.
Say, who are you kidding here?
We're goners!
Water! I can't die now.
Think of the millions of children who want me to have the diamond.
The poor children!
Look at that. ls it a mirage? Or just product placement?
Who cares? With shopping convenience at such low prices.
Water, Fresca, Mountain Dew.
Your product name here. ls this your idea?
The audience expects it.
They don't even notice this kind of thing anymore.
Nice of Wal- Mart to provide these Wal- Mart beverages... in return for us saying ''Wal- Mart'' so many times.
Where's Yosemite Sam?
- What is your report?
- Boss, it wasn't me.
That razzan- frazzan duck and that crazy son D.J... and a humina- humina Dusty Tails.
You know, that makes a lot of sense.
Thank you.
Mr. Drake, are you going to save us the bother of eliminating your son?
My son is going to kick your evil butt.
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes, Dad.
- Desert operative.
- No.
Not a bad idea, Dad.
Our desert operative is due for a win.
I told you we should have made that left turn at Albuquerque.
Don't start that again.
All right. Here's the plan.
We wait here for the next truck or car or camel or whatever... and take Bugs and Daffy... get back to Hollywood and finish making the movie.
What are you going to do?
- I‚Äôm just gonna keep walking that way.
- That's your plan?
Yep. That's the direction the car was going.
You're not leaving me here while you make off with my diamond.
I don't wanna get too wrapped up in your caper... but let's assume that you're right and Damian Drake is a spy?
Super spy.
What's the point of just meandering through the desert if....
Here.
Be safe.
- Attaboy. Trust your instincts.
- Yeah.
Except for the water tower, the Batmobile, the rubble known as Las Vegas.
There's nobody as rich, famous, and powerful as my father... who just disappears into thin air.
Suddenly I feel like
I'm in Aunt Marge's Jell- O mold.
Guys, it's air- conditioned in here.
Come on in.
Intruder alert.
Easy.
Earth freak.
Okay, buster.  Where's Damian
Drake and that big diamond?
Cleanup on aisle three.
Can I be of service?
I am monitored to respond to the name Robbie.
Hi, D.J.
At ease. I‚Äôm Mother.
Yeah, like the car said that we would be meeting you.
How do you know my name?
D.J., I've known you since you were this big.
That's not really possible, is it?
Must have been a photo.
Let me just take care of this, and we'll....
Give it to me straight. How bad is it?
So, shall we?
So little to do, so much time.
You're going to put him back, right?
I can't go back to L.A. with duck soup.
We do have the facilities to reconstitute the body.
The mind though, will remain a gooey mess.
So, about my father?
All in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.
All right, break it up, fellas. Nice coats.
White is the new black, you know.
Yes.
Look.
- So this is Area 51, right?
- No.
The secret military base where they keep the aliens?
No, Area 51 is actually a paranoid fantasy we concocted... to hide the true identity of this facility.
- Which is?
- Area 52.
But don't quote me on that.
Oh, right. Area 52.
- So, Mother- -
- Call me ''Mom.''
Mom, what is it that you do here exactly, anyway?
Creation, transubstantiation, destruction.
It's stressful. All kinds of things.
They're already here. You're next.
My God... what am I going to do with you?
You've done nothing but screw up!
You've walked off mesas.
You've been smashed by boulders.
You've been run over by diesel trucks.
Don't blame the equipment. It's good.
It's ACME equipment.
You're a coyote. Be wily.
All right, now.
Buck up and let's see a little smile.
Little bigger.
That's nice.
Now, just go take a shower, and don't come back till you smell better!
Be careful. There're men moving a safe out there, and I don't want you to....
And be careful of the box of fireworks because....
I suppose I should mention the plate- glass window....
It's tough being the boss.
A communication.
Memo to Marvin the Martian.
Obtain the playing card, and destroy the duck.
And when I say destroy the duck,
I mean kill him viciously and painfully.
A mission? I‚Äôm all a- tingle.
So, here we are in the I- can't- tell- you- what room.
Robert, can you take care of that, please?
Yes, madam.
When you bring Daffy back, could you make him 20% funnier?
- I heard that.
- What were we discussing?
This isn't about the giant ants, is it?
- Giant ants?
- Because they're not really ants anymore.
Tell me about the Blue Monkey.
How do you know about that thing that I've never heard of in my entire life?
My dad told me.
What is the point of making them pinky swear?
All right.
Now this tape will explain everything. lt was prepared especially for your father.
Greetings, Damian Drake.
If you are watching this, you are aware that the world is in grave danger.
The ACME Corporation is in hot pursuit of the Blue Monkey diamond...
a supernatural gem with the ability to turn people into monkeys...
and then back again.
lt is the ACME chairman's goal to turn the population...
into monkey slaves to manufacture shoddy ACME goods...
and then change them back to people to buy the stuff.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable, you may say.
Your mission is this.
Find it, destroy it, save humanity.
And remember, no one wants to be turned into a monkey.
So that's why.
Those guys came after my dad because he was going to save the world.
So that means if I go after the diamond, then the bad guys come after me.
Hang on.
You're not seriously thinking about- -
Taking over your father's mission?
- I guess that would be all right.
- What?
Listen, if you're going to be a spy, you'll need spy stuff.
So, is this where you keep all the high- tech spy gadgets?
Yes.
That's cool. So I get to use all this stuff?
No, your stuff is over here.
But I really like the....
All right. Looks like an ordinary cell phone.
Three- way calling, voice dialing, downloadable ringtones.
- My phone does all that.
- Superconducting electromagnet.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
GPS with mapping software... tip calculator, Gameboy.
Gameboy?
High- powered laser.
Polycarbonate rappelling line with jet- propelled micro grappling hook.
Nose hair trimmer.
You always want to look your best.
Get over here, you idiot.
No, cold. Cold. Warm, warmer.
Permit me, madam.
Robert, darling. Excellent choice.
Swank pants.
And comfortable, too.
Plus, liquid hydrogen rocket pockets, here and here.
And stitching, nuclear- powered crotch pad....
He'll be down in a moment.
Wakey, wakey, friends.
Time to wreak mayhem in the cause of evil.
Mother, just one last question.
What's the deal with this card?
That is the window into what lies behind her smile.
What?
I‚Äôm sorry, our intelligence people feel a need to code everything in a riddle.
They get some kind of perverse pleasure out of it. I think it's corporate.
All humans.
Looks like we got company.
Illegal aliens.
Exterminate them.
Darn. I knew this day would come.
Let us exterminate them.
Emergency shutdown activated.
Force- barrier seal in 30 seconds.
Exterminate.
The playing card, please.
I'll take that. Out of my way.
Hero coming through.
There is no escape.
You pesky fowl!
Isn't it about time to enjoy a frosty, cold soda at the concession stand?
Exterminate!
Get the lead out.
Bus is leaving.
Halt or be fricasseed.
That was fun.
Looking for this?
Now, what did she mean by a window?
The window into what lies behind her smile.
That's the Mona Lisa.
- Which is in the Louvre.
- Which is in Paris.
Just how are we supposed to get to Paris?
Like this. lt doesn't look like much of a window to me.
Maybe the diamond is in the painting.
- All we have to do is steal the Mona Lisa.
- Way ahead of you.
- No, you look, you don't touch, right?
- Yeah.
But I‚Äôm already in costume.
- That's a good look for you.
- Do you think so?
Wait a minute. lt is a window.
It's an X- ray.
Sorry.
It's a map of Africa.
Maybe that's where the diamond is.
Hold it up. I'll take a picture.
Can I take a picture? Please?
Come on, give me your phone.
I want to take a picture, too.
Cheese it, the cops.
He's gone.
So let me take a picture, will you?
I want to take a picture, too.
Come on, please? Can I hold the window?
Let me see the window.
I'll take that!
What gives, doc?
We made 35 pictures together.
As it turns out, I‚Äôm secretly evil.
That's show biz for you.
Now make with the card, so I can please my dark masters.
Yes, sir. Queen of diamonds is your card.
Just put it back in the deck, anywhere is fine. And oopsie- daisy!
- ls this your card?
- No.
- This?
- No.
- Run. This?
- No.
I said it's the queen of diamonds,
I tell you.
You mean, like this one?
Think we should go back and help him?
Elmer never gets Bugs.
It's a formula, but it works.
The great thing about movies, you always know what will happen.
For instance, if this was a movie... you and I‚Äôd probably wind up together.
If you don't let go of me, I'll scream... but I‚Äôm not gonna stop screaming!
Well, this is surreal.
Stop or I'll fire.
Hello.
Oh, my.
Ladies, please.
Gendarme!
- Oui, monsieur?
- There's a man there. He's got a woman.
She's tied up in a burlap sack.
He's taking her to the Eiffel Tower. lt is spring, is it not?
I‚Äôm gonna blast you.
Shucks.
''Pointillism: A technique of using individual dots of pigment...
''which, taken together, make an image.''
Oh, crud.
I think when you go to the movies, you should learn something.
Pardonnez- moi. Excusez- moi.
Look at that clown here.
Now, there's something you don't see every day.
You.
Come here.
Wait a minute.
- I don't want any trouble.
- What are you doing?
I just want your pants!
That's right. I‚Äôm a vicious bird of prey.
Merci.
He's got the camera !
Give the girl back!
- What kept you?
- You okay?
That was great.
I‚Äôd say it's a perfect day.
Except for the fact that we lost the map.
- We?
- All right, I‚Äôm the jerk who lost the map.
And I‚Äôm the bunny who saved the card. Voil√†.
Nice going, Bugs.
Africa.
Chair people, I reveal to you... the whereabouts of the Blue Monkey.
All right.
There's a duck in the middle of the map.
Remove the duck.
Remove the duck! The duck is in the....
Duck!
We cannot let a boy, girl, duck, and rabbit thwart our plans for global domination.
- Wanna bet?
- A wager?
$5 says my son will scuttle your diabolical plans and save the world.
You're awfully spunky for a man in your position.
How do you like that,
Mr. Slap Yourself in Your Own Face?
Give him a good zets every once in a while.
My pleasure.
Now, I think I'm going to hedge my bet.
I‚Äôm going to unleash our most vicious operative.
Mr. Chairman, while we agree that the
Tasmanian Devil is quite vicious...
if memory serves, he is also really stupid.
Really? So are you.
That's a good boy.
I withdraw my objection.
This would have been a lot easier underground.
Come on, it's only another 6,000 cubits in this here thick direction.
Look, Granny, it's that nice boy from next door.
Little Damian.
How funny seeing you here, dear.
Hi, Granny.
Would you and your little friends like a lift?
Giddy-up, Dumbo.
Sure was a lucky coincidence you showing up just now.
Yes, wasn't it?
I've discovered my roots.
I've discovered my lunch.
Cry freedom !
What a fantastic view.
Unless you're in the audience... in which case you've been staring at an elephant's behind for 30 seconds.
My destiny awaits.
I guess this is our stop.
Enjoy the rest of your adventure, children.
This is the Blue Monkey?
This dime- store bauble?
- I've been rooked. Shafted by the gods.
- Nice going, Daffy.
I demand recompense.
I want my diamond.
Where is my humongous rock?
Pressed duck.
- This looks like a puzzle piece.
- What?
Wait a minute.
Are we rich yet?
Any time now.
I‚Äôm rich. I‚Äôm affluent.
My liquidity is assured.
Daffy, get back here. Don't touch that!
Let go! Don't you dare!
- The rock is mine. So close.
- You mind?
Yes, I mind. I'm the hero.
I should get the treasure.
The girl, too, but we'll discuss that later.
Careful with my diamond. Easy, now.
Dad, this is for you.
Why, D.J., why you? Why wasn't it me?
Just academic curiosity, you understand.
Gotta go. Bank closes at 5:00.
- Come on, Daffy, change him back.
- All right.
Buddy pictures.
- D.J., pal, you're okay.
- Yeah.
Give me that.
- I liked you better as a monkey.
- Thanks.
That is so sweet.
Now if you could just hand over the diamond.
Immediately!
My turn.
Pardon.
All right, now, I've come for the diamond.
I knew it was you.
You knew it was me, did you?
You're wrong. Because I‚Äôm not me.
I‚Äôm actually....
I can't. I can't reach over the hat.
I‚Äôd rehearse back at ACME, but I never wore the hat.
And now the hat is throwing me off.
Would you....
Thank you very much. Now, I‚Äôm actually....
Your father.
- Dad.
- Saw that one coming.
Look into your heart, D.J.
- You know it's true.
- No, it can't be true.
You're right, it isn't.
Let's do some drills.
This doesn't make a lick of sense.
Well, who's laughing now?
Apparently, no one.
Anyway, give me the Monkey!
No, forget that, man. You're evil.
Thank you, but....
Anyway, Mr. Smith, let's show this muscle- bound beefcake... who I have sometimes been mistaken for... what it's like to live in the real world.
Have you ever been disintegrated in one place and then reassembled in another?
Fire away.
No, you don't!
I thought they fixed that glitch.
Mr. Smith is fired!
I have to do everything myself around here.
- Good.
- You....
Henchmen.
Dad.
So this is the remote that works.
This, my friend, is the ACME Train of Death... which is not good news for your father.
Don't worry about me, son.
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this one.
You see, if the Train of Death doesn't kill him... then those crates of TNT will.
Not to mention the 2- ton anvil hanging over his head.
And look. There's the Pendulum of Doom.
What's the Pendulum of Doom doing there? I did not order it.
It's overkill. Get rid of it.
Now, if you want to keep your family ''together''...
I would hand over the Blue Monkey now.
Don't worry, son. I‚Äôm fine.
- You're a sick man, you know that?
- Get used to it.
Excuse me? What about my father?
- He's waiting for a train.
- What? You....
Where's Marvin the Martian?
All right, here is the Blue Monkey.
Go put it on the satellite. Go!
No, you don't, eight ball.
You'd never catch that rabbit being this heroic.
- What's up, doc?
- You're despicable.
Vandals.
Your friends' efforts will prove to be futile.
You see, here is the Blue Monkey, here is the ACME satellite.
When the Blue Monkey is finally docked in the satellite...
I will transmit a beam around the world... which will transform everyone but me into monkeys.
Now take them away!
Don't you think that'll get lonely...
Mr. All My Friends Swing from Trees and Pick Fleas Out of Their Furry Butts?
Lonely? I suppose I could use a little human companionship.
Thanks a lot.
I've seen you notice me.
I know I'm hot.
But I prefer someone with a little more oomph.
I prefer Mary!
Hello, Mary.
We're a cute couple, don't you think?
Take those future simians away and lower the Monkey shield.
Earthlings have the worst sense of direction.
What do you know, he fell for it.
I guess I owe you $5.
Did you order satellite?
I don't even have cable.
You know, when I fired that duck...
I never would have seen this coming.
Gotta be a way out of this.
You can get out of this, son.
You've just got to set your mind to it.
Besides, I‚Äôm hearing my dad's voice in my head.
Actually, I‚Äôm down here, son.
Hold on, Dad, I'll be right down!
That was too easy.
What was that noise, son?
- You know how I always wanted a dog?
- Yeah?
I just got one.
Wait. Maybe he wants to play fetch.
- Nice mechanical doggy.
- Good dog. Want to play?
Good boy. Fetch! lt looks to be a deadly mission requiring strength... cunning and nerves of steel.
So good luck, Bugsy,
I'll keep the engine running.
You tricked me!
What's up, Darth?
Now I must incapacitate you with my bubble gun.
Ain't that cute?
Of course you realize this means war.
You go that way. I‚Äôm gonna go this way.
Bad dog! Sit!
I don't want to put you under any added pressure... but judging by the vibrations of these train tracks, I've got about... one minute and forty- two seconds left.
Down! Put him down.
What am I gonna do?
What would Damian Drake do?
What would Duck Dodgers do?
Wait a minute. I am Duck Dodgers!
Yes, I‚Äôm going to be the hero of this picture!
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!
Duck....
It's you- know- who to the rescue! lt helps if you don't say the name.
Bad dog!
Disgusting Earth rodent.
Now to neutralize that duck.
This can't be good.
Now the diamond will bathe the Earth in a monkey- transforming glow.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
six, five, four...
three, two, one.
Thwarting evil makes me so angry.
That takes care of that.
Thanks, Daff.
Darn dark side!
Are you all monkeys yet?
Checkmate, Mr. Chairman.
You're going down.
Come on, say it.
Just a little ''You're my hero''?
- Nope, sorry.
- Bugs, say it, come on.
- Not interested.
- No one will ever know.
I‚Äôm really proud of you, D.J.
I knew I could count on you.
Yes.
Dad, I think we should move.
- What was wrong with Beverly Hills?
- I meant from this spot.
- I think we scratched it.
- Don't worry, it's a rental.
You guys, you pulled it off!
- You pulled it off, all right.
- Give me that.
Way to go, Daffy.
You didn't do so bad yourself, stunt boy.
To set the record straight... all credit for saving the human race goes to Daffy.
Exactly.
Oh, no, you don't, buster. You're the hero.
Wait a minute. Pronoun trouble.
I‚Äôm the hero.
I‚Äôm the hero, all right.
Are you gonna introduce us, D.J.?
- Dad, this is Kate. Kate, this is- -
- Damian Drake.
I‚Äôm a really big fan...of your son.
Daff, you achieved your goal of being a hero.
Yep, but you didn't achieve your goal... of getting me back in your stupid movie.
- Cut. Great, that's a wrap.
- That's it, guys.
Remind me to get a new agent, will you?
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Maybe we are a team.
Bugs and Daffy. No, Daffy and Bugs.
What do you think?
Excuse me, do you remember me?
I threatened your manliness, and you got me fired?
I know you.
Do I know him?
You must be someone that I got fired.
See, I get a lot of people fired.
- You be good now.
- So like I said....
Not again. He's down again. Are you okay?
- Come on.
- He said he can do stunts.
Bugs is here. Gotta go.
Daffy, you're right.
- The usual place, Mr. Bunny?
- Very good.
From now on, you and I are going to be equal partners in this thing.
No more second banana for you.
Thanks, pal. I really appreciate this.
At last my star is rising.
All my hopes and aspirations....
What do you know?
My luck is changing already.
Go home, folks.

Why not call it the Big Chill or the Nippy era?
I'm just sayin', how do we know it's an Ice age?
Because of all the ice.
Well, things just got a little chillier.
Help. Help.
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.
But, but, but, Dad.
No buts. You can play extinction later.
OK. Come on, guys.
So, where's Eddie?
He said he was on the verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.
Really?
I'm flying.
Some breakthrough.
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.
Crazy mammoth.
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.
It'll be quieter when you're gone.
Come on. If he wants to freeze to death, let him.
I'm up. I'm up.
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?
Where is everybody? Come on, guys, we're gonna miss the migration.
They left without me.
They do this every year.
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?
Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?
All right, I'll just go by myself.
Sick.
Wide body, kerb it next time.
Oh, jeez. Yuck.
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?
What a mess. You rhinos have tiny brains. Did you know that?
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.
Yummo.
A dandelion. Must be the last one of the season.
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.
He ruined our salad.
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...
No, no, seriously, let me take care of this. What is this?
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.
Delicious. That's good eating.
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.
Tasty, isn't it? Bon app√™tit.
Now?
Now.
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.
We'll just take our furry pi√±ata and go.
If it's not them today, it's someone else tomorrow.
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?
We'll break your neck so you don't feel a thing.
Wait a minute. I thought rhinos were vegetarians.
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.
Who says we're gonna eat him after we kill him?
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.
OK, if either of you make it across that sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.
Get him.
A dandelion?
We did it.
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?
Great. Jump on my back and relax the whole way.
- Wow, really?
- No.
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?
Isn't this great? You and me, two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish.
You're a very shrewd mammal.
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...
Stop following me.
OK, so you've got issues. You won't even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.
Especially since his daddy wiped out half our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.
An eye for an eye, don't you think?
Let's show him what happens when he messes with sabres.
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.
Phew. I'm wiped out.
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.
But with my little stick and my highly evolved brain, I shall create fire.
Fascinating.
We'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?
Think I saw a spark.
Any chance I could squeeze in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.
You should see what they did last year.
They woke up early and tied my hands and feet and they gagged me with a field mouse, covered their tracks, went through water so I'd lose their scent, and... who needs 'em, anyway?
So what about you? You have family?
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.
Manny.
There's Diego. Fall back.
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.
You lost it?
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.
You'd better, unless you want to serve as a replacement.
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.
It had better be alive.
Can we trust you with that, Diego?
Let's go.
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance, at least pick a female with the same colour pelt. "
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go praying mantis on me. "
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.
There's plenty of Sid to go around.
Manny?
Manny?
Look at that. He's OK.
She's gone.
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.
But you can't leave him here.
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".
There never was a "we". In fact, without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.
I'll return you. We don't need that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?
No, we don't.
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm gonna die.
Manny.
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.
There is no "us".
I see. Can't have one of your own, so you want to adopt.
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt your snack, but we gotta go.
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.
You were thinkin' it.
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.
I'll help you bring it to its herd, but leave me alone after that.
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't spear me.
- This is a problem.
- Now what?
That's perfect.
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.
Don't you have some poor animal to disembowel?
They couldn't be far. I mean, they went this way, or this way?
You don't know much about tracking, do you?
I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf. That's my tracking.
You didn't miss them by much.
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.
You don't need this aggravation.
Give me the baby. I can track humans down a lot faster than you.
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.
Unless you know how to track, you'll never reach them before snow closes the pass.
Which should be, like, tomorrow.
So, you can give that baby to me, or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?
No. The sooner we find the humans, the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face, and the baby, too.
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.
√úber-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.
Help me.
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?
So if he poops, where does it go?
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea, you're small and insignificant, and I'll pummel you if you don't.
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.
I'm gonna slip.
It's clean. Got ya!
Will you cut it out?
Do that again. He likes it.
It's makin' me feel better too.
Here, you hold it.
Turn him towards me.
Where is the baby?
There he is.
Where is the baby?
There he is.
Stop it. You're scarin' him.
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.
Enough, enough, enough.
Food.
I don't know, but I've been told
I don't know, but I've been told
End of the world be mighty cold
Prepare for the Ice age!
Protect the dodo way of life!
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!
Protect the dodo way of life!
Prepare for the Ice age!
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...
.. burn and die.
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...
No way. This is our private stockpile for the Ice age.
Sub arctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years.
So you got three melons?
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you.
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.
Oh, no. No.
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...
There goes our last female.
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.
The last melon.
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.
Now to find a meal befitting a conquering hero.
What ho? A foe? Come on, come on. You want a piece of me?
Spoils worthy of such a noble...
Bedtime, squirt.
The triumphant return.
Huh? Oh, that.
I'm so full. How about a good-night kiss for your big buddy, Sid?
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.
All right, good night.
Will you stop it?
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.
Oy.
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?
Tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby, or don't come back at all. "
I have a message for Soto.
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.
And tell him I'm bringing... a mammoth.
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.
This one does, and I'm leading him to Half Peak.
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack to bring this mammoth down.
Get everyone ready.
Now.
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?
Sid.
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.
Sabres were closing in on him.
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.
Yeah, well, he needed me, and I only wish I had one of my own, too.
Really? I find that attractive in a male.
Alas. Who wouldn't want a family, I always say.
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...
Hey. Hi, Manny.
What's the matter with you?
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep marinating and I'll be right back.
Sexy.
He's not much to look at, but it's so hard to find a family guy.
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.
Manny, I need him.
So, ladies, where were we?
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves like a cheetah. And that tiger...
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?
Look at you. You're gonna grow into a great predator.
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.
No fangs, no claws.
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?
Does this look like a petting zoo to you? Huh?
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.
You think that's funny? How about this?
You'll be a little snack for the owls.
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.
Help. Help.
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.
Help.
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.
Over here.
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.
Wait a minute.
He's dead all right.
Carnivores have all the fun.
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts like that. But you know how it is.
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.
Manny. Manny.
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...
I thought you were gonna... Were you?
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on, come on. Can you wait a second, please?
Fellas.
Thanks for waiting.
Three, two, one...
Sure is faithful.
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.
Modern architecture. It'll never last.
Hiya, Manny.
Hi, Diego.
Hey, Sid.
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.
Ask him directions.
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.
Let me try. Pack.
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.
Pack of wolves? Pack of...
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.
Pack of flying fish.
Great news. I found a short cut.
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.
I know what a short cut is.
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass or we take the long way and miss 'em.
Through there? What do you take me for?
This time tomorrow, you could be a free mammoth.
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo.
Guys. Guys. Check this out.
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.
No, thanks. I choose life.
Then I suggest you take the short cut.
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!
Way to go, tiger.
Quick. Get inside.
OK, I vote short cut.
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.
Guys?
A fish.
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.
I gotcha.
Captain, iceberg ahead.
Oh, no.
Yeah. Who's up for round two?
Tell the kid to be more careful.
Look, look. Tigers.
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers are just playing tag with the antelope.
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.
You're it.
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloth‚Äôs?
You never see any sloth‚Äôs.
Have you ever noticed?
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.
And he's got a family.
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.
- Sid...
- Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths...
- Sid.
- What?
- Shut up.
- But...
Would you look at that.
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.
Next stop, Glacier Pass.
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?
You're almost home.
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.
Seriously. My feet are really hot.
Tell me that was your stomach.
I'm sure it was just thunder.
From underground?
Come on, keep up with me.
I would if you were moving.
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?
Hold Pinky.
Manny.
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.
What? What? I can't hear you.
You're standing on my trunk.
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?
You could have died, trying to save me.
That's what you do in a herd.
You look out for each other.
Well, thanks.
I don't know about you guys, but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.
I can't wait to get my claws in that mammoth.
No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby.
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.
Mammoths don't go down easy.
There's only one way to do it.
First, you have to force it into a corner.
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,
I'll go for the throat.
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.
- How much further?
- Three miles.
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloth‚Äôs on the map.
Why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down?
And make him rounder.
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.
I'm a genius.
From now on you'll have to refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.
Lovebirds.
Look at this.
I don't believe it.
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.
Come to Uncle Sid.
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.
No, no, no. No, go to him.
Go to him.
OK.
Good job. Keep practisin'.
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.
Look at that big pushover.
You know, Diego, I've never had a friend who would risk his life for me.
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.
Yeah, he is.
Well, good night.
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.
Diego, what do you think?
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?
Maybe because we save him, he won't hunt us.
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and a long skinny neck and call you Mama.
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.
Diego. You frozen back there?
- Get down.
- What?
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?
At the bottom of Half Peak, there's an ambush waiting for you.
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?
- You set us up.
- It was my job.
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.
No, you're not. Not yet.
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.
Trust you? Why in the world would we trust you?
Because I'm your only chance.
Hello, ladies.
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.
No need to worry. In about two minutes you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.
Very nice.
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.
Don't give away your positions until you see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.
You want to maul something, don't you?
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?
No, I said wait for the mammoth.
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!
Loop-de-loop.
Slalom! Slalom, baby!
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.
Get him.
Surprise!
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid and get outta here while we can.
Come on, Diego, let's bring this mammoth down.
There he is.
That's right. Where's the baby?
Survival of the fittest.
I don't think so. Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.
Fine. I'll take you down first.
We did it.
We were some team, huh?
Were? Come on, we're still a team.
I'm sorry I set you up.
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.
Knock it off, squirt.
You gotta be strong.
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.
Especially Sid.
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?
Come on, Diego, come on.
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.
Listen, you have to leave me here.
If those humans get through the pass, you'll never catch them.
You didn't have to do that.
That's what you do in a herd.
Don't forget about us.
OK?
We won't forget about you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Sid...
- Bye.
Bye.
That's right. Where's the baby?
Come on, Sid, let's head south.
Bye.
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.
Diego? You're OK.
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.
You're OK.
I could kiss ya.
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?
No thanks. I gotta save whatever dignity I've got left.
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.
This is gonna be the best migration ever.
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

{1038}{1088}Christmas is right around the corner...
{1093}{1144}...and Chanukah starts tonight.
{1149}{1184}Ain't a better time of year.
{1189}{1300}You got no school, you can eat|like a pig and people give you stuff.
{1305}{1369}Just makes you feel tingly all over.
{1395}{1420}But you know what?
{1425}{1517}There are some buffoons out there who|actually can't stand the holiday season.
{1523}{1579}And seeing other people|enjoy the festivities...
{1583}{1621}...gets them even more disgusted.
{1654}{1705}In fact, the head honcho of holiday|humbug...
{1710}{1799}...lives right here in little old Dukesberry.|His name's Davey Stone.
{1804}{1859}That fool's in the China Dragon...
{1863}{1948}...coming up with his own way|of feeling tingly all over.
{1999}{2097}Four scorpion bowl in five minute?|That's got to be a restaurant record.
{2107}{2223}Well, right now I'm going to go for|another restaurant record: longest burp.
{2486}{2605}Congratulations. Now, please excuse me|while I go take shower.
{2619}{2697}At one time, Davey was a super student,|super athlete...
{2703}{2793}...super sweet, super kid and the apple|of his parents' eye.
{2844}{2937}Now, he's just a 33-year-old,|crazy Jewish guy...
{2942}{3025}...who lives for making this town|as miserable as he is...
{3030}{3087}...especially on the first night|of Chanukah.
{3092}{3159}How'd he end up this way?|Let's save that for later...
{3163}{3277}...because right now, Davey's about to|get himself into some serious trouble.
{3381}{3452}Hope you're not planning on driving|tonight, Stone.
{3457}{3547}No, officer. I'm just going to say|good night to my car...
{3551}{3644}...then walk home and enjoy|the holiday decorations.
{3650}{3743}Listen, sweetheart. I have to leave you|here alone tonight...
{3747}{3840}...but don't you worry, I'll be back|first thing in the morning.
{3845}{3940}Now, behave yourself,|and don't stay up too late.
{3957}{4003}Nighty-night.
{4059}{4123}All right, baby. But let's make this quick.
{4139}{4171}Oh, mama!
{4176}{4229}You like it when I hold you like this?
{4234}{4307}Because I'll do it all night long.
{4333}{4392}So sweet.
{4419}{4480}Yes, so precious.
{4520}{4575}I love you, car.
{4579}{4688}He dine and dash me! He chew and|screw me! He sip and skip me!
{4693}{4763}-What?|-He no pay for his four scorpion bowl.
{4767}{4797}Oh, boy.
{4843}{4871}Get him.
{4997}{5039}Come back here, you jerk!
{5105}{5143}Somebody stop that guy!
{5153}{5224}I'm the kind of guy who can't stand|A holiday
{5229}{5324}So I drink them all away, that's me
{5329}{5408}I don't decorate no trees
{5413}{5496}And I won't eat no potato latkes
{5501}{5611}But I'll give this old lady's melons|A squeeze
{5615}{5680}That's just who I am
{5824}{5900}Well, I'll never spin a dreidel,|But I'll always throw an egg
{5905}{6003}And I'll charley horse your leg for laughs
{6018}{6092}While you're singing your holiday tunes
{6097}{6183}I'm acting like the town buffoon
{6187}{6280}Whipping out my big, white, scary moon
{6285}{6367}And blowing a beef your way
{6371}{6455}I hate folks who think reindeer are cute
{6460}{6533}To me they're just something to shoot
{6549}{6588}I hate love
{6593}{6635}I hate you
{6640}{6685}I hate me
{6731}{6776}Well, I'm a snowmobile-stealing
{6781}{6897}No 'tis-the-season-feeling kind of guy
{6917}{7004}This time of year sucks|So I take my nunchaks
{7009}{7104}And make sure every snowman dies
{7109}{7188}Believing in Santa's all wrong
{7202}{7283}And Chanukah's eight nights too long
{7291}{7319}I hate love
{7323}{7361}I hate you
{7367}{7411}I hate me
{7418}{7443}Coming through.
{7448}{7475}I hate love
{7479}{7519}I hate you
{7523}{7551}I hate me
{7556}{7629}Davey Stone, you're nothing|but a delinquent!
{7657}{7721}Stone, what the heck are we|going to do with you?
{7726}{7835}I've sent you to reform school, the drunk|tank, the local psychiatric ward.
{7839}{7924}Not one of those places has made you|change an ounce for the better.
{7929}{7968}You used to be a good kid...
{7973}{8091}...playing ball for the Jewish Community|Center, with the best shot ever seen.
{8096}{8187}Your Honor, I still got a pretty good|jump shot. Let me show you.
{8258}{8328}I'd hit a 3-pointer, but I'd|have to drop my pants...
{8333}{8383}...and pop a thumb up my boo-boo.
{8388}{8496}You leave me no choice. I'll really|have to crack down hard this time.
{8501}{8624}Your Honor, if it pleases the court,|I'd like to interject for a moment.
{8629}{8729}What the hell was that? Did anybody|hear a parakeet, or am I going crazy?
{8734}{8816}No, Mr. Chang. It's me, Whitey Duvall.
{8822}{8893}And a happy first night of Chanukah|to you.
{8898}{8935}I'm not Jewish.
{8940}{9046}Neither am I, but that don't stop me|from enjoying a holiday.
{9056}{9131}Whitey, we went over this|two months ago.
{9136}{9215}It's your last year of reffing|the youth league basketball.
{9220}{9256}You're turning 70 years old...
{9261}{9344}...and our insurance company says|they won't cover you anymore.
{9348}{9373}No, no, no.
{9378}{9493}My interjection pertains to the case|currently under adjudication.
{9498}{9559}You see, I knew this young man|years ago...
{9563}{9631}...when his moral fiber was still intact.
{9636}{9672}What are you getting at?
{9677}{9785}Why not sentence him to be a|referee-in-training for youth basketball?
{9791}{9880}I've seen some pretty rowdy kids|turn into perfect gentlemen...
{9885}{9943}...after spending time on my court.
{9948}{10009}If that happened with Stone,|it would be a miracle.
{10014}{10125}It's the holidays. Things like that have|been known to happen this time of year.
{10160}{10243}Whitey, if you want to work with|this punk, then God bless you.
{10248}{10319}But Mr. Stone, what Whitey says goes.
{10324}{10369}And if I hear that you break one law...
{10373}{10482}...l'll send you to the state|penitentiary for no less than 10 years.
{10514}{10555}Happy holidays.
{10598}{10627}Oh, God.
{10632}{10695}The short man who's kind|and the donkey's behind.
{10699}{10797}What a bizarre matchup.|Good luck, Whitey. You'll need it.
{10818}{10899}Okay, let's give the little guy|some support.
{10963}{11048}Did I just see two Persian cats|on your ass?
{11053}{11157}I think I'm going to barf.
{11185}{11254}Your horn works, try the lights.
{11315}{11355}Okay.
{11361}{11437}One. Two.
{11442}{11493}Good to see you still got circus feet.
{11498}{11597}Men's 11 right foot, children's|9 left foot...
{11602}{11635}...at your service.
{11647}{11672}Yuck.
{11683}{11767}Now, I assume you've done|your pre-game stretching.
{11772}{11812}No, let me do it right now.
{11817}{11873}One. Two. Three.
{11878}{11927}Four. Five. Six.
{11931}{12001}Okay. That's good, but don't forget|your hammies.
{12005}{12083}Of course Whitey wouldn't understand|what getting flipped off means.
{12087}{12159}He's so behind the times,|he thinks Viagra's a big waterfall.
{12194}{12231}But there is one thing he knows.
{12235}{12318}The voting has begun for the highest|honor anyone in town could receive.
{12372}{12438}I think it's gonna be your year, Whitey.|I really do.
{12473}{12592}Whoa. Don't even think of coming|on this floor with those hard soles, pally.
{12597}{12644}Fine, I'll just ref in my socks.
{12739}{12787}Must be game time.
{12819}{12891}Don't let him push your buttons, Whitey.
{13449}{13479}What are you waiting for?
{13483}{13531}-Come on. Dribble!|-Hurry up!
{13651}{13717}What, no whistle on that one, ref?
{13723}{13753}Okay.
{13775}{13863}Foul on this kid for eating|everything in sight.
{13871}{13975}Jelly jugs, next time you come on|my court, you better wear a bra. Okay?
{14018}{14119}He was just kidding, son.|You've got very nice boobs.
{14136}{14161}-Jerk!|-Idiot!
{14166}{14259}You don't like that? How about you|throw something at me. I dare you.
{14263}{14308}With pleasure!
{14319}{14431}They're scratching up my floor.|Here comes a seizure.
{14467}{14548}This will pass in a second, kids.
{14553}{14588}Don't be scared.
{14593}{14629}Is he break dancing?
{14679}{14771}Okay, that's it. Game over.|Nobody wants to see an old man die.
{14776}{14851}Fatty's team loses because|I want to see him cry again.
{14919}{15009}I want to talk to you in my office.
{15057}{15101}Why the hell are we at the mall?
{15106}{15156}You need to clean your brain out.
{15161}{15241}And to me, the mall is the best place|to do that.
{15246}{15283}What's good about this place?
{15288}{15383}What's good about it? Everything.|You want a pair of socks?
{15387}{15464}My buddy, Mr. Foot Locker,|will warm your feet.
{15469}{15509}You need a fancy doodad?
{15514}{15640}Hello, Sharper lmage. Thanks for the|combination pogo stick"l"clock radio.
{15645}{15707}I mean, The Body Shop, the Tie Rack...
{15711}{15755}...GNC, RadioShack...
{15760}{15867}...Petland for a cat or two,|Spencer's Gifts for some fake dog doo...
{15872}{15937}...Sbarro's, Dunkin' Donuts,|they're simply the best.
{15942}{16013}And don't forget the orange|chicken at Panda Express.
{16018}{16076}But if you're short of cash|like little old me...
{16081}{16147}...the window shopping's always free.
{16163}{16269}Did you prepare that or did you rhyme|that many times in a row by accident?
{16285}{16338}Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?
{16343}{16379}Maybe you are a leprechaun.
{16383}{16449}Let's just get some snacks and chat.|Okay?
{16495}{16537}Aren't you a boy?
{16623}{16675}Now, I'd like to make this work out.
{16680}{16755}But in order to do so, you're|going to have to learn...
{16759}{16872}...that youth basketball ain't about you|and your lack of respect for others.
{16877}{17003}It's about the kids and teaching them|responsibility and teamwork.
{17007}{17083}I've been doing my part for 35 years.
{17088}{17159}Are you ready to join me, big guy?
{17300}{17405}Joke's on you, tough guy. I can't read.
{17410}{17499}Special delivery for Whitey Duvall,|sugar-free doughnuts.
{17504}{17593}Every day she does this for me.|Jennifer, you're too much.
{17598}{17667}My fraternal twin sister's a diabetic...
{17672}{17781}...and out of respect for her and her|disease, I don't eat sugar products.
{17787}{17851}There's a surprise in there you'll like.
{17855}{17945}Don't tell me it's Bavarian cream-filled.
{17967}{18016}It is Bavarian cream-filled!
{18021}{18052}Hubba-bubba!
{18057}{18185}These babies make my taste buds|do double daffies, for gosh sakes.
{18193}{18240}Why are you hiding over there?
{18245}{18295}It's okay, sweetheart. Talk to Whitey.
{18299}{18368}Hi, Whitey. I got another Chanukah|present tonight.
{18373}{18467}Wow, Benjamin, an Etch A Sketch.|Not too shabby.
{18472}{18513}That's a Game Boy, you idiot.
{18518}{18587}Sorry, I'm not up|on modern technology.
{18592}{18699}But I guess my friend Davey is.|Why don't you tell him what else you got.
{18703}{18763}First night, I got a basketball|and some dreidels.
{18768}{18835}Night two, I got a pup tent for camping|in the backyard.
{18840}{18881}And tonight, I got this.
{18886}{19004}Wow. Maybe on night four the Chanukah|monster will take a big crap on your bed.
{19035}{19091}Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit,|psycho.
{19096}{19157}Come and help me|clean the muffin trays.
{19162}{19230}-Bye, Whitey.|-See you at the game tomorrow.
{19262}{19355}Your girlfriend's backyard|isn't sugar-free. That baby looks sweet.
{19360}{19423}Technical foul! Technical foul!
{19427}{19505}That's a lady, and you will not|speak about her that way!
{19510}{19535}Easy.
{19539}{19599}She's going through a tough time now.
{19604}{19695}Last spring, her husband of 13 years|ups and leaves her...
{19699}{19763}...for a woman he met on the computer.
{19767}{19895}She had the courage to move back a|month ago to try and raise her boy alone.
{19901}{19936}So she's available?
{19942}{20033}You wish, mac. You blew your shot|with her 20 years ago.
{20038}{20069}Twenty years?
{20074}{20117}Was that Jennifer Friedman?
{20123}{20209}I'm surprised you have enough|brain cells left to remember.
{20264}{20363}Hey, Jennifer, you still coming over to|watch "Dukes of Hazzard" after the game?
{20367}{20400}That's a big 10-4, Davey.
{20404}{20429}Hey, Davey.
{20434}{20491}Smile! Your mom wants to take a picture.
{20518}{20545}Thanks, honey.
{20551}{20617}If my parents fall asleep early,|I'll show you my basement.
{20623}{20658}Keep dreaming.
{20688}{20773}They make a nice couple|boogie-oogie-oogies.
{20806}{20863}I don't know when you were goofier,|then or now.
{20868}{20972}Good evening, Mayor Stuey Duhy.|Out for some late-night shopping?
{20977}{21075}Yeah. Then I have to figure out how to|rebuild our giant menorah and Santa.
{21079}{21137}Thanks for ruining the ice pageant again,|Stone.
{21142}{21201}I didn't do it for you.|I did it for the ladies.
{21206}{21231}Yeah, right.
{21259}{21383}Has there been talk about who the lucky|patch recipient may be this year or...?
{21387}{21477}That's up to who the town votes for.|Could be you or me or anybody.
{21483}{21540}All right, I'm going to get going now.
{21545}{21597}Happy holidays, your excellence.
{21602}{21687}Good night, mayor! And the answer|to your question is Spencer's Gifts.
{21692}{21776}They definitely have furry underwear.
{21799}{21851}You're gross.
{21879}{21965}Is it just me, or did you notice|when he said, "It could be you"...
{21971}{22040}...there was a certain sincerity|in his voice, or...?
{22045}{22108}You actually give a crap|about winning a patch?
{22113}{22229}It's only the most prestigious award|given out at the all-star banquet.
{22234}{22280}Can you imagine?
{22290}{22375}Won't you dance with me
{22379}{22468}At the annual all-star banquet?
{22487}{22579}We'll be so fancy-free
{22583}{22681}At the annual all-star banquet
{22695}{22792}Everyone in town will be looking|Their best
{22797}{22883}Even Mrs. Selman with her one|Extra breast
{22888}{22983}It's the kind of a night when your|Feet match
{22987}{23099}When you feel nearly 5-foot-3!
{23105}{23200}They'll laugh and they'll dance|And they'll pee in their pants
{23206}{23328}'Cause there's a patch at the|All-star banquet waiting for me
{23345}{23399}Can you take me home now?
{23482}{23567}Well, that was nice of Davey to snap|Whitey out of his little dream.
{23572}{23663}All that song was saying was|the patch means the world to Whitey.
{23667}{23725}He'd rather be remembered|for his hard work...
{23730}{23809}...not for the fact that he had the|hairiest buns in the locker room.
{23814}{23847}Can you blame him?
{23947}{24001}How's that peanut brittle?
{24007}{24071}Crunchy and delicious.
{24111}{24233}Funny, I don't remember Denise|or Janice ringing up a purchase for you.
{24238}{24295}I guess that means I stole it.
{24398}{24451}Easy, seizure-boy!
{24462}{24521}That's it. I'm calling the judge.
{24527}{24623}Go ahead. I'll be on the first bus out.|I ain't spending 10 years in prison.
{24627}{24672}Maybe I'll just take you in myself.
{24677}{24759}Don't think you can intimidate me|just because of my size.
{24763}{24843}Why? You're smaller than me?|I didn't notice that.
{24855}{24911}Put me down! Put me down!
{24916}{24967}And get out of my car right now!
{24972}{25093}Oh, no. You're going to make me walk|10 feet? That's where I live, idiot!
{25128}{25165}Thanks for the ride, patchy.
{25170}{25224}It was great patching with you.
{25229}{25288}And I guess I'll patch you later.
{25359}{25405}I'm letting this one go, Stone.
{25411}{25501}But next screwup, it's slammer time.
{25773}{25848}Got any sand or rock salt in there?
{25853}{25897}I need to get some traction.
{25903}{26001}"Got any sand or rock salt in there?|'Cause I need to get some--"
{26007}{26059}Oh, shut up!
{26089}{26169}He could've at least given me a push|or something.
{26604}{26698}--closing, channel 36 would|like to wish all of its Jewish viewers...
{26703}{26761}...the very happiest of Chanukahs.
{26766}{26812}Boo!
{27347}{27372}Hey!
{27411}{27443}A little help, fellas?
{27667}{27753}One. Two. Three!
{27768}{27828}Have a holly, jolly one, guys.
{27832}{27872}Doesn't it make you feel good...
{27878}{27956}...when you see a group of deer|helping a motorist in need?
{27960}{28016}But I bet Whitey wishes they showed up|earlier...
{28021}{28098}...because his sister, Eleanore,|gets a little edgy when he's late.
{28102}{28146}Whitey, where were you?
{28150}{28263}You're an hour and 51 minutes late.|I already called the morgue.
{28268}{28348}They said you weren't there,|but to try back later.
{28357}{28427}I had an interesting talk|with the mayor tonight.
{28432}{28560}The mayor? Was it about the ruffians|who stole my Liz Taylor wig?
{28581}{28629}Eleanore, that was 45 years ago.
{28635}{28691}I'm still shaking from it.
{28700}{28775}Anyways, the mayor seems to think|there's a chance...
{28780}{28833}...I might receive the patch this year.
{28839}{28929}Oh, boy. Let's just soak our feet, brother.
{28940}{29015}First position. Second position.
{29086}{29127}See you later, smell.
{29132}{29211}Just don't get your hopes up too high|about the patch.
{29216}{29296}I can handle myself,|Eleanore. Trust me.
{29826}{29919}When you have enough lights to make|your house look like the Vegas Strip...
{29923}{29981}...you'll have a big electric bill.
{29985}{30042}And being a volunteer referee|for the youth basketball league...
{30046}{30129}...doesn't exactly get you|"in the" Fortune "500."
{30142}{30248}So old Whitey's up early every day,|searching the town for odd jobs...
{30254}{30320}...to help make ends meet|for him and Eleanore.
{30342}{30379}How's that, fellas?!
{30384}{30443}It's crooked, shorty. Move it to the right.
{30447}{30472}You got it.
{30496}{30522}Whoops.
{30717}{30813}Well, will you look at that.|It's a jackass-in-the-box.
{30862}{30912}Let's go get some coffee.
{30917}{30991}Anything else I can do for you guys?
{30996}{31071}If you clean out the crappers,|I'll give you a buck.
{31095}{31155}Consider it done.|Nice doing business with you.
{31622}{31684}That's what happens|when you hit the bottle.
{31689}{31784}You go to sleep in Dukesberry,|you wake up in Pukesberry.
{31790}{31821}Pukesberry.
{31826}{31876}Hey. What are you do--? No!
{32181}{32301}The worst has happened.|I'm covered in human feces.
{32315}{32430}That's a good look for you. But for|health reasons, I should spray you off.
{32593}{32647}Smell you later, poopsicle.
{32722}{32784}You're a fricking degenerate.
{32789}{32828}I know I am.
{33148}{33194}A little help, please.
{33450}{33496}Your tongues tickle.
{33502}{33541}They tickle.
{33576}{33631}You are right. That was gross.
{33653}{33726}Thumbelina, there's no kids playing.|Why'd you tell me to come?
{33730}{33841}I thought you could use a refresher|course on b-ball rules and regulations.
{33846}{33945}-You're nuts. I'm going to pound a few.|-First of all, you booze, you lose.
{33951}{34011}And secondly, if you don't turn around...
{34016}{34144}...Officer Sherman over there'll know of|the infamous peanut brittle incident.
{34168}{34209}What's with the dunkin' munchkin?
{34214}{34321}His mom had to do a double shift so I'm|watching him till she can get here.
{34327}{34421}Now, both of you cop a squat|next to me and let's observe.
{34494}{34529}Take it! Take it!
{34559}{34593}Charging! Our ball.
{34597}{34674}See, that wasn't a charge.|It was actually blocking.
{34679}{34765}The defender didn't have both feet|planted in time.
{34769}{34843}Oh, really? Because I thought|that was high-sticking.
{34859}{34979}Don't encourage him, Benjamin. He's|upset because he can't play no more.
{34985}{35091}Twenty years of drinking destroyed|the basketball lobe of his brain.
{35097}{35179}I can whup any of those clowns|out there even with you as my partner.
{35184}{35221}I'd like to see that.
{35227}{35265}I'd like to see that right now.
{35271}{35349}He was just kidding, fellas.|Whole lot of jibber jabber.
{35353}{35417}We got no beef with you guys.
{35422}{35533}Because if a midget and a drunk|can beat us, I'd eat my own jockstrap.
{35537}{35593}No, he don't play ball anymore.
{35597}{35689}I'll play. But if we win, you got|to eat that guy's jockstrap.
{35783}{35842}First to five wins. We're shirts.
{35855}{35943}Oh, boy. Does that mean we're skins?
{36012}{36058}I don't see any skin, monkey-man.
{36077}{36109}Just pass me the ball.
{36114}{36153}All right, Fuzzy Wuzzy.
{36159}{36261}All right, simmer down, Whitey.|Don't travel. Don't double dribble.
{36265}{36328}I want a good, clean game|and no back talk.
{36333}{36389}Orangutan, you're playing, not reffing.
{36399}{36493}He's right. Look for your opening|and take it.
{36528}{36553}There it is!
{36645}{36701}Now set yourself and shoot.
{36789}{36823}Oh, no.
{36861}{36919}Are you finally dead, old man?
{36961}{37053}I'll be over to feed the cats|in the morning...
{37059}{37116}...Mrs. Addison.
{37146}{37194}Okay, he's useless.
{37285}{37320}One more thing.
{37370}{37434}Good kitty. Nice kitty.
{37451}{37497}Muffin boy, what's your real name?
{37501}{37525}Benjamin.
{37531}{37569}You're in. Let's go.
{37581}{37640}You're trading in the midget for a spaz?
{37652}{37693}This is going to be even sadder.
{37744}{37791}We'll see. Your ball.
{37795}{37821}Oops.
{37825}{37853}I'm not very good.
{37858}{37952}That's all right. Just try to stay|confident, and if I say shoot it, shoot it.
{38007}{38048}Game on.
{38065}{38121}He may be big, but he's ugly, Benny.
{38131}{38157}Good luck, chump.
{38177}{38224}-I'll take that.|-Hey!
{38282}{38313}Put it up.
{38353}{38393}Coming through!
{38398}{38493}That's all right, just keep your|elbow in. Now stick it, kid.
{38529}{38557}Yeah!
{38562}{38643}Looks like you better start|showing the spaz some respect.
{38649}{38689}Just keep playing.
{38829}{38953}Where am I going, baby?|Where am I going? Oh, snap. Oh, snap.
{38958}{39001}-Trap him.|-I'm on it.
{39040}{39078}It's all you, buddy.
{39087}{39161}I hope you all like your|jockstraps extra sweaty.
{39166}{39222}One. Two.
{39242}{39270}Three.
{39297}{39349}-You wanna win this or not?|-Yeah.
{39355}{39401}Well, then cover the nerd.
{39417}{39461}The saga continues.
{39630}{39683}Not this time, little man.
{39704}{39761}Hey, look what I still got.
{39807}{39854}Yeah, good coverage.
{39884}{39916}What a shot.
{39920}{40012}I call that the|top-of-the-key-eat-the-jockstrap shot.
{40210}{40256}Hold it now. Hold it now.
{40286}{40338}Where's it going now?
{40354}{40396}How's he doing that?
{40408}{40448}Oh, boy.
{40463}{40494}Put it up, Ben.
{40533}{40557}Got a piece!
{40562}{40617}Bam! Got a piece of my ass.
{40641}{40669}Shut up!
{40674}{40741}One more basket and it's chow time,|boys.
{40949}{40989}Let's bring it home.
{41013}{41056}You're my boy, Benny.
{41245}{41289}Whoa, little lverson.
{41351}{41407}-Double up on Stone!|-You got it!
{41417}{41448}Put it up, Benny.
{41453}{41480}What's happening?
{41502}{41560}-No!|-Oh, Benny!
{41565}{41600}You gotta be kidding me!
{41604}{41628}Yeah!
{41651}{41703}Now say what I told you to say.
{41710}{41787}Eat that nut-strap, bitch!
{41799}{41826}Benjamin!
{41901}{41977}Don't ever use that kind of language|again. Do you hear me?
{41982}{42013}I'm sorry.
{42018}{42057}He's just having some fun.
{42065}{42177}Cursing and acting like a jerk may be|your idea of fun, but it won't be his.
{42183}{42241}One Davey Stone|around here is enough.
{42315}{42375}My finger's in your mouth, kitty...
{42381}{42457}...but I don't feel no teeth.
{42463}{42501}Let's go, Benjamin.
{42577}{42639}Why are you eating that?
{42702}{42771}You know, my mother doesn't|like you very much.
{42777}{42851}You know, I don't like me|very much either.
{42892}{42933}Nice playing with you, mini-Shaq.
{43140}{43188}Why was she looking at me like that?
{43201}{43252}How could they let that guy|work with kids?
{43257}{43308}Giving me those nasty eyes.
{43323}{43360}I was being nice to her kid.
{43369}{43421}They should have locked|him up for good.
{43427}{43494}At least she was looking at me.|That felt all right.
{43507}{43557}Why can't he just be like he used to be?
{43631}{43705}It all seems so long ago
{43710}{43785}Young and happy don't you know
{43790}{43872}Down by the creek I would show
{43878}{43949}Fireflies to that girl
{43953}{44035}But that was back when he was nice
{44041}{44121}Before my warm heart turned to ice
{44125}{44208}My sister's wig once had lice
{44213}{44291}But that was long ago
{44297}{44383}The schoolyard's where we were
{44388}{44448}The first time I kissed her
{44454}{44517}He thought he got some tongue
{44522}{44601}But it was only retainer
{44607}{44670}Eleanore's bra is a trainer
{44678}{44753}Well, over there's my family home
{44769}{44840}And the woods we used to roam
{44846}{44927}The only time I had|sex was on the phone
{44932}{44968}But that was long ago
{45003}{45040}I carved our names upon that tree
{45082}{45156}I loved him and he loved me
{45161}{45246}My darling wife was once a he
{45251}{45324}But that was long ago
{45330}{45400}He'd always whisper in my ear
{45405}{45485}But then I started drinking beer
{45489}{45617}My jewels got licked by six frisky deer
{45662}{45759}Now he's just a loner and a liar
{45764}{45831}And my trailer's caught on fire
{45835}{45860}Fire?!
{45963}{45991}Oh, my God!
{46008}{46052}Be careful!
{46429}{46473}Maybe it's some kind of sign.
{46477}{46561}After all, Chanukah is|the festival of lights.
{46569}{46638}I should stick you on|a twig and roast you.
{46643}{46741}Just get back in my car. You'll stay|with me and my sister for a while.
{46746}{46785}I ain't living with you buffoons.
{46791}{46877}What other options do you got, Mr.|Rockefeller?
{47130}{47197}-Hello?|-Hi, is Ophelia there?
{47202}{47286}-Ophelia who?|-Ophelia Hiney.
{47291}{47355}Oh, feel my hiney?
{47367}{47491}You hoodlums better bring my|wig back! I know it was you!
{47779}{47849}It's a home-invasion robbery!
{47854}{47975}Take whatever you want, but please|don't chop my legs off!
{47980}{48033}It's okay, Eleanore, it's okay.
{48039}{48146}Whitey, thank God you're here. We're|being robbed by a lunatic.
{48151}{48229}Mister, if you're going to kill us, take|off your wet shoes.
{48233}{48289}They're soaking the carpet.
{48327}{48387}Eleanore, that's Davey Stone, my new|partner.
{48393}{48513}The criminal?! Did he force you to|bring him here so he could molest you?
{48564}{48673}His home just went up in flames. So I|invited him to stay with us for a while.
{48775}{48853}Okay, but I'm making an inventory...
{48857}{48925}...of every single item in this house.
{48930}{48955}Fascinating.
{48959}{49081}Look! He already stole something.|He's hiding it in his jacket.
{49087}{49147}I didn't steal this.|It's a card my parents gave me.
{49152}{49218}So why don't you go stay with them?
{49222}{49247}They died.
{49252}{49288}My bad.
{49313}{49389}Here's to you guys for letting me|crash over.
{49408}{49512}Alcohol in our house?|This is never going to work.
{49518}{49635}It will. We just need to set some rules|so Davey knows how we do things here.
{49640}{49681}I'm scared.
{49686}{49791}Look. You gotta understand it's just|been me and Eleanore for 67 years...
{49796}{49852}...so she gets nervous around|strangers.
{49857}{49904}I wouldn't show that picture to anyone...
{49909}{49975}...or they may try to take you two back|to the laboratory.
{49984}{50034}Listen. We got rules in this house...
{50039}{50122}...and you better follow them or you'll|find yourself out of here.
{50174}{50224}This might be harder than I thought.
{50254}{50346}If you're coming from the street|With dirty shoes on your feet
{50351}{50395}That's a technical foul
{50438}{50516}If you switch the radio to some|"Modern" music show
{50521}{50576}That's a technical foul
{50630}{50699}If you don't shut the door
{50704}{50781}After using the 'frigerator
{50786}{50857}That's a technical foul
{50862}{50945}A technical foul
{50966}{51008}If you touch the thermostat
{51014}{51045}You'll get hit with a bat
{51050}{51093}'Cause that's a technical foul
{51099}{51139}You will feel my wrath
{51144}{51224}-lf your hair clogs the drain|-You'll know the meaning of pain
{51229}{51271}'Cause that's a technical foul
{51276}{51327}I'll show you no mercy
{51332}{51393}Ho! This is such bullshit
{51410}{51488}In this house we say "bullspit"
{51494}{51564}Or it's a technical foul
{51571}{51606}A technical foul
{51611}{51702}Let me get this straight. You expect me|to change my lifestyle in one night...
{51706}{51777}...because you guys are a couple of|psychotic control freaks?
{51781}{51841}-You got it, bub.|-Or you can go rot in the gutter.
{51846}{51913}-It's up to you, Yankee Doodle.|-I don't want to do that...
{51918}{52003}...but let me run a few questions by you|so I don't screw up accidentally.
{52034}{52116}If I don't spray Lysol|After moving a bowel?
{52121}{52165}That's a technical foul
{52202}{52295}If I decide to wash my ass|With your monogrammed towel?
{52300}{52369}-That's a technical foul|-Please, say "hiney."
{52390}{52473}If I make fun of your crazy feeties
{52479}{52549}Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes
{52554}{52605}That's not only a technical foul
{52635}{52699}But possibly a homicide
{52778}{52823}Can I sleep past 3?
{52828}{52869}If you do, you'll get a T
{52874}{52955}-Take a whiz in those flowers?|-I'll say, "Hit the showers"
{52960}{53037}-Use this horn as a bong?|-Adi√≥s", Tommy Chong"
{53042}{53082}Make some long-distance calls?
{53087}{53152}You'll get a kick in the balls|Oops!
{53157}{53231}Can I walk around with|My morning erection?
{53236}{53310}If you want an automatic ejection
{53315}{53379}'Cause that's a technical foul
{53384}{53455}But I'd like to see it anyway
{53483}{53520}Just kidding.
{53539}{53623}There are certain rules|Which apply in one's life
{53628}{53716}With your sister, friends|Or imaginary wife
{53722}{53807}I can't believe I haven't killed myself
{53812}{53908}Here with Wigs McGee and the furry elf
{53913}{53988}They took my wig
{53994}{54092}I remember the look in their eyes
{54097}{54172}I guess I'll have to deal|With your demands
{54178}{54271}But please don't touch me|With your alien hands
{54276}{54363}I got no right to growl
{54368}{54429}The whistle, she's on the prowl
{54444}{54543}Without my wig, I look like an owl|Hoo! Hoo!
{54548}{54589}-Oh, my God.|-Don't laugh at her.
{54594}{54688}Or it's a technical foul
{54693}{54774}A technical foul
{54778}{54807}A technical foul
{55040}{55091}Davey will have to make the best of this.
{55098}{55181}-I guess I got to make the best of this.|-See. I told you.
{55208}{55308}But that shouldn't be too hard for him.|Even loners need company sometimes.
{55354}{55398}Shaving the chest.
{55402}{55479}Nobody needs a uni-brow.
{55525}{55573}This is going to scare her silly.
{55578}{55607}Yeah, it is.
{55611}{55669}Peanuts for me?
{55926}{56025}-Wish we were taller, Eleanore?|-I can't reach the cobwebs.
{56046}{56109}-Thank you, Davey.|-No problem, Eleanore.
{56352}{56397}Good one, Eleanore.
{56450}{56516}-Here you go.|-Thanks. Have a good day.
{56646}{56689}Good luck, old man.
{56746}{56855}Now I can understand wrapping|the cornmeal around the hot dog...
{56860}{56928}...but why the heck would they shove|this stick in here?
{56933}{57012}I'm getting exhausted|trying to cut around it.
{57018}{57103}You're supposed to hold the stick|and just eat the corn dog off of it.
{57117}{57183}How futuristic.
{57188}{57222}Oh, my God.
{57238}{57319}Zip up or you'll catch a throat cold.
{57324}{57366}Thank you.
{57415}{57447}Hey, Benny!
{57451}{57531}Nice game against Saint Catherine's|today. How many buckets you score?
{57535}{57560}Fourteen.
{57564}{57615}You're gonna be league-high scorer, kid.
{57634}{57678}You just got to keep your elbows in.
{57683}{57723}That's my man.
{57934}{58005}Hey, you two, just doing circles.
{58077}{58111}Oopsy-doodle!
{58184}{58224}Yeah!
{58230}{58267}I haven't done that in a while.
{58272}{58384}Maybe I'm so excited about the banquet|tonight, it's giving me extra oomph.
{58390}{58509}You'll extra-oomph yourself right into|another seizure if you don't calm down.
{58515}{58593}He'll be all right. How'd you get|so good on the ice, anyways?
{58598}{58685}In the '50s I reffed youth hockey|for a couple of seasons.
{58690}{58773}Until a wrist shot caught him in the|back of the skull.
{58779}{58849}Nothing a little metal plate couldn't fix.
{58855}{58905}He was in a coma for three months.
{58911}{58964}I needed the rest anyway.
{59071}{59116}Could I get a lift from you, partner?
{59120}{59144}Sure.
{59231}{59320}So, Davey, did you play the hockey|when you were a child?
{59325}{59373}No, hockey players get up too early.
{59379}{59476}This guy's sport always was and|always will be basketball.
{59482}{59514}Back in '81...
{59520}{59601}...he was the star of what is still|known to this very day...
{59605}{59669}...as the JCC miracle game.
{59675}{59700}Oh, my.
{59704}{59767}The JCC was down by 24 points.
{59773}{59841}The bad news is we stand no chance|of winning this game.
{59847}{59944}The good news is it's Chanukah, so|you'll all get presents tonight anyway.
{59949}{59987}Speaking of presents...
{59992}{60073}...our parents come to all our games|even though we always lose.
{60078}{60109}So I was thinking...
{60113}{60208}...maybe tonight we could try to win one|for them. You know, as a gift.
{60213}{60294}The only way that'll happen is if you|take all the shots.
{60300}{60342}Well, if you guys don't mind....
{60347}{60405}-It's okay with us.|-Go for it. You got it.
{60411}{60447}Let's win!
{60453}{60493}Where are your parents, anyways?
{60541}{60616}I don't know. Hopefully, out|getting me an Atari.
{60829}{60860}All right, Davey!
{61260}{61296}-Come on!|-Let's go!
{61362}{61389}We'll take that.
{61469}{61508}Not today.
{61664}{61763}That kind of shooting makes me|want to do the robot dance.
{62011}{62044}Nice story. You can stop now.
{62049}{62132}No, no, go on. Whitey, I'm mesmerized.
{62137}{62178}Can we just go? I'm cold.
{62183}{62277}I want to hear what happens next.|It's like a fairy tale.
{62281}{62400}Unfortunately, this fairy tale|doesn't have a happy ending.
{62720}{62792}Davey was wondering|where his parents were.
{62797}{62865}Turns out they were on their way|to the ball game...
{62871}{62997}...when a truck hit a patch of black ice|and swerved into oncoming traffic.
{63003}{63117}Mr. and Mrs. Stone tragically|couldn't get out of the way in time.
{63130}{63189}I couldn't believe something|that horrible...
{63195}{63273}...could happen to a kid that nice.
{63279}{63376}He walked right through that door|and into foster home after foster home...
{63381}{63447}...until his 18th birthday.
{63509}{63625}Oh, my. You poor, poor boy.|What in heaven's name did you do?
{63631}{63661}Let's just get off of this.
{63667}{63728}He didn't know how to handle it.
{63734}{63831}What 12-year-old kid would?|He basically shut down.
{64110}{64230}Davey, I'm so sorry.|I don't know what to say.
{64235}{64293}There's nothing to say.|My parents are dead.
{64299}{64368}Happy Chanukah.|Now, leave me alone.
{64429}{64521}That's the saddest story I've ever heard.
{64761}{64819}I'm out of here.|I don't need this sympathy crap.
{64825}{64901}Maybe it's time you stop running|from your emotions.
{64909}{64957}I'm not. I'm running from two crybabies...
{64962}{65034}...who won't shut up about something|that isn't their business.
{65039}{65111}You know, I read recently|in "Reader's Digest"...
{65116}{65209}...that people who let themselves cry|when they're hurting...
{65214}{65269}...are often stronger than the people...
{65273}{65353}...who try to hold all their pain inside.
{65359}{65440}Did you read about a deformed referee|who spends 35 years...
{65444}{65489}...trying to win some stupid patch...
{65493}{65564}...so he can pretend people|actually like him?!
{65570}{65624}Which month was that in?
{65633}{65677}Take that back.
{65682}{65759}If they have an award for the|freakiest looking fraternal twins...
{65763}{65847}...who no one even gives a crap about,|you two are definitely winning.
{65852}{65921}But that patch thing ain't ever|gonna happen for you...
{65925}{66025}...because the truth is, nobody|in this town even knows you exist!
{66056}{66096}You're an animal.
{66100}{66128}And you're bald!
{66132}{66189}Not again!
{66203}{66292}You're not welcome in my house.
{66296}{66340}Good, your house sucks!
{66345}{66421}Do you have to be nasty to everyone|who tries to help you?
{66429}{66455}That's my problem.
{66500}{66544}He just a no-goodnik.
{66550}{66641}And I am the real Kristi Yamaguchi.
{66716}{66828}Wow. Just when you started to really|like Davey, he has a butthole relapse.
{66882}{66913}Hey, fellas.
{66919}{66981}You know, Eleanore really does|look like an owl.
{67012}{67036}Sorry.
{67041}{67107}Cheer up, Eleanore.|Let's just get ready for the banquet.
{67244}{67320}It doesn't hurt to smell nice. Does it,|fellas?
{67324}{67365}You're a good deer.
{67429}{67520}Let's try the red wig. And please,|don't crap on my carpet.
{67550}{67641}Well, while Whitey and Eleanore|are getting ready for the banquet...
{67646}{67717}...the moron is having|a party of his own.
{67726}{67785}And when people get in the state|that Davey's in...
{67790}{67842}...they do really stupid things...
{67846}{67904}...like go to a mall that's obviously|closed...
{67909}{67992}...to yell at a woman who's obviously|not there.
{68042}{68080}Shut up!
{68162}{68217}Jennifer!
{68242}{68276}Jennifer!
{68282}{68363}What's the matter with the way I live|my life? Huh, Jennifer?!
{68368}{68457}Where are you?! Home reading|your baby boy a bedtime story...
{68463}{68552}...while he sucks his thumb|and goes pee-pee on his blanket?!
{68558}{68595}Horseshit!
{68600}{68704}Look who finally showed up.|We've been waiting for you all night.
{68710}{68739}Who said that?
{68744}{68800}I said that. Everybody wake up!
{68806}{68841}This is not a rehearsal.
{68847}{68879}Numb-nuts is here.
{68899}{68935}Roger on that. Over.
{68940}{68985}Let's do this, people.
{68992}{69057}Just let me put my teeth in.
{69112}{69143}How do you like your java?
{69148}{69186}With a shot of whiskey.
{69191}{69252}Let's try it black instead.
{69270}{69304}That burns!
{69309}{69377}Wake up, kids.|Our hot and sour friend is here.
{69397}{69450}We're coming!
{69492}{69537}It's about time you got here.
{69541}{69583}I've been tossing and turning.
{69588}{69645}I know. I was watching you.
{69661}{69709}I mean, me too.
{69715}{69764}What the heck is happening right now?
{69769}{69825}Something that should have happened|20 years ago.
{69831}{69865}Time to cry, Davey. Over.
{69871}{69923}What? Get out of here. I'm leaving.
{69929}{70009}You can run from Whitey,|but you ain't gonna run from us.
{70045}{70145}We all heard what happened|At the skating rink today
{70149}{70266}When Whitey brought up your sad past|You snapped and walked away
{70274}{70399}Well, maybe they're onto something|That you should give a try
{70405}{70515}Go ahead and let it out|And have yourself a cry
{70520}{70573}Let it out, Davey
{70578}{70637}Shut your wooden mugs
{70642}{70701}Let it out, Davey
{70707}{70770}Would you check out her bezugs
{70775}{70877}You want me to deal with pain|Well, "Cheers" is what I say
{70895}{71005}This here stuff just numbs the pain|It don't make it go away
{71011}{71061}You try to act so tough
{71067}{71125}But you just live a lie
{71131}{71250}Why don't you show your feminine side|And have yourself a cry
{71255}{71316}Let it out, Davey
{71322}{71367}I'll pour you down the sink
{71373}{71442}You gotta do it, Davey
{71447}{71505}Y'all can bite my dink
{71564}{71676}You labels and logos are wasting|Your time making me sit here
{71681}{71800}'Cause nothing you can say or do|Will make me shed a tear
{71805}{71864}He possesses a strong spirit
{71869}{71913}And won't let down his guard
{71918}{71981}So now we'll bring in the big gun
{71989}{72064}His beautiful Chanukah card
{72090}{72153}Take it, Davey. It might have money in it.|Over.
{72321}{72449}Happy Chanukah to our wonderful son
{72459}{72522}You fill our lives
{72532}{72603}With joy
{72617}{72679}Don't ever change
{72685}{72761}The way you are
{72801}{72869}You beautiful
{72876}{72953}Twelve-year-old
{72958}{73028}Boy
{73257}{73292}Breaking and entering.
{73297}{73361}I knew you'd screw|up eventually, Stone.
{73366}{73460}-I'm sorry.|-Save your sorries for the judge.
{73666}{73693}This is embarrassing.
{73912}{73965}-Come on, guys.|-Okay, sweetheart.
{74021}{74070}Don't be sad, Mom. I can be your date.
{74081}{74137}You should let me be your date.
{74156}{74281}I may be dirty and smelly,|but in the dark, I'm just smelly.
{74309}{74380}Well, thank you, but he asked first.
{74389}{74472}Oh, my God. Slow down.|Come on. I'm scared.
{74477}{74562}Hey, why are we stopped now?|What are you doing? What's going on?
{74567}{74623}Who's out there?|Do we need to call the police?
{74629}{74707}Don't worry, Eleanore. I promise|you'll have a good time.
{74712}{74797}All right, brother. Let's go win this thing.
{74953}{75071}You look like Audrey Hepburn if she was|four feet and weighed 300 pounds.
{75077}{75114}Thank you.
{75127}{75179}Watch the ice, Eleanore. Don't slip.
{75184}{75234}It's all good, Whitey.
{75285}{75353}Eleanore Duvall? Is that you?
{75357}{75393}Why do you want to know?
{75399}{75435}What can we do you for, bub?
{75440}{75510}I've been waiting to see your sister|for many years.
{75518}{75582}Are you the kid who stole my wig?
{75587}{75647}Yes, I'm Eli Wolstan...
{75653}{75738}...and I've always felt bad about being|so thoughtless when I was young.
{75743}{75789}So I wanted to return this to you.
{75801}{75829}Thank you.
{75893}{75918}Feel better?
{75929}{75976}One more thing.
{76088}{76125}Now I feel better.
{76185}{76249}At least this one make me look pretty.
{76299}{76400}Attention all officers. Davey Stone is|on the loose.
{76578}{76645}Last bus to New York|City now boarding.
{76860}{76960}Whitey, they were giving out lobster|bibs in the bathroom.
{76965}{77077}That's not a lobster bib, Eleanore.|That's a germ protector for your tushy.
{77084}{77163}Okay. Well, I'll use it here.
{77222}{77289}My hiney is germfree and I love it.
{77331}{77395}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.|I'm Mayor Stuey Duhy.
{77399}{77456}I'd like to welcome you to the|35th annual...
{77461}{77529}...youth league basketball|all-star banquet.
{77609}{77703}For those of you celebrating Christmas|tomorrow, merry Christmas.
{77708}{77748}Merry Christmas.
{77752}{77824}For those of you celebrating|the eighth night of Chanukah...
{77828}{77868}...happy Chanukah.
{77876}{77920}Happy Chanukah.
{77969}{78004}Going to the Big Apple, son?
{78022}{78052}Yeah.
{78056}{78085}Business or pleasure?
{78105}{78129}Freedom.
{78135}{78212}I see. You're one of them|hippie-dippy fellas.
{78228}{78293}Everyone knows I like to start|these events with a joke.
{78298}{78365}But I've been so busy at the hardware|store this year...
{78370}{78486}...l've had no time to think of a great|one. But I thought of this driving here:
{78492}{78520}Knock, knock.
{78525}{78560}Who's there?
{78564}{78628}-Don't you.|-Don't you, who?
{78632}{78704}Don't you wish I hadn't been so busy|at the hardware store...
{78710}{78765}...and had more time to think|of a great one?
{79437}{79485}Mom, I didn't get that one.
{79490}{79572}I don't think anybody did.|People just try to be nice to the mayor.
{79586}{79649}It's gonna be a good night.|Let's get to it.
{79653}{79756}The award for most impressive growth|goes to a kid who began at 4-foot-2.
{79760}{79876}He is now about to take the stage|at his current height of 6-foot-5.
{79880}{79916}Donald Hardy!
{79922}{79952}Get up here, you beanpole.
{80009}{80064}Saint Ignatius is number one!
{80068}{80140}Hopefully that young man's getting|a weed whacker for Christmas.
{80152}{80205}The mayor is very funny.
{80466}{80565}Look at Davey, inches|from a clean getaway.
{80570}{80647}But there's some things you|just aren't meant to get away from.
{80679}{80704}What the hey?
{80736}{80829}Whoa! Whoa! Hang in there, Betsy!|We'll make it! Whoa!
{80840}{80899}Nice driving skills, pal.
{80964}{81016}That's the strangest thing|I've ever seen.
{81020}{81085}One thumbtack popped all eight|of my back tires.
{81213}{81272}Okay. I see what you're doing.
{81296}{81380}Who you talking to? Having one of them|hippie-dippy mushroom flashbacks?
{81386}{81456}I need to go apologize to someone|before I leave.
{81461}{81548}I know you hippies don't wear watches,|but it should be fixed in 30 minutes.
{81554}{81584}I'll see you then.
{81588}{81641}Run, hippie! Run!
{81752}{81824}I'm just here to say I'm sorry|to the little guy. I swear.
{81864}{81928}If I give myself a wedgie|will you believe me then?
{82132}{82161}Okay?
{82255}{82308}Glad we could work that out.
{82324}{82404}I can't believe I'm in the same room|as the mayor.
{82408}{82488}I can't believe how many rolls|you put in your purse.
{82492}{82556}It'll be a nice snack for February.
{82572}{82656}Ladies and gentlemen, this next award,|the Dukesberry All-Star Patch...
{82660}{82761}...was created 35 years ago to recognize|people for their tireless work ethic...
{82765}{82808}...their unparalleled generosity...
{82812}{82904}...and their passion and dedication to|both the league and our fine community.
{82909}{83016}Your hands are sopping wet.|Don't be so nervous, Whitey.
{83020}{83068}I'm not nervous. I'm excited.
{83074}{83165}I've been waiting 35 years|for this night.
{83452}{83521}-You see something?|-Just some deer doing a pyramid.
{83526}{83573}Okay, well, let's keep looking.
{83653}{83688}Good job, fellas.
{83697}{83780}Hand-picked by you,|the people of our fine town...
{83785}{83860}...I now present the 35th annual...
{83866}{83948}...Dukesberry All-Star Patch Award...
{83953}{83980}...to...
{83990}{84032}Please let there be a miracle.
{84090}{84141}...Tom Baltezor.
{84148}{84212}Tom, come up here and get this sucker.
{84287}{84339}Attaboy, Tommy!
{84828}{84873}We love you, Tommy!
{85122}{85205}Nobody in this town even knows|you exist!
{85344}{85428}All you people can bite|my germfree booty!
{85472}{85585}Looks like I better do a lot more than|apologize. See you in 10 years, fellas.
{85657}{85734}When I was a kid playing youth|league ball for Palmer Episcopal...
{85738}{85781}...I dreamed of two things:
{85786}{85901}Learning to make a lay-up with my left|hand and becoming a multi-billionaire.
{85906}{85985}I think you all know which dream|came true.
{85993}{86036}Wow!
{86040}{86128}Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.
{86160}{86288}And even though I don't recall scoring a|point during my four seasons of play...
{86300}{86372}...the memories of the fun times|I did have...
{86377}{86464}...made it very easy for me to purchase|the new digital scoreboard...
{86468}{86552}...for the community center|earlier this year.
{86557}{86592}Thanks for the recognition.
{86596}{86661}-Thanks for the scoreboard!|-Thank you, Tommy!
{86689}{86760}Excuse me! Can I just say something?
{86766}{86821}-There he is!|-Stone, what are you doing here?
{86826}{86900}Getting himself arrested, Mayor Duhy.|He broke into the mall.
{86905}{86964}I love it! Your ass busted!
{86970}{87033}Now you go to jail|and marry big, smelly man.
{87040}{87088}Stone, you screwed up for the last time.
{87093}{87168}That 10-year sentence I promised you|starts tonight.
{87237}{87309}Please, just let me speak for one second.
{87320}{87356}Are those tears in his eyes?
{87361}{87395}Finally.
{87412}{87448}Let the guy talk!
{87500}{87548}After all, it is the holidays.
{87597}{87680}She's right. And then we'll|send him up the river.
{87752}{87833}Okay, Mrs. Triple Nipple--|I mean, Mrs. Selman.
{87837}{87912}Go ahead, Mr. Stone. Let's hear|your parting words of wisdom.
{87917}{88024}I know you people don't like me or|care about my opinion, but here goes.
{88029}{88136}Tommy, nothing personal, but Whitey|should have won the patch tonight.
{88142}{88204}You're all crazy for not realizing that.
{88209}{88312}Why would we give Whitey Duvall the|patch? So he could use it as a blanket?
{88529}{88581}That's the reaction I thought I'd get.
{88598}{88664}Everyone in this room has been|Associated with Whitey
{88668}{88705}Through basketball or the mall
{88712}{88840}Or various odd jobs he does around|Town for free or at most a dollar
{88864}{88941}And I'm guessing 99% of you have|Either laughed in Whitey's face
{88948}{89028}Or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or|Voice or sister or shortness
{89032}{89124}When he wasn't looking
{89129}{89221}But the next time you'd see him, he'd go|Out of his way to smile and wave at you
{89226}{89276}And ask about your mother's operation
{89281}{89388}Because he, unlike us, Cares|about someone other than himself
{89407}{89508}The reason I bring this up to you
{89512}{89632}Is because I was the worst offender
{89636}{89691}Of all
{89754}{89828}My life was simply going nowhere
{89842}{89924}Then a tiny, little man|Rushed to my side
{89949}{90032}He should've gotten a big thank-you
{90054}{90132}Instead he got a Port-A-Potty ride
{90136}{90224}I was such a shithead
{90228}{90313}But he never quit on me
{90332}{90433}Till I told him he was useless
{90439}{90517}And his sister was freaky
{90524}{90608}Once when we were watching|Sunday football
{90620}{90728}A fuzzy screen was all that|We could see
{90732}{90809}Whitey came over with a hanger
{90825}{90897}And spent the game on top of our TV
{90904}{90985}And when the lightning struck him
{90996}{91060}He let out a wicked-loud yell
{91096}{91192}But we just turned up the volume
{91201}{91252}And ignored the burning smell
{91256}{91324}We should all rot in hell
{91345}{91417}I went to high school with Whitey
{91434}{91525}As a joke I told him to meet me|At the prom
{91537}{91640}When he got there I said, "I can't|Believe you thought I was serious"
{91645}{91721}So he ran home crying and|slow-danced With his mom
{91725}{91829}What a crushing blow to Whitey
{91833}{91908}I bet you wish you could take it back
{91932}{91992}How could you all be|so mean to Whitey?
{92029}{92088}Sound to me like you are all on crack
{92095}{92120}Huh?
{92125}{92220}Tonight Whitey was|counting on this town
{92226}{92317}To show that we care
{92322}{92406}But the first time he really needed us
{92411}{92461}We weren't there
{92468}{92576}And on Christmas Eve|And the last night of Chanukah
{92585}{92684}It's just not fair
{93112}{93156}I wonder if that guy
{93161}{93241}Ever wiped his ass with|The wrong hand
{93254}{93280}Yes.
{93795}{93870}I'm so sorry they hurt you, Whitey.
{93875}{93936}We should go to the mall.
{93941}{94017}That place always makes me feel better.
{94022}{94064}But it's closed.
{94069}{94175}Maybe the night guard|forgot to lock the door again.
{94180}{94249}Well, if he didn't, we can at|least sit in front of it.
{94255}{94313}These are desperate times.
{94449}{94543}Let the door be open.|Please, just give me that.
{94555}{94609}Thank God.
{94625}{94720}This is the most beautiful place|I've ever seen.
{94724}{94793}It's like a sanctuary.
{94797}{94924}Eleanore, could you just give me a|second to say a few words in private?
{94928}{95020}Take as much time as you need, Whitey.
{95152}{95221}Hey, mall, long time no see.
{95226}{95305}Fourteen hours to be exact.
{95312}{95364}If you haven't heard by now...
{95368}{95493}...I didn't get that patch I've been|telling you about for all these years.
{95497}{95581}In fact, I've been|kind of kidding myself...
{95587}{95661}...to even think I was in the running.
{95685}{95712}You see...
{95723}{95772}...the people of Dukesberry...
{95776}{95867}...think I'm nothing but a joke.
{95889}{95965}So I was kind of thinking...
{95970}{96097}...maybe I should move to a town|where nobody knows who I am.
{96103}{96231}At least then they'd have a|reason not to acknowledge me.
{96247}{96324}I think Eleanore might like Florida...
{96328}{96451}...and I hear they got some pretty|amazing malls there.
{96460}{96515}You're not going anywhere.
{96544}{96644}Holy shit, did the mall|just say something?
{96664}{96721}No, it was me.
{96743}{96792}What do you want, Stone?
{96798}{96852}I came to apologize, Whitey.
{96861}{96964}Well, there's nothing to apologize for,|Stone, because you were right.
{96969}{97028}Nobody does care about me.
{97032}{97119}I don't think that's true.|Do you, Mr. Mayor?
{97197}{97264}Whitey, tonight for the first time|in years...
{97268}{97369}...your partner, Davey Stone, actually|did a good thing for this community.
{97374}{97436}What he do, steal beer for everyone?
{97448}{97564}No. He made me see how great Whitey|is and how neglectful we've all been.
{97581}{97668}That's why I'm here, Whitey.|I'm here to fix a big mistake.
{97674}{97796}It's your moment, Whitey
{97801}{97908}You've waited oh, so long
{97914}{98041}It's your moment, Whitey
{98063}{98142}We're here to right our wrong
{98148}{98256}For service to the league and this|community, I proudly present to you...
{98262}{98383}...the 35th annual Dukesberry|All-Star Patch.
{98403}{98452}But this is Tom's.
{98466}{98588}Mr. Duvall, the 35th All-Star|Patch is now where it belongs.
{98629}{98704}I can't believe this is happening.
{98713}{98752}And the 34th!
{98792}{98825}And the 33rd!
{98838}{98934}And the 32nd,|and the 31 st, and the 30th!
{98940}{98968}-29th!|-And the 16th!
{98972}{99006}-And the 28th!|-And the 23rd!
{99011}{99036}And the 27th!
{99040}{99097}-Oh, Whitey.|-And the 11 th!
{99102}{99144}-And the 25th!|-And the 18th!
{99186}{99212}We love you, Whitey!
{99217}{99328}You stepped up for me, Stone.|I don't know if I could ever repay you.
{99343}{99389}Well, you can help me with my dream.
{99396}{99468}You got a dream? What is it?
{99474}{99528}To have someone wish me|a happy Chanukah...
{99532}{99609}...and feel as good as I used to|when my dad would say it to me.
{99620}{99668}Happy Chanukah, Stone.
{99676}{99712}Merry Christmas, Whitey.
{99753}{99864}You know, Stone, if my imaginary wife|and I ever have a son...
{99869}{99928}...I hope you consider him a brother.
{99932}{100016}Thanks, Whitey. And I'll pretend|I never heard you say that.
{100027}{100052}Appreciate it.
{100057}{100180}It's your moment, Whitey
{100184}{100296}-Enjoy, our tiny friend|-Thank you. Thank you.
{100300}{100369}Like the Bavarian cream-filled donut
{100376}{100452}You ate last week
{100456}{100513}Thank you. Thank you.
{100524}{100572}Would you three show Whitey and I...
{100576}{100660}...how to light the Chanukah candles|at our house tonight?
{100665}{100692}You up for that, pal?
{100698}{100741}And when Benjamin falls asleep...
{100748}{100825}...the both of you can play|Spin the Dreidel for tongue kisses.
{100829}{100854}Sounds good to me.
{100860}{100977}Now, go live happily ever after or I'll|dropkick the teeth out of your mouth.
{100981}{101032}That won't be necessary.
{101037}{101111}They make a nice couple.
{101135}{101172}I never
{101177}{101305}Want this to end
{101384}{101433}Don't worry, folks. Whitey's okay.
{101440}{101512}This is the happiest seizure of my life.
{101516}{101540}See, I told you.
This is a story from long ago, when the great mammoths still roamed our lands.
It's the story of my two brothers and me.
When the three of us were young, we were taught that the world is full of magic.
The source of this magic is the ever-changing lights that dance across the sky.
The shaman woman of our village told us that these lights are the spirits of our ancestors, and that they have the power to make changes in our world.
Small things become big.
Winter turns to spring.
One thing always changes into another.
But the greatest change I ever saw was that of my brother, a boy who desperately wanted to be a man.
- Get down.
- What?
Get down! Get down!
Kenai.
Never try to milk a caribou.
No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No.
Hey. Will you two knock it off?
That's all right.
After today, he won't treat me like that.
Right, the big manhood ceremony.
Doesn't matter what the spirits say, you'll always be our baby brother.
- Well, wait till I get my totem.
- Baby brother.
Hey, I said knock it off.
The quicker we get these fish, the faster we get to your ceremony.
Let's all just try and get along for a few hours. Okay, Denahi?
- Whatever you say.
- Okay, Ken...
So, what are we waiting for?
When the Earth was young and the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the great beyond
With its many paths
Man and nature lived side by side
In this wilderness of danger and beauty
Lived three brothers bonded by love
Their hearts full ofjoy
They ask now for guidance
Reaching out to the skies up above
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other in this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
Give us wisdom to pass to each other
And give us strength so we understand
That the things we do
The choices we make
Give direction to all life's plans
To look and wonder at all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn
Only leads to another
A journey ends but another begins
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other in this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
- Kenai's back.
- Kenai.
Kenai, are you excited about getting your spirit rock today?
It's not a rock. It'll be my totem.
I'll probably get a sabre-tooth tiger for bravery, or strength, or greatness.
- Something that fits me.
- A mammoth for your fat head?
- Make sure you get that basket tied up.
- Don't worry.
No stupid bear is gonna get near this fish.
Just tie it up.
- She's back. Tanana's back.
- Come on.
- Come on, Kenai, let's go.
- Come on.
Tanana's got your rock. Come on.
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other in this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
Brothers all the same
Nana.
- Hey, Nana.
- Well, hello there, sweetheart.
What a big girl.
When each of us comes of age, the great spirits reveal to us a totem that helps guide us through our lives.
Some of us use courage to guide us.
Others patience.
And some of us beauty.
Kenai.
- You nervous?
- Excited.
You should be. It's a good one.
Kenai, I have been to the mountain where the lights touch the earth, and the great spirits have revealed to me your totem.
To become a man, your actions must be guided by one thing.
Your totem is...
Love.
- What?
- Yes, love.
The bear of love?
A love that connects and unites all living things.
- Who wants to trade?
- There is no trading.
Oh, Kenai, love is the most precious of totems.
It reveals itself in unexpected ways.
Let love guide your actions, then one day you'll be a man, and we'll place your mark next to those of our ancestors.
There he is.
Come here, lover boy.
- Leave me alone.
- Kenai, wait.
- I'm sorry.
- What?
Your totem, I think it's really great.
- You do?
- Yeah. And I made you something.
Really?
Now when you skip around loving everybody, you'll smell so sweet.
Well, isn't this nice?
Instead of fighting, you're giving each other flowers.
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch with his totem already.
Hey, dog breath, go take care of the fish.
Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves...
- Kenai.
- Someday I'm gonna just...
- He's just such a...
- Hey, bonehead.
Just because his totem is wisdom doesn't mean he's wise.
- I mean, look at him.
- Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
- Hi, Denahi.
- Hi.
Let go!
Yeah, the spirits messed up on both of our totems.
I felt the same way when Tanana gave me mine.
- Get out of here.
- No, really.
I said, "The eagle of guidance?
What does that mean?"
But now that I'm older,
I know it's about being a leader and keeping an eye on you two.
I just want to get my handprint on that wall.
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem, you will.
- Really?
- Guarantee it.
But come on, the bear of love?
I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone.
They don't think. They don't feel.
I mean, they're...
- They're thieves.
- You didn't tie it up, did you?
You should get the totem of pinheads.
Knock it off.
- We'll just make another basket.
- We?
Oh, no. It took me two weeks to make that basket.
Get lover boy to do it.
He's the one always messing things up.
- Typical Kenai.
- All right, I'll go get your basket.
Kenai, wait. Kenai!
What?
Kenai!
- Where'd he go?
- If we're lucky, far away.
Kenai!
- Kenai.
- Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here.
- What?
- The bear. Behind you.
Hey, bear, come on. Over here.
Come on, bear, come this way.
Denahi!
- Hold on.
- Pull.
Sitka. Sitka!
Sitka.
Come on!
- Sitka!
- Sitka!
Sitka. Sitka!
- Sitka?
- Sitka, where are you?
Kenai.
No.
Sitka!
Denahi, let's find him!
Sitka.
Sitka, where are you? Sitka!
- You ready?
- For what?
For going after the bear.
I know what you're feeling, but killing that bear is wrong.
Wrong? Our brother is dead and it's because of that monster.
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.
- I see.
- Killing the bear won't make you a man.
Now you're trying to be wise.
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you?
You really think love has anything to do with being a man?
A man wouldn't just sit here and do nothing.
Kenai. Don't upset the spirits.
Spirits. Thanks for your wisdom.
I've got to stop him.
You left too soon, Sitka.
Your brothers need your guidance.
Kenai.
What?
Sitka.
No.
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.
A man wouldn't just sit here and do nothing.
So, Kenai, you've decided to join the living.
That's quite a bump you've got.
That must have been one heck of a ride down the rapids.
Tanana?
Nana, you won't believe this.
I was at the top of this rock, and all of a sudden...
Kenai, honey.
I don't speak bear.
No.
No, no! No!
All right! All right! All right!
Would you settle down? Settle!
Kenai! Kenai...
Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.
Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this.
Strange. Spirits don't usually make these kind of changes.
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Sitka must have something really big planned for you. Yep, yep.
You are going to get a whole new perspective on things.
Do you see in black and white or colour?
Hey. Listen to me.
You got yourself into this mess.
If you want to change, take it up with your brother's spirit.
You'll find him on the mountain where the lights touch the earth.
He'll help you make up for what you've done wrong.
But I didn't do anything wrong.
Tanana? Tanana!
Wait. I didn't do anything wrong.
- I don't even know how to get there.
- What happened to them?
- I don't know.
- They were here. Now they're gone.
Yeah, that's pretty weird.
So you're telling me you didn't eat them and you have no idea where they are?
Hey, hey, you. You just talked.
Just back away, real slow-like.
- How did you do that?
- I knew you had them.
Are we there yet?
Don't make me turn this formation around.
Hey. Wait. Come back.
I'm trying to find where the lights...
- What's he getting worked up about?
- Maybe the goose pooped on him?
He's looking over here.
Let's beat it. This way.
- No, this way.
- Thank you very much.
- Just stay still and...
- Hey, you two!
Head down.
I think he's seen us. Now what?
- Act like we're not here.
- We're not here.
- What are you doing?
- You said to...
- Don't say anything.
- Okay.
- I said, "Don't say anything."
- Excuse me.
- Don't eat us.
- You won't like us, eh? We're gamey.
Yeah. Eat hoof-for-brains over there.
- Pine-cone breath.
- Crusty tail.
- Twig legs.
- Big nose.
- Sorry.
- You went too far that time.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Guys.
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- I'm not eating anybody.
- That's mighty decent of you, eh.
- My name's Rutt.
- This is my brother Tuke.
- How's it going, Bear?
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry...
- Mr Bear?
- I mean, I'm not a bear. I hate bears.
- Well, gee, you're one big beaver.
- No kidding, eh?
Do either of you know where the lights touch the earth?
No. No. Sorry, bear... Beaver.
I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear...
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.
- I'm a man.
- Excuse me.
I was transformed into a bear.
Magically. I was lifted into the sky by my brother.
- Crazy.
- Gesundheit.
No. Fruitcake.
- Are you okay?
- No. That bear. Over there.
- He's crazy.
- I am not crazy.
Whoever said you were?
We understand.
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah.
You see, we're not moose either.
- We're not?
- No.
We're like squirrels. Yeah.
Yeah. Beauty, eh?
Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.
Look at these cuspids.
- Give him a little room.
- Why am I talking to moose?
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.
I'll find it myself.
- I wouldn't go that way.
- Why not, eh?
Well, there was a reason.
- You brought it up.
- I'm trying to...
- So, you think of it yet?
- Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.
Hey. Is the coast clear?
- What?
- Are there any hunters around?
- No.
- Good!
You didn't see the trap?
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
- What?
- You need to get down. Let me help.
Oh, wait.
- Hold still.
- Just... Stop that.
If you just...
- Stop it!
- It's no use.
The only way to get down is to chew your own foot off.
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.
- Okay, here.
- No, I'll do it myself.
Put it back. No, where you found it.
To the left. By the little rock.
- Here?
- Yes.
Okay.
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.
All kinds of trees.
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars, maples, birch trees, willow trees...
My eyes were watering and my tongue was swollen.
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.
See? It's all about using your head.
That was funny. Do it again.
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...
- Salmon run.
- Whatever. But if you can't...
You turn around, walk away, and never come back, ever.
- You swear?
- Yeah.
- Pinkie swear?
- Yeah, sure, fine, pinkie swear.
But this is a human trap and you're just a dumb little bear.
There's no way you're going to be able...
Okay, so I'm thinking we travel by day and sleep by night.
My bedtime is an hour after sunset...
Run!
Yeah, good riddance.
Denahi.
Denahi, you found me.
You wouldn't believe what a nightmare this has been.
Denahi? It's me. Kenai.
Is he gone?
I think he was going...
Hello. I can't breathe.
- Why is he chasing me?
- That's what they do.
- But it's not like him.
- Lucky for him, he didn't find us
'cause when I get in a fight,
I go all crazy and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.
I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing, but I got some moves.
- Really?
- Yep. This first one, well...
It's just a little thing
I like to call "The Slasher."
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death."
- He's coming back.
- Where?
Typical.
Yeah, well, the next time we run into that hunter...
There is no "we."
I'm not taking you to any salmon run.
What? But you pinkie swore.
Yeah, well, things change.
See you, kid.
Wait...
The truth is,
I got separated from my mom.
And now, with this hunter around...
- Kid, I got my own problems.
- Come on. Please.
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish, and every night we watch the lights touch the mountain. Last year...
- Wait, wait. What did you say?
- Lots of bears and fish.
No. You know where the lights touch the earth?
Yeah! The top of the mountain right by the salmon run.
- You're kidding me.
- No, no, they're practically next door.
Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great.
I promise to help you escape from every trap you walk into.
I'm not going to walk into any more...
- Traps.
- Come on. What do you say?
Sure you can take me to where the lights touch the earth?
Yeah, no problem.
- If you slow me down...
- I won't, I promise.
All right, we leave first thing tomorrow.
And keep all that cuddly bear stuff to a minimum, okay, kid?
My name's not "kid." It's Koda.
What's your name?
- Good day.
- How's it going, eh?
Beauty. So we got a lot to get done today. You want to get started?
- Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh?
- Okay.
- Just help me crack this.
- All right.
- You ready now?
- Almost.
Just want to do "dog facing forward."
- Come on.
- Good. Okay.
And go.
This a nice patch here.
Don't go near this patch here.
Something went here.
Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat.
Hey, I've got a mountain to get to.
Come on, kid.
I told you before. My name's Koda.
Say it with me. Ko... Da.
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko-duh?
- Rutt.
- Go away, I'm eating twigs.
- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.
We should start running, like now!
I can't. I'm still digesting. I'll get cramps.
- He's after us!
- Come on, little brother.
Cramp!
If you really want to know how me and my mom got separated...
I was saving this story for the salmon run, but I'll tell you.
It was probably the fifth or sixth most coldest day in my entire life.
- Sounds good. You should save it.
- You think so?
Yeah. For your friends.
- Well, I have this other story.
- Tell you what.
- How about no talking?
- Okay.
- Then I'll sing.
- No, no, no.
Tell everybody I'm on my way
Will you stop it?
New friends and new places to see
Come on, quit it.
Koda, stop singing.
Yes, I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I'm loving every step I take
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
And I can't keep this smile off my face
'Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
No matter what the distance between
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
Oh, it really lifts my heart
So tell them all I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?
With the moon keeping watch over me
Not the snow, not the rain can change my mind
The sun will come out, wait and see
And the feeling of the wind in your face
Can lift your heart, whoa
There's nowhere I would rather be
'Cause I'm on my way now
Well and true
I'm on my way now
Hey, hold on, eh?
Wait up.
- How's it going, bear boy?
- And smallish bear.
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.
- Actually, he's...
- There was this hunter following us.
We was thinking if we could maybe just hang out with you guys.
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.
- If the hunter was going to catch up...
- Then you'd eat him.
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.
You don't think he'll follow those?
- They are quite nice.
- I've got an idea.
Okay, this is really weird.
- I'm driving.
- When can I have a turn?
It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.
Let's get a back seat or something.
I look like you hunted me.
Tell everybody I'm on my way
Hey, come on.
And I just can't wait to be there
Blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way
Nothing but good times to share
So tell everybody I'm on my way
And I just can't wait to be home
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
With nothing but good times to show
I'm on my way
Yes, I'm on my way
Beauty, eh?
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.
I learned that one the hard way.
That reminds me. Last year at the salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.
But I'd heard of a cub who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.
Then he started to float away.
To save him they had to rip off his tongue, so now he hath to talk like thith all the time and...
Do you ever stop talking?
Look. The night rainbow.
- You can see the spirits from here.
- You know about the great spirits?
Yeah, my grandma's up there, and my granddad.
Mom says the spirits make all the magical changes in the world.
Like how the leaves change colour, or the moon changes shapes,
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.
You know, for a change, maybe they could just leave things alone.
- What do you mean?
- My brother's a spirit.
If it wasn't for him, I...
I wouldn't be here.
You have a brother up there?
- What happened to him?
- He was killed by a...
By a monster.
What's your brother's name?
Sitka.
Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.
I always wanted a brother.
So, you want to play "I spy"?
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.
I spy something green.
Tree?
- My turn?
- Yeah.
Okay, I spy something tall.
- Tree.
- Okay.
I spy something with bark.
Tree?
Okay, I spy something...
- A vertical log.
- Tree.
- Okay, I spy something...
- Tree.
- My turn.
- Tree.
- No, I...
- It counts.
- I didn't even spy anything.
- It counts.
Okay. Tree.
Let's play something else.
Koda. Come on.
- Koda, wake up.
- Two more months, Mom.
So, where are we?
Well, which way?
- I think it's that way.
- You think, or you know?
That way?
Why wasn't I turned into a homing pigeon?
- Come on.
- Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.
- Last summer, I was with Bucky...
- Enough with the stories.
I don't care about the time you and Binky found the world's biggest pine cone ever.
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.
Second, it wasn't a pine cone, it was a pine nut.
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.
Our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?
Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.
- Can you swing your leg...
- I can't get off.
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...
I guess we'll just catch up with those guys later, eh?
- Good trip, eh?
- Beauty.
You know, I was thinking now might be a good time for me to drive.
Just relax and enjoy the ride.
Yeah. Okay.
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?
- Even though it's your fault.
- My fault?
That's it.
Just remember, if it weren't for me, you'd be hanging upside down.
Better than being stuck nowhere with you and your blabbering mouth.
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"
- Why don't you just grow up?
- Fine. I'll go on my own then.
- Fine. Go ahead.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Koda?
Those monsters are really scary.
Especially with those sticks.
Come on, let's go.
So, you recognise anything yet?
Or maybe you can't see past my fat head.
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?
Well, if you hunched your shoulders a little it wouldn't seem so big.
You mean like this?
Or like this?
How about this?
Oh, my, that was good.
Maybe they can give us directions.
- That clears up the sinuses.
- Oh, it does.
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.
- Hello, sweetie.
- Yes, she's checking me out, all right.
- Hey, baby.
- No, come on, you nitwit.
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.
You want to go? Bring it on.
- Horns up.
- Hold on.
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?
- What is that?
- Just a minute, bear.
Hey, shut up.
No, you shut up.
Hey, will you shut up?
Just shut up.
Their horns are screwed on too tight.
Wait a second.
- I know this place.
- You do?
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.
We just have to go through here.
What?
Hey, you sure you know where you're going?
Yeah, yeah, follow me.
Koda?
Where are you?
- Don't do that.
- Scared you, didn't I?
There's scared, and then there's surprised.
And you were both.
Nice try. You got a little spit right there.
- Kenai!
- You're not getting me this time.
No, look out.
No.
Come on.
Kenai.
Kenai, where are you?
Left. Left. No, the other left.
Kenai!
No!
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here.
Why do they hate us, Kenai?
- We're bears.
- So?
So, you know how they are.
They're killers.
Wait a minute, who's the killers?
- Bears.
- What? Which bears?
I'm not like that, and you're not like that.
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're okay.
Most bears will look for any excuse to attack a human.
But, Kenai, he attacked us.
You're just a cub.
When you're older, you'll understand.
Fish! Fish! Fish!
We made it. We're here.
- Come on!
- What? Koda.
- Fish! Fish! Fish!
- Hey. Get away from me.
Get away from me. Go on.
Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude.
Yeah, try not to scare off the fish there, buddy.
Tug.
Hey, Koda. Come here.
Look at you.
- Have you seen my mom yet?
- No, as a matter of fact I haven't.
- Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
- He's with you?
Hi.
I've never seen you at the run before.
- Where are you from?
- Well, I...
There's the mountain, just like I promised.
The lights touch the top every night.
Gonna be harder getting up there than riding those mammoths.
- Mammoths?
- Are you kidding?
- That's weird.
- Yeah.
He does weird stuff.
Like the way he drinks water with a leaf.
He never sharpens his claws on a tree.
He's never hibernated before...
Koda. Koda.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.
He's kind ofjumpy, isn't he?
Okay. Okay.
Koda, I...
- I got to get going.
- Well, when you come back...
I won't be coming back.
What? Why not?
Because... Well, it's hard to...
- You're leaving?
- No.
Well, I mean, yes.
Well, it's just that I...
- I don't belong here.
- Don't belong?
Every bear belongs here.
Come on, buddy.
Everyone's invited
Let's have some fun!
This is how we live
We're all here for each other
Happy to give
All we have, we share
And all of us, we care
So come on
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
We're happy giving and taking to the friends we're making
There's nothing we won't do
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our happy-to-be time
This is our festival
You know that best of all
We're here to share it all
There's a bond between us nobody can explain
It's a celebration of life
And seeing friends again
I'd be there for you
I know you'd be there for me, too
- So come on
- Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is our festival
You know, and best of all
We're here to share it all
Remembering love once departed
Someone dear to your heart
Finding love, planning a future
Telling stories and laughing with friends
Precious moments you'll never forget
This has to be the most beautiful
The most peaceful place
I've ever been to
It's nothing like I've ever seen before
When I think how far I've come
I can't believe it
Yet I see it
And then I see family
I see the way we used to be
- Come on
- Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
We're happy giving and taking to the friends that we're making
There's nothing we won't do
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our happy-to-be time
This is our festival
You know, and best of all
You're here to share it
We're here to share it all
All right, settle down, everyone.
Settle down. Hey.
Don't throw your fish bones there.
Somebody could choke on that.
Look, okay, I'll go first.
Okay, let's see. The most interesting thing that happened to me this year.
I know, I know, I know! Listen to this.
It was when I knocked down that tree that was blocking the view from my cave.
Now I got a family of chipmunks staying in my place.
Yeah.
All right, everybody, let me see some paws in the air.
- Who's gonna be next? Come on.
- Tug. I got one.
Watch me. Hey, gotcha.
This year I lost my dear husband Edgar.
Quit telling everyone I'm dead!
Sometimes I can still hear his voice.
I'm getting the next one.
Oh, yeah.
- This is it. I got it. I got...
- I guess it's our turn.
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous...
No, you're gorgeous.
- You're gorgeous-er.
- Get a cave.
If only Edgar was alive...
I told you, woman, I'm right here!
- I love you, buttercup.
- This has got to be it.
- Here you go, Koda.
- You gotta tell it, Kenai.
- What?
- Yes. You caught it, you tell it.
Didn't you play when you were a cub?
Come on, Keno.
Okay, all right already. All right.
- You want to know what I did this year?
- Yes.
I went on the longest, hardest, most exhausting journey I've ever been on with the biggest pain in the neck
I've ever met.
What do you expect from a little brother?
Okay, buddy, your turn.
- Let's hear it, Koda.
- Okay, okay, here we go.
This year I watched my mom in a life-and-death struggle battling the most fiercest creature ever.
- Who's next?
- What?
Wait a minute. I think we all want to hear the rest of that one, Koda.
I thought you might say that. Let's see.
It was probably the fifth or sixth most coldest day in my entire life.
Me and Mom were eating fish, having a great time.
All of a sudden she pushes me into the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.
There's something in the woods running towards us, getting closer and closer.
And then, out of the trees, jumps a hunter.
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.
The monster has her backed up against this giant glacier.
The monster attacks, but Mom's too quick for him.
And before he can do it again, she stands up real big and yells, "Go away."
Kenai.
Mom smells more of them.
There's a whole pack coming right at us.
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.
She runs to stop them before they get to me.
They're all around her, poking her with sticks.
- Sitka.
- The whole thing broke and fell off.
There was ice everywhere.
She couldn't hold her breath any longer, and pow.
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.
- I'm going after the bear.
- Koda?
- Sitka wouldn't want it.
- Sitka's not here because of that monster.
Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.
Can you imagine?
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?
- What happened next?
- Was she okay?
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.
Right after that I met Kenai.
Kenai?
Scared you again, huh?
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?
- You look horrible.
- Koda...
My mom says when you eat too much fish, just lie down.
There's something I...
You know that story you told me last night?
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a story to tell you.
Really? What's it about?
Well, it's kind of about a man, and kind of about a bear.
But mostly it's about a monster.
A monster who did something so bad...
Everywhere I turn I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
I'd do anything within my power
I'd give everything I've got
But the path I seek is hidden from me now
Koda, I did something very wrong.
Brother bear, I let you down
I don't like this story.
You trusted me, believed in me and I let you down
Your mother's not coming.
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone
No. No!
Something will come to take away the pain
There's no way out
Of this dark place
No, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
And I can't face another day
Koda? Koda?
Koda!
Koda, I wish I could...
If there was just some way...
I'd give anything if...
If I could just...
I'm sorry, Koda.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Kenai.
I don't know what I'm doing any more.
I need help.
Sitka.
Look, I am sorry.
If I was driving this never would have happened.
- You never let me do nothing.
- Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go.
I can't believe you totalled a mammoth.
- That mountain came out of nowhere.
- I cannot accept your apology.
- It was in my blind spot...
- Look. It's that little cub.
- Something's bugging him.
- What's wrong, smallish bear?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer.
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.
- From now on, he's my new brother.
- You can't do that.
Sorry, you've been replaced with my dear brother...
What's your name again?
I don't want any more brothers.
- See? He's had enough of you, too.
- I promise I'll change.
Trample off. You won't.
Being a brother means nothing to you.
- Of course it does.
- Like what?
What about when your hooves froze in the pond?
- Who sat with you all winter, eh?
- You did.
Who showed you where the good grazing is?
The really tender stuff all covered in dew.
Now, why do you think I did that, eh?
Because I...
Because I love... dew.
Excuse me?
I don't believe I heard what you said.
I said, "I love dew."
I love dew, too.
Hey, I can change.
- Go away.
- Come on, I can change.
- Go away, don't touch me.
- I can change.
Hey. No.
Not there, that's the spot.
Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear.
Yeah, good day.
You know what this calls for?
A pile of delicious barley and amber weed on a cool bed of malted hops.
I like it.
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?
Sitka?
Please. Please, Sitka.
I don't know what else to do.
Sitka.
Denahi.
Sitka, hurry, change me back.
Where are you, Sitka?
Denahi.
Denahi, please.
Koda.
No!
Leave him alone.
Koda!
Kenai?
Sitka?
Koda, don't be afraid. It's me.
He needs me.
You know, he did look better as a bear.
But, Denahi...
It's all right, Kenai.
No matter what you choose, you'll always be my little brother.
Did I say little?
Kenai.
My brother Kenai went on to live with Koda and the other bears.
He taught me that love is very powerful.
And I passed on the wisdom of his story to our people.
The story of a boy who became a man by becoming a bear.
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other in this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
Brothers all the same
So, like, what are you doing there, smallish bear?
I'm practising my moves.
Want to see one?
Sure. This ought to be good?
Listen to me. I was a man that was changed into a bear.
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.
Yeah, so, before that you was probably like a goat?
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.
No way, eh.
Okay, now, everyone, take a big inhale.
And then on...
On the exhale, shift into salutation to the sun.
No, you shut up.
- How you doing over there, Koda?
- Pretty good.
In accordance with all federal and state wildlife regulations, no fish were harmed during the making of this film.
No! He's gonna eat me!
Cut. Cut.
Somebody, help me.
Help me. Somebody.
Martial law is in effect, under the command of Duke Red.
Abandon your weapons and surrender.
I repeat...
... the coup d'√©tat has failed.
Martial law is in effect, under the command of Duke Red.
Abandon your weapons and surrender.
Ken-ichi!
Hey! Ken-ichi!
Uncle!
You're safe! That's great!
Are you all right?
This? It's nothing!
Who's this?
Her name's Tima.
We escaped from that fire together.
Tima, this is my uncle.
'Uncle'...
Atlas!
It... was... a... trap!
We meet at last.
Don't move!
No trouble.
Give me the girl, and you might get back home alive.
Don't make promises you won't keep, Rock!
Don't play games with me!
Tima! Pick up the gun!
I'll have that back, please.
Don't give it to him!
You going to shoot?
I'm human, you know.
Rock!
So it's these people you've neglected your duties...
...to go chasing after...
Tima!
It's you!
Rock!
What's going on here?!
You told me no one survived the fire in Dr Laughton's lab!
And how did you know about Tima?
Answer me!
I will.
You are the one who must sit on the Throne of Power.
No robot must ever rule...
...the Ziggurat, and Metropolis!
Fool!
'Robot'?
Do you think you fool me?
You're out of line, boy!
Get up!
I never want to see you again!
Ken-ichi!
So it was you who hired Laughton!
What if I did?
I've come from Japan to arrest Laughton.
My name is Shunsaku Ban...
Get in.
And Ken-ichi?
You'll see him later.
I'm here to see
Superintendent Notarlin.
He's been transferred.
His successor hasn't been named.
There's been a mistake. The Malduks have taken my nephew away...
Handle it through your embassy!
At this moment our state extends its reach to the stars!
I tremble at the honor of announcing...
... the culmination of humanity's long history of intellect and science.
Sak√©.
Make it hot.
Hot whisky or gin I can do, for a Japanese detective.
Hot whisky, then.
Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat?!
And those Malduks can eat dogshit!
Here.
Hey! That was Rock!
I heard he quit the party.
What's he doing here?
Thanks.
Take care.
Whoops!
Um...
...a man earlier tonight asked me to give you this.
I said 'no'.
He wanted it kept secret from Duke Red, and of course...
...I said I couldn't possibly, but... his name was 'Ken-ichi'.
'I can't move at the moment, so I can't...
'... come to you.
'I'm leaving the country soon.
'I want to see you again.'
Ken-ichi!
What's going on here?
You will bring her back soon, won't you?
I'll be in real trouble if they ever find out.
Don't worry. This won't take long.
This wasn't my idea.
I have to get back.
You tricked me.
How else could I talk to you?
Where's Ken-ichi?
If you know, take me to him.
Well, well, well...
To talk to you, you'd never guess you were a robot.
I guess Father chose his mad scientist very well.
What are you talking about?
You being a robot.
That's not true. I'm not a robot.
So what are you? Human?
So who's your father? Where is he?
My father...
...is Ken-ichi.
The super-being?
A mannequin like you?!
If you can't take me to Ken-ichi,
I'm going.
Tima's gone?!
Watch where you're going!
Let's see inside this super-being
Father wants so much.
Come on, Laughton!
N- n-notebook...
That notebook?
Don't be alarmed.
I taught Rock a lesson he won't forget.
Where's Ken-ichi?
I'm looking for him, too.
I need your help for that.
You do?
I think they've got him somewhere in the Ziggurat.
I need to look for him...
...on the Ziggurat's data network.
Can you do that?
Hold out your hand.
Ken-ichi!
Well?
Ken-ichi's in...
...that building!
You did it! I knew he was there!
What happened to me?
I see... you don't know who you are, do you.
What do you mean?
I'll report the instant we find anything, sir.
Duke Red?
Yeah.
Anything?
We can track the signal...
...by where it burned out the splitters.
Got it!
Where?
Zone 1, South Block 1 7.
The Hotel Coconut.
Tell me, please! Am I human, or am I...
Well, you're different...
...from normal robots.
I'm human.
Just like Ken-ichi!
Uh, yes... of course you are!
Anyway, now we've got to rescue Ken-ichi.
Tima! I've been looking for you!
Tell me what's going on, or I'll charge you with kidnapping!
I'm not your man.
It's your son you want to talk to.
Huh? Rock?
I don't know what the plan is...
...but I suspect Dr Laughton was involved in it somehow.
And I suspect you had him killed...
...to keep her a secret.
Take him away.
Come on!
That is a special throne made especially for you.
One day from here you will rule the entire world!
Me?
Why?
That is your destiny.
I'll show you.
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Wake up, Ken-ichi!
It's me! Can you hear me?
Ken-ichi... Ken-ichi?
What have you done to him?!
He's in no danger. We just had to quiet him down a little.
Ken-ichi? Ken-ichi?
I'll file a protest with my embassy!
It'll be an international incident!
Oh? I didn't realize you were so politically important.
My apologies.
But soon every nation in the world will bow down before Tima.
Make Ken-ichi the way he was.
What's one or two young kids, Tima?
You have the power to rule the world!
What power is that?
Am I human?
Or am I one of those poor robots?
Oh, don't be silly!
You're nothing like those piles of junk!
Then am I human, like Ken-ichi?
What are you saying?!
You're no mere human being...
...ruled by emotion and feeling, torn between morality and love!
You are the super-being!
So then I am a...
I've brought you new clothes,
Miss Tima.
Yes, you are a robot...
...but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence!
No. I have the emotions and love that you hate.
That's because your full capacities haven't yet taken form.
As your abilities evolve...
...they're simply taking the form of emotion and love.
In time...
You will become one with that throne, a computer weapon meant on conquest!
Your memories and emotions will all be erased!
How did you know that?!
I fancy myself a detective.
Come, Miss Tima.
You should change.
Father... open your eyes!
Rock!
What on earth?!
What are you doing?!
It is you who must sit on that throne.
You are the leader we must bow to!
No!
Tima!
You're awake?
I am a humanoid... a machine made to destroy the world...
Not 'destroy'! 'Make again'!
Stop!
Ken-ichi...
Hey!
Who threw that switch?!
It just started up!
Cut the power!
It won't respond!
It's going into the red!
Dr Ponkotz!
What's that alarm?!
The omotanium generator's going wild!
What's going on!?
I'm not sure...
Stop, Tima!
You'll destroy the Ziggurat!
This comes of trifling with robots.
Her memory's merging with the data network! She'll go mad!
Thus God destroyed the Tower of Babel...
Tima!
No! She's no longer the Tima you knew!
All right.
The omotanium generator will explode if we don't shut it down!
The chance of human survival...
...will fall to 30 per cent within one hour.
My entire world-wide network of forces...
...will be completely activated within 30 minutes.
Their targets are the world's major cities...
...and 7,586 other facilities.
Estimated time period...
...for eradication of humanity by biological warfare:
1 7 hours, 27 minutes.
Hear that, Duke Red?
Your super-being says she doesn't need us!
Tima!
Come back!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Tima!
Tima!
Tima!
Doctor! We've lost control of the underground power pl...
What's happening?!
Get out! You robots are not supposed to be here!
Tima! It's me!
Ken-ichi!
It's Ken-ichi!
Stop!
The likes of you...
...will never kill...
...my father!
Rock!
Tima!
Tima!
Tima! Grab my hand!
I'm Ken-ichi.
Who are you?
'Who are you. '
No, no, no... you call yourself'I'.
Ken-ichi!
Grab on!
I am... who?
Tima!!!
Where did you find this?
Fifi?
Fifi!
Ken-ichi!
Uncle!
Uncle...
...I think I'd like to stay here a bit longer.
I am... who?
{1990}{2052}Come along, faithful viewers,
{2054}{2153}on our journey|through the drain forest
{2154}{2236}as we search|for that very unusable creature,
{2238}{2295}the three-toed sloth.
{2351}{2386}Ah, there he is!
{2388}{2434}Teething with life.
{2436}{2484}Let's get a closer look,|shall we?
{2486}{2521}Oh, no, you don't!
{2523}{2558}Cut! Cut!
{2559}{2606}Don't worry, Chuckie.
{2607}{2699}I'm Nigel Strawberry,|wild aminal expert.
{2738}{2808}And 'cause|I'm an eggsbert, I say,
{2810}{2864}everybody into the truck!
{2914}{2945}Go, go, go.
{2946}{3019}Jump Tommy, jump!
{3021}{3067}Say something, Nigel.
{3069}{3141}I can hear the tiger's|running feets,
{3143}{3192}see his sharp teeths,
{3194}{3272}and oh, oh...|I feel a cool breeze.
{3646}{3690}Crocogator!
{3830}{3883}Not to worry, guys!
{4087}{4159}Oh, no! It's coming back!
{4161}{4200}But that was my onliest|cute toy!
{4202}{4255}Then feed him Phil.
{4257}{4283}I heard that.
{4285}{4322}That way! Through the swamp!
{4426}{4496}Nigel, why are we sinking?
{4498}{4552}Quitsand! I should|have knowed!
{4554}{4598}Guys, hang on to me!
{4817}{4877}What are you diaperbags|screaming about?
{4879}{4911}We're about to get eated
{4913}{4970}by that ferocious|Siferean tiger.
{4971}{5039}Were you pretending|to be Nigel Strawberry
{5041}{5073}again, Tommy?
{5074}{5121}Yeah. He's my hero,
{5122}{5194}and when I grow up,|I want to be just like him.
{5195}{5246}Pickles,|you're no Nigel Strawberry.
{5248}{5312}You're not even a Nigel...
{5314}{5349}...Raspberry!
{5350}{5409}You're never gonna have|real adventures.
{5410}{5497}You're just a backyard baby|with a diaper full of dreams.
{5549}{5604}Wow. She's mean.
{5606}{5674}Now, who wants to go look|for cookies under stuff?
{5675}{5701}I do!
{5703}{5750}Okay, come on.|Follow me.
{5950}{6000}The panthera onca,
{6002}{6081}commonly known as the jaguar,|seems determined
{6083}{6130}to feast on my nether regions.
{6131}{6163}But not to worry.
{6237}{6276}Well, faithful viewers,
{6278}{6339}our journey was|a smashing success.
{6398}{6469}Until next time,|this is Sir Nigel Thornberry
{6470}{6558}of Sir Nigel Thornberry's|Animal World.
{6560}{6606}Back! Back! Back!
{6608}{6667}Why, hello, Scout.
{6669}{6715}Boy, rest your eyes|for a second,
{6717}{6753}at old Thornberry's|gator bait.
{6755}{6781}Hey.
{6811}{6869}Boy, that Sir Nigel gets|in some real scrapes
{6870}{6938}out there in the wild,|but he always manages
{6940}{6998}to wiggle out of trouble|somehow.
{7070}{7106}Oh, and, Jonathan, don't think
{7108}{7164}that just because I'm on|a Luxury Lipschitz Cruise
{7166}{7197}in the South China Seas,
{7199}{7248}I won't be checking messages,
{7250}{7293}E-mailing, and carrier|pigeons on the hour.
{7295}{7353}Honey, I thought we were|going to leave work behind
{7354}{7382}for seven|fun-filled days.
{7384}{7429}Silly, it's|not all work.
{7430}{7478}I've signed up for|every spa treatment
{7481}{7532}culminating in|the Salem Retreat,
{7534}{7581}where you're pressed|between layers of hot rocks
{7583}{7622}and ripe cranberries.
{7624}{7664}Sounds bewitching.
{7666}{7699}But aren't we all|going to be busy
{7701}{7741}with our children?
{7743}{7786}Deed, that's|what the Kidsatorium is for.
{7788}{7834}Each morning|we drop off the pups
{7836}{7860}and head for|the All-Day Breakfast Buffet.
{7933}{7966}I hear they make a mean egg yolk omelet...
{7990}{8018}Ooh!
{8020}{8086}...dipped with five kinds|of sausage.
{8118}{8153}Whoa!
{8207}{8236}We signed up the kids
{8238}{8290}for "Pirate Play|and Pillage" class.
{8292}{8341}It teaches tolerance|for the peg-legged.
{8343}{8407}Well, I'm going to use|the whole seven kid-free days
{8409}{8434}to reshape my physique.
{8437}{8461}Could happen.
{8465}{8510}The Earth was created in six.
{8612}{8639}Everyone all set?
{8640}{8698}I think we all should thank|my husband Stu
{8700}{8754}for arranging this|wonderful getaway.
{8756}{8787}No. You can thank me
{8788}{8818}by having the time|of your lives.
{8860}{8887}Welcome!
{8889}{8947}Bienvenue! Willkommen!
{8948}{8974}Welcome aboard
{8976}{9071}the world-renowned|Dr. Lipschitz Cruise!
{9140}{9195}Stu must have taken Spike
{9196}{9234}for one last potty run.
{9236}{9287}I-I'm sure he'll be right back.
{9289}{9311}He better.
{9313}{9367}He's got all our tickets.
{9369}{9436}That sure is a nice cambera,|Susie.
{9438}{9465}Thanks, Tommy.
{9467}{9495}My mommy got it for me
{9497}{9551}so she can see everything|she's missing.
{9552}{9602}How come|she and your daddy can't come
{9604}{9633}on the cruise with us?
{9635}{9681}Well, my mommy's getting|a special award
{9683}{9738}'cause she 'scovered|a new disease,
{9740}{9775}and my daddy's cutting|the ribbon
{9777}{9815}at the Dummi Bear Theme Park|opening.
{9816}{9853}But I wanted to come|with you guys.
{9855}{9877}And we're
{9879}{9959}so glad you did,|Susie Carmichael.
{9961}{9984}Now, here!
{9986}{10049}Hold the spotlight|on Lounge Singer Cynthia.
{10108}{10186}Dresses and shoes|are the only things
{10188}{10265}That I'll share...
{10268}{10295}That's my rules.
{10296}{10347}Oh! I wonder if it's too late
{10348}{10379}to call my mommy.
{10480}{10518}Hey, The ship's sailing|without us!
{10520}{10541}Wait!
{10580}{10604}Isn't that our ship?
{10606}{10629}Wait!
{10796}{10826}Whoa!
{10858}{10896}Ahoy, mates!
{10898}{10995}Captain Stu at your service!
{10997}{11035}Climb aboard for seven
{11037}{11099}fun-filled days|on the S.S. Nancy.
{11101}{11147}No fancy packaged tour.
{11149}{11174}Just the thrill
{11176}{11242}of the open sea,|the smell of the salt air,
{11244}{11291}and the joy|of close friends
{11292}{11338}and family.
{11340}{11384}Drew, hold the shoes.
{11597}{11675}I'm Queen of the World!
{12004}{12075}Oh, isn't this a great vacation,|guys?
{12077}{12103}As long as
{12105}{12154}the "Queen" doesn't sing...
{12156}{12195}I'm happy.
{12196}{12275}And the bestest part is,|we're all togethers.
{12347}{12435}Ah! This is|just like my bathie.
{12437}{12503}Only there's no|rubber ducky, and...
{12504}{12531}I'm not nakie.
{12532}{12558}There's a ducky.
{12629}{12655}Well, okay.
{12657}{12687}Time to get nakie.
{12689}{12715}Oh.
{12717}{12743}Nakie!
{13014}{13043}I can't believe
{13044}{13101}you did this without|consulting us, Stu.
{13103}{13137}Look at poor Kira.
{13139}{13207}This was supposed|to be our honeymoon.
{13233}{13257}Sorry, Chas.
{13259}{13327}And here I was hoping|you'd be my first mate.
{13328}{13384}Me? Really?
{13386}{13417}Snap out of it, Gilligan.
{13419}{13442}At the next port,
{13444}{13484}we're getting off|this rinky-dink tub,
{13486}{13525}and getting|on the Lipschitz Cruise.
{13629}{13660}Don't you see?
{13662}{13693}If we were
{13695}{13740}on a cruise right now,|we wouldn't be together.
{13742}{13804}We'd be split up|between the pools, the spas,
{13806}{13831}and the mile-long buffets.
{13858}{13925}We're missing|Canadian Bacon Tuesday!
{13927}{13972}Oh, can't this bait|trap go any faster?
{14004}{14030}Hello?
{14032}{14059}Hello?
{14060}{14108}Is anybody there?
{14109}{14187}Welcome passengers|to what I like to call
{14188}{14222}"The Voyage of Your Lifetime!"
{14224}{14255}Everybody, I'm getting a signal.
{14257}{14288}It's from the Lipschitz Cruise.
{14290}{14326}Oh, quick, let|me talk to them.
{14328}{14379}Mom, are you there?
{14380}{14433}We're having a little trouble|with the wild child.
{14435}{14490}Sounds like|a disgruntled passenger.
{14492}{14545}Oh! Hello, Lipschitz.|Charlotte Pickles here.
{14547}{14595}Could you send a rescue boat|right away?
{14597}{14654}We're the squalid little boat|in the middle of the ocean.
{14656}{14686}Mom?
{14688}{14740}My muscles are atrophying|as we speak.
{14742}{14779}Well, we paid|for spa treatments,
{14781}{14803}and I'm not missing one!
{14805}{14832}Hey, we're getting a signal|here.
{14834}{14870}Oh, Dr. Lipschitz,|can you help us?
{14872}{14920}My wife really needs|to see the ship's doctor.
{14922}{14951}Huh? Hang on a sec, Mom.
{14953}{15027}I'm picking up some|lame-o soap opera.
{15029}{15068}What is it this time, Debbie?
{15070}{15086}Okay.
{15089}{15121}I made everyone dinner,
{15123}{15174}so I shouldn't have|to clean up, too,
{15176}{15202}right?
{15204}{15267}Mom, all she did was hand us|a jar of peanut butter.
{15269}{15347}Uh, can we talk about this|when your father and I get home?
{15349}{15391}Yeah. Any E.T.A. on that?
{15393}{15457}'Cause you've been gone|since, like, yesterday.
{15459}{15499}We're still looking|for the leopard at...
{15500}{15523}Oh, Nigel!
{15524}{15556}Over there!|What's that?
{15558}{15605}That's... I see spots!
{15607}{15634}Oh!
{15636}{15706}Watch out for that|limb, dearest.
{15708}{15765}Here, neofelis nebulosa,
{15767}{15813}come to Papa.
{15815}{15875}Hello? I was talking here!
{15877}{15907}Oh, I'm sorry, Debbie.
{15908}{15965}Now you're on your own|for dinner tonight.
{15967}{16020}You know, normal|families
{16023}{16073}eat dinner together|once in a while.
{16075}{16135}Marianne, perhaps|I can lure out the leopard
{16137}{16208}by imitating its mating call.
{16328}{16362}Okay, so we're not normal.
{16364}{16410}But as a teen,|I reserve the right
{16412}{16463}to alternately reject|and embrace my parental units.
{16465}{16512}Consider us embraced.
{16513}{16548}Now, keep an eye on Donnie.
{16552}{16578}It's going to rain,
{16580}{16613}and you know how he likes mud.
{16648}{16672}Over and out.
{16673}{16720}She totally hung up on me.
{16722}{16767}And I was having|a sensitive moment.
{16768}{8470}Debbie, you are|so self-centered.
{16818}{16868}I am not!
{16880}{16930}Okay, what's the monkey saying|about me?
{17039}{16826}Mmm.
{17557}{17592}Oh, that's great.
{17593}{17616}Oh, it's fine!
{17617}{17654}Come on, pups,
{17656}{17706}get underneath.|Come on.
{17935}{17988}Come on, move it, move it,|move it! Down below!
{18121}{18169}Oh!
{18361}{18391}Captain Stu,
{18393}{18427}I can't hold|the wheel.
{18429}{18479}Will you stop calling|him captain?
{18481}{18535}He has no idea|what he's doing!
{18537}{18576}I do so!
{18578}{18615}Does anybody know|where the brakes are
{18617}{18650}on this thing?
{18652}{18707}Jonathan, why aren't you|answering the phone?
{18709}{18764}I need you to divert|a tropical storm.
{18889}{18958}It's a 40-foot wall|of water.
{18960}{19011}We're going to need|a bigger boat.
{19013}{19046}Everyone get below!
{19406}{19429}Phone overboard!
{19433}{19453}Phone overboard!
{19457}{19494}Charlotte, forget the phone!
{19496}{19533}Jonathan!
{20380}{20444}Well, this is how we came in...
{20445}{20467}No!
{20573}{20606}Oh, babies!
{20608}{20640}Oh, Kimi.
{20641}{20670}Chuckie, hold on to me.
{20672}{20728}Why didn't|anybody stop me?
{20729}{20778}Out of my way!
{20876}{20915}Where you going?
{20917}{20942}No, Charlotte!
{20944}{21013}Charlotte, don't.|I-It's a rental.
{21164}{21201}Come on!
{21301}{21344}Right behind you,|boys!
{21456}{21527}If you like to make a call,|please hang up and try again.
{21529}{21579}If you need help, hang up...
{21708}{21764}You're safe!
{21765}{21798}I got it!
{21800}{21859}Dil's binky!
{21861}{21901}Oh, Betty,|thank you.
{21987}{22039}I thought this might|come in handy, too.
{22116}{22175}Abandon ship!
{22405}{22489}I can't help feeling|partially responsible.
{22772}{22906}There's got to be|a morning after
{22908}{23008}If we can hold on|through the night...
{23010}{23054}I know we can.
{23056}{23148}We have a chance|to find the sunshine...
{23150}{23184}Come on!
{23186}{23306}Let's keep on looking|for the light
{23346}{23381}Spike!
{23383}{23405}Here, boy!
{23407}{23437}Spike!
{23439}{23475}Come over here, Spike.
{23530}{23601}Cynthia overboard!
{23602}{23649}Cynthia! No!
{23740}{23790}No, no, no, no.
{23792}{23844}-No, no, no, no.|-There, there, Princess.
{23846}{23892}We've all lost|something today.
{23894}{23988}Why, I lost my cell phone|with 100 free minutes,
{23990}{24040}and Daddy lost|his favorite sun visor,
{24042}{24109}and Uncle Stu lost|all our respect.
{24717}{24760}Cynthia!
{25096}{25139}You guys, wake up!
{25141}{25208}We're at the bacation place.
{25302}{25349}Ah, that was a good nappie.
{25350}{25391}It was just like when Mommy
{25393}{25455}used to rock us to beddie-bye.
{25457}{25552}Well, I likes a bed|that doesn't move.
{25641}{25679}Land ho!
{25681}{25719}Land ho!
{25721}{25792}I'll never set foot|on water again!
{25860}{25883}Where are we?
{25885}{25911}Oh, isn't it obvious?
{25913}{25952}The palm trees, the white sand,
{25954}{25982}the crystal blue water...
{25984}{26049}Why, we've landed|on an island resort.
{26051}{26087}Place looks pretty deserted.
{26089}{26112}Oh, Betty.
{26113}{26157}The best ones always are.
{26159}{26212}Just look for a cabana boy|carrying towels.
{26214}{26243}Hello!
{26245}{26301}I could use a double espresso,|chop-chop.
{26303}{26341}-Chop-chop...|-Don't worry,
{26343}{26369}I've got a map.
{26371}{26424}We'll figure this out.
{26426}{26481}We left here. We capsized here.
{26483}{26532}I know exactly where we are.
{26534}{26598}See? We're on this|tiny little island called...
{26627}{26681}"Uninhabited."
{26683}{26771}You mean we're|the only people here?
{26773}{26817}Well, we'll just have|to get back in the boat
{26819}{26845}and row to another island.
{26847}{26877}One with coffee.
{26879}{26929}Drew, the lifeboat's gone!
{26931}{26951}-Gone?!|-Where'd it go?
{26953}{26978}Look, it's way out there.
{26980}{27046}Wait, ho, ho, oh, great.
{27048}{27070}We're marooned?
{27072}{27113}With no food?
{27115}{27168}How soon before we all|turn cannibal?
{27169}{27198}I have to get|out of here!
{27255}{27327}So, "Swiss Family DeVille"|he's not.
{27501}{27566}Good morning, poodles!
{27568}{27624}We were up all night
{27625}{27659}Iooking for that leopard.
{27661}{27692}Debbie, they're here!
{27693}{27723}Ta da!
{27725}{27817}Homemade coconut muffins|and fresh herbal tea.
{27819}{27854}Debbie, this|is so sweet.
{27856}{27901}Oh, and these|look heavenly.
{27945}{28004}Afraid we must|eat and run.
{28005}{28040}Mmm.
{28041}{28084}Ooh, really|delicious, honey.
{28085}{28126}But you guys|just got here!
{28128}{28168}I know, but the Foundation
{28169}{28212}is expecting that|footage today,
{28213}{28254}and we still|haven't got it.
{28256}{28332}Nigel, I think|we should split up.
{28333}{28366}Dearest!
{28368}{28414}I thought we|were so happy.
{28461}{28497}Oh...
{28499}{28540}You mean to look
{28541}{28596}for the leopard,|don't you?
{28597}{28642}I can't believe this!
{28644}{28695}You're always working.
{28697}{28739}When's the last time|we took a vacation?
{28741}{28808}But, Debbie, we travel|all over the world.
{28809}{28872}I want a family vacation.
{28873}{28948}You know, where we fight over|the bar of hotel soap.
{28949}{28996}And Debbie hogs|all the good towels?
{28997}{29032}And we order|room service.
{29033}{29076}And we do dorky family|activities?
{29077}{29167}Yes! Dorky sounds|really good right now.
{29169}{29216}Well, girls, I'm sorry.
{29217}{29268}I didn't realize|you felt this strongly.
{29269}{29340}I promise, as soon|as we find the leopard,
{29341}{29404}we'll do dorky|family activities.
{29407}{29485}It's settled then.
{29537}{29588}-You're leaving, too?|-Mm-hmm.
{29589}{29625}Fine, go.
{29626}{29676}I was just going to hang out|on the beach today anyway.
{29678}{29727}Debbie, are you forgetting|that I talk to animals?
{29729}{29773}Sadly, no. Your point?
{29775}{29828}I'm going to find out where|that leopard is so we can leave,
{29829}{29879}and maybe we'll|really take a vacation.
{29925}{29955}Come on, Darwin.
{30039}{30084}Darwin's staying here.
{30086}{30108}See ya.
{30173}{30199}Donnie!
{30201}{30259}I did not slave|over a hot oven
{30261}{30285}to feed the birds!
{30390}{30446}When I write about my life--
{30448}{30476}and I will--
{30478}{30543}I will not be kind.
{30700}{30742}Okeydoke, kids.
{30744}{30810}You play here,|while the mommies and daddies
{30812}{30895}try to ward off|the specter of doom.
{31100}{31150}Babies, listen up.
{31152}{31210}We're stucked|on a topical island
{31212}{31266}that don't gots|no people on it.
{31268}{31316}But we're here, Angelica.
{31318}{31358}I mean people who matter.
{31360}{31385}And we gots no food.
{31387}{31414}And no cookies!
{31416}{31456}You don't know what|you're talking about,
{31457}{31486}Angelica.
{31488}{31514}Oh, yeah?
{31516}{31583}I saw a movie 'bout it once.
{31585}{31626}These little kids|were all alone
{31628}{31672}on an island till|they growed up
{31673}{31721}and turned wild.
{31723}{31768}The boy grew a beard|down to his feet,
{31770}{31839}and they had to wear rags|for clothes.
{31865}{31928}That's not the worstest part.
{31951}{31973}This isn't like
{31975}{31998}Our park back home
{32000}{32061}With slides and pools|and swings
{32063}{32088}It's a creepy little island
{32091}{32145}With great big scary things
{32147}{32204}Where mutant lobsters|crawl around
{32206}{32250}Chomping on little kids
{32252}{32300}And water wings can't save you
{32302}{32349}From the slimy,|squishy squids
{32351}{32382}That's why you need
{32384}{32445}A princess--|someone beautiful, hmm?
{32447}{32516}Like me-- to save you|from the scary claws
{32518}{32565}That grab you from the tree
{32567}{32608}So if you don't wanna|end up
{32610}{32654}Being mutant lobster food
{32680}{32717}The keep your Island Princess
{32722}{32778}In a really happy mood
{32780}{32841}That means|no blowing bubbles
{32844}{32900}That means no making smells
{32901}{32937}That means no bugging me
{32939}{33001}To wear my royal shells, ha!
{33003}{32001}Just do the things|I tell you
{33034}{33058}Like bow when I walk by
{33090}{33133}Listen when I speak to you
{33134}{33190}But don't look me in the eye
{33192}{33237}You're not|some lsland Princess
{33238}{33291}There's not a squishy squid
{33293}{33339}There are no mutant lobsters
{33341}{33384}That would ever eat a kid
{33386}{33435}Don't listen to her stories
{33437}{33484}She always misbehaves
{33486}{33533}She's trying to scare|you babies
{33534}{33589}Into being lsland Slaves
{33590}{33693}Why do you always have to be|so good and nice and cheeky?
{33694}{33733}Just face the facts
{33735}{33805}That I'm this|lsland Princess Angeli-tiki
{33806}{33901}So if you don't wanna end up|being mutant lobster food
{33904}{33949}Then keep|your lsland Princess
{33950}{33997}In a really happy mood
{33998}{34053}Keep your lsland Princess
{34054}{34165}In a really happy mood.
{34166}{34210}Y eah!
{34248}{34273}It's obvious.
{34275}{34307}The first thing to do
{34309}{34349}is make a signal fire.
{34350}{34393}You know what else|is obvious?
{34394}{34418}You're an idiot.
{34419}{34466}We have to find|something to eat.
{34468}{34516}All I saved was a couple jars
{34518}{34555}of baby food.
{34557}{34605}I never knew|strained peas and apricots
{34607}{34635}went so well together.
{34637}{34676}Oh, you ate|the baby food?!
{34678}{34706}Babies don't need food.
{34708}{34745}I have to keep my strength up
{34747}{34808}for when you try to throw|me into the soup pot!
{34810}{34835}He's delusional.
{34837}{34868}This is all your fault!
{34870}{34892}My fault?
{34894}{34950}Whose idea was the|Stu Cruise to Doom?
{34951}{34974}Oh, I would expect that
{34975}{35031}from the Finsters|or the DeVilles,
{35033}{35055}but Charlotte!
{35057}{35079}I knew|this day was coming
{35081}{35099}since you were in diapers!
{35102}{35138}I should have never left Paris!
{35485}{35565}This is the Circle of Chaos.
{35566}{35632}If we're going to survive|on this island,
{35634}{35710}we can't ever step foot|in the Circle of Chaos.
{35746}{35827}Wow. I feel|calmer already.
{35890}{35949}We don't know when|we'll get off this island.
{35951}{36004}Until we do,|we're gonna need order.
{36006}{36045}First thing we need is a leader.
{36047}{36079}Any volunteers?
{36115}{36159}Stu, put down your hand.
{36202}{36244}I nominate Betty.
{36246}{36282}I accept.
{36284}{36369}All in favor of me,|raise your hand.
{36371}{36397}Hold on.
{36399}{36438}You're all going|to blindly follow Betty
{36440}{36483}just because|she drew a circle in the sand?
{36485}{36509}Yes!
{36510}{36537}Thank you.
{36539}{36567}As my first duty
{36569}{36595}as your rightfully
{36597}{36676}elected leader,|I'm assigning Stu to baby watch.
{36678}{36722}The rest of|yous, follow me.
{36760}{36844}Geez, all I wanted to do|was have a little adventure.
{36846}{36909}Now everyone and their brother|is blaming me for this mess.
{36989}{37084}Angelica, are the growed-|ups mad at my daddy?
{37086}{37132}That's a blunderstatement.
{37134}{37177}He's in big trouble.
{37178}{37250}It's cause of him we're going|to have to live here forever.
{37252}{37286}Maybe we can help.
{37314}{37374}You babies are|gonna help?
{37376}{37433}You can't keep|your fingers
{37434}{37503}out of your nose.
{37505}{37532}We gots to try, Angelica.
{37594}{37654}Guys, up that hill.
{37656}{37697}I think it's the drainforest,
{37699}{37787}just like we sawed|on Nigel Strawberry's TV show!
{37789}{37858}Does that mean|Nigel Strawberry's here?
{37860}{37932}What makes you think|that big-nosed nature guy's
{37934}{37965}on this dinky island?
{37966}{38031}Because that's the lastest place|we sawed him.
{38033}{38076}He was getting eated|by a crocogator.
{38078}{38107}'Member?
{38109}{38141}Nice knowing you, Chuckie.
{38142}{38174}Phil!
{38176}{38272}I bet if we go in there,|we'll find Nigel Strawberry.
{38274}{38322}He can help us get home!
{38324}{38422}And no one would be mad|at your daddy no more!
{38424}{38510}And I wouldn't have to share|the waffle I gots in my diapie.
{38512}{38541}Philip.
{38542}{38618}Uh, if I had a waffle|in my diapie.
{38770}{38821}See you, Angelica.
{38822}{38877}Hey, get back here.
{38878}{38933}You babies better|listen to me,
{38934}{38961}or else!
{38962}{39020}Or else...
{39022}{39057}I'm going to build a signal fire
{39058}{39109}that will have us|off this island in no time.
{39110}{39148}Uh, let's see.
{39150}{39201}Gum, my special|"writes-upside-down" pen
{39203}{39241}and disposable razor.
{39242}{39309}Great. I can chew, shave,|and write about it.
{39311}{39339}On my head.
{39341}{39395}I can't believe it, Cynthia.
{39397}{39470}Those babies always|do whatever I say!
{39472}{39525}What's all this junk?
{39527}{39556}It's not junk, Angelica.
{39558}{39604}These everyday items can be used
{39606}{39653}to make a lot of things.
{39654}{39707}That's it!
{39709}{39759}I'll build a radio|and send a distress signal!
{39761}{39815}Angelica, keep an eye on|the babies for me, okay?
{39817}{39902}I'm supposed to baby-sit|those half-pipes?
{39904}{39953}That's dog's work!
{39982}{40011}Spike! Wake up!
{40013}{40038}Watch the babies.
{40041}{40084}I got|important things to do,
{40086}{40151}Iike find someone|to be my royal subjects.
{40153}{40193}Now, go!
{40733}{40822}Cynthia, this vacation stinks!
{40824}{40853}I've been walking forever,
{40856}{40927}and no one's come along|to carry me yet!
{40929}{40997}Hey, that bird's got a cupcake!
{40998}{41038}Drop it, beak-head!
{41078}{41110}Ew!
{41368}{41431}There's got to be someone|around here I can boss.
{41573}{41605}Ew! Ah...!
{41606}{41635}Listen up, monkey.
{41637}{41700}All that chimp chatter|really bugs.
{41702}{41790}Just hand over those munchies|and keep painting.
{41819}{41876}Wow! She's got that monkey
{41878}{41944}waiting on her hoof and mouth.
{41946}{42024}Cynthia, I could learn|a lot from that girl.
{42026}{42098}Excuse me, Miss Bossy Lady?
{42126}{42164}Pipe down, monkey.
{42166}{42199}Hey, lady!
{42201}{42240}Who's calling me a lady?
{42242}{42271}I'm a teen!
{42273}{42302}Where did you|come from?
{42304}{42357}This is supposed to be|a deserted island.
{42359}{42423}I'm Angeli-tiki,|the island princess.
{42425}{42457}And I'm thirsty.
{42516}{42576}And I lost my touch|for being bossy,
{42578}{42617}so you got to teach me.
{42618}{42655}No ice cubes|next time.
{42926}{42982}There's the drainforest, guys!
{42983}{43045}Bet we'll find Nigel Strawberry|down there.
{43047}{43092}Now you're talking, Tommy!
{43094}{43139}Wait up! Wait for me!
{43286}{43393}This place is different|than our own backyard
{43394}{43478}I hope we haven't gone too far
{43480}{43586}We're somewheres new|and we haven't a clue
{43588}{43695}I just saw that butterflly|turn blue
{43697}{43779}This is a strange|and mysterious place
{43782}{43884}With lots of yummy buggies|for us to chase
{43886}{44000}We're walking|and we don't know where
{44002}{44098}Ooh-wee,|it's a jungle out here
{44100}{44174}This place is really neat
{44176}{44289}Lots of wormies for us to eat
{44290}{44384}Lots of furry things|everywhere you stare
{44386}{44472}Feels like I got some|in my underwear
{44474}{44555}Monkeys swinging all around
{44557}{44680}I wonder if we're ever going|to get found
{44682}{44771}We're having lots of fun,|hey, look over there...
{44773}{44885}Whoopie! Oh, boy! Yay!
{44887}{44994}Great big snake|hanging from a tree
{44995}{45079}I hopes that it|don't eat up me
{45081}{45169}Fat green lizard|looking me in the eye
{45173}{45281}I sure am glad|that I'm not that fly
{45282}{45383}Prettiful birdies|singing a song, tweet tweet
{45385}{45481}I hope we don't stay here|for long
{45483}{45572}We gots a job to do,|and we're headed up there
{45574}{45673}Look sharp,|it's a jungle out here
{45675}{45782}We gots a job to do,|and we're headed up there
{45783}{45888}Ooh-wee,|it's a jungle out here.
{45958}{46045}Wow! It's got a gazillion feets.
{46047}{46093}Well, down the hatch.
{46094}{46145}Philip, no!
{46146}{46171}Oh, sorry.
{46173}{46204}Want a bite?
{46206}{46275}No! I don't think|we should eat bugs
{46277}{46309}no more.
{46310}{46340}That's crazy talk, Lil.
{46342}{46377}We've been raised on bugs.
{46378}{46410}I know it, Philip,
{46411}{46478}but that's afore I sawed|that poor fly
{46480}{46555}get eated|by that big mean ol' flower.
{46557}{46597}Now, you let him go!
{46779}{46881}If I knowed the last bug I eated|would be the last bug I eated,
{46882}{46995}I would've|eated it slower.
{46997}{47034}Look! Growed-up feetprints!
{47036}{47082}I bet|they're Nigel Strawberry's!
{47083}{47123}Let's go!
{47174}{47256}You know, it's lots easier going|potty in the drainforest
{47258}{47285}than at home.
{47287}{47328}And you don't have to worry
{47330}{47417}'bout getting any on the floor|or the walls or anything.
{47418}{47476}Guys? Uh...
{47478}{47529}Wait up!
{47530}{47583}Uh, uh, guys?
{47585}{47666}Excuse me, I'm looking|for a clouded leopard.
{47667}{47700}Have you seen any around?
{47702}{47748}Sure. There's|one at the...
{47750}{47804}Eliza!
{47913}{47967}You'll never believe|what I just saw!
{47969}{48054}There's a little girl at camp,|and she's a miniature Debbie!
{48056}{48085}In every way.
{48087}{48145}She's bossy, she's loud...
{48146}{48203}she's hideous!
{48205}{48244}Darwin, look!
{48246}{48290}A dog?
{48292}{48321}What's he doing here?
{48322}{48390}Oh, spreading his fleas|on an unsuspecting world.
{48422}{48469}Come on.
{48569}{48611}Hey, hey, hey.
{48613}{48670}Could you give a dog|a little warning?
{48674}{48726}I'm trying|to do my business here.
{48728}{48758}Oh, I'm so sorry.
{48760}{48809}You know, it's funny.
{48811}{48837}For a minute there
{48838}{48894}I thought I actually heard you|talking to me.
{48896}{48930}You talking to me?
{48931}{48970}Are you talking to me?
{48972}{49001}Yeah, I can talk|to animals.
{49002}{49026}It's a long story.
{49028}{49052}Should we come back?
{49054}{49113}Ah, no problem; I'm done.
{49114}{49153}I was just marking.
{49154}{49206}Spike was here!
{49208}{49303}Uh, sorry. I know...|Where are my manners?
{49305}{49336}I am Spike.
{49338}{49436}Full name: Down Spike! Down!|Get Off That Couch!
{49438}{49466}I'm Eliza,
{49468}{49502}and this is Darwin.
{49628}{49707}Spike was here, too.
{49709}{49755}Wow! I've been sneezing all day.
{49757}{49795}My sniffer's on the blink.
{49797}{49833}I can't even smell my own butt.
{49835}{49859}And let me tell you,
{49861}{49889}I've tried.
{49890}{49919}Charmed.
{49921}{49969}Spike,|what are you doing here?
{49970}{50054}Well... I'm...
{50056}{50111}To be honest with you,|I'm looking for my babies.
{50113}{50141}You lost your babies?
{50142}{50201}Probably too busy|drinking from the toilet.
{50202}{50245}I was not! I|was sleeping.
{50247}{50289}That was my|second guess.
{50291}{50349}Hey, hey, smart boy,|you don't get it, okay?
{50352}{50381}This is how it works.
{50383}{50451}Usually they wander off,|I find them, no problem.
{50453}{50498}But I can't smell.
{50499}{50575}I might as well|not even call myself a dog.
{50577}{50610}Don't worry,
{50612}{50638}Spike.
{50640}{50669}We'll help you find them.
{50671}{50717}And I won't tell anyone|you lost them.
{50718}{50779}Really? You really|will help me find them?
{50781}{50862}Thank you!|That is so nice.
{50912}{50986}Wow, you taste pretty good.
{50988}{51021}Animals.
{51054}{51139}Tommy? Phil? Lil?
{51141}{51206}Spike?
{51482}{51526}Aw...

{51709}{51777}This is the way|we wash our clothes
{51778}{51824}Wash our clothes,|wash our clothes
{51826}{51882}This is the way|we wash our clothes
{51884}{51937}So early in the morning.
{52040}{52090}Phil?
{52092}{52120}Lillian!
{52122}{52153}This is not funny!
{52705}{52769}Oh, you're just my 'flection!
{52772}{52813}How ya doin', Chuckie?

{53090}{53122}Hey! Where'd it go?
{53124}{53161}Um, Chuckie?
{53250}{53285}That's not very nice.
{53286}{53317}From now on,
{53318}{53394}I'm not gonna make funny faces|with you no mores!
{53606}{53656}Hey! Who's throwing stuff?
{53766}{53840}My shorts feel kinda big...
{53842}{53902}Aah! Who took my shoeses?
{54474}{54496}Hey!

{54642}{54684}Oh!
{54686}{54780}I don't even look|like Chuckie no mores.
{55333}{55357}Phillip!
{55359}{55413}No! We don't do that no mores!
{55414}{55470}Aw, just one little wormie, Lil!
{55471}{55550}Don't you 'member|how good they used to taste?
{55553}{55610}How they tickled|on the way down?
{55611}{55634}No, I don't!
{55636}{55716}I told you I'm|a vegebelatarian now.
{55747}{55816}We don't eat bugs.|We pet 'em.
{55843}{55904}I don't knows you|anymore, Lil.
{55906}{55934}Do you...
{55938}{55986}do you still like|to eat mud?

{56026}{56062}But you're my twin!
{56063}{56115}Who's gonna 'splain|Mommy's jokes to me
{56128}{56175}or-or help me plant my booger farm?
{56195}{56264}And who's gonna tell me|when my feet smell?
{56448}{56474}Okay, Dil.
{56476}{56503}Do your stuff.
{56536}{55463}Eeew! Tinky!
{56769}{56841}Guys, I haven't seen Chuckie|for a long time.
{56843}{56869}We better go back.
{56871}{56941}You know how scared|Chuckie is of being losted.
{56943}{56980}Chubby!
{57365}{57414}Is everything okay, Chuckie?
{57519}{57644}When did Chuckie|start talking backwards?
{57757}{57784}Not a hair,
{57786}{57834}not a paw print,
{57836}{57871}not even a dropping!
{57873}{57929}Must keep my chin up.
{57931}{57960}I'll find that cat
{57961}{58035}or my name's not|Nigel Archibald Thornberry.
{58037}{58123}I'll find that big-nosed|nature guy,
{58125}{58211}or my name's not Tommy|Awfully Bald Pickles!
{58277}{58300}Donnie?
{58302}{58334}Is that you?
{58460}{58520}Look, it's Nigel Strawberry!
{58522}{58560}We founded him!
{58562}{58629}Great Goodall,|a gaggle of babies!
{58631}{58669}Children!
{58671}{58698}Stay right there!
{58700}{58734}I'm coming down!
{58902}{58967}Not the way I intended.
{59147}{59205}Heavens, what a fall.
{59207}{59283}I must get to those babies.
{59450}{59527}Are you okay,|Mr. Strawberry?
{59529}{59608}She called me "mister!"
{59610}{59638}Silly Billy.
{59640}{59712}I'm only this many years old!
{59713}{59748}Do any of you remember
{59749}{59795}where I left my tricycle?
{59859}{59893}That's one old three-year-old.
{59896}{59954}Uh, no, Mr. Strawberry.
{59956}{60005}We're shipwrecked|on this island.
{60007}{60074}We was hoping you could|help Tommy's daddy.
{60076}{60158}Watch what I can do.
{60189}{60213}Spinning?
{60215}{60245}Tommy,
{60247}{60348}I think Nigel Strawberry's|acting kinda funny.
{60351}{60397}Maybe he's|got diapie rash.
{60398}{60423}Oh, yeah!
{60425}{60488}Wee! Wee!
{60609}{60653}Did you catch|a whiff of anything yet?
{60655}{60735}It's, look, it-it-it,|it's kind of a damp smell
{60737}{60795}that's a cross between|sour milk and poop.
{60797}{60819}Eww!
{60821}{60851}Well,|actually I kind of like it.
{60853}{60884}Sorry, Spike,
{60886}{60949}but everything smells|pretty much the same to me.
{60951}{60983}Ha! Humans.
{60985}{61028}How do you live?
{61030}{61096}And who put|the "poo" in pooch?
{61288}{61320}Whoa.
{61321}{61382}Okay, there you go.|Look at yourself now.
{61384}{61432}All right, you got|a little dog pee on you.
{61433}{61456}Oh, my gosh! You're the..
{61457}{61509}I am Siri,|the clouded leopard.
{61511}{61556}I'm Spike,|the purebred mutt!
{61557}{61591}See these claws?
{61593}{61616}Sniff my butt!
{61617}{61641}Spike,
{61643}{61672}why'd you say that?
{61674}{61706}I was being social.
{61708}{61777}Of course,|a simple handshake wouldn't do.
{61778}{61900}Hey, twitchy, I do not|shake with cats, okay?
{61902}{61977}Now... a small|chimp for breakfast,
{61980}{62013}a mutt for lunch,
{62014}{62073}and a sensible girl|for dinner.
{62075}{62133}Hey, chimpboy,|will you stop worrying?
{62134}{62184}I know all about cats
{62185}{62225}with a capital K.
{62227}{62288}Sit on a windowsill,|hack up a fur ball.
{62289}{62372}Ooh,|that's very ferocious.
{62373}{62428}Spike, this isn't|your regular house cat.
{62430}{62468}They all twitch|their whiskers
{62470}{62545}one whisker at a time,|just like you and me.
{62704}{62748}Don't go and be fooled
{62749}{62815}By those fancy pants
{62817}{62917}It's just|her feline arrogance
{62919}{63020}Flaunting their collars|with tinkly bells
{63022}{63117}She thinks her litter box|don't smell
{63118}{63153}Whoa, hey,|who cut the cheese?
{63157}{63182}Was that you, baby?
{63184}{63222}You may want|to reexamine your diet.
{63224}{63288}Can the old|canine philosophies
{63325}{63424}Why don't you just go|and tend to your fleas
{63425}{63452}Don't push me, mutt
{63453}{63536}I'm just not in the mood
{63539}{63626}You're one swipe away|from becoming cat food
{63628}{63742}Don't go and be fooled|by this crazy cat
{63744}{63840}Don't go and listen|to his crazy facts
{63842}{63939}Not gonna tell you twice,|you better watch your back
{63941}{63999}Don't go and be fooled
{64001}{64112}The big bad cat's|a fur-ball-hacking
{64113}{64171}Rodent-snacking act
{64173}{64216}That's right, an act.
{64246}{64280}You're just a pussycat.
{64283}{64314}You think you're tough?
{64316}{64381}I dare you, Spike,|to call my bluff
{64383}{64417}You're a very scawy puddytat.
{64419}{64482}You're one swipe away|from becoming toast
{64484}{64567}Eliza, get my doggy bag.|I'm about to catch a snack.
{64571}{64629}We can settle this right now,|right here--
{64630}{64694}mano a mano, dogo a cato.
{64696}{64746}Ow!|That has gotta hurt--
{64748}{64790}falling off a cliff|into a sticker bush.
{64792}{64864}Not gonna tell you twice,|you better watch your back
{64866}{64901}Oh! Here I am. Come get me.
{64940}{64970}You think I'm afraid|of your claws?
{64972}{64998}Coochie-coochie-coo.
{65000}{65028}Bombs away, ladies.
{65076}{65109}Come on, me and you.|Come on, let's go right now.
{65111}{65157}I'll rip|that fur coat off ya
{65158}{65193}and wear it,
{65194}{65226}and all my dog friends|will be going,
{65228}{65290}"Spike, where did you get|that skanky cat coat?"
{65415}{65453}You hear what I'm saying, Red?
{65498}{65547}I thought cats|didn't like water.
{65549}{65578}But frankly, Eliza,
{65580}{65620}she did need a bath...|Come on, come on.
{65622}{65652}Oh! Whoa!
{65653}{65686}Aw, what happened?
{65688}{65710}Well,
{65712}{65750}I'm outta here,|I gotta go find my babies.
{65752}{65795}Helpless offspring?
{65797}{65830}Yeah! Yeah!|That's it. That's it.
{65832}{65880}Have you seen 'em?|Little ones, walk on two feet?
{65882}{65927}Last time I saw 'em,|they were on the beach.
{65964}{65986}Walking...
{65988}{66021}stumbling, actually.
{66023}{66053}Two feet?
{66055}{66122}Yeah, they're|my human babies.
{66207}{66242}I thought we were|looking for puppies!
{66244}{66292}No, no. My pups|are home with the wife.
{66294}{66325}She can't travel.
{66327}{66349}Delicate stomach.
{66351}{66385}Me, I could eat anything--
{66387}{66433}shoes, furniture, pencils
{66435}{66457}with the little erasers.
{66459}{66495}I ate one of Chuckie's|diapers one time
{66497}{66522}-Spike...|-and let me tell you...
{66524}{66575}-Spike!|-that is spicy.
{66577}{66647}Spike! We have to find those|babies before Siri does!
{66649}{66674}Come on!
{66715}{66780}When will I think|before I bark?
{66854}{66920}Spike, is that you?
{66922}{66969}Tommy? Kimi?
{66997}{67040}Anybody?!
{67103}{67156}Oh, no, not monkeys!
{67269}{67352}Hey, they're chasing|that little one!
{67354}{67414}That's not very nice.
{67675}{67764}Now, you big monkeys|go 'way.
{67766}{67831}You was little monkeys|yourselfs once...
{67833}{67866}um... probably.
{67868}{67987}So just go away and leave|this little monkey 'lone.
{68017}{68063}Shoo! Shoo!
{68268}{68309}Thanks.
{68360}{68448}Wow! I saveded someone|'stead of someone saving me.
{68477}{68570}I must be a wild boy now.
{68789}{68840}Babies!
{68878}{68913}Tommy!
{68914}{68974}Susie!
{68976}{69047}Oh, my dogness!
{69049}{69111}What if I never feel|their sticky jammy fingers
{69113}{69164}poking in my ears again?
{69166}{69237}What if I never find a floating|diaper in my doggie bowl?
{69239}{69261}What if...
{69263}{69304}Spike! Snap out of it!
{69306}{69350}Right, right, right, right.
{69352}{69382}Not helping. Not helping.
{69384}{69437}Focus, focus, Spike.
{69439}{69475}What does "focus" mean?
{69477}{69500}Right, right.
{69533}{69589}But who's going|to sneak me donuts?
{69591}{69638}Come on, we're almost there.
{69998}{70033}These are much better
{70036}{70092}than the cookies we gots|back at the grass hut,
{70094}{70162}and I don't have to share|with no dumb babies.
{70164}{70235}I mean, um,|dumb baby savages.
{70237}{70274}Tell me about it.
{70301}{70382}I have to share with a pigtailed weirdo,
{70353}{70424}a jungle freak,|and a monkey in a tank top.
{70560}{70585}Uh, refill.
{70608}{70655}Why do I have to get it?
{70667}{70702}You said you|wanted to learn
{70703}{70731}how to be|bossy, right?
{70733}{70770}This is how|you learn.
{70771}{70838}Extra ice, two straws.
{70914}{70990}I would trade the monkey|for her any day.
{70991}{71048}Debbie, come in. Over.
{71050}{71082}Hey, Mom, how's it going?
{71083}{71119}It's not going at all.
{71120}{71153}Have you heard from your father?
{71155}{71209}No, but get this, Mom.
{71211}{71270}Tell me later, honey.|Be back soon.
{71308}{71360}Angeli-tiki is nobody's lackey.
{71491}{71555}Hey, lady!
{71556}{71595}What's that|bubble thing?
{71597}{71625}A bathysphere.
{71627}{71655}It goes underwater.
{71656}{71691}You know,|like a submarine.
{71693}{71737}Getting thirsty here!
{71740}{71808}That girl's|even bossier than me.
{72048}{72073}Those dumb babies
{72076}{72121}are practically|on top of a mountain,
{72123}{72169}and I'm gonna be blamed!
{72172}{72217}I gotta go home|and pretend I'm innocent.
{72219}{72281}Um, Debbie?
{72283}{72313}I just 'membered.
{72315}{72441}I was supposed to be home for,|uh, the lsland Sacrifice.
{72443}{72500}Okay, my mom will drive you|when she gets here.
{72502}{72531}But I have to go now.
{72533}{72560}I'm the princess.
{72562}{72612}Who do you think's|going to throw in the goat?
{72614}{72673}Oh, it's a native thing.
{72676}{72713}Oh, Mom will understand.
{72715}{72778}But I am not waiting around|to watch the goat bite it.
{72875}{72908}Is that a CD player?
{72910}{72954}Yeah, only the best.
{72955}{73044}You know an awful lot|for an "island girl."
{73046}{73147}Um, well, see, a TV|washed up on the beach once
{73149}{73242}and the island king|made the whole tribe watch it.
{73243}{73277}Cool!
{73322}{73344}I love this song!
{73346}{73370}Hey, me, too.
{73556}{73591}Woo!
{73655}{73763}Darling you've got|to let me know
{73765}{73818}Should I stay or should I go
{73866}{73953}If you say that you are mine
{73955}{74031}I'll be here|till the end of time
{74071}{74170}So you've got to let me know
{74171}{74235}Should I stay or should I go?
{74237}{74275}Y ow!
{74277}{74299}It's always tease...
{74301}{74323}Whoa!
{74419}{74429}Whoa!
{74537}{74566}Debbie!
{74567}{74614}Debbie, there's a bunch of|a babies lost around here,
{74615}{74654}and the leopard's after them!
{74655}{74705}I didn't know there was|a leopard out there.
{74707}{74729}I'm gonna be
{74731}{74759}in big trouble.
{74761}{74809}Get back here and|put your seat belt on.
{74871}{74917}C'mon, Cynthia.|We're taking a ride!
{74951}{74983}Angeli-tiki!
{75027}{75060}Oh, man.
{75346}{75384}Twinkle, twinkle
{75386}{75433}Little star...
{75893}{75938}Debbie, what happened?
{75939}{76016}I was taking care of this|island princess and...
{76059}{76112}What's she doing|in the bathysphere?
{76114}{76138}I didn't say
{76139}{76202}I was taking care|of her well.
{76203}{76265}Where are the lights|on this thing?
{76589}{76628}I'm a kangaroo.
{76631}{76683}Hoppity, hoppity, hop.
{76685}{76717}I'm a froggie,
{76719}{76749}and I'm frogging.
{76774}{76854}All this hopping|is making my diapie creep.
{76855}{76898}Ooh...
{76899}{76958}Now I'm|a giant kitty cat,
{76959}{77007}with lots
{77009}{77042}of pointy toothies!
{77095}{77122}Don't worry, guys.
{77124}{77203}Nigel Strawberry plays with|wild aminals all the time.
{77204}{77258}He'll get us|out of this scrape.
{77259}{77293}Does kitty want a mousie?
{77295}{77376}Does kitty want to dress up|in dolly clothes and take a ride
{77378}{77400}in Nanny's pram?
{77465}{77526}Kitty gave me a boo-boo.
{77597}{77645}Nice kitty.
{77804}{77837}Chuckie, be careful!
{77839}{77880}He's so brave.
{77882}{77916}Or dumb.
{78371}{78437}Hey, I been looking|all over for you.
{78439}{78498}I don't like being half nakie.
{78501}{78553}I want my clothses back.
{78623}{78672}Hey, I got sticks in my hair!
{78674}{78705}I gots no shoeses!
{78707}{78755}Oh, ouch, my feet!
{78827}{78849}That's better.
{78851}{78910}Now I can see.
{79639}{79666}Whoa!
{80537}{80597}Look, Mumsy, I'm a whale.
{80647}{80727}You sure he can|really help us, Tommy?
{80731}{80758}Of course, Susie.
{80759}{80822}He's Nigel Strawberry.
{80824}{80933}He's, um, the bestest|nature 'splorer ever.
{80935}{81035}Or... I thought he was.
{81036}{81100}Guess we're stucked here|till somebody finds us.
{81102}{81147}Who's going to find us in here?
{81149}{81183}I know what'll cheer
{81184}{81225}everybody up.
{81227}{81271}A nice waffle.
{81272}{81341}It's kind of crusty.
{81343}{81421}You sure you don't gots|any mable syrup in there?
{81423}{81488}Nope.|But I got some ketchup.
{81490}{81528}Watch this one.
{81571}{81588}What 'dat?
{81590}{81619}What 'dat?!
{81663}{81757}Maybe TV people are only|good at doing stuffs on TV.
{81759}{81853}Well, I guess we'll be living|on this island from now on.
{81855}{81886}That means...
{81887}{81987}I might not see my family|again for a long time.
{82044}{82094}Uh, you gonna eat|that waffle?
{82097}{82161}Shh, Phillip. Susie's sad.
{82163}{82198}I'm sad, too.
{82200}{82252}I want my mommy and daddy.
{82254}{82295}Me, too.
{82348}{82378}I'm sorry, guys.
{82379}{82430}I never shoulda|broughted you here.
{82433}{82475}Angelica was right.
{82477}{82614}I am just a backyard baby|with a diapie full of dreams.
{82676}{82726}No, you're not.
{82727}{82836}Tommy, you took us through|the drainforest all by yourself!
{82838}{82910}And led us up|the side of the mountain.
{82913}{82980}And you founded|Nigel Strawberry.
{82982}{83045}And you saved me from|the giant kitty cat.
{83047}{83089}Oh, you got lots more
{83091}{83147}than dreams|in your diapie, Tommy.
{83210}{83246}Thanks, guys.
{83248}{83329}That's the nicest stuff|anyone's ever said.
{83331}{83392}So, hey, even though|we're stucked in a cave
{83394}{83520}and there isn't any boat|and we can't swim,
{83522}{83599}I still promise|to get you out of here!
{83640}{83723}It's like my hero Nigel|Strawberry always says...
{83725}{83771}The Martians|have landed!
{83773}{83809}Um, no.
{83811}{83855}I was thinking|'bout when he says,
{83856}{83896}"Don't give up hope,
{83898}{83922}fateful viewers!"
{83999}{84040}Ahoy, babies!
{84042}{84125}Now who's your princess?
{84127}{84155}Yay! Let's go!
{84157}{84217}We're saved!
{84272}{84324}Drew, there's no longer|a ringing in my ears
{84327}{84396}from constant|cell-phone usage.
{84398}{84429}Oh, isn't this paradise?
{84431}{84464}Sure is, honey!
{84466}{84501}Whoa! Honey!
{84503}{84567}Didi, you think|this is done?
{84569}{84642}I've never cooked a fish|with its head still on.
{84644}{84679}Well, let me see.
{84681}{84706}Does it flake|when...
{84742}{84778}My fish!
{84831}{84870}Who's that|little cannibal boy?
{84871}{84902}Those look an awful lot
{84903}{84947}Iike Chuckie's|sneakers.
{84950}{85004}You ate the fish and Chuckie!
{85006}{85025}Come on, guys!
{85027}{85045}After him!
{85157}{85180}Whoa!
{85182}{85206}Hey, whoa-oh...
{85207}{85243}He's getting away!
{85447}{85527}Well, it's not a|clouded leopard,
{85528}{85566}but at least I'll have film|of something.
{85592}{85622}Donnie!
{85695}{85718}What?
{85720}{85776}This is supposed to be|a deserted island.
{85778}{85846}Oh, thank heavens!
{85847}{85900}We're part of an elaborate|television stunt
{85902}{85934}designed to humiliate us.
{85935}{85979}Who are you?
{86033}{86070}Hold it.
{86072}{86146}My name is Marianne Thornberry.
{86148}{86195}From the nature show?
{86198}{86222}We're shipwrecked.
{86224}{86252}Can you help us, Marianne?
{86254}{86287}Of course. Our|camp is nearby.
{86288}{86314}Debbie, come in.
{86316}{86368}Oh, Mom. What's up?
{86370}{86403}I need you to|bring the Comvee
{86404}{86439}over to the east beach.
{86440}{86487}Uh, that may be a problem.
{86488}{86525}Don't worry about|cleaning up.
{86527}{86586}Oh, thanks,|but that's not the problem.
{86587}{86623}Just get here. Now.
{86624}{86659}My daughter will bring|our trailer
{86660}{86702}and my husband|will be along soon and...
{86703}{86766}Behold, fellow islanders!
{86768}{86871}I, Stu Pickles,|have built us a radio!
{86873}{86928}Stu, who's watching the kids?
{86930}{86973}Oh, Angelica said she'd take|care of them.
{87091}{87130}Chuckie!
{87131}{87174}Oh, this is very strange.
{87175}{87221}I feel like this|has happened before.
{87328}{87354}Look at them...
{87356}{87394}chasing their own tails.
{87398}{87450}If only I could tell them|that it doesn't work.
{87452}{87483}I know, I've done it.
{87484}{87531}I've chased my tail|a million times.
{87532}{87582}It does not work.
{87584}{87639}It's getting a signal!
{87640}{87678}I'm very impressed.
{87680}{87716}Oh, Stu's an inventor.
{87718}{87770}Runs an ad in the shop-and-buy.
{87803}{87862}Girls, have you seen|some children?
{87863}{87889}Just a bossy 3-year-old
{87891}{87945}who has delusions|of being a princess.
{87948}{87986}-Angelica!|-I'm the boss
{87988}{88021}-of this bathie thing.|-That's her!
{88023}{88057}We haven't moved a bit,|Angelica.
{88059}{88083}That's Susie.
{88085}{88150}She must have turned on|the radio in the bathysphere.
{88151}{88209}A 3-year-old's driving|the bathysphere?!
{88211}{88236}What the heck?
{88314}{88366}Hey, it's no problem.
{88367}{88418}We can track them by|radar from the Comvee.
{88420}{88473}Uh... yeah. Except...
{88475}{88543}I sunk the Comvee.
{88544}{88571}You what?!
{88683}{88741}I'm beginning to think you|tooked this scrubmarine
{88743}{88777}without permission,|Angelica.
{88779}{88866}Oh, you think you're such|a know-it-all, Carmichael.
{88868}{88895}Now, here's the right button.
{88930}{88975}You need this to drive.
{88977}{89001}Mm-hmm.
{89003}{89038}Now, here's|the other right button.
{89671}{89711}Oh, I can't get a signal.
{89713}{89763}We've got to try to reach them|on your coconut.
{89765}{89808}Uh-uh, Carmichael.
{89810}{89843}Hello. Calling Angelica.
{89845}{89894}She really did give me|cream soda.
{89896}{89924}Angelica, Susie.|Can you hear me?
{89926}{89963}You didn't have permission,|Angelica!
{89965}{89990}Angelica!
{89992}{90059}Stop fighting this instant|and listen to your father!
{90061}{90083}...accessory!
{90085}{90146}Sorry, Mommy.
{90147}{90187}Our mommies and daddies!
{90189}{90227}Daddy, tell Susie|to stop bothering me
{90229}{90264}while I'm trying to drive|a scrubmarine!
{90266}{90307}Give me that, Angelica.
{90498}{90526}Hiya!
{90683}{90713}What's this?
{90724}{90765}A new toy?
{90816}{90872}Kippers!
{90873}{90907}I'm the happiest lad|in all of England!
{90975}{91023}Listen, Angeli-tiki.|It's me, Debbie.
{91015}{91037}Let me talk to my Dad.
{91041}{91063}Hey, mister!
{91066}{91121}Stop eating those smelly|fish and talk to the teen.
{91122}{91175}This little fishie|goes to market.
{91177}{91205}Yuk!
{91207}{91239}This little fishie stays home.
{91241}{91293}Great. Dad finally lost it.
{91295}{91321}Something's wrong with Nigel.
{91323}{91370}Girls, this is Mrs.Thornberry.
{91371}{91416}Do you see a red handle?
{91418}{91464}I see it!
{91466}{91493}I need you to push that up.
{91495}{91536}That will bring you|up to the surface.
{91538}{91576}Drooly,|don't touch that!
{91986}{92028}Oh, no, Nigel Strawberry!
{92030}{92092}This calls|for my 'mergency bottle.
{92378}{92429}Hello there.
{92431}{92496}Well, what have we here?
{92498}{92564}Who are all you positively|adorable children?
{92566}{92598}Huh?
{92599}{92634}We're shipwrecked.
{92635}{92700}We went all over the island|looking for you.
{92702}{92734}I saved them,|but then Carmichael
{92736}{92777}tried to drive this|tub-boat and now...
{92779}{92829}We just want to go home.
{92831}{92886}Well, of course|you do, young lady.
{92887}{92935}And so we shall.
{92961}{93006}Hmm. Bit of a pickle.
{93007}{93038}No fuel left.
{93039}{93086}The radar appears|to be knocked out,
{93087}{93134}which means I have|no idea where we are
{93135}{93197}and we're almost|out of oxygen.
{93199}{93225}I'm bored.
{93227}{93282}Yes, and there's that, too.
{93283}{93309}Angeli-tiki, come in!
{93311}{93334}What's going on down there?!
{93335}{93358}Deborah?
{93359}{93402}Is that you?
{93403}{93467}Dad! You're back to normal!
{93469}{93502}Well, Dad-normal anyway.
{93503}{93552}Oh, Nigel,|thank goodness you're all right.
{93554}{93586}Can you bring her|to the surface?
{93587}{93658}Impossible at the moment,|dearest.
{93659}{93689}You'll have to engage
{93691}{93744}the automatic-retrieval system|in the Comvee.
{93746}{93802}And I don't want|to alarm anyone,
{93803}{93848}but we're a tad low|on oxygen down here.
{93850}{93901}Copy that.
{93903}{93936}We'll get you as soon as we can.
{93938}{93962}Over and out.
{93964}{94025}Okay, we have to raise|the Comvee.
{94458}{94504}No go.
{94506}{94540}The pump's destroyed
{94542}{94607}and there's a huge|rip in the pontoon.
{94634}{94656}What, it's ripped?
{94658}{94684}Hang on.
{94687}{94753}The professor's getting|an idea.
{94918}{95022}How about a little song|to lift our spirits?
{95074}{95145}Old MacDonald had a farm
{95146}{95208}E-l-E-l-O
{95210}{95312}And on his farm|he had a ring-tailed lemur
{95314}{95373}E-l-E-l-O
{95375}{95414}With a guttural roar here
{95416}{95466}And a throaty rumble|there...
{95468}{95511}Okay, here's the plan.
{95513}{95582}We'll transfer force from|the bi-pedal energy generator.
{95584}{95642}to the dual reduction chamber.
{95645}{95707}The resulting compressed|atmospheric matrix
{95709}{95758}will transverse the tubular|transport mechanisms,
{95760}{95810}which you gentlemen will connect|to the deflated pontoon.
{95814}{95867}This will increase|the displacement coefficient
{95869}{95909}of the Comvee and it will rise
{95910}{95973}aided by a fulcrum-driven|counter balance
{95975}{96022}weighted with coconuts.
{96023}{96049}Let's do it!
{96098}{96126}It's perfect, but...
{96128}{96213}how are we going to inflate|a pontoon with a hole in it?
{96214}{96242}Oh, no.
{96244}{96269}What do we do now?
{96270}{96294}What's going on?
{96296}{96331}We can't raise|the Comvee.
{96333}{96374}We need something|to patch it.
{96376}{96406}Eliza!
{96408}{96441}There's a rafty thingy|out there.
{96442}{96469}Can we use that?
{96470}{96493}It's perfect!
{96494}{96525}She found your boat, Spike.
{96526}{96570}They can use it to|patch the Comvee.
{96571}{96594}I'll get it!
{96595}{96618}Spike, no!
{96619}{96644}The waves are too big!
{96646}{96739}Hey, this is Spike|you're talking to.
{96741}{96822}I've paddled my way to more|tennis balls than I can count!
{96886}{96947}If I could count.
{96973}{97007}But I'm afraid|you won't make it!
{97009}{97037}Sure I will!
{97038}{97113}And if I don't,|well, no one's going to say
{97114}{97202}that ol' Down Spike|didn't try his best.
{97274}{97356}You only go around once|in this crazy, mixed-up life.
{97434}{97465}Well, not cats.
{97466}{97497}They get nine lives
{97498}{97553}while dogs have to cram|seven years into one.
{97554}{97593}Now that bites!
{97810}{97871}That a boy, Spike.
{97874}{97918}Good boy, Spike.
{98245}{98290}Look! It's Spike!
{98384}{98415}Ooh, nice save, dog.
{98417}{98460}Good boy, Spike.
{98523}{98598}But what are we going|to use for glue?
{98633}{98662}I'll take care of it.
{98741}{98787}That gum won't stay|sticky for long.
{98789}{98843}-Places!|-Let's go.
{98869}{98892}Debbie?
{98918}{98943}Don't worry, Mom.
{98945}{98977}I'm on it.
{99391}{99428}Got it!
{99430}{99456}Pedal!
{99875}{99914}It's working!
{100305}{100351}And on his farm
{100353}{100460}He had a oceanospirillum|multiglouliferum
{100462}{100532}E-l-E-l-O.
{100636}{100721}Can we go home now,|Mr. Strawberry?
{101191}{101227}We've got 'em!
{101229}{101266}Now let's reel 'em in.
{101359}{101389}Nigel,
{101390}{101429}is everybody okay down there?
{101431}{101469}Excellent, dearest.
{101472}{101525}Well, one little girl is|rather pouty
{101526}{101622}and somebody needs a diaper|change-- I won't say whom.
{101720}{101767}Smashing!
{101769}{101825}Why, it's the architeuthis,
{101826}{101888}commonly known|as the giant squid.
{101999}{102073}Isn't she magnificent?
{102074}{102142}If only I had a camera...
{102144}{102204}Here,|Mr. Strawberry...
{102206}{102236}60 feet long
{102238}{102301}and two tons of boneless flesh.
{102420}{102452}Oh, your picture
{102454}{102500}didn't come out.
{102502}{102567}Well, that's probably|as it should be.
{102569}{102623}You see, children,|the giant squid
{102625}{102692}has never been seen alive|before.
{102694}{102809}I suppose this marvel of nature|will be our little secret.
{102810}{102850}What do you say?
{102942}{102988}Couldn't have said it|better myself.
{103365}{103398}Here I am!
{103496}{103566}-Mommy!|-Daddy!
{103600}{103636}Dil!
{103638}{103665}Susie!
{103666}{103700}Where's Tommy?
{103730}{103790}And who does this little chap|belong to?
{103847}{103880}He's ours.
{104146}{104192}Come here, champ.
{104217}{104246}Honey,
{104248}{104301}I'd like you|to meet Stu Pickles.
{104302}{104390}He made the coconut radio|that saved your lives.
{104392}{104428}Terribly grateful,|Mr. Pickles.
{104477}{104529}I have a feeling|I wouldn't be here
{104530}{104562}without this|little chap, either.
{104718}{104742}Pickles!
{104774}{104826}You might grow up
{104829}{104903}to be just like|Nigel Strawberry after all.
{104905}{104944}Thanks, Angelica.
{104946}{105050}But I think I'll grow up|to be just like my daddy.
{105052}{105093}Well, bro, I got|to hand it to you...
{105095}{105125}I'm so proud of you, Stu.
{105127}{105203}Oh, Nigel,|I was so worried.
{105205}{105257}I confess, I was, too.
{105260}{105324}I hated the thought|of our last family meal
{105326}{105418}being shortchanged because|we had to go find a leopard.
{105457}{105502}Your father's right.
{105503}{105559}We lost sight|of what's important--

[Music playing]
NARRATOR:
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful
[Creaking] the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
And the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint
Fire!
[All gasping]
Aah!
Like a Candarian zap-wing overtaking its prey--
[Door creaks]
WOMAN:
James Pleiades Hawkins l thought you were asleep an hour ago. l thought you were asleep an hour ago.
Mom, I was just getting to the best part.
Please?
Oh, can those eyes get any bigger?
Scootch over.
NARRATOR: like a Candarian zap-wing overtaking its prey
Flint and his band of renegades swooped in out of nowhere
[Jingling]
Ha ha ha ha!
And then. gathering up their spoils vanished without a trace
-Ooh!
-Ooh!
NARRATOR: Flint's secret trove was never found but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the farthest reaches of the galaxy stowed with riches beyond imagination-- the loot of a thousand worlds
JIM AND NARRATOR:
Treasure Planet
OK. Blow your nose.
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace? l have no idea.
Come here, you, you li--
I'm gonna get--oh!
[Pffft]
[Giggling]
OK, now it's time for this little spacer to go to sleep.
You think somebody'll ever find Treasure Planet?
Sweetheart,
I think it's more... like a legend.
I know it's real.
You win. It's real.
-Nighty-night, Mom.
-Nighty-night, sweetheart. l love you.
Love you, too.
[Rustling]
[Rustling]
NARRATOR: There are nights when the winds of the Etherium so inviting in their promise of flight and freedom made one's spirit soar!
[Buzzing]
Yaaaa-hoo!
[Alarm rings]
Whoo!
Come on!
Whoo! Ha ha ha!
Whoo-hoo!
[Sirens blaring]
Oh, great.
[Thunder]
Mrs Hawkins!
I know-- refill on the purp juice.
Coming right up,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.
There we go. That's four powdered spheroids... two lunar eclipses, and it's a big bowl... of Zorellian jelly worms for the big boy!
-Awesome!
-Enjoy.
Sorry, Delbert. It's been a madhouse here all morning.
No problem, Sarah.
Ah! My Alponian chowder with the extra solara seed.
Mmm! Yum!
[Sniffing]
Hello.
DOPPLER:
What brings you here curious little one?
Go away.
Are your parents around?
What's the matter?
Cat got your--yaah!
[Gulp]
Oh, they're so adorable at that age.
Oh, yes...deplorable.
Uh...adorable! Hmm.
Speaking of which, how's Jim doing?
Much better. I know he had some rough spots... earlier this year, but I really think... that he's starting to turn a corner.
Mrs. Hawkins?
Jim! [Drops dishes]
Ooh...wrong turn.
OK. Thanks for the lift, guys.
Not so fast.
We apprehended your son operating... a solar vehicle in a restricted area.
Moving violation 9-0-4... section fifteen, paragraph, um...
Six?
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.
-Jim!
-As you are aware, ma'am... this constitutes a violation of his probation.
Yes, yes. No, I understand.
Um, but could we just--
DOPPLER:
Um. ahem. pardon me
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.
I am the noted astrophysicist
Dr. Delbert Doppler.
Perhaps you've heard of me.
No? Uh, I have a clipping.
-Are you the boy's father?
-Oh! Good heavens, no!
Eww! He's just an old friend of the family.
Back off, sir!
Thank you, Delbert. l will take it from here.
Well, Sarah, if you insist.
Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again.
Due to repeated violations of statute 1 5-C... we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result... in a one-way ticket to Juvenile Hall.
-Kiddie hoosegow.
-The slammo.
Thank you, officers.
It won't happen again.
We see his type all the time, ma'am.
-Wrong choices.
-Dead-enders.
Losers
-You take care now.
-Let's motor.
[Conversations resume]
Jim, I have had it.
Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? ls that it?
SARAH: Jim?
Jim, look at me.
It's been hard enough keeping this place... afloat by myself without you going--
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.
Those cops just won't get off my--
Forget it.
MRS DUNWIDDIE:
Mrs Hawkins! My juice!
Yes, I'll be right there,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.
Jim, I just don't want to see you... throw away your entire future.
Yeah, what future?
[Thunder]
[Clang]
DR DOPPLER: I really don't know how you manage it. Sarah
Trying to run a business while raising a felon like-- felon...fellow... fellow like Jim.
Managing it?
I'm at the end of my rope.
Ever since his father left well. Jim's just never recovered
And you know how smart he is
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!
And yet. he's failing at school he is constantly in trouble and when I talk to him. he's like a stranger to me
I don't know. Delbet
I've tried everything--
[Engines sputtering]
Hey, Mister?
Mister, you're OK in there, right?
[Growling]
Aah!
[Coughing]
He's a-comin'.
Can you hear him?
Those gears and gyros clickin' and whirrin'... like the devil himself!
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn't ya?
He's after me chest... that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.
[Straining]
But they'll have to pry it... from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore I--argh!
[Coughing]
Oh, my--
Uh, come on, give me your arm.
That's it.
-Good lad.
-Mom's gonna love this.
[Click]
Thanks for listening, Delbert.
[Sighs] It helps.
It's going to be OK.
You'll see. l keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door... and there he'll be just the way he was.
A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet... and begging me to let him keep it.
[Thunder]
[Gasps] James Pleiades Hawkins!
Mom, he's hurt...bad!
Me chest, lad.
[Gasping]
[Groans]
BILLY BONES:
He'll be comin' soon
Can't let them find this.
Who's coming?
[Whispering] The cyborg!
Beware the cyborg! [Gasps]
Ohh!
[Rumbling]
[Sarah gasps]
Quick! We gotta go!
-Ohh!
-Aah!
I believe I'm with Jim on this one!
[Pirates shouting]
Delilah! Hallelujah!
[Yelping excitedly]
Stay! Don't move!
PIRATE: Where is it?!
Find it!
DOPPLER:
Don't worry. Sarah
I'm an expert in the laws of physical science.
-On the count of three--one...
-Three!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Go, Delilah! Go!
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!
Hyah! Hyah!
[Crickets chirping]
[Crickets chirping]
DOPPLER: I just spoke with the constabulary
Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace
[Clock chimes]
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn has burned to the ground.
Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble... over that odd little sphere.
Those markings baffle me
Unlike anything
I've ever encountered
[Beeps, whirring]
DOPPLER: Even with my vast experience and superior intellect it would take me years to unlock its--hey!
[Gasps]
DOPPLER: Why, it's a map!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
This is us, the planet Montressor.
[Gasps]
That's the Magellanic Cloud!
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!
Oh!
DOPPLER:
That's the Cygnus Cross and that's the Kerian Abyss.
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it--it's...
Treasure Planet.
No!
That's Treasure Planet!
DOPPLER: Flint's trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?
You know what this means?
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.
Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place... atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience--
[Click]
Whoo! What just happened?
Mom, this is it. This is the answer to all our problems.
Jim, there is absolutely no way--
Don't you remember, all those stories?
That's all they were--stories!
With that treasure... we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!
Well, this is-- it's just--oh, my.
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?
It's totally preposterous... traversing the entire galaxy alone.
SARAH: Now at last, we hear some sense!
-That's why I'm going with you.
-Delbert!
I'll use my savings to finance the expedition.
I'll commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.
You're not serious.
All my life I've been waiting for an opportunity like this... and here it is screaming,
''Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!''
OK. OK! You're both grounded!
[Sighs]
JIM: Mom. look l know that I keep messing everything up... and I know... that I let you down.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.
I'm gonna set things right.
Sarah?
If I may?
You said yourself, you've tried everything.
There are much worse remedies... than a few character-building months in space.
Are you saying this because it's the right thing... or because you really want to go? l really, really, really, really want to go... and it's the right thing.
[Sighs]
Jim... l don't want to lose you.
Mom...you won't.
I'll make you proud.
DOPPLER: Well. uh. ahem
There we are then.
We'll begin preparations at once.
We'll begin preparations at once.
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be off to the spaceport.
[Whoosh]
[Squawking]
[Squawking]
[Creatures speaking alien languages]
DOPPLER:
Jim! Oh. Jim! Wait for me!
[Clanking]
[Breathing deeply]
Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity... for the two of us to get to know one another.
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um... well, contempt, but, in our case--
Look, let's just find the ship. OK?
[Clank]
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.
Hey, thanks.
It's the suit, isn't it? l should never have listened... to that pushy two-headed saleswoman.
This one said it fit, that one said it was my color. l didn't know what to do. l get so flustered. Ooh!
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!
Whoa!
OFFICER:
Stow those casks forward!
Heave together now!
How cool is this?
[Squishing noise]
Sorry about that. l didn't mean--
[Angry farting noises]
Allow me to handle this.
[Pfft pffft pffft]
[Eek eek eek eek]
[Poit]
[Chuckling]
[Eek pfft]
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.
Took two years of it in high school.
[Pffft]
Flatula? Cool.
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?
Shipshape it is, sir, but I'm not the captain.
The captain's aloft.
[Meow]
Mr. Arrow, I've checked this miserable ship... from stem to stern, and, as usual, it's...spot on.
Can you get nothing wrong?
You flatter me, Captain.
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?
Uh, um, yes. l--
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
If I may, Doctor, this works so much better... when it's right-way up and plugged in.
-Ooh!
-Lovely. There you go.
If you don't mind, l can manage my own plugging!
I'm Captain Amelia... late of a few run-ins with the Protean armada.
Nasty business, but I won't bore you with my scars.
You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.
Please, Captain.
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know l don't mean a word of it.
Ahem, excuse me. I hate to interrupt this lovely banter... but may I introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?
Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure--
Doctor, please!
[Growls]
I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map... in front of this particular crew... demonstrates a level of ineptitude... that borders on the imbecilic... and I mean that in a very caring way.
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've--
May I see the map, please?
Here.
Hmm. Fascinating.
Mr. Hawkins, in the future... you will address me as ''Captain'' or ''Ma'am.'' ls that clear?
Ugh...
Mr. Hawkins?
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key... when not in use.
And, Doctor, again... with the greatest possible respect... zip your howling screamer.
Captain, I assure you l--
Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible. l don't much care for this crew you hired.
They're...how did l describe them, Arrow? l said something rather good this morning before coffee.
''A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots,'' ma'am.
-There you go--poetry.
-Now, see here--
Doctor, I'd love to chat-- tea, cake, the whole shebang-- but I have a ship to launch... and you've got your outfit to buff up.
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes... down to the galley straightaway.
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.
What? The cook?
That woman! That...feline!
Who does she think is working for whom?
It's my map, and she's got me bussin' tables?
I'll not tolerate a cross word about our captain!
There's no finer officer in this or any galaxy.
[Whistling]
ARROW: Mr Silver?
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
Bringin' in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley.
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.
Heh heh heh heh!
A cyborg!
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?
The financier of our voyage.
Love the outfit, Doc.
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
Jimbo! Uh...
Aw, now, don't be too put off by this hunk of hardware.
[Humming]
Whoa!
These gears have been tough getting used to... but they do come in mighty handy from time to time.
[Humming]
Mmm!
Here, now, have a taste of me famous bonzabeast stew.
[Sniffing]
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
SILVER: Old family recipe
Aah! ln fact, that was part of the old family!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, ho! I'm just kiddin', Doc!
Uh, yeah, well...
I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
[Giggling]
SILVER: Morph!
You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
So that's where you was hiding!
[Chattering]
[Belch]
Wha--? Ha!
What is that thing?
''What is that thing?''
SILVER: He's a morph
I rescued the little shape-shifter on Proteus 1
[Cooing]
Aw, he took a shine to me.
We been together ever since.
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
We're about to get underway.
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?
Would l?
Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets?
I'll follow you.
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.
[Cough]
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but--
Captain's orders! See to it the new cabin boy's kept busy.
-Aw, but, no, but--
-No, you can't--
[Both sigh]
So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
Whatever.
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?
Yeah.
You know...these purps... they're kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.
You ever been there? l can't say as I have, Jimbo.
Come to think of it, just before I left... l met this old guy, who was, um... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his. ls that so?
Yeah.
What was that old salamander's name?
Oh, yeah. Bones.
Billy Bones?
Bones? Bones?!
Mm-mmm.
T'ain't ringin' any bells.
Must have been a different cyborg.
There's a slew of cyborgs roamin' this port.
[Whistle on-deck]
ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
Eh, off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
There'll be plenty work a-waitin' for you afterwards.
[Humming]
[Chattering]
We best be keepin' a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?
We wouldn't want him strayin' into things he shouldn't.
We're all clear, Captain!
Well, my friend. Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?
My pleasure, Captain.
All hands to stations!
ARROW: Smatly now!
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!
Loose all solar sails!
[Grunting]
Come on!
ARROW: Heave up the braces
Brace up
[Crackling]
Ooh. Oh.
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
[Poomp poomp poomp pooomp]
[Clank]
[Clatter]
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
Take her away!
[Revving]
Brace yourself, Doctor.
[Snidely] ''Brace yourself.''
Aah! Oof!
Whoa.
[Woooo]
[Woooo]
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
Smile.
Uh, Doctor, I'd stand clear--
Ha.
SILVER: Ah. 'tis a grand day for sailing. Captain and look at you
You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
You can keep that kind of flim-flammery... for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy--
You cut me to the quick,
Captain. l speaks nothing but me heart at all times.
MORPH: Nothing but me heat
And, by the way, isn't that your cabin boy... aimlessly footling about in those shrouds?
Yep, it--oh...
A momentary aberration, Cap'n, soon to be addressed. Jimbo! l got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
Heh heh heh heh!
Yippie.
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
Watch it, twerp.
[Murmuring]
What are you looking at, weirdo?
Yeah, weirdo.
[Hisssss]
Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business.
Why? You got something to hide, bright eyes?
Maybe your ears don't work so well.
[Grunts] Yeah. Ahem.
Too bad my nose works just fine.
Why, you impudent little--
[Crew shouting]
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!
[Poot poot phoot]
Any last words, cabin boy?
Mr. Scroop... you ever see what happens to a fresh purp... when you squeeze real hard?
ARROW: What's all this. then?
You know the rules.
There'll be no brawling on this ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig... for the remainder of the voyage.
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
Transparently.
SILVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
Jimbo, I gave you a job.
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing--
Belay that! Now, I want this deck swabbed spotless... and heaven help you if l come back and it's not done.
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup... and let me know if there be any more distractions.
OK Aye-aye
[Chattering]
[Sighs]
[Crew grumbling]
[Crew grumbling]
So, we're all here, then.
-Excuse me.
-Fine.
Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen... are you all... stark-raving, totally blinking daft?!
[Chatters]
After all me finagling getting us hired... as an upstanding crew... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it's time?
The boy was sniffing about.
You just stick to the plan, you bug-brained twit.
As for the boy,
I'll run him so ragged... he won't have time to think.
[Morph laughs]
[Coughs]
[Sighs]
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
Making new friends like that spider psycho.
Spider psycho, spider psycho.
Heh. A little uglier.
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!
Pretty close.
SILVER: Well thank heavens for little miracles.
Up here for an hour... and the deck's still in one piece.
Um, look, l, uh...
What you did...
Thanks.
Didn't your pap ever teach you... to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
Your father's not the teachin' sort.
No.
He was more the taking off and never coming back sort.
Oh.
Sorry, lad.
Hey, no big deal.
I'm doing just fine. ls that so?
Well, since the captain has put you in my charge... like it or not,
I'll be pounding a few skills... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.
-What?
-From now on...
I'm not letting you out of me sight.
You can't do--
You won't so much as eat, sleep... or scratch your bum without my say-so.
Don't do me any favors!
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.
You can be sure of that.
You can be sure of that.
Heh heh heh heh!
Put some elbow into it.
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want
Made of pain
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy. no. I'm a man
You can take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown
Yeah. you stand here on your own
They don't know me
'Cause I'm not here
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me
But I'm still here
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted. h could be
Now you know me
And I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me
As long as I know who I am
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah. the world is still sleeping
While I keep on dreaming for me
While I keep on dreaming for me
And the words are just whispers and lies
That I'll never believe
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
Whoa!
How can you say h never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now
'Cause I'm still here
I'm the one son still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
[Song fades]
[Pulley squeaking]
[Grunts]
Oh, ho ho!
You having a little trouble there?
Oh, get away from me.
[Laughing]
Oh, Jimbo.
If I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age... they'd be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.
Bowing in the streets.
-Oof.
-Oof. l don't know.
They weren't exactly singing my praises when I left home.
-Heh. Whew.
-Whew.
But I'm gonna change all that.
Are you now? How so?
Uh, I got some plans.
Gonna make people see me a little different.
Ooh.
Sometimes, plans go astray.
Not this time.
Hmm.
Ooh...
[Chatters]
Oh, thank you, Morphy.
So, uh, how'd that happen anyway?
You give up a few things chasing a dream.
Was it worth it?
Heh.
[Sighs]
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo. l most surely am.
[Screams]
[Ship groans]
What the devil?
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa... it's gone supernova!
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!
Aye-aye, Captain.
All hands, fasten your lifelines!
[Shouting]
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!
Secure all sails!
Reef them down. men!
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom!
Ha ha ha ha!
-Aah!
-Silver!
Whoa. Thanks, lad.
[Yelling]
Captain, the star!
It's devolving into a...
[Gasps] a black hole!
We're being pulled in!
Ohh!
No, you don't, you--
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.
There'll be one more in precisely 47.2 seconds.
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!
We'll ride that last magilla out of here.
All sails secured, Captain!
Good man!
Now release them immediately!
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.
Unfurl those sails
-What?!
-But we just finished...
-Tying them down!
-Make up your blooming minds!
Mr. Hawkins... make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!
Aye-aye, Captain.
Lifelines secured, Captain!
Very good!
Gaah! Whoa!
Oof!
[Gasps]
Aah!
DOPPLER:
Captain. the last wave!
Here it comes!
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
[Whimpers]
[Boom]
Oof!
[Crew cheering]
[Sighs]
Captain! That--oh, my goodness.
That was-- that was absolutely-- that was the most--
Oh, tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor... your astronomical advice was most helpful.
Well, uh, uh--thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically-- amanamonically-- as-astronomically. [Slap]
Well, I must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.
It seems your cabin boy... did a bang-up job with those lifelines.
[Both chuckle]
All hands accounted for,
Mr. Arrow?
Mr. Arrow?
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.
His lifeline was not secured.
No, I checked them all. l--l did. I checked them all.
They were secure. l swear.
Mr. Arrow was a...
Ahem. Fine spacer... finer than most of us could ever hope to be... but he knew the risks, as do we all.
Resume your posts.
We carry on.
[Whimpers]
[Ship creaking]
It weren't your fault, you know?
[Sighs]
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss--
Look, don't you get it?! l screwed up!
For two seconds, l thought that maybe... l could do something right, but--
Aagh! I just--
[Sighs]
Just forget it. Forget it.
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya... but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.
Stick to it, no matter the squalls... and when the time comes you get the chance... to really test the cut of your sails... and show what you're made of, well, I hope I'm there... catching some of the light coming off ya that day.
[Sniffles]
[Sobs softly]
There, there.
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.
It's all right.
Now, Jim, l, um... l best be getting about my watch... and you best be getting some shut-eye.
[Chattering]
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.
Next thing ya know, they'll be saying I've gone soft.
[Crew snoring]
[Crew snoring]
[Muttering]
[Poomp phem poom-poomp]
[Poooomp]
[Pfft-pfft-pfft]
[Phooomp]
Uh--oh! Oh! Ugh!
[Sighs]
Morph?
Morph, knock it off.
It's too early for this.
Ow! Hey, Morph!
Pbbbt!
[Laughs]
-Hey, come back here!
-Come back here!
Gotcha, Morph!
[Sighs]
That's it, you little squid.
You little squid.
You little squid.
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.
Ungh! Unh!
Ha! Busted!
Look. what we're saying is we're sick of all this waiting
There's only three of them left
We are wanting to move.
We don't move till we got the treasure in hand.
SCROOP: h say we kill 'em all now l say what's to say!
Disobey my orders again... like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow... and so help me, you'll be joining him! and so help me, you'll be joining him!
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.
SILVER: You got something to say. Scroop?
It's that boy.
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.
SAILORS: Yeah
Now, mark me, the lot of ya. l care about one thing, and one thing only!
Flint's trove.
You think I'd risk it all for the sake... of some nose-wiping little whelp?
SCROOP: What was it now?
''Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya ''
Shut your yap! l cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.
But I ain't gone soft.
ONUS: Land ho!
Ha ha ha! There it is!
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.
Where the devil's me glass?
Jimbo.
Playing games, are we?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're playing games.
Oh, I see. Well, I was never much good at games.
Always hated to lose. [Click]
Hmm.
Me, too!
Yaaah!
Right-o...
SILVER: Ohh blast it all
[Blows whistle]
Change in plan, lads!
We move now!
[Cheering]
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.
With pleasure, Captain.
[Roars]
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Doctor, familiar with these?
[Gun powers up]
Oh, I've seen-- well, I've read--
Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.
Ooh.
[Laughs]
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.
Morph! Give me that!
Oh, you're taking all day about it.
Oh! Stop them!
DOPPLER: Aah, aah, aah. Oof!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Hey, you!
To the longboats, quickly!
Unh!
Rrr-yeah!
[Cocks gun]
Morph! No!
AMELIA: Chew on this, you pus-filled boils!
[Screaming]
Did you actually aim for that?
You know, actually, I did.
[Gears turning]
Oh, blast it.
Doctor, when I say ''now'', shoot out the forward cable.
I'll take this one.
JIM: Morph. here! Morph!
Morph!
Morphy, come here. [Whistles]
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.
Come here, boy. Morph!
-Come on!
-Morph! Morph, here!
-Morphy!
-Morph!
[Groans] Ohh.
[Powers up]
[Beeping]
[Sighs]
Now!
Whoa!
Unh!
Jim!
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.
That's it! Come to papa!
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o'clock!
-Whoa!
-Aah!
[Creaking]
Ow.
Oh, my goodness.
That was more fun than l ever want to have again.
[Chuckles]
That's not one of my... gossamer landings. Unh!
Captain!
Oh. Ooh.
Oh, don't fuss.
Uh-uh--
Slight bruising. That's all.
Cup of tea, and I'll be right as rain.
Mr. Hawkins.
The map if you please.
Ah.
[Giggling]
Morph!
[Giggling]
Morph!
Morph, where's the map?!
Are you serious?!
It's back on the ship?
Stifle that blob and get low.
[Engine whining]
CAPTAIN AMELIA:
We've got company
We need a more defensible position.
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.
Aye, Captain.
-Unh!
-Steady, steady.
Now, let's have a look at that.
[Wind whistling]
[Morph chattering]
[Rattling]
[Gasps]
Shh. shh.
[Powers up]
-Aah!
-Aah!
Oh, this is fantastic!
A carbon-based life form come to rescue me at last! l just want to hug you and squeeze you... and hold you close to me.
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's just I've been marooned for so long. l mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.
For heaven's sakes, after a hundred years... you go a little nuts!
Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry. Am l... l am, um...
My name is, uh...
[Cuckoo cuckoo]
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.
-And you are?
-Jim.
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, OK? l got to find a place to hide, and there's pirates chasing me.
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates! l don't like them. l remember Captain Flint.
This guy had such a temper.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint? l think he suffered from mood swings, personally.
I'm not a therapist, and anyway... but l--you let me know when I'm rambling.
But that means--but wait.
But then you gotta know about the treasure?
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
It's--well, it's... it's all a little-- little--little fuzzy.
Wait. l--l r-r-remember. l do. l--treasure!
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid-- centroid--centroid of the mechanism.
And there was this big door opening and closing... and opening and closing... and Captain Flint wanted to make sure... nobody could ever get to his treasure... so I helped him...
[Sputtering]
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
JIM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !
Reboot! Aah! And you are?
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure? l want to say Larry.
The--the centroid of the mechanism, or--
I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
You haven't found it, have you?
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?
Look, B.E.N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?
So I'm just gonna be, you know, moving on.
Oh, uh, so, well, then... l guess, uh... this is good-bye, huh?
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.
So, uh, go ahead and... l do understand. l do. Bye-bye.
[Whines]
[Sighs] Look, if you're gonna come along... you're gonna have to stop talking.
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!
Me and my best buddy are lookin' for a...
[Clears throat]
[Whispering] Being quiet.
And you have to stop touching me.
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.
OK. Now, I think that we should--
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search... um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?
[Chuckles] Kind of urgent.
JIM: BEN. I think you just solved my problem
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people
You'd think in a hundred years... l would've dusted a little more often... but, you know, when you're batchin' it... you tend to, uh, let things go.
Aw, isn't that sweet? l find old-fashioned romance so touching, don't you?
How about drinks for the happy couple?
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
Thank you, we don't drink... and, uh, we're not a couple.
Ahem.
Look at these markings.
They're identical to the ones on the map. l suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants... of an ancient culture.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr Hawkins stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
Yes, yes. Now listen to me... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.
Very forceful, Doctor.
Go on. Say something else.
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
Stop wastin' your fire!
SILVER: Hello. up there!
Jimbo?
If it's all right with the captain...
I'd like a short word with ya.
No tricks, just a little palaver.
Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.
Pestilential...
-Ugh!
-Captain.
That means...that he thinks we still have it.
Ah, Morphy! I wondered where you was off to.
[Groaning]
Ooh.
Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky... since that game attack we had in the galley.
[Chuckles]
Ahh.
Whatever you heard back there... at least the part concerning you... l didn't mean a word of it.
Had that bloodthirsty lot thought I'd gone soft... they'd have gutted us both.
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right... we can both walk away from this rich as kings.
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.
You get me that map... and, uh... an even portion of the treasure is yours.
[Chuckles]
Boy.
You are really something.
All that talk of greatness... light coming off my sails... what a joke.
Now, just see here, Jimbo-- l mean, at least you taught me one thing.
Stick to it, right?
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make sure that you never see... one drabloon of my treasure!
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!
Oh, you still don't know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?
Now, mark me.
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow... or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons... to blast ya all to kingdom come!
Morph, hop to it.
Now!
Oh, blast it!
Gentlemen... we must stay together and... and...ohh.
And what? What?!
We must stay together and what?!
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
She's lost her mind!
Well, you gotta help her.
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer, not a doctor. l mean, I am a doctor, but I'm not that kind of doctor. l have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.
You can't help people with a doctorate.
You just sit there, and you're useless.
It's OK, Doc.
It's all right.
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.
It's just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.
Jim, any thoughts at all?
Without the map, we're dead.
If we try to leave, we're dead.
-If we stay here--
-We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time. Heh.
So I'll just slip out the back door.
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah. l get this delightful breeze through here... which I think is important... because ventilation among friends--
Whoa What is all this stuff?
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet?
Not a clue.
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think l found a way out of here!
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay--
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!
Woof.
[Snoring]
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
[Whispering] OK, here it is.
We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons... and bring back the map.
[Muffled] That's a good plan. l like that plan.
The only thing is...
I'm wondering, how do we get there?
On that.
MORPH: Ooh.
Oop? [Poink]
-Aah!
-BEN. shh!
Sorry. sorry Sorry
OK, I'll get the map.
You wait here.
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!
Yo-ho. yo-ho. a pirate's life for me
[Humming]
[Sighs]
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.
[Gasps] Oh, mama.
[Sighs] Yes.
[Alarm blaring]
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.
OK, fixing.
That stupid robot's gonna get us all...killed.
Cabin boy.
Aah!
[Growling]
[Squealing]
[Powers up]
BEN:
Whoops OK. don't panic
Breathing in breathing out
[Ship creaking]
-Aah!
-Hmm?
[Poink] Raah!
This has gotta be cannons.
[Rumbling]
Maybe not.
Rraar!
[Thud]
[Grunting]
Heh heh.
Come on, come on, come on.
No!
[Snickers] Oh, yes.
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.
[Gasps] Rraar!
Tell him yourself!
Aah!
Back you go, you naughty plug!
Oh!
Unh! [Gasping]
[Rattling]
[Coughing]
Morph?
[Chirrups]
BEN:
Laser cannons disconnected
Captain Jimmy, sir!
Gee, that wasn't so tough.
Doc! Doc, wake up! l got the map.
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.
[Muffled yelling]
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.
Aah!
[Morph yelping]
What's this sorry stack of metal?!
Not the face!
You're just like me, Jimbo.
Ya hates to lose.
[Chuckles]
What the devil's the...
Open it.
I'd get busy.
[Crew murmuring]
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?
Ha ha ha ha!
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we--what?
You want the map... you're taking me, too.
[Grunts]
Hmm.
[Chuckles]
We'll take 'em all.
Unh.
[Chattering]
It's OK, Morph. It's OK.
Jimmy, l--l don't know about you... but I'm starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.
At least, I think it's my life.
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!
B.E.N., shh.
This isn't over yet.
SILVER:
We're gettin' close. lads l smell treasure a-waitin'.
[Laughs]
Huh?
SILVER: Where is it? l see nothing! One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!
What's going on, Jimbo? l don't know. l can't get it open.
We should've never followed this boy!
Hey!
SILVER: I'd suggest you get that gizmo going again. and fast!
Let's rip his gizzard right out right now!
Throw him off the cliff!
[Rumbling]
Oh, have mercy.
JIM: The Lagoon Nebula?
But that's halfway across the galaxy.
JIM: A big door opening and closing
Let's see.
Kinapis.
Montressor spaceport.
So that's how Flint did it.
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.
But where'd he stash it all?
SILVER: Where's that blasted treasure?!
Treasure! Treasure!
It's buried in the--
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.
What if the whole planet is the mechanism... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?
[Shouting]
[Boing]
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?
Just open the right door.
[Alarm beeping]
Wait for me! Wait for me!
[Gasps]
[Cheering]
The loot of a thousand worlds.
CREATURE: We are going to need a bigger boat!
[Laughing]
This is all seeming very familiar.
I can't remember why
B.E.N., come on.
We're getting out of here, and we're not leaving empty-handed.
But--but, Jimmy! Jimmy!
A lifetime of searching.
And at long last... l can touch it.
Do you know what's strange? l can't tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy...
'cause there's something just-- it's nagging at the back of my mind.
Aah!
-Captain Flint?
-ln the flesh!
Well, s-sort of, except for skin, organs... or anything that--that--that resembles flesh... that's not there.
And yet it's so odd. you know?
I remember there was something horrible
Flint didn't want anyone else to know but h--h just can't remember what it was
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
[Sobbing]
B.E.N., l think I just found your mind.
Hold still.
Aah! Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
Whoa!
Hello.
You know, uh, Jimmy, l was just thinking... l was just think--
It's all flooding back!
All my memories!
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits... so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!
[Crash]
-Speaking of which...
-Huh?
Flint wanted to make sure... that nobody could ever steal his treasure... so he rigged this whole planet... to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
[Jingling]
[Yelling]
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
You go back and help the captain and Doc!
If I'm not there in 5 minutes, leave without me. l am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
Unless he looks at me like that.
Bye, Jim!
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
No! Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
[Crew yelling]
Come back here, ya blighters!
[Rumbling]
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.
[Sighs] I'm just sorry... l couldn't have been more helpful to you.
Oh, don't be daft.
You've been very helpful.
Truly. l feel like such a useless weakling... with abnormally thin wrists.
Excuse me, brutish pirate.
[Belches]
Yes, you. I have a question. ls it that your body is too massive... for your teeny-tiny head... or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny... for your big, fat body? l pummel you good!
Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do... l have one more question. ls this yours?
Uhh...
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!
[Cackling]
SILVER: Ah. Jimbo!
Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?
Get back! l like you, lad, but I've come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.
Aah!
Oh, no, you don't!
[Chattering]
What?
Jimbo.
Reach for me now!
Reach! l--l can't!
Aah! l...
Oh, blast me for a fool!
Aah!
[Groans]
Silver, you gave up?
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.
BEN: Aloha. Jimmy!
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes... and thirty-four seconds till planet's destruction!
You're doing fine, Doctor.
Now ease her over gently--gently!
Aah! We were better off on exploding planet!
Take us out of here, metal man!
Aye, Captain!
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of--
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
[Chuckles]
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
30% ? That means we're--
We'll never clear the planet's explosion in time.
-We gotta turn around.
-What?
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!
DOPPLER: Pardon me. Jim. but didn't that portal open onto a raging inferno?!
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
I'm gonna open a different door
Captain, really, I don't see how this is possible--
Listen to the boy!
One minute, twenty-nine seconds till planet's destruction!
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.
There you go.
There you go.
OK. Now, no matter what happens... keep the ship heading straight for that portal.
BEN: Fifty-eight seconds!
Well, you heard him!
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
Doctor, head us back to the portal.
Aye, Captain.
Go to the right! The right! l know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!
Twenty-five seconds!
No! No!
Come on, lad.
Seventeen seconds!
BEN: Seven sixfivefour three...two...
Wow! Yeah!
SILVER: You done it. Jimmy!
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!
Didn't I say the lad had greatness in him?
[Cheering]
Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you
Just wait until your mother hears about this!
Of course, we may downplay the life-threatening parts.
Jimmy, that was unforgettable! l know you don't like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, you hugged me back.
Oh, I promised myself l wouldn't cry.
[Sobbing]
BEN:
Does anyone have a tissue?
[Morph squeaking]
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-l know.
JIM: You never quit. do you ?
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha! l was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure.
Mmm.
Well... that should hold it.
Heh heh heh. l taught you too well.
If you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison.
Little morphy here, he's a free spirit.
Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
[Squeaks]
Ohh!
What say you ship out with us, lad?
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
You know, when I got on this boat... l would've taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, l met this old cyborg... and he taught me that l could chart my own course.
That's what I'm gonna do.
And what do you see of that pal of yours?
A future.
[Chuckles] Why... look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
You're something special, Jim.
You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.
[Clears throat]
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.
[Sniffles]
[Sobbing]
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?
See ya around.
[Sniffs]
Morphy, I got a job for ya. l need you to keep an eye on this here pup.
Will ya do me that little favor?
Aye-aye, Captain.
Oh, and one more thing.
[Chuckles]
This is for your dear mother... to rebuild that inn of hers.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
[Laughs] Why, Jimbo, lad... when have I ever done otherwise?
[Laughing]
Oh! [Giggling]
[Cheering]
[Yawns]
[All gasp]
[All cheer]
[Playing music]
[Crying]
[Laughing]
[Song starts]
It's good to see the sun and feel this place
This place I never thought would feel like home
And I ran forever
Far away
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone
Somehow the world has changed
And I've come home
To give you back the things they took from you
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
When I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
And I found something that was always there
Sometimes it's got to hut before you feel
But now I'm strong. and I won't kneel
Except to thank who's watching over me
And somehow h feel so strong
And I've begun to be the one
I never thought I'd be
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
Now it's all so clear
And I believe
That everything's been opened up to me
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
And when I feel the sun
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are

But, Ms. Finster,
I‚Äôve got dirt on everybody.
Well, everybody except
Detweiler and his pals.
Come to think ofit,
I haven‚Äôt seen those guys anywhere.
Ah, forget about ‚Äôem, Randall.
There‚Äôs nothing T.J. Detweiler and his hooligan friends can do to stop me now.
Well, that should do it.
There‚Äôs enough here for everyone.
Good. Then it‚Äôs party time.
Kids ofthe playground !
I giveyou ice cream !
Pull !
[ Cheering ]
- Ice cream !
- Choco-pops !
- Fudge bars !
Fudgsicle !
My ice cream !
Stop it !
Stop it, I say !
You little monsters are in trouble now !
-Just wait‚Äôll Principal Prickly finds out about this !
-Attention, students !
- This is Principal Prickly talking.
- Ooh, that was fast.
Some ofyou may have noticed ice cream on the playground.
I willnotstandforthis. This ice creamshouldbe eatenimmediately.
Huh ?
[ Cheering ]
In addition, I wantyou all to ignore
Ms. Finster, no matterwhat she says... about ice cream or anything else.
- [ Cheering Continues ]
- [ Muttering ] This can‚Äôt be happening.
Furthermore, I want to inform you all that I have a fat, saggy butt... which I like to scratch every hour on the hour.
Also, I want to apologize to all ofyou... for being such a mean principal, taking away hall passes, giving guys recess detention, refusing toacceptsicKnotes just ‚Äôcauseitdoesn‚ÄôtlooK liKeaguy‚Äôsmom‚Äôssignature, maKingKidsstandat the wall forten wholeminutes, withnobreaK!
Man, I feel ashamed ofmyselffor all the terrible, rotten things I‚Äôve done.
And nextyear,
I promise to--
Why, Principal Prickly, sir, what a surprise.
Why doyou do this to me, Detweiler ?
Doyou enjoy tormenting me ?
- Doyou hate me ?
- On the contrary, sir, I have the utmost respect foryou.
Don‚Äôt be smart with me, boy. All year long you‚Äôve been pushing me, testing me.
- I don‚Äôt know whatyou mean, sir.
- Oh, really ?
How about the timeyou convinced the F.B.I. I was a Chinese agent and got me arrested ?
You were giving us a speech on personal hygiene. You had to be stopped.
How about the time you forged my signature and ordered a motorboat for the school ?
It was for the kindergarteners.
Owning a boat‚Äôs always been kind ofa dream oftheirs.
I‚Äôve had enough ofyour pranks.
This time I‚Äôm really gonna throw the book atyou.
With all due respect, sir, you‚Äôd better get throwing, ‚Äôcauseyou‚Äôre out oftime.
- Huh ?
- It‚Äôs the last day ofschool, sir.
I‚Äôve only got 20 more seconds offourth grade left. Look.
In some ways, people, this day is a bummer for me.
But in otherways it‚Äôs the ultimate high, because every milestone thatyou kids pass is another step towards--
- Uh, Miss Grotke ?
- Yes, Spinelli ?
I don‚Äôt mean to interrupt, but--
Oh, yes !
Be my guest.
[ Kids In Unison ]

I‚Äôll tell you a wonderful expression offreedom andjoy.
Twelve weeks ofnothing but me at the
West Side GolfCourse, and no Detweiler.
I second that emotion, sir.
Man, Teej, that prankwas sweet.
Yeah, you should‚Äôve seen
Finster‚Äôs face-- I thought she was gonna blow a gasket.
Those limesicles were tasty.
A tasty beginning to a tasty summer.
Twelve weeks ofnothing but riding bikes, hanging out at the lake... and T.P.-ing the West Side GolfCourse.
Summervacation-- the ultimate recess.
Yeah, I can‚Äôt wait to get to baseball camp.
Baseball camp ?
What areyou talking about ?
Actually, Teej,
I‚Äôm gonna be out oftown too.
Big-time Wrestling Federation has this training camp, and I gotta learn some new moves ifI‚Äôm ever gonna turn pro.
- But, Spinelli--
- It‚Äôs military camp for me.
My dad says I need to learn to be a leader.
I shall be attending the Mt. Van Buren Space Camp.
- Don‚Äôt wanna let those science geeks get ahead ofme.
- You‚Äôre all going to camp ?
- Not me.
- Thank goodness.
The Young Voices Training Program doesn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äò‚Äòcamp.‚Äô‚Äô
They provide opportunities for aspiring singers to train theirvoices... in a rigorous yet supportive setting.
But summer‚Äôs gonna be ruined.
What am I gonna do ? Play baseball by myself? Watch reruns ? Read ?
Sorry, man, but we gotta think about our futures.
Yeah, we can‚Äôt waste the whole summer
Just fooling around like kids.
- But we are kids !
- Actually, as ofthe completion offourth grade, we are technically considered pre-young adults.
And nextyear we won‚Äôt even be ‚Äò‚Äòpre.‚Äô‚Äô
But--
[ Sighs ]
All right, let‚Äôs make the most ofthe time we‚Äôve got left.
When doyou all leave ?
- First thing in the morning.
- Oh, man.
[Chattering]
Well, there‚Äôs my bus.
- Better get going.
- Yeah, same here.
Bye, Teej.
Try to have some fun, okay ?
Don‚Äôt worry, buddy.
You‚Äôll have a great time without us.
I don‚Äôt know, Vince.
All my plans were made for six.
Don‚Äôt tell meyou Ashleys are going to baseball camp.
Eeew !
As if!
Cheerleading camp is right across the lake. Duh !
I hope it‚Äôs a big lake.
[Horn HonKs]
Ah, space camp.
Wonder ifthey‚Äôll let us make craters.
Hey, Hustler Kid,
I didn‚Äôt knowyou wrestled.
I don‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm pre-management.
Besides, my research tells me that kids who wrestle trade the most for contraband snacks.
Which reminds me--
Wanna buy a Winger-Dinger ?
All right, all the kindergarten performers on the bus first.

Thanks, Gus, but I think I‚Äôll stick it out at home this summer.
Okay, butyou don‚Äôt know whatyou‚Äôre missing.
- Hiya, Captain Brad !
- I don‚Äôt likeyou, Griswald.
I am notyour friend !
- Do I make myselfclear ?

And so, the summer season officially begins... with kids all over the country rushing offto camp.
In other news, the national
No Recess movement... has hit a serious stumbling block... with the disappearance ofits leader, former Secretary of Education
Phillium Benedict.
Benedict, fired by the president twoyears ago for his extremist views, has recently been--
No recess ?
What a bunch ofhogwash.
[ Yawns ]
Morning, Mom. Morning, Dad.
Areyoujust getting up now ?
Geez, you‚Äôre sleeping away yourwhole vacation.
Why don‚Äôtyou go play with your friends ?
What friends ? The ones who abandoned me and went to camp ?
Now, T.J., I know there are other boys around this summer.
Mrs. Ween says Randall is available.
Doyou want me to make a play date ?
- A play date ?
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Bye, T-Jerk.
Now, Becky, be nice toyour little brother.
He‚Äôs feeling S-A-D right now.
- I can spell, Mom.
- Well, unlike some kids,
I gotta get to work.
Mr. Walsh says ifI can master the Vatman 2000,
I‚Äôll be assistant manager by the end ofthe summer, and you know what that means--
I‚Äôll get to drive the Floppy Burger truck.
Boy, she‚Äôs sure aiming for the stars.
At least she‚Äôs not sitting around the house, moping all summer.
Going to a play date with Randall.
Man, I can‚Äôt believe
I sunk this low.
This is the worst summer ever.
[ Loud Zap ]
- What the heck ?
- [ Loud Zap ]
- That‚Äôs weird.
- Hey, you!
Get away from that fence !
Hey, Dad, what do they use the school for during the summer ?
They lock it up.
It‚Äôs empty. Why ?
Today, when I was riding by,
I saw this scary guy and--
I‚Äôm sure he wasjust cleaning up.
I think something weird‚Äôs going on in there-- something really weird.
[ Sighs ]
Mrs. La Salle was right.
We should‚Äôve sent him to some kind ofcamp.
9:32 a.m. Ugly bald guy still guarding school.
[Horn HonKs]
Staging area one.
- Give me a hand with this.
- Got it.
9:32-and-a-halfa.m.
Grownups wrong. School‚Äôs not empty.
[LoudZap]
9:32 and three quarters.
Green glow in window again.
I‚Äôm going in for a closer look.
[ Loud Zap ]
Allright, goaheadandelevateit.
[ Gasps ]
Mom ! Mom !
- [ Groans ]
- T.J. ! Areyou all right ?
Those guys at the school, they‚Äôre doing some kind ofevil experiment !
That bonk on the head must‚Äôve rattled your little brain.
- But, Mom--
- You‚Äôre feverish.
You wait right here.
I‚Äôll go get the baby thermometer and the petroleum jelly.
Uh, Dad, Dad !
- Dad !
- What is it, boy ?
Those bad guys have a laser beam and they‚Äôre lifting this safe--
T.J., did you run into the sliding glass door again ?
No, but-- Yeah, but--
Gaaah !
Come back ! Your mom‚Äôs gonna want to takeyour temperature !
Okay, kid, we got it all in the report.
We‚Äôll take care of those mad scientists.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, no one‚Äôs gonna levitate any safe on mywatch.
Ooh, look, Artie, somebody‚Äôs levitating my doughnut... with a laser beam !

- Sorry.
Something weird‚Äôs going on in the school.
I saw these mad scientists and--
Yeah, yeah, very funny.
I‚Äôm not falling for another one ofyour so-calledjokes.
- How dumb doyou think I am ?
- It‚Äôs not ajoke, sir.
They have this laser beam, and--
Aw, please, Principal Prickly, you gotta believe me ! The school‚Äôs in danger !
Give me a break,
Detweiler.
Come on.
Go with the kid, Pete.
- This isn‚Äôt the kind ofissue you should be avoiding.
- [ All Laughing ]
All right, Detweiler, let‚Äôs get this overwith.
Looks fine to me.
Now can I go back to my golfgame ?
Just wait till you get inside.
You‚Äôll see.
Oh, the things I do foryou kids.
Sometimes I thinkyou were put on this Earthjust to--
- Aaah !
- Aaah !
Aaah !
[ Panting ]
1 1 :57 a.m.
Principal Prickly dematerialized... in a horrifying field ofelectricity.
The cops won‚Äôt listen.
Mom and Dad won‚Äôt listen.
I gotta get the guys together.
It‚Äôs the onlyway.
Like, I am so through with him, Melissa.
He asked me ifI spoke French, then winked at me.
Becky, you gotta help me !
I need a ride up to Chesterville !

-Jerks.
Hey, you kids ! Get away from that fake Martian landscape !
- Miss Director ! Miss Director !
- What is it now, Gretchen ?
I‚Äôve been studying the moon with the
200-inch telescope at the observatory, and I‚Äôve detected some peculiar eccentricities in its orbit.
Gretchen, maybeyou should try out one ofthese neat antigravity harnesses.
The other kids love ‚Äôem, and look, you can even do back flips,
Just like real astronauts.
But--
[ Sighs ]
Why do I bother ?
Becauseyou‚Äôre driven by a passionate desire for knowledge ?
T.J. ? Vince ?
What areyou guys doing here ?
You‚Äôre not gonna believe this, but--

- Thanks a lot, sis.
- You owe me gas money.
- Okay, Teej, what‚Äôs this big secret plot ofyours ?
- Follow me.
Look at that.
Let‚Äôs get movin‚Äô out.
- Who are those guys ?
- Perhaps they‚Äôre government agents.
- Or gangsters.
- Or aliens.
Aliens ?
They don‚Äôt look like aliens.
Well, maybe they‚Äôre in disguise.
Yeah, ifyou were an alien, you wouldn‚Äôtjust walk around in your lizard skin all day.
Hmm. Good point.
Whoever they are, we need to take a closer look.
- We‚Äôll get the rest later.
- Right. I‚Äôll close it up.
Hurry.
Man, this thing weighs a ton.
That‚Äôs ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs full ofmoon rocks and alien eggs.
Hey, it‚Äôsjust a bunch ofpaper.
Weather maps ? Test scores ?
Some stuffwritten in Swedish ?
- Actually, that‚Äôs Norwegian.
- Whatever. It‚Äôs all
Just dumb school stuff.
You got me out ofbaseball camp to watch some guys restock the supply room ?
No ! Something‚Äôs going on in the school ! I swear !
Teej, I thinkyou cooked this whole thing upjust ‚Äôcause you wanted us back from camp.
- What ?
- Hey, we understand.
It must be pretty boring around here all summer byyourself.
Your mind simply created an adventure because it needed some excitement.
No, it really happened.
I saw Prickly disappear.
Well, if Prickly disappeared, then who‚Äôs that ?
- Come on, guys. Let‚Äôs get back to camp.
- Yeah.
Seeya in a few weeks, Teej.
No, wait !
You guys gotta believe me !

You‚Äôre in T.J.‚Äôs backyard, man.
How‚Äôd you guys get me here ?
Hey, this is kinda comfy.
Yeah, yeah. Get out ofthere, you big lummox.
Okay, Teej, you were right. Something weird is going on in the school.
- And Prickly must be in on it.
- I saywe go to the police.
I alreadywent to the police.
I went to everyone. Nobody‚Äôll listen.
- What we need is proof.
- Proof? How are we gonna get proof?
- I got a plan. A stakeout.
- A stakeout ?
We can stay up in my tree house and watch the school every night until something happens.
- Like one ofthem TV cop shows.
- Sure.
The next time those laser guys make a move, we‚Äôll catch ‚Äôem red-handed.
We can take pictures with my night-vision digital cam.
Then we call in the feds and, bang, we got ‚Äôem.
Onlyoneproblem--
Whataboutcamp ?
Oh, yeah. Ifmy dad finds out
I‚Äôve gone AWOL, he‚Äôll throw me in the brig till September.
Not to worry. I‚Äôll get Becky to drive you back to camp in the morning.
Then at night we‚Äôll pickyou up again.
Campers by day, spies by night.
But what ifthe camp counselors notice we‚Äôre not there ?
Leave that to me.
- Call foryou, sir.
- Give me that.
- Captain Brad here.
- Bradley. This is Colonel O‚ÄôMalley.

Griswald on special assignment tonight.
- When he gets back to camp, act like nothing‚Äôs happened.
- Yes, sir !
And you‚Äôd better start making his bed and spit-shining his shoes as well.

Infrared night vision,
200-to-1 zoom.
I gotta hand it toyou, Gretch. You can see the whole school with this thing.
You can make lots ofhandy devices out ofthe spare parts in a family‚Äôs garage.
I once fashioned a particle accelerator... out ofa broken hair dryer and a four-slice toaster oven.
‚Äò‚ÄòTonight, the magical moment arrived.
We met behind the drive-thru menu and kissed passionately... as the sound ofthe deep fat fryer faded into the night.‚Äô‚Äô
Man, I wish I had an older sister.
Laugh ifyou will.
I think it‚Äôs beautiful.
Sorry I‚Äôm late, guys, but I had to wait till my mom and dad fell asleep... before I could sneak out with... the goodies.
Roast beefand mashed potatoes !
My favorite !
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- I also managed to swipe this.
- Rocky Road ! My other favorite !
Hey, give me some ofthat.
Excuse me, but aren‚Äôt we supposed to eat dinner before dessert ?
Good one, Gretch.
You were right, Teej.
This is the life.
Hanging out with friends, eating ice cream, spying on bad guys.
It‚Äôs the ultimate kid experience.
Too bad these days are numbered.
Yeah, this is probably the last summer... we‚Äôll get to do stufflike this.
Kinda whomps, huh ?
Hey, remember that summer after second grade... when we went down to the pond every day to catch minnows ?
Or how about that summerwe all carved our initials in that tree in the Wilsons‚Äô backyard ?
And Spinelli spelled hers wrong.
Hey, I was seven.
And S‚Äôs are tricky.
[GusSobbing]
What‚Äôs your problem ? This is the first summeryou‚Äôve lived here.
I know, and I‚Äôll never have any ofthose memories.

There‚Äôs something in here.
‚Äò‚ÄòHelp me ?‚Äô‚Äô
It sounds like a desperate cry for help.
- Then Principal Prickly must still be in the school.
- Being held captive !
You know what that means, don‚Äôtyou, guys ?
We gotta go in there and save him.
- Bikes ?
- Check.
- Walkie-talkie ?
- Check.
- Rope with pointy thing ?

Not if Muriel P. Finster has anything to say about it.

- The nerve center ofthe system.
- Shh ! The bad guys are talking.
- But, Dr. Benedict, please--
- No, let me make this clear toyou, Lazenby.
We have a thing called a window ofopportunity.
Ifwe miss the window ofopportunity, then the project fails.
And ifthe project fails, then I get very, very... angry !
Th-Theymayhave apoint, sir.
It seems the logistical problems are a bit more complicated than Dr. Steinheimer thought.
Yes, it would be a lot easier ifwe could move the laser to a more appropriate location.
This operation will be executed as planned from right here !
Have I made myselfclear ?
- But, sir--
- No buts !
It started at 3rd Street.
It is going to end at 3rd Street.
Dr. Benedict, we‚Äôre ready for the test.
Coming.

- Ready ?
- I‚Äôve been ready for decades.
-Just do it.
- Yes, sir.

What are those kids up to in there ?

[ Beam Sputtering ]

- Dr. Rosenthal, why did the beam suddenly--
Oh, what‚Äôs the technical word for it ? Stop ?
W-Well, uh, as I believe you were told before--
‚Äò‚ÄòTold before‚Äô‚Äô ?
[ Chuckles ]
Doyou think I care what I was told before ? I‚Äôll do better next time.
‚Äò‚ÄòNext time.‚Äô‚Äô
Isn‚Äôt that cute.
Rosenthal, let me askyou something.
Sayyou were a teacher-- or even better, say, the principal ofa school-- and you had to deal with a naughty child who didn‚Äôt know his place, who kept telling you over and over that he‚Äôd do better ‚Äò‚Äònext time.‚Äô‚Äô
But he never did.
What would you do ?
Oh, no. N-Not detention.
Not detention !
- Take him away !
- No, please ! I can fix it !
Don‚Äôt do this to me-e-e !
All right, who‚Äôs second-in-command ?
- Uh, I am, sir.
- Well, good. Nowyou‚Äôre in charge.
And ifI wereyou, I‚Äôd make sure
I had this machine working at full power by tomorrow morning.
- Do I make myselfclear ?
- Y-Yes, sir.
Oh, dear,
I got spittle on my lapel.
Mmm.

[MuffledShouting]
Principal Prickly !
You‚Äôre alive !
- Oww ! Would you be careful !
- Boy, am I glad to seeyou.
You won‚Äôt believe what these guys are doing. They‚Äôve got this big laser gun and--
- Whoa, who tookyour pants ?
- Never mind, Detweiler.Just untie me.
- These knots are tight.
- Ofcourse.
I‚Äôve been pulling at them for the last day and a half.
They‚Äôve chaffed mywrist.
- Don‚Äôt worry, sir.
My pals‚Äôll get us out ofhere.
- What makes you so sure ?
You don‚Äôt know my friends.
They‚Äôll get help. You‚Äôll see.
Soyou‚Äôre saying youjust escaped from a troop ofninja warriors ?
- That‚Äôs right !
- And they got a giant laser gun in the school auditorium ?
- Precisely !
- Which is aimed at the moon ?
Thank heavens you understand !
[ Grunts ]
I‚Äôve almost got it.
Careful, Detweiler.
That‚Äôs my putting hand.
[DoorLocK UnlocKing]
Hello, Pete.
Remember me ?
Well, well, ifit isn‚Äôt
Phillium Benedict.
- I should‚Äôve known you‚Äôd be the one behind this.
- You know this guy ?
Ah, Pete and I are old pals.
Although the last time we saw each other, Pete was the one ruining my life.
By the way, Pete, you like this suit ?
It‚Äôs Italian. Raw silk. Nice, huh ?
You always were more concerned about appearances than people, Phil.
Oh, Pete, come on.
There‚Äôs no need to be rude.
Not after I instructed my men to take such special care ofyou.
Special care ?
That‚Äôs whatyou call gagging me, tying me up and taking away my pants ?
Had to. Otherwise, you might run offand betray me, likeyou did the last time.
But, hey, look at the bright side.
At leastyou‚Äôve got company now.
Let the boy go.
He can‚Äôt do anything toyou.
[ Sighs ]
Same old noble Pete.
- Always standing up for the rights ofchildren.
- You ?
But, unfortunately,
I can‚Äôt let anybody go right now.
You see, this experimental, um, night school that I‚Äôm running is kind ofa secret.
I‚Äôm trying to show that my...
[ Chuckles ] adult students can be trained... to be capable and productive members ofsociety.
Well, ifyou‚Äôrejust running a night school, then what‚Äôs that giant laser gun doing in the auditorium ?
What a rude and badly dressed little boyyou are.
You should teach your pupils a little respect for their superiors, Pete.
But that would mean thatyou‚Äôd have to know how to teach them anything at all, wouldn‚Äôt it ?
Geez, how doyou know thatjerk ?
We went through teacher training together.
- You mean--
- That‚Äôs right, Detweiler.
That man is a rogue teacher.
[PricKly]
It wasbacK in thespringof‚Äô68.
A differentage.
We wereallyoung, idealistic andreadyto change the world.
[ Chattering ]
[RocK]
Oh ! Ha ha ha.
Peace, Peter.
Hey, Muriel, had a groovy time at the Dead concert last night.
You gonna be at the teach-in Saturday ?
We‚Äôre gonna paint myVolkswagen.
- Wouldn‚Äôt miss it for the world.
- Groovy.
Yes, weall thought we wereprettycool.
- Butoneguy was the coolestofusall.
-[VehicleApproaching]
Phillium Benedict was mybestfriend.
He wassmart, he washandsome.
Hehadjustbeennamedprincipal of3rdStreetSchool.
[ All Giggling ]
So, Phillium, how‚Äôs it feel being theyoungest principal in the history ofthe state ?
Copacetic, baby.
I mean, you know what they say:
Young is in, man, and old is out.
Way out.
Doyou like the American flag helmet, Pete ? It does go with the leatherjacket, right ?
You are one groovy educator, Phil.
Cool. Follow me, my man.
I wanna showyou my new principal‚Äôs pad.
Whoa !
Psychedelic principalia.
Pull up a bag, bro.
I wanna rap.
- Lay it on me, man.
- You see, Pete, I been thinkin‚Äô.
We‚Äôre a new generation ofteachers, right ?
It‚Äôs time we shook things up a little.
I hearyou, brother.
In fact, dig this.
I was meditating to that new
Ravi Shankar album last night... when I got this righteous notion--
What ifwe hold all our classes outside, on the playground ?
Imagine-- school, recess.
No boundaries.
Hey, baby, that‚Äôs a hip idea, but I got a better thought here.
As my first official act as principal,
I‚Äôve decided... to get rid ofrecess.
What ? No recess ?
But, Phil, for a kid, recess is like a major play-in.
It‚Äôs the one time ofday they have any freedom.
[ Sighs ]
Look, Pete, the ‚Äô60s are over.
All that peace and love and freedom stuff, it was great for pickin‚Äô up chicks, but it‚Äôs not gonna help my career.
To do that, I gotta make test scores go up, and to make test scores go up, I gotta keep kids in class where they belong.
That‚Äôs why, starting tomorrow,
I am tuning out recess... once and for all.
[PricKly]
Needless tosay,
Phillium ‚Äôsplan didn‚Äôtgo overall that well.
[ Shouting ]
- [ Protester] What do we want ?
- [ Crowd ] Recess !
- When do we want it ?
- Now !
- What do we want ? When do we want it ?
- Recess ! Now !
Be cool, people, be cool.
You‚Äôre bumming my mellowness.
We‚Äôll be cool when you give our kids their recess back.
Hey, baby,
I‚Äôll do what I want.
I‚Äôm principal ofthe school, and there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do about it. Dig ?
[ Shouting Continues ]
[Man]
It‚Äôsnotright!
- People, people, please calm down.
- [ Shouting Stops ]
Mr. Prickly here has informed me ofthis ‚Äò‚Äòno recess‚Äô‚Äô proposal.
Let me assureyou that as long as I‚Äôm superintendent, this radical plan will never be carried out in this district.
- [ Cheering ]
- Hey, man, youjust don‚Äôt get it !
Ofcourse I do, Benedict.
- That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm replacing you.
- What ?
- Prickly, from now on, you will be principal.
- Who, me ?
Oh, I see what‚Äôs going down here.
You tricked me, went around my back to the man to get myjob !
- No, Phil, it‚Äôs not like that at all.
- Yeah, right !
Come on, Muriel baby, let‚Äôs blow this scene.
No, Phil, it‚Äôs over. I could never be with a man who doesn‚Äôt love recess.
Soyou‚Äôre against me too.
Well, fine. I don‚Äôt need you.
I don‚Äôt need anyone !
- Aaah !
- Phil ! You okay, man ?
Don‚Äôt touch me !
You took my chick.
You took myjob.
Well, enjoy it whileyou can,
Petey boy,
‚Äôcauseyou‚Äôre gonna pay.
Somehow, someway, you‚Äôre gonna pay.
IneversawPhillium again.
He quit teaching, went into politics, eventually became secretary ofeducation-- until the president fired him for trying to get rid ofrecess again.
Only this time it was nationwide.
So that guy‚Äôs some weirdo ex-teacher who wants to get rid ofrecess ?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Now it‚Äôs personal.
Let‚Äôs see-- weather maps, some stuffin Norwegian, a Farmer‚ÄôsAlmanac.
Must be something in here that‚Äôll explain what that Dr. Benedict is doing.
I‚Äôll tell you one thing he‚Äôs not doing-- having lunch tomorrow at 1 2:22 with his little girlfriend.
Spinelli, that‚Äôs the man‚Äôs personal date book.
Well, it‚Äôs mine now, and I guess Miss Luna Pergum is gonna be at the restaurant all by herself.
- Who did you say ?
- The girl whose name is in here-- Luna Pergum.
Must be some Italian chick.
Lunaeperigeum.
Ofcourse !
- What areyou talking about ?
- Don‚Äôtyou understand ?
Lunaeperigeum is no lady.
It‚Äôs an event. Look.
Once a month, the moon reaches the point where it‚Äôs closest to the Earth-- lunar perigee, which in this case happens to be 1 2:22 tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe that‚Äôs when that doctor guy is gonna shoot his laser at the moon and blow it up.
Close guess, but I have another theory.
When I was up at space camp,
I observed some abnormalities in the moon‚Äôs position.
I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was causing it, but now it all makes sense.
Dr. Benedict‚Äôs device is not a laser beam at all. It‚Äôs a tractor beam !
You mean he‚Äôs gonna plow the moon‚Äôs surface ? Whateverwill he plant ?
Not a tractor, you goombah.
A tractor beam.
Like from a science fiction movie.
Precisely.
Theoretically, ifa powerful tractor beam... were shot at the moon exactly at lunar perigee, it could move the moon into another orbit.
Move the moon ? But why would anybodywant to do that ?
Who knows, Vince ?
Who knows ?
[Banging On Metal]
Here we are, sir.
I can‚Äôt believeyou have been creeping around in these vents.
They‚Äôre school property.
Dang ! The line‚Äôs dead.
Hey, what did you do with the walkie-talkie you confiscated from me last week ?
Top drawer, on the right.
Just lookwhat Phil‚Äôs done to my office.
I had it all nice and clean for the summer.
Packs ofgum, yo-yos, my old baseball--
Hey, I‚Äôve been looking for this.
Here it is-- mywalkie-talkie.
Now all I gotta do is contact the guys and--
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Detweiler ?
I told ‚Äôem that guywas a nut.
[ T.J. ] Hello !
Hello ! Is anybody there ?
It‚Äôs T.J. !
T.J., buddy, you‚Äôre okay ?
- Yeah, I‚Äôm fine, and so is Principal Prickly.
- Principal Prickly ?
I don‚Äôt have time to explain, but I thinkwe‚Äôve figured out what Benedict is up to.
He‚Äôs trying to get rid ofsummervacation !
No !
Guys, don‚Äôt freak out on me !
I got a plan ! All we do is--
Heh-heh. Why, Mr. Bald Guy, what a surprise.
T.J. ! T.J. !
- It‚Äôs dead !
- They must‚Äôve got him !
What are we gonna do ?
There‚Äôs only one thing we can do: we gotta get help.
[ Becky] Bow-wow ! Welcome to Floppy
Burger. May I takeyour order, please ?
- Becky, this is Vince.
- [ Becky] What areyou doing here ?
It‚Äôs notjust Vince, it‚Äôs me,
Gretchen, everybody. We got a problem !
I got a problem too-- six dweeby ten-year-olds who won‚Äôt leave me alone, even when I‚Äôm at work.
I am a professional ! So whatever your little problem is, forget it !
- But it‚Äôs about T.J .
- He‚Äôs in trouble, and he needs your help.
[ Becky ]
Well, isn‚Äôt that nice ?
After stealing my diary, threatening to put it on the Internet... and making me drive across the state three times, he needs my help ?
Give me one good reason why I should help him.
‚ÄôCause he‚Äôs your little brother, and he needs you.
Please pull forward to the second drive-thru window.
A confiscated walkie-talkie.
Why doyou do these things ? Doyou enjoy tormenting me ? Doyou hate me ?
I don‚Äôt hateyou, Phil.
I just thinkyou‚Äôre insane.
[ Chuckles ]
Insane.
Well, thereyou go again, Pete.
Insulting me, hurting my feelings,
Just like 30 years ago.
Only this time, Petey,
I‚Äôm ready.
You see, all thoseyears, no matter how big I got, no matter how successful,
I always thought aboutyou.
Howyou embarrassed me !
Howyou humiliated me !
Howyou destroyed my relationship with Muriel Finster, the onlywoman I ever loved !
- That part still grosses me out, sir.
- Shh.
This time, Pete,
I‚Äôm gonna humiliateyou.
I‚Äôm gonna prove to the world thatyou were wrong and I was right.
- About what ?
- About recess !
About freedom !
About test scores !
I‚Äôve found a way to prove my theory.
I‚Äôm gonna get rid of the biggest recess ofthem all.
I am gonna get rid ofsummervacation.
- You fiend !
- ‚Äò‚ÄòFiend.‚Äô‚Äô Try to help people, that‚Äôs the thanks you get.
- It‚Äôll neverwork, Phil.
- Well, actually, Pete, that‚Äôs whereyou‚Äôre wrong.
You see, all I have to do is modify the moon‚Äôs orbit ever so slightly, and tide levels on the Eastern Seaboard rise eight feet.
Move the moon over here, and the currents that warm California suddenly become ice-cold.
Summer, as we know it, will become a thing ofthe past.
And without summer,
- [ Both Gasp ]
- no summervacation.
- You‚Äôll never get away with this, Benedict.
- Oh, yeah ?
Well, who‚Äôs gonna stop me ?
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe my little brother... actually stumbled on a real, live evil conspiracy.
- That‚Äôs ourTheodore.
- You should see the crates ofsoda they left back there.
And boxes ofmustard and ketchup too.
Mmm, tomato-ey.
Hey, that‚Äôs stuffs the property of
Floppy Burger International.
Quityour gabbin‚Äô and step on it.
We need reinforcements.
[Cheering, Shouting]
[Cheering, Shouting]
[Finster] I‚Äôm tellingyou, a troop ofninja warriors... is using3rdStreetSchoolas asecretjujitsu trainingground.
- Ninja warriors. Elementary school.
- [ Snickering ]
Jujitsu training ground ?
Hey, lady, aren‚Äôtyou forgetting the magic laser beam ?
- I‚Äôm serious !
- So are we.
Hey, I got an idea-- Why don‚Äôtyou go home, get some rest... and we‚Äôll make a personal call toJackie Chan.
Yeah, he‚Äôs the perfect man for ajob like this.
I‚Äôm telling ya, something is going on in that school !
Help ! Help !
Somebody get us outta here !
- Calm down, Detweiler.
- Calm down ?
We‚Äôre locked in a giant birdcage while a madman‚Äôs trying to destroy summervacation, and you want me to calm down ?
- I understand, but I--
- How can you understand ?
You‚Äôrejust a grownup.
What doyou know about summervacation ?
I‚Äôll letyou in on a little secret, Detweiler.
Every adultyou‚Äôve ever known was a kid some time in his life.
You thinkwe don‚Äôt remember summervacation ?
Riding bikes by the creek ?
Catching polliwogs in ajar ?
Camping out under the stars ?
Well, you‚Äôre wrong.
Some days I sit in my office, looking out atyou kids on the playground, and I think, ‚Äò‚ÄòThey don‚Äôt know how good they‚Äôve got it.
In a fewyears, they‚Äôre all going to be grownups, like me, and all those good times will
Just be memories for them too.‚Äô‚Äô
So go ahead, put a whoopee cushion in my chair, cover my carpet with fake vomit, make fun of my big, saggy butt.
But don‚Äôtyou ever say I don‚Äôt care about summervacation,
‚Äôcause those memories are the last part ofchildhood I‚Äôve got left.
Principal Prickly,
I had no idea.
Yeah, well, nowyou do.
- So let‚Äôs stop messing around.
- How did you get those keys ?
Swiped ‚Äôem off Phillium‚Äôs desk when he wasn‚Äôt looking.
Now come on.
We‚Äôve got a summervacation to save.
[ All Chattering ]
People ! People !
Just quiet down for a moment !
Oh, man, nobody‚Äôs listening.
They‚Äôll listen to me, once I introduce them to my good friend Madam Fist.
Come on, Spinelli.
That‚Äôs your answer for everything.
I don‚Äôt seeyou coming up with any great ideas, sports boy.
Listen to the two ofyou.
You‚Äôre not helping at all.
[ All Arguing ]
[Gus]
Quiet!
What we need is a leader.
A kid with the right training.
A kid who knows strategy and field tactics.
A kid who commands respect.
Yeah, but where we gonna find a kid like that ?
Leave that to me.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
-[Gretchen Whistles]
Please !
We have to get organized.
Ah, what‚Äôs the use ?
Ifwhatyou say is true, all the fun ofbeing a kid is, like, totally ruined anyway.
- It‚Äôs like the whole world‚Äôs been turned right side up.
- [ All Agreeing ]
Not necessarily. All we have to do is work together and come up with a plan.
- Detweiler‚Äôs the one who always comes up with the plans.
- Let‚Äôs face it-- we‚Äôre doomed.
- [ All Agreeing ]
-[Spinelli] That‚Äôs what you thinK!
Kids ofthe playground, meet your new commanding officer.
Griswald ? He couldn‚Äôt lead a glee club.
You find that funny,
Bradley ?
Well, I‚Äôm not here to makejokes !
I‚Äôm here to make history !
So ifyou wanna laugh, take it somewhere else.
But ifyou wanna save the world, then suck in your gut and stand at attention.
Now who‚Äôs with me ?

Spinelli, you get the special forces.
- Special forces ?
- The kindergartners.
- I oweyou for this, Griswald.
- Now there‚Äôs one last thing
I need to say.
- [ Talking Ceases ]
- This mission is bigger than any one ofus kids.
Bigger than T.J .
Even bigger than Principal Prickly.
This, my friends, is about the future.
- Geez, he sounds like T.J .
- Shh. He‚Äôs on a roll.
Years from now when kids who aren‚Äôt even born yet look back on this moment, they‚Äôll say,
‚Äò‚ÄòThey did it.
Those kids saved
3rd Street School.
They saved summervacation.‚Äô‚Äô
So, boys and girls, we‚Äôre goin‚Äô in.
- Twenty-two minutes to perigee, sir.

Don‚Äôtyou everwatch old spy movies ?
This trick is pure gold.

Hey, you two aren‚Äôt guards.

Uh, Fenwick, why is the power off ?
Uh, perhaps we blew a fuse, sir ?
Well, go fix it !
We must restore the power.
Quickly, here.
Hey, whathappened?
Letus out!
Plan‚Äôs working, Gus.
Good. Now we gotta stop that laser beam before it‚Äôs too late.
That‚Äôs whatyou thinK, Kid.

Hey, baldy!
Sayyour prayers.
It‚Äôs chowder time.
[ Screaming ]
- Bull‚Äôs-eye !
- T.J. !
I knewyou guys would come back for us.
- Ooh, that‚Äôs gotta hurt.
- Six minutes to perigee !
Quick. To the auditorium.
And no running in the halls !
Emergency power system is in place.
Switch on the global electrode.
Power up the photon channeler.
Activate the tractor beam, quickly !
We‚Äôve only got four minutes left.
[PricKly]
You‚Äôvegotnominutes left, Phil.
This is my school and I want it back.
Sorry, Pete. You‚Äôrejust gonna have to wait until I finish making the world a better place.
- Now let‚Äôs get this show on the road.
- Don‚Äôt do it, Dr. Benedict !
[ Chuckles ] Don‚Äôt do it ?
You think after all this planning, all this work, you can get me to stopjust by saying, ‚Äò‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do it‚Äô‚Äô ?
- What ifwe add ‚Äò‚Äòplease‚Äô‚Äô ?
- [ Sighs ] You kids
Just don‚Äôt get it, doyou ?
Well, let me explain this in a wayyour little uneducated brains will understand.
The American public think test scores are too low.
But ifa person, say me, could make test scores go up, why, everybody‚Äôd feel better.
They might even elect that person...
President ofthe United States.
Now, doyou have any idea which countries have the highest test scores ?
- Um,Japan ?
- Germany ?
- Tierra Del Fuego ?
Canada, Iceland, Norway !
And why ? Because it‚Äôs snowing up there all the time.
Kids don‚Äôt waste their summers playing ball. They‚Äôre inside studying.
And that is why I‚Äôm getting rid ofsummervacation once and for all.
You got it all wrong, old man.
Your plan will neverwork.

Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again
Chihiro? Chihiro!
We're almost there.
This really is the middle of nowhere.
I'll have to shop in the next town.
We'll just have to make do.
Look, there's the elementary school.
That's your new school, Chihiro.
Why, it looks very nice.
I liked my old school.
Mom, my flowers got bent.
No wonder, the way you squeeze them.
A little water and they'll perk right up.
My first bouquet, and it's farewell flowers.
What about the rose you got for your birthday?
One rose? One rose isn't a bouquet.
You dropped the card.
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.
SPIRITED AWAY
Wait a minute. Did I take a wrong turn?
I don't get it.
That must be it up there.
The blue one on the end.
That's it.
I guess I turned off too soon.
Maybe if we go straight?
Oh, please. That's how we always get lost.
Let's just see what's up here.
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.
Dad, are you sure?
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.
Sit down, Chihiro.
What are you doing? Slow down!
There's a tunnel.
What's this building?
It looks like a gate.
Honey, I think we should go back.
Chihiro!
Honestly...
Look at this, it's just plaster.
This thing's pretty new.
The air's blowing in.
What is it?
Let's see what's on the other side.
It's creepy, Dad. Can't we go back?
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.
The movers will be there soon.
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.
I know, but...
No! I won't go.
Dad, let's go.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm staying here!
Chihiro, you wait in the car.
Mom...
Wait up!
Watch your step.
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.
Let's find out. It must be close.
Houses, way out here?
I knew it.
It's an abandoned theme park.
They built lots of them back in the nineties.
But they went bust when the economy tanked.
This must be one of them.
Wait, where are we going?
Let's go back, Dad.
Please!
Mom, that building's moaning.
It's just the wind.
What a lovely spot. We should've brought the sandwiches.
This would've been a river.
Do you smell something?
- Something smells good.
- You're right.
Maybe they're open for business after all.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
Wait for me!
This way.
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.
There's nobody here.
Over there.
Come on!
Come take a look.
This is amazing.
Hello, is anybody here?
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.
You got customers!
Don't worry. We'll pay when they show up.
You're right. Let's see now...
What kind of bird is this?
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.
I don't want any.
Can't we go? They'll be mad at us.
Don't worry, your father's here.
I've got credit cards and cash.
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.
- Mustard.
- Thanks.
Mom! Dad!
What a weird building.
A train!
You can't be here. Go now!
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!
They're lighting the lamps. Come on!
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!
What's his problem?
Dad?
Dad, let's go home.
Let's go, Dad!
Dad!
Mom!
Mommy!
Water!
No...
It's just a dream.
Wake up, wake up. Wake up!
Please wake up.
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.
Go away, disappear.
Disappear.
I'm fading away!
This has to be a dream.
Don't be afraid. I'm a friend.
No, no, no!
Open your mouth. Eat this.
Unless you eat something from this world, you'll disappear.
No!
Don't worry. You won't turn into a pig.
Chew it and swallow.
Good, now you'll be fine.
See for yourself.
I can touch you.
Of course. Now come.
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?
You can't see them now, but you will.
Quiet!
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.
I can't stand up. What should I do?
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.
In the name of the wind and water within, unbind her.
Stand up!
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.
I'm scared.
Be calm.
Welcome, your presence honors us.
Greetings, welcome.
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.
Welcome back. We've been waiting for you.
Just a little further.
Master Haku!
Where have you...
A human?
Run!
Master Haku, Master Haku!
I smell something.
A human intruder!
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.
No, Chihiro, you did very well.
Now listen. I'll tell you what to do.
If you stay here, they'll find you.
I'll distract them while you get away.
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.
You have no choice, if you want to survive here... and save your parents, too.
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.
Listen carefully.
After I'm gone, go through the back gate.
Take the stairs all the way down.
You'll find the boiler room where... they stoke the fires.
Look for Kamaji.
Kamaji?
Ask him for work.
If he refuses, keep asking.
If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.
Yubaba?
She's the sorceress who rules our world.
She'll try to trick you into leaving... but keep asking for work.
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.
Master Haku, Master Haku!
I have to go.
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?
You told me long ago.
My name is Haku.
Here I am!
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.
I know, I've been searching too.
Um...
Excuse me.
Um...
Are you Kamaji?
Haku sent me. Please let me work here.
What, all at once?
Get to work, you little runts!
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers that heat the baths.
Step on it, boys!
Please let me work here.
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.
I'll never run out of help.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait a second.
Out of the way.
Wait, what do I do with this?
Do I leave it here?
Finish what you start.
Get to work, runts! Wanna turn back into soot?
And you, better watch it. You can't just take someone's work.
If they don't work, their spell will be broken.
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.
You sootballs got a problem?
Get to work!
Chow time!
What, you guys at it again?
Give it a rest. Where's your bowl?
I keep telling you to leave it out.
Food's here. Break time!
The human! You're gonna catch it.
They're having a fit about it upstairs.
She's my granddaughter.
Your granddaughter!
She says she wants work, but I don't need any help.
Could you take her to Yubaba for me?
This girl can handle herself.
Not a chance. Yubaba would kill me.
Not even for this? Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.
If you want work, you have to sign a contract with Yubaba.
Might as well try your luck.
Fine! You there, follow me.
What about "Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?
Yes, ma'am.
What a klutz. Move it!
Yes, ma'am.
Leave the shoes. And the socks!
Yes'm.
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.
Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Yubaba lives on the top floor in the back.
Move it, will you?
You'll lose your nose.
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.
We're here.
Welcome, sir!
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.
Here we are.
Your room is on the right.
- Lin?
- Yes, sir!
Something smells.
It's human. You reek of human.
Is that so?
I smell it, I do. Smells mighty tasty, too.
You're hiding something.
Tell me the truth.
Maybe it's this.
Roasted newt? Give it here!
Not a chance. The girls asked me to get it.
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.
Pull the lever to go up, sir.
Can't you even knock?
What a plain little girl.
Now, come.
I said, come!
Ow...
What a racket. Could you be quiet?
Please...
Let me work here.
Stop your babbling.
Why do I need a weakling like you?
Besides, this is no place for humans.
Millions of spirits come here... to purge themselves of toil and care.
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.
Gobbling our guests' food like a couple of pigs.
Just deserts, I'd say.
And as for you, you'll never see your world again either.
You'd make a lovely piglet.
Or perhaps a lump of coal?
Trembling, aren't you?
Still, I'm impressed you made it this far.
Someone must've helped you.
I must thank your friend.
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.
Please let me work here!
Not that again!
I want to work here!
Shut your mouth!
Why on earth should I hire you?
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.
What job would I possibly have for someone like you?
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.
Or maybe I'll give you the nastiest job I've got... and work you night and day... until you breathe your very last breath!
Now, now. What's wrong, my dear?
I'm coming. That's a good baby.
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.
I want to work here!
Keep your voice down.
I'll be right there, just be patient.
That's a good baby. There, there.
Please give me a job!
All right, just pipe down.
There, there, good baby.
That's your contract.
Sign on the bottom line.
I'll put you to work.
But one peep out of you about anything... and I'll turn you into a piglet.
Should I sign here?
Where else? Quit dilly-dallying.
Unbelievable.
What a ridiculous oath I took.
I'm bound to give work to whoever asks.
- Finished?
- Yes.
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.
Quite a fancy name.
From now on, your name is Sen.
Understand? Sen.
Answer me, Sen!
I understand.
Yes ma'am?
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.
What is your name?
Chi... I mean, Sen.
Then follow me, Sen.
Haku, I...
No idle chatter.
Call me Master Haku.
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't give an order like that.
Humans aren't allowed here.
She signed the contract.
- What!
- I'll work hard.
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.
She won't stink after three days of our food.
If she doesn't measure up, do with her as you will.
Now go back to work. Where's Lin?
What, you're dumping her on me?
You wanted an assistant.
That's right! Lin's just perfect.
Go, Sen.
Yes sir.
What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.
Off you go.
Come on.
You pulled it off!
You're so thick, I was worried.
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.
What's wrong?
My legs are shaking.
This is where we live.
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.
Your apron. Keep it clean.
Trousers.
You're so puny.
Too big.
Lin, are there...
What?
Are there two Hakus here?
Two of that one? I sure hope not.
Still too big.
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.
Now where was that...
All right, here we go.
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.
What's all the noise, Lin?
New girl. Says she feels faint.
Meet me at the bridge. I'll take you to your mother and father.
My shoes are gone.
Thank you.
Follow me.
Dad, Mom, it's me!
It's Sen.
Mom! Dad!
Are they sick? Are they hurt?
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.
They don't remember they were ever human.
Listen to me! I promise
I'll save you.
Don't get too fat or they'll eat you.
Hide these.
I thought they were gone.
For when you go home.
This was a farewell card.
Chihiro?
Chihiro... That's my name!
Yubaba controls us by stealing our names.
You're Sen here. Keep your real name a secret.
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.
Without your real name, you'll never find your way home.
I no longer remember mine.
Your real name?
But it's strange, I remember yours.
Better eat, you must be hungry.
I don't want to.
I put a spell on them to give you back your strength.
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.
You know the way back.
Thanks Haku. I promise to work hard.
Where were you? I was worried.
Sorry.
Out of the way.
Come on, give it some elbow grease.
Starting today, you two are on the big tub.
What? That's Frog work!
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.
Aren't you getting wet?
Sen, come on!
Coming!
I'll leave this open.
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.
Just look at this. Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.
The big tub is reserved for our filthiest guests.
It's caked with sludge.
Lin! Sen! First customers are coming.
All right already!
Man, this is pure harassment.
Go get a tag from the foreman.
A tag?
For an herbal bath.
Right.
Lin, what's a foreman?
Something's coming. I wonder... ls some good-for-nothing using the rain to sneak in?
Absolutely not, it's too valuable to waste.
Good morning!
Feeling refreshed?
For Kasuga.
One deluxe sulfur bath.
No point standing there.
Back to work.
Scrub it with your hands.
Good morning!
Your bare hands.
But she said it has to be an herbal bath.
You just don't get it.
Mugwort, right?
Relax and enjoy.
Foreman. Yes ma'am!
Thank you!
But that's not...
Hey you, wait!
What's the trouble?
Oh, nothing at all.
We have an intruder.
A human?
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.
Wow, you got a really good one.
This goes straight to Kamaji.
Water should be right up.
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.
You're really are a klutz.
Look at that color.
This one has dried worm salts.
With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?
Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.
Okay.
Ouch!
Um... The bath's not ready yet.
So many...
They're for me?
But I don't need them.
No, you gave me one already.
Madam!
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.
It's headed straight for the bridge!
Please turn back.
Please go! The baths are closed for the night.
Please withdraw, please!
Stinky!
That's odd. Stink
Spirits feel different.
Well, now that it's here, better go greet it!
All we can do is get rid of it fast.
Everyone, please return to your rooms!
Please hurry. Terribly sorry!
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.
Yes sir!
Pay attention, this is your debut.
Show the customer to the big tub.
Remember, one peep out of you and you're coal.
- Got it?
- It has arrived.
No, that's not polite!
Welgum to our bazz.
Oh... Money...!
Hurry Sen, take it!
Yez ma'am.
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!
Diz way...
Sen!
Horrible!
Breakfast!
Open the windows, all of 'em!
What? Just a minute.
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.
What will she do?
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls with her dirty hands!
Did you give Sen new tags?
Never, what a waste!
All that precious herbal essence!
Sen! Sen, where are you?
- Lin!
- Are yo u okay?
I asked Kamaji to help us out.
He's sending his best herbal essence.
Thanks. There's a thorn or something stuck in him.
A thorn?
I can't pull it out.
A thorn? Hmm...
Get everyone downstairs!
Hurry!
Sen and Lin!
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.
Use this rope.
Yes ma'am!
Tie it good and tight!
Hurry up! Girls, lend a hand!
It's tied!
Everyone ready? All together now!
Heave!
And heave!
Heave!
Heave!
A bicycle?
I knew it. Now, heave!
Heave!
Sen, are you all right?
Well done.
Gold! It's gold!
Hands off! That's company property.
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.
Open the main gates! He's leaving!
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.
That was the guardian of a great river.
Everyone, learn from Sen!
Sake on the house tonight.
Now hand over all that gold you picked up.
Want some? I swiped them.
Thanks.
What a day.
Haku missed the whole thing.
Not Haku again!
Sometimes he just disappears.
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.
Really?
Lights out, Lin.
Okay.
There's a town. And the water's like an ocean.
What did you expect after all that rain?
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.
What's wrong?
Gold!
Who are you? You're no customer.
You're not allowed in there.
Hey, it's gold! For me?
You can make gold?
Gimme!
Who's down here?
It's way past lights out.
Hey boss, I'm hungry.
Starved, in fact.
That voice...
There, I'll pay you now.
I'm a customer. I want a bath.
Wake everyone up!
Mom and Dad, the river guardian gave me this medicine.
If you take it, you'll be people again.
Dad, Mom, where are you?
Daddy!
What an awful dream.
Lin?
Where is everybody?
Wow, it really did turn into an ocean!
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.
Kamaji lit the fires already.
Did I sleep that long?
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers!
Sen!
Lin?
I was just coming to wake you up, look!
Gold! He gave me real gold.
We've got a real high roller.
Please, sir, try this!
Throw us some gold!
I'm starving, bring it all!
Who's this guest?
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.
I'm going to see Kamaji.
I wouldn't go there now.
He's angry because they woke him up.
Lin, let's go back for more.
What if I can't recognize my parents?
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.
That's the dragon I saw.
It's coming this way.
Those aren't birds!
Haku, don't give up. Over here!
Haku!
It's just paper.
Haku? It is you, isn't it?
Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.
You're safe now.
He's going to Yubaba.
What should I do? He'll die!
Now the richest man in the whole wide world... has come to grace us with his presence.
Greetings!
Now let us appeal to his generosity.
Please, sir! Over here.
I hope I get some.
They say gold springs from his palms.
Toss some this way, sir!
What are you doing?
Going upstairs.
No you don't. What's this?
Blood!
Out of the way, we have a guest.
Thank you for your help.
Get out of the way!
I don't need it.
I'm busy, please excuse me.
Quiet! Quiet down.
Back, get back!
Please excuse her manners.
The girl is new and a human.
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.
Why, I would never...
He ate them!
Yubaba!
We're in a fine mess now.
He's a No Face.
That's right, a No Face!
Your greed attracted quite a guest.
Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.
Just look at this carpet.
Get Haku out of here.
He's useless to me now.
Bo, sleeping outside your crib again?
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.
Baba still has work to do.
Go back to sleep now, that's a good baby.
Ouch, let me go!
Oh, thanks for helping me.
But I'm in a hurry, please let me go.
You came to make me sick.
The outside has bad germs.
I'm a human. Maybe you never saw one before.
You'll get sick out there.
Stay here and play with me.
Are you sick?
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.
Staying inside will make you sick!
You see, someone I really care about is badly hurt.
I've got to go right now.
Please let me go.
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.
I'll break your little arm.
You're hurting me!
Please, I'll come play with you later.
No, I wanna play now!
Blood! See? It's blood!
Haku!
Go away!
It's you, isn't it?
Hang on!
Be quiet!
Haku!
Go away!
No!
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.
Please be a good boy and wait.
If you don't play with me I'll cry...
Please, wait!
What a racket. Simmer down.
You're a little butterball, aren't you?
I am a bit transparent here.
Baba...
Oh dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?
There, that gives you a little more freedom.
Let's see now. What shall we turn you into?
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...
I'll do the same to you.
Who are you?
Yubaba's older twin sister.
Thanks to you I've had a nice tour of the place.
Now hand over the dragon.
What are you going to do?
He needs help.
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.
He stole a valuable seal from my house.
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid... and eager to learn my sister's magical ways.
This boy will do anything that greedy woman wants.
Now step aside.
It's too late for him anyway.
The thing he stole had a protection spell.
Now the thief will die.
No, don't!
What are you up to now?
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.
Oh dear, that was careless...
Haku, no!
Haku!
What is this?
Hold on there!
Haku!
Does it hurt?
This is serious.
Haku, don't give up.
What can we do? He'll die!
Something inside him is eating him up.
Inside him?
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.
Eat it, maybe it will help.
Haku, open your mouth.
Please Haku, eat it.
See, it's safe.
Is it some kind of medicine?
Open your mouth. You can do it.
That's it.
Swallow it.
He spit something out. That's it!
The seal!
It's getting away.
There! Over there!
Sen, we have to purge the spell.
Begone!
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister.
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.
Precious loot, I'd say.
I knew it was Haku.
Kamaji, it's Haku!
Haku!
Haku, Haku!
Kamaji, he's not breathing.
He is, but he's still very ill from the spell.
That should calm him some.
Haku turned up one day, just like you.
He said he wanted to learn magic.
I tried to warn him.
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice is dangerous business.
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying... that he'd lost his home.
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.
He got paler and paler as time went by... and got a sharp gleam in his eye.
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Zeniba.
Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.
Tell me how to get there.
To Zeniba's house?
That's one scary sorceress.
Please.
Haku helped me. Now
I want to help him.
Well, getting there is one thing.
Getting back's the problem.
Wait a minute.
Let's see now, they're here somewhere...
Everyone, I need my shoes and clothes.
Sen! I've been hunting for you everywhere!
Lin...
Haku? What happened here?
Who are those guys?
My new friends.
Right?
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.
That big tipper turned out to be a No Face.
Yubaba says you let him in.
She might be right.
What, are you serious?
I thought he was a customer.
He's already swallowed three of our people!
Found them. Here they are, Sen.
We're busy, gramps.
You can use these.
Train tickets? Where'd you get those?
Leftovers from 40 years ago.
You get off at the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.
Swamp Bottom?
That's right, the sixth stop.
Six.
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train... but these days it's one way only.
Still want to go?
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.
What about Yubaba?
I'll talk to her now.
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.
What's going on here?
Don't you understand? It's love.
It just keeps getting bigger!
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.
Thank goodness, Sen!
Yubaba can't control him.
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.
Where's Sen? I want Sen!
Now hurry!
Yubaba, it's Sen.
Where were you?
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!
Win him over and take all his gold.
What's this filthy rat?
Don't you recognize him?
Of course not. How disgusting.
Now in you go.
Have a nice time.
Will she be all right?
Want to take her place?
Try this, it's yummy.
Want some gold? I've decided it's just for you.
Come over here.
What do you want? You can tell me.
Where did you come from?
There's someplace I have to go right away.
You should go home.
You can't give me what I want.
Where's your home? You must have a mom and dad.
No... No...
I'm lonely... So lonely...
Are you lost?
Sen... I want Sen.
Take the gold.
Would you eat me?
Take it.
Take it!
Before you eat me, eat this first.
I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.
Sen!
You little wench!
What did you feed me?
Watch out!
Not in my house!
I'm over here!
Here!
You'll pay for this!
Sen, down here!
Over here!
We don't need him.
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.
But where do we take him?
I don't know.
Don't know?
Great, now he's following us.
- From here you walk.
- Okay.
You'll find the station.
Thanks.
Be sure to come back!
I will.
Sen! I said you were a klutz.
I take it back!
No Face, hurt her and you'll get it from me!
There it is.
The train's coming, let's hurry.
To Swamp Bottom, please.
You want to come too?
One more, please.
Sit down.
Behave yourself, okay?
Kamaji.
Oh, Haku. You're awake.
Kamaji, where's Sen?
What happened? Please tell me.
Don't you remember anything?
Just fragments.
Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.
I followed her voice and woke up here.
Chihiro? So her name is Chihiro.
Wonderful...
It's the power of love.
This gold will hardly cover the damage.
That fool, Sen! She just cost me a fortune.
But we were saved, thanks to her.
Silence!
She started the whole thing.
Now she's run away.
Abandoned her own parents!
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.
No, wait.
Master Haku!
What, you're still alive?
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.
You've gotten pretty fresh.
Since when do you talk that way?
Bo?
Bo!
Pebbles!
Bo!
Where are you, Bo?
Please come out.
Bo!
Bo?
Why, you little...
Out with it!
Where did you hide my Bo?
He's with Zeniba.
Zeniba?
Now I understand. That evil witch.
She thinks she's beaten me.
So, what's your plan?
I'll bring him back.
But you must send Sen and her parents back to their world.
And what about you?
Maybe I'll send them back and then tear you to pieces.
I think this is right.
Come on.
You can ride on my shoulder.
Come in.
Thank you.
Well, hurry up then.
Come on.
So you all made it.
- I...
- Have a seat.
I'll make some tea.
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.
Do you know what this is?
No, but I know it's very precious.
I'm here to apologize for him. He's sorry.
You held this and nothing happened to you?
What?
Wait, the protection spell is gone.
I'm sorry. There was this strange bug.
I squashed it.
Squashed it!
My sister snuck that bug into the dragon... so she could control him.
And you squashed it!
Now then, sit down.
You must be No Face. You sit, too.
Please turn them back into themselves.
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.
They can change back any time.
Yubaba and I are two halves of a whole, but we don't get along.
You know what bad taste she has.
Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.
I'd like to help you dear, but there's nothing I can do.
It's one of our rules here.
You'll have to save your parents and your dragon boyfriend... all by yourself.
But can't you even give me a hint?
I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.
In that case it's easy.
Everything that happens stays inside you... even if you can't remember it.
It's already late. Why don't you stay the night?
You boys give me a hand.
Come on, keep at it.
See? You have a talent for this.
You're a big help.
It's not the same when you use magic.
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.
Haku could die while
I'm sitting here.
And they might eat my mom and dad!
Wait just a little longer.
There we are.
Use it to tie back your hair.
It's pretty.
It'll protect you. I made it from the thread we spun.
Thank you.
What good timing. We've got another guest, let him in.
Sure.
Haku!
Haku...
I'm so glad to see you.
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?
Thank goodness.
Good timing, I'd say.
Zeniba, Haku's alive.
Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.
But be sure to protect this girl.
Okay boys, time you went home.
Come see me again soon.
You stay with me and be my helper.
Zeniba!
Thank you, I'm going now.
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
My real name is Chihiro.
Chihiro? What a nice name.
Take good care of it.
I will!
Now off you go.
Thank you, Zeniba. Goodbye!
Haku, listen.
I don't remember this, but my mom told me about it.
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.
But I just remembered.
The river was called... it was called the Kohaku River.
Your real name is Kohaku.
Chihiro, thank you!
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
What a name! Sounds like a guardian spirit.
I remember how you fell into me as a child.
You were chasing your shoe.
Yes, and you carried me to shallow water.
I'm so happy...
They're back!
You brought Bo back with you?
Baba!
Bo! You're not hurt? What a terrible time you had.
Bo, when did you learn to stand on your own?
Yubaba, remember your promise.
Send Chihiro and her parents back to their world.
Sorry, but it's not that simple.
This world has rules, you know.
Silence!
Just do it, Baba. Don't be so mean.
Baby had such a good time.
But I'm just following the rule.
Otherwise I can't break the spell.
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.
But...
Granny!
Granny?
I'll do as you ask.
Haku told me about the rule.
Well, you've got guts.
I brought your contract. Follow me.
This won't take a minute, Bo.
Don't worry.
See if you can pick out your parents for me.
You get one guess.
Pick them out and you all go free.
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.
Not here? Is that your answer?
Yes.
You're right!
Attagirl! Good for you.
Thank you everyone.
All right! You win, just get out of here.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
See you soon.
- Haku!
- Let's go.
Where's Mom and Dad?
They went on ahead.
The water's gone.
I can't go any further.
Go back the way you came.
But don't look back until you're out of the tunnel.
But what about you?
I'll tell Yubaba I'm quitting my apprenticeship.
I'm fine now. I have my name back.
Now I can go home too.
Will we meet again somewhere?
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?
Promise.
Now go, and don't look back.
Chihiro!
Where have you been? Hurry up.
Mom! Dad!
Don't go running off like that.
Let's go.
Mom, are you really okay?
Hurry, the moving van will be there.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
Watch your step.
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.
The end of the tunnel.
Hey!
What is it?
Will you look at that.
It's all dusty inside, too.
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...
I told you not to stop here.
That's it, you're fine.
We're off, Chihiro.
Chihiro! Hurry up!

The End
{2094}{2167}Horror and devastation lay in their wake.
{2197}{2256}The source of their terrifying power...
{2259}{2339}lay within a chamber on planet Uroboris.
{2367}{2492}The waters it contained|held the promise of everlasting life.
{2537}{2623}The chamber could only be opened|with a single key...
{2625}{2680}which, if ever found...
{2692}{2818}would guide its bearer back|to the fountainhead of immortality.
{2860}{2971}However, the key would drive|all who touched it insane.
{3013}{3123}When the Arakacians were finally defeated,|the chamber was locked...
{3126}{3227}and the key, cast out deep into space.
{3246}{3306}It has never been found...
{3324}{3376}until now.
{5539}{5596}Give it up, why don't ya!
{5641}{5698}Damn! Not again!
{5786}{5855}I can't wait to get|those new matter munchers.
{5870}{5940}I've had just about enough|of these cheap heads.
{6294}{6366}Tyler, major find here!
{6373}{6400}What is it?
{6496}{6531}I don't know.
{6925}{6995}Careful, it could be a Class 4 biohazard.
{7013}{7056}What is that thing?
{7119}{7153}What's it doing?
{7703}{7756}It's weird.
{8090}{8123}What's going on?
{8150}{8179}Are you okay?
{8218}{8275}Should I call for a containment crew?
{8405}{8432}No, please!
{9158}{9227}The guardian has revealed himself!|The key has been found!
{9270}{9368}Odin, tell us. Is the day|of the great darkness at hand?
{9374}{9501}Yes. It is written in the Old Books.|The coming back time has begun.
{9573}{9622}Evil will descend upon us!
{9629}{9686}We must prepare to defend the chamber!
{10202}{10241}Sanders, sector 3!
{10249}{10250}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10250}{10318}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10320}{10381}What? How long|have they been down there?
{10386}{10457}Over 12 hours. They must be going nuts.
{10510}{10611}Weird. System checks out,|but no response. Deadsville.
{10619}{10700}Send someone down there.|I want to know what's going on.
{10718}{10776}I need a big ship to get somewhere.
{10780}{10830}What the hell do you think you're doing?
{10832}{10872}Security. To the bridge!
{11105}{11148}Any other stupid questions?
{11238}{11334}You, fat boy. Name and duties.
{11351}{11426}- Lambert, sir. Navigation's Officer.|- Drive.
{11480}{11513}Germain St. Germain.
{11515}{11590}When I want your name, shit brain,|I'll ask for it.
{11595}{11634}Take over engineering.
{11642}{11713}Plot a course for BR-549, sector 7.
{11734}{11797}And somebody better|get rid of this garbage.
{11911}{11940}By the way...
{11970}{12035}you have 20 seconds|to get us out of here.
{17720}{17745}Hi.
{17747}{17789}What are you still doing here?
{17791}{17852}I know. I'm going to be late for school.
{17858}{17887}Where's Dad?
{17890}{17964}He's at the council meeting.|I thought you were supposed to go.
{18361}{18425}Do you believe|any of that immortality crap?
{18444}{18501}Think about it. A stupid key?
{18524}{18572}Call him a liar, and see what happens.
{18574}{18636}Listen, this guy's getting weirder|by the day.
{18638}{18708}Imagine in 10 years? Hell, 100.
{18742}{18777}You've got a point.
{18781}{18875}I am getting sick of it.|Going all over the bloody place.
{18888}{18941}Looking for a stupid compound!
{19019}{19091}- What have you got?|- A FAKK 2 planet, sir.
{19114}{19181}Death to all carbon based life forms.
{19219}{19298}Federation Assigned Kitogenic Killzone|to the second level.
{19300}{19359}Which means it's a dead planet.
{19369}{19400}Scan it anyway.
{19457}{19493}I don't get it.
{19511}{19551}There's life out there.
{19553}{19626}The FAKK 2 must have been|from an old registry.
{19632}{19716}I want a bio-scan for compound H2O-471.
{19910}{19973}There are small traces in their systems.
{20010}{20067}Yeah. Immortality all over the place.
{20090}{20115}You!
{20128}{20186}Just remember you're not immortal yet!
{20222}{20266}What's this place called?
{20342}{20370}Eden, sir.
{20439}{20479}Welcome to paradise.
{20654}{20737}And our irrigation program|is already showing promise.
{20750}{20837}Agro-production is up five percent|in the last six months.
{20845}{20904}Phase two of our expansion project...
{20906}{21011}the development of the Noma Valley,|will begin in three weeks as scheduled.
{21023}{21111}Things look good, ladies and gentlemen.|Our future is bright.
{21475}{21588}- Help Kerrie. I'll get our air defences up!|- Be careful! I'll see you up there!
{21679}{21717}Quickly. This way!
{22562}{22589}Kerrie!
{25735}{25761}Julie.
{25800}{25827}Father!
{26844}{26919}Looks like the boys|got a little trigger-happy.
{26936}{27016}When making an omelette,|one breaks a few eggs.
{27219}{27269}Here, let me help you.
{27338}{27387}They attacked.
{27405}{27494}- You okay?|- We never had a chance.
{27521}{27609}Hey, look at this! A live one!
{27635}{27667}Leave her alone!
{27836}{27907}Get off of me! Let me go!
{28085}{28146}Feisty and sexy.
{28149}{28213}Careful boys, this one's a keeper.
{28258}{28304}- Pack 'em up!|- Yes, sir!
{28315}{28375}Splitsville, boys! We're moving out!
{28630}{28661}Wait for me!
{28673}{28738}Lover-boy, you're on your own.
{28746}{28806}You can't just leave me here like this!
{28834}{28876}Wait a minute, man...
{29018}{29091}Like the sign says, a dead planet.
{29838}{29906}This won't hurt. It's just a DNA test.
{29909}{29977}The good stuff comes later.
{30043}{30087}Start with the others, Doc.
{30093}{30188}- This one's special.|- But of course.
{30242}{30293}What I need is in your system.
{30305}{30347}Not enough to make you immortal...
{30349}{30474}but it probably keeps your people|beautiful and healthy. Especially you.
{30492}{30538}I'll save you for last.
{30543}{30619}And if you're lucky, my dear,|and play your cards right...
{30621}{30697}we'll spend a lot of quality time together.
{30903}{30981}Perfect. I knew|you wouldn't disappoint me.
{31055}{31085}Clean her up!
{31096}{31156}And I don't have to remind your kind...
{31174}{31209}she's mine.
{33793}{33836}I should have been a cook!
{33866}{33914}Try this for an appetiser!
{33916}{33998}- I didn't do anything! I swear!|- You're one of them!
{34000}{34082}No! I mean, I was, but I ran away!|I didn't kill anybody!
{34084}{34116}Who did this?
{34118}{34180}He took over our ship|and forced us to come here!
{34182}{34231}- Who?|- His name's Tyler!
{34233}{34263}Why did he attack?
{34265}{34332}He's nuts!|He thinks he's going to live forever!
{34335}{34431}Where did he go? You've got one second.
{34446}{34470}One....
{34504}{34550}Wait! I'll take you to him!
{34553}{34606}- Where?|- Do we have a deal?
{34674}{34786}- How long to fix this Spacehawk?|- Two hours, max! I'm almost there.
{34855}{34944}You dropped your wrench.|Aren't you going to pick it up?
{34967}{34991}Yeah.
{35115}{35152}What did I do?
{35576}{35616}I am a genius.
{35676}{35735}Doc, this had better work.
{35997}{36048}I like the hint of lemon.
{36075}{36108}I'm so glad.
{36159}{36187}Yes!
{36422}{36457}So, where are we going?
{36502}{36563}He said he needed to get to a jump port.
{36568}{36635}Computer, set co-ordinates|for the closest spaceport...
{36637}{36694}that can handle a class C vessel.
{36703}{36802}Searching. Confirmed.|Neo Calcutta. Course set.
{36809}{36859}ETA 93.7 hours.
{37218}{37255}So, what's your name?
{37293}{37369}Don't talk, don't touch,|don't even breathe...
{37372}{37463}or I kill you. Got it?|- I got it.
{38783}{38839}Request incoming docking co-ordinates.

{39744}{39804}Confirmed. Cleared for docking.
{40679}{40725}You like this place?
{40736}{40783}Looks like a lot of your type.
{40823}{40911}After four days stuck in a Spacehawk,|getting the cold shoulder...
{40913}{40985}it's not so bad.|We could have a lot of fun here.
{40989}{41040}What are you, socially deprived?
{41042}{41131}I'm not socially deprived.|Well, maybe a little.
{41163}{41271}'¬¥Sit down! What are you looking at?|You snore!
{41284}{41346}'¬¥Get outta my face! Shut the fuck up!'¬¥
{41376}{41439}This is heaven compared|to where I come from.
{41458}{41491}Shut the fuck up.
{41668}{41786}Are you sure this guy Tyler is looking|for a jump port? And to where?
{41905}{41977}We're talking high-grade,|silicone-rubber flesh here.
{41979}{42093}And a PVC skeleton with plastic ball|and socket joints for optimum movement.
{42105}{42185}You can customise her|with a choice of seven synthetic hair dyes.
{42187}{42287}And optional entry ports|with four speeds of suction!
{42323}{42359}Loveable, isn't she?
{42397}{42433}Check this out.
{42435}{42529}She's loaded with the latest micro-sensor|orgasmatronic technology...
{42534}{42585}and an expandable vocabulary...
{42587}{42669}of over 200 dirty words.
{42671}{42747}Test results indicate|she's better than the real thing.
{42758}{42828}Go on, Venus.|Show the gentleman what you got.
{42910}{42977}Please select your sexual preference.
{42981}{43070}Vaginal. Anal. Oral. Other.

{43150}{43214}I don't know, 2,000....
{43219}{43306}Unless, of course,|you'd prefer the Fellation Blowfish.
{43326}{43439}Sick, twisted, low-life, scum sucking pig!
{43447}{43504}At least I'll have someone to talk to.
{43534}{43556}What?
{43562}{43625}That's him. The tall one.
{43683}{43759}- Let's go.|- I'll wait here.
{43768}{43849}But he'll see me.|You don't know what he's like.
{43865}{43894}Chicken shit.
{45153}{45193}God, this is fun!
{45717}{45757}Nobody touches these...
{45817}{45843}but me!
{45882}{45908}Bar towel!
{46293}{46368}Hello? Captain Tyler,|Metal Mammoth Mining.
{46372}{46416}We need some drinks!
{46529}{46605}We should make it fast.|We don't want to miss the jump.
{46623}{46654}Screw the jump!
{46665}{46718}I've got all the time in the world!
{46720}{46786}Besides, something just came up.
{46853}{46916}You just found the man of your dreams.
{48512}{48599}When you kill someone, darling,|make sure he's dead.
{48620}{48649}What the hell?
{49856}{49903}Looks like happy hour is over.
{49924}{50012}- Who's gonna pay for all of this?|- This ought to take care of it.
{50015}{50067}Here. Keep the change.
{50081}{50131}What? Holy shit!
{50144}{50169}Grenades!
{50647}{50673}Julie?
{50791}{50828}Are you all right?
{50903}{50986}He died! And then he was alive again!
{50999}{51031}Now you know.
{51062}{51122}I don't know dick! How does he do it?
{51124}{51171}He's got this weird potion!
{51173}{51236}And a key leading him|to the Chamber of lmmortality.
{51238}{51291}Why didn't you tell me that before?
{51294}{51370}'¬¥Sit down. Get outta my face!|Shut the fuck up!'¬¥
{51449}{51542}So if I take away his potion,|he'll stay dead, right?
{51544}{51616}If you can get close enough.
{51688}{51727}That's him, isn't it?
{51731}{51778}Son of a bitch, he's getting away!
{51796}{51868}What more could the universe want|in a tyrant?
{51889}{51957}Perfect body, perfect mind.
{51993}{52067}- Irresistible charm.|- Perfect psycho!
{52093}{52172}Psycho? Time to come out and play.
{52174}{52217}Don't even think about it!
{52307}{52385}The hyperspace jump.|There's always something.
{52420}{52481}I'll make it up to you later, sweetheart.
{52514}{52577}Let me out of here, you bastard!
{52981}{53063}Cortez to Jump Control.|Set lock-in for Uroboris.
{53067}{53142}No pre-set lock-in. Set co-ordinates.
{53152}{53240}Quadrant 9, sector 4013,|in the Terackian system.
{53250}{53293}Scanning location.
{53313}{53379}Warning. No returnjump port.
{53390}{53436}Please confirm lock-in.
{53451}{53481}Confirmed.
{53504}{53556}It'll take us forever to get back!
{53573}{53632}That won't be a problem,|once we get there.
{53716}{53777}We'll never make it!|This thing's a death trap!
{53811}{53896}- It's gotten us this far.|- This far is nowhere.
{53901}{53957}Spacehawk in hyperspace equals death!
{53961}{53996}Stow the bag.
{54582}{54670}- Are you nuts?|- I'm not going to lose him now.
{55356}{55428}You can't just piggyback their jump!
{55597}{55685}A tractor beam! Are you insane?|We're going to rip to...
{56294}{56364}- What the hell is that?|- We've got company.
{56373}{56440}Excuse me, '¬¥company'¬¥?|What do you mean '¬¥company'¬¥?
{56445}{56522}See that blip? It's like|somebody hitched onto our jump.
{56524}{56631}That could change our trajectory.|I want them dead! Now! Take 'em down!
{56638}{56713}But I've never heard of anyone|firing on a ship in hyperspace.
{56715}{56784}Do you have a better idea? Do it! Now!
{56789}{56828}Man, that's suicide.
{57080}{57161}- We lost them all. They're toast.|- Send the bomber.
{57197}{57271}One more word, and I'll send you.
{57466}{57547}We're hit! I knew it!
{57557}{57601}This is all your fault!
{57752}{57790}Do something!
{58119}{58160}The tunnel's breaking up!
{58172}{58225}We're not going to make it!
{58485}{58529}Yes! Do it!
{59288}{59348}I sense the key is here.
{59390}{59492}For the moment, it is best|if Zeek and I assess the threat alone.
{61608}{61640}My ampoules.
{61804}{61867}I'm afraid it's down to you.
{61889}{61941}No. Please.
{62139}{62181}Lambert, damage report.
{62237}{62278}I want a damage report!
{62552}{62591}Don't worry, I'm fine.
{62604}{62656}Yeah? Like I give a shit!
{62668}{62741}What's the status|on the double D-40s and munitions?
{62755}{62791}We found a wheel.
{62795}{62823}Personnel?
{62864}{62920}Seventy-eight percent dead or missing.
{62922}{62953}Life-scan?
{63008}{63104}There's a town, looks like|it's about 10 or 12 miles north of here.
{63119}{63150}Flight status?
{63165}{63207}You've got to be kidding.
{63211}{63273}Gather the weapons,|what's left of my men...
{63275}{63330}shoot the injured. We're moving on.
{64035}{64088}Was it good for you?
{64169}{64215}I'll start you off like this.
{64217}{64320}The next step, in three or four days,|depending on your production...
{64323}{64384}will be the body tank.
{64439}{64469}You're sick!
{64495}{64550}I'm a sick genius.
{65836}{65874}I can't breathe.
{65896}{65941}Get off my face!
{66017}{66049}What are you?
{66051}{66109}I'm Zeek, what are you?
{66210}{66249}You're so soft.
{66269}{66319}I'm harder than you think, stone man.
{66321}{66414}Please, you must not touch|my master Odin's property.
{66418}{66490}He's left me with the responsibility|to guard it.
{66500}{66597}Relax, your thing is safe with me.|Where is your master?
{66600}{66631}I am Odin.
{66640}{66747}Please excuse my little friend,|he takes his duties very seriously.
{66750}{66827}- What are you called?|- FAKK Julie.
{66870}{66964}Julie, soft. Very soft.
{66983}{67036}You're not from our world, are you?
{67043}{67098}Hardly. What is this place?
{67110}{67207}Uroboris. Some call it home.|Others call it hell.
{67216}{67275}My master says you come from the sky.
{67278}{67343}Do you have it? Do you have the key?
{67355}{67405}I don't know anything about a key.
{67407}{67473}I crashed here trying to kill a madman,|who won't die.
{67475}{67519}I did see two fireballs.
{67534}{67623}The other was headed in the direction|of a city called Shantaar.
{67646}{67713}It's not far from here. We'll take you there.
{67740}{67794}So please, come with us.
{67818}{67883}Tell me more about this madman.
{67908}{68000}Bastard named Tyler,|killed everyone I ever cared about.
{68005}{68120}Our legends say that|whoever carries the key, becomes insane.
{68145}{68190}That's him all right.
{68235}{68300}I'm sorry. I sense your sadness.
{68313}{68377}It's hard to be the last of your people.
{70009}{70079}Not much of an army. But it's a start.
{70099}{70190}Look. The ugliest one seems|to be sitting in my chair.
{70828}{70865}Hey, you, ugly!
{70901}{70975}Your mother is a Hectarian|whore's handbag!
{71818}{71903}Molten lava? We have to cross this?
{71910}{71989}Yes, Shantaar lies on the other side.
{72031}{72117}- I hate this place.|- How are we going to cross?
{72183}{72306}I am Chartog, guardian of the Red River.
{72314}{72356}I know the way across...
{72383}{72431}and I will tell you.
{72469}{72512}You just have to...
{72547}{72586}kiss me.
{72600}{72627}No way.
{72655}{72722}What's the matter, my precious?
{72758}{72836}Don't you find me attractive?
{72885}{72948}If this is what it takes to kill Tyler....
{72985}{73072}That's a good girl. Help your friends.
{73085}{73142}It will be over soon.
{73162}{73223}Who will I have to kiss to get back?
{73490}{73528}What are you doing?
{73557}{73596}We're waiting for you.
{73635}{73710}Son of a bitch! Kiss this!
{73819}{73881}Your people have strange customs.
{73936}{73975}Tell me about it.
{74574}{74662}Mortality sucks, immortality sucks.
{74675}{74716}Everything sucks.
{74789}{74816}Oh, shit.
{74877}{74922}This really sucks.
{75767}{75813}Is he the one you search for?
{75850}{75876}Oh, yeah.
{76061}{76107}Yeah! Come on, Tyler!
{76476}{76543}I'm your new leader! Me!
{76723}{76768}Now we're up the creek.
{77058}{77104}When you kill someone...
{77167}{77210}make sure they're dead!
{77394}{77423}Yo, baby.
{77704}{77819}I am Tyler! Your new lord!
{78118}{78197}Blind adulation makes me so horny.
{78226}{78259}Bring me a wench!
{78448}{78525}Master, he's the one with the key, isn't he?
{78572}{78642}He's far too powerful for us|to deal with alone.
{78644}{78678}Leave that to me.
{78683}{78795}Julie, you are too impulsive.|Please, think about this.
{78802}{78863}- Think about what?|- The key.
{78889}{78968}- You don't understand.|- You worry about the key.
{78977}{79016}Tyler's mine.
{79092}{79179}She is letting her thirst|for revenge rule her mind.
{79891}{79950}A little retro, but hey....
{80200}{80241}Where'd they find you?
{80273}{80386}I hear you're very special.|I've come a long way to meet you.
{80489}{80605}- You're not a robot, are you?|- Why don't you find out for yourself?
{80626}{80694}I could say I've died|and gone to heaven, but...
{80715}{80757}that wouldn't be true.
{80766}{80857}Which part, the dying or the heaven?
{80932}{80955}You.
{81080}{81158}I know I'm irresistible,|but what do you want?
{81166}{81208}I want you...
{81231}{81279}and what you have.
{81284}{81352}There's a price to pay for immortality...
{81356}{81424}and the universe is going|to pick up the tab.
{81455}{81490}How original.
{81505}{81559}Every king must have a queen.
{81597}{81632}Do you want me?
{81656}{81697}Take a wild guess.
{81815}{81843}Forever?
{81866}{81894}Shut up.
{82162}{82198}Not this time!
{82257}{82283}Bitch!
{82289}{82335}Time to die!
{82474}{82497}Die!
{82641}{82677}What are you doing?
{82707}{82801}- Stop!|- I can't! The master told me!
{82877}{82912}You stupid rock!
{83167}{83241}What does it take to get laid around here?
{83258}{83350}I had him! Ten more seconds,|and he was dead!
{83366}{83414}We thought you were in trouble.
{83424}{83492}Julie, it's too late.
{83507}{83567}It's not just about you and Tyler.
{83588}{83680}What Tyler seeks lies within the walls|of the Holylands.
{83705}{83806}He will come and we will all be judged.
{83845}{83912}What do you mean you can't find them?
{83932}{84038}How do you lose a 6-foot bitch|with a talking rock?
{84087}{84123}How do you do that?
{84126}{84210}- We looked everywhere.|- You idiots!
{84218}{84245}Gather the troops!
{84286}{84324}This is it?
{84362}{84459}I sure could use a drink|and a little social give and take.
{84520}{84565}There goes that idea.
{84961}{85065}Can we stop for a moment?|I'm not as young as I once was.
{85077}{85125}I'll see what lies beyond.
{85224}{85268}Eden was beautiful.
{85283}{85329}Then he destroyed it.
{85338}{85396}Master, come see!
{86012}{86081}It's time for the next phase.
{86156}{86179}Please.
{86188}{86262}In five minutes, you will lose all senses.
{86339}{86410}It will seem like a very peaceful dying.
{86426}{86492}What? We have company.
{87691}{87724}Do you like this?
{87948}{87994}You shouldn't have done that.
{88397}{88466}Now I'm really upset!
{88560}{88656}I am worried, Master.|The soft one has been inside too long.
{88706}{88767}Here, kitty.
{88799}{88847}I know where you are.
{88849}{88913}I can smell you.
{89076}{89104}Help me!
{89230}{89312}- Kerrie, what about the others?|- They're all dead.
{89361}{89391}Hang on to me.
{89528}{89554}It's okay.
{89599}{89628}Nearly there.
{89766}{89794}Hurry, run!
{90407}{90453}Isn't that where we crashed?
{90511}{90544}My ampoules!
{90798}{90862}I've had it up to here with that bitch!
{90874}{90995}When I find her, I'll make her immortal|so I can screw her and kill her...
{90999}{91093}every hour of every day for all eternity!
{91101}{91155}We march on the Holyland now!
{91349}{91417}Where the key goes, horror follows.
{91419}{91482}All in the sacred name of immortality.
{91511}{91537}Why us?
{91541}{91620}Do your ancient books|not teach you about the Arakacians?
{91623}{91664}We have no ancient books.
{91672}{91738}They were destroyed|so our people could live in peace...
{91740}{91793}without the memory of past evil.
{91822}{91914}To forget history is|to allow evil to rise again, Julie.
{91927}{91983}More sinister and ruthless than ever.
{91986}{92066}- Is Tyler an Arakacian?|- He is not.
{92072}{92174}Many centuries ago, the Arakacians|discovered an ancient tear...
{92179}{92263}in the fabric of the universe|from which flowed a liquid...
{92265}{92318}capable of bestowing immortality.
{92332}{92434}They enslaved my ancestors|and forced them to build a chamber...
{92437}{92524}in the Holylands to contain|this unnatural power.
{92548}{92628}And so it was that the Arakacians|ruled in infamy until...
{92630}{92751}my people were able to lock the chamber|and cast the key deep into space.
{92771}{92876}Without their life-giving waters,|the Arakacians became mortal...
{92895}{92958}and we were finally able to defeat them.
{92976}{93022}But now Tyler has the key.
{93025}{93107}Yes. The key which holds|the promise of immortality...
{93110}{93190}but also renders its bearer insane.
{93197}{93238}Such is the curse.
{93265}{93338}The promise of immortality?|He's already invincible.
{93340}{93392}No. He is not.
{93425}{93501}The key is guiding him|to the everlasting waters...
{93504}{93548}but he has yet to reach them.
{93550}{93601}Why did he have to destroy Eden?
{93606}{93678}The Arakacians also occupied your colony...
{93687}{93778}and stored some of the liquid there|as they ravaged the universe.
{93793}{93847}Over time it seeped into the earth.
{93851}{93930}Your people absorbed traces of it|into their systems.
{93937}{93997}Which Tyler distilled from their bodies!
{94032}{94088}Not enough to render him immortal...
{94090}{94160}but now he has the strength|to reach the chamber.
{94162}{94249}A whole people destroyed|because of the lust for power of one man.
{94260}{94356}It has happened before, Julie.|It will happen again.
{94385}{94417}Not with Tyler.
{95737}{95789}Welcome back, Master Odin!
{96153}{96240}- Odin, the key? ls it here?|- I'm afraid so.
{96256}{96299}As we speak, the carrier...
{96301}{96392}and the vile scum of Shantaar|descend upon our city.
{96414}{96516}We have done all we can to prepare.|We will fight to the death.
{99069}{99108}You know each other?
{99113}{99164}He tried to save me at the school.
{99177}{99210}It was nothing.
{99244}{99285}And where did you meet?
{99301}{99330}We're sisters.
{99361}{99389}Sisters!
{99419}{99488}The elders have been killed!|There's a traitor among us!
{99490}{99522}Warn the others!
{99583}{99611}There it is.
{99641}{99730}The Chamber of lmmortality,|that holds the everlasting waters.
{100686}{100716}The last one.
{101389}{101450}Everybody fight! Come on!
{102731}{102768}This is going to suck!
{104471}{104500}You fool!
{104514}{104565}That was my last one!
{105873}{105942}- Thank you, soft one.|- Anytime.
{106384}{106413}Hey, asshole!
{106452}{106478}You again!
{107855}{107894}Did you miss me?
{108273}{108331}You always hurt the ones you love.
{108340}{108371}Like this?
{108620}{108713}Hold that pose. I'll be right back.
{109364}{109451}It's mine. It's all mine!
{109934}{110029}Bring it on, bitch!|You're really starting to piss me off!
{110038}{110116}You are not worthy of the Holy Waters!
{110156}{110183}Not today.
{110802}{110869}Remember this on your way to hell!
{110942}{110974}FAKK 2!
{111021}{111114}The insanity has to end now.
{111255}{111305}We must destroy the key.
{111350}{111385}Perhaps not!
{111508}{111532}Why?
{111560}{111674}Because I am Arakacian!
{111680}{111761}My charade fooled|the insufferable Holylanders!
{111766}{111813}And even that little stone idiot!
{111815}{111889}What makes you think|a pathetic mortal could stop me?
{112735}{112774}You fools!
{113366}{113423}I must fulfil my destiny.
{113961}{114034}- You must!|- Zeek, I command you!
{114272}{114360}Good-bye, soft one. I'll never forget you.
{115194}{115220}It's over.
{115367}{115438}- Let me help you.|- Oh, no. He survived.
{115462}{115491}Are you okay?
{115507}{115570}What does it look like, you dickhead?
{115783}{115869}Eternity is a long time to spend alone.
{115886}{115930}What are you talking about?
{115966}{116031}Does this mean|we're all going to be immortal?
{116055}{116100}'Cause if that's true, you know....
{116102}{116168}Listen, I'm going to be around|for a long time.
{116185}{116219}Who took the key?
{116231}{116276}Does this mean we're friends now?
{116278}{116348}'Cause I've been putting up|with a lot of your crap, so...
{116364}{116448}l think it's payback time.|Come on, you know you love me.
{116919}{117026}And so the key to the chamber|of immortality...
{117028}{117149}was once again cast out|into the silent gulfs of space...
{117189}{117314}with a new stone protector|to guard it against evil.
Huh?
What the... Aw.
Oh...
I hate Mondays.
Pooky, cover me.
I'm goin' in.
Alley... oop.!
B- b-b-b-b-bah, ha!
Oh, Sleeping Beauty, wake up.
You can stop dreaming about me because I'm here.
Now, just wake up.
You've got work to do.
You're not just my owner, you're my primary caregiver.
- Now be a...
- Not now, Garfield.
Get... A-Ah...
Just... All right.
Cut the sweet stuff.
Easy now. Just...
Trying to cuddle with me, huh?
Trying to avoid your duties, huh?
Well, that just ain't gonna... fly!
It isn't gonna work with m... me.
See, I'm getting my exercise, doin' my job.
Just one quick cannonball!
- Oh!
- Morning.
Garfield!
Okay! I think you're clean enough now.
- H- H-Hot.! Hot.! Hot.!
- Got your towel right here.
Garfield.! No.!
- It's liver flavored.
- Mm! Delicious.
Mm. Mm!
Mm!
Oh! Oh, liver!
Well, actually, it's liver flavored.
That was a good breakfast.
Now I think I'll just fall off the "Catkin's" diet... and get myself a little high-fat chaser.
Mmm.
- Garfield, look, the milk truck.
- Oh, attaboy, Nermal.
- The milk truck comes every day.
- Yeah, but maybe not today.
Maybe it's changing routes.
Maybe this'll be the last we'll ever see of it.
Come on. It's just across the street.
We're cats. We like milk.
- Let's go for it.
- No.
- But, you... -
- But nothin'.
I don't leave the cul-de-sac for anything.
Out there, it's a hornet's nest of trouble.
Bad things happen out there.
So I don't go out there.
Besides, I've found if you wait long enough...
everything comes to you.
#Here come the milkman
Here come the milkman #
- # He got his shoes on, he got his milk pan ##
- Hey, Nermal...
let's play astronaut again today.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I love that game.
You're such a brave little astronaut.
- All right.
- Prepare to jump into your spaceship,
Commander Nermal.
But wh-wh-what about the milk?
- Who needs milk when you can be in outer space?
- Ah.
- You got a secret mission today.
- Yeah?
- You'll be exploring the Milky Way.
- Okay.
I get the chills when you jump in your little spacecraft.
The nation thanks you.
Prepare to blast off.
- I'm ready to go, friend.
- Three, two, one.
Whoa!
Now I feel like it.
Bon voyage.
Look at me go.!
Whoo-hoo.!
- Don't look down.!
- I'm an eagle flying.!
Come to papa, baby.
I can see everything up here.
I can see my house.
Got milk?
I can see the whole neighborhood.
- Well, that's nice. That's very nice.
- Hey, there's another milk truck.
Ooh.!
And that is even nicer.
- I can see... Whoa!
- Mission accomplished, Nermal.
Whoa.! Whoa,
Garfield, do it again.
Where did everybody go?
You're on the wrong side of the street, fat cat. Beat it!
And you, Luca, the wrong side of the evolutionary curve.
Okay, that's it.
- You're gonna get it good today.
- I make a point to get it good every day.
The real question, Luca, is how shall I outwit you this time?
- What?
- Shall I baffle you with simple math?
- I know how to spell.
- Or should I distract you with something shiny?
- Now you're making fun of me.
- I hope so. You're no fun to look at.
You'll never get the best of me! Aaah!
- I think I just did.
- Not the ducks again!
Jump back!
And kiss myself.
Oooh!
If I ever get off this chain, you're goin' down.
Everybody back up! I don't know how wild this thing is gonna get.
I love the smell of cinnamon-apple in the morning.
It smells like... victory.
Oooh!
I hate this fat cat.
So much time, and so little I need to do.
Mouse!
No thanks, I'm full.
Get him, Garfield!
Get him, Jon!
Oh, it's always gotta be smashing and crashing.
Nobody poisons anymore.
Aha.!
Whoa...
There's my ball!
What good is a cat that can't chase a mouse?
I don't do the chase thing.
All right,
I'll handle this.
I know you don't hear me, but can't you just listen?
Louis, what are you doing in the house when Jon's home?
Sorry, Garfield, man.
I couldn't help it.
Look, when he sees you, he expects more from me. Don't you get that?
Jon's got those macadamia nut cookies.
I'm trying to maintain.
- You understand?
- Sure. As long as you understand I have to eat you.
Aw!
Mm. Mmm.
- Mm! Mmm!
- Oh, good boy.
See, I knew you could do it if you put your mind to it.
- You are the best cat a guy could have.
- Mmm.
Mm.! Mm.!
Mmm.
M- M-M-M-M-M-M-Mm.
Have you tasted yourself lately?
Hey, it wasn't exactly the first-class lounge in there for me either.
Get yourself lost. Take a powder for a couple days, get a haircut and grow a beard.
Cool.
I owe you one, "G."
I got a question for you.
Do you love your cat?
Finally, back on my regular schedule.
You're gonna make sure he has nothing but Kibbly Kat food.
Isn't that right,
Persnikitty?
That cat's puss is everywhere...
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.
Who would want that kind of exposure?
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah, cut the small talk. What's in the bag?
Remember, be happy.
I'm happy when I'm with you, you delicate m√©lange... of tomato paste, ricotta cheese, ground meat and pasta!
Garfield, don't even think about it.
That's my food.
I may just nibble.
Thanks, Happy.
And thank you for joining us.
I'm Christopher Mello.
Remember...
Be happy.
Okay, cut. Good.
We're clear.
Give me the Benadryl.
Give me the Benadryl.
Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah! Yeah.
Damned cat allergies.
Any word from the network yet?
Uh, no, but they're looking for a dog act on Good Day, New York.
Dog act!
Story of my life.
Looking for a dog, and I'm stuck with a cat.
I thought the segment went quite well.
"I thought the segment went quite well. "
Of course it went well, you toad!
The 50 housewives who saw it, loved it.
This is WalterJ. Chapman reporting live from The Hague.
Oh, please, what a know-it-all!
...were met with angry crowds...
And everybody always said
I was the handsome one.
I was the smart one.
And I was born first.
But there you are
"live from The Hague"... and here I am working with this sack of dander on a dead-end regional morning show.
Back to you, Dan.
Back to you, Dan.
Garfield!
Did you eat all four boxes of lasagna?
It's not my fault. They started it.
What am I gonna do with you?
Love me. Feed me.
Never leave me.
Come on. Let's go for a ride to someplace you love... that always leaves you feeling pampered and refreshed.
Huh? Oh, I know...
Chuck E. Cheese.
Thank you.
No? Wendy's?
Taco Kitty? No?
Well, I'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden for you?
Hmm. The only time I ever leave my cul-de-sac is when Jon takes me to the vet... which he's been doing a lot recently, and it appears to have nothing to do with me.
Jon must want to go for his own reason.
Well, there's nothing wrong with Garfield.
He's just a happy, fat, lazy cat.
No need for a second opinion.
- Well, I worry about him.
- I know you do.
Ooh!
You know, you care about him more than any owner I've ever known.
"Him" has a name.
Is this an H.M.O.?
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
I wanna talk to you in private.
- Mm. Oh!
- She's so beautiful.
Uh, Mr. Pathetic, you've had a crush on her since high school.
Would you please ask her out so she can reject you, and we can get on with my life?
I have to ask her out.
- Wish me luck.
- Okay, go get 'em, big tiger.
You the man. You the fella.
You the boss.
You preach to her. Show her how the cow eats the cabbage... you hopeless loser.
Betty, today, why don't you start me off with a Swedish massage... a manicure and a pedicure, okay?
Seaweed wrap, loofah... belly rub, uh... tail waxing and then crack my toes to finish.
Jon, there's something important I need to ask you.
Something that I wouldn't ask most guys who come in here.
Wait, no. I think I know where this is going.
- You do?
- I do.
Liz, I've wanted to ask you the same thing for a very long time.
- Are you sure that we're talking about the same thing?
- Absolutely.
Yeah, uh, I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life.
Liz, I am ready to take a chance.
I am ready for...
Thank you.
A dog!
A dog.
I'm ready for a dog.
Hi.
- Hey, I think he likes you.
- Hi. Yeah.
Hi.
He's a frisky... frisky little fella, isn't he?
His name's Odie, and he's not gonna make it... if he has to live his life in a cage.
He needs to be loved.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
No, maybe not in my neighborhood.
Hey, Boomer,
I really gotta run.
Gotta fly, everybody. Really, please, stay behind the security fences.
So great of you to come out to see me... but I've got somebody waiting for me, very devoted, almost crippled.
No, please, don't cry.
I know what it's like to be unloved.
Well, you do.
I'll try to come back and visit, and if I don't, I'll try to write.
- Bye-bye.
- Does anybody know this guy?
Bye-bye, everybody.
Garfield is leaving the building.
Jon, you know you don't have to do this if you don't want to.
No. No, it's okay.
Some part of me always wanted to know what it'd be like... to have a pet that actually wants to play with you.
You're a good friend.
One question... Am I still gorgeous?
Jon, I think we got a little problem here.
Uh, Jon...
I can help the transition go smoothly.
Jon, it's in my seat. Jon.!
- We could all go out together. Park, dog shows,
- Jon.! Uh, Jon?
- Stuff like that.
- Uh, Jonny boy?
W- Wait a minute.
Are... Are you... asking me out?
Oh, Jonny boy, the time has come to get a car alarm.
You're not gonna believe it. A mongrel mutt has broken into your car!
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.
Whoa! You went in there to get a date and came out with a dog?
Oh, that's bad even for you.
Oh, you're so sad!
Oh, no, no, no. We're not bringing a dog home with us.
Hey, I ride shotgun!
What are you looking at, tick boy?
Jon, it's not too late.
Quickly, turn around... before he finds out where we live.!
Please take this trouser sniffer back.!
- Please.
- Come on, Odie. Let's go.
This is your new home.
Come on, buddy.
Jon, you had me, a chick magnet... and now you've got a tick magnet.
Garfield,
Jon brought a dog home.
- I am aware, Nermal.
- Why would he do a thing like that?
Gee, I don't know, Nermal.
It just seems like a weird thing to do... bringing a dog into a house that already has a cat.
Can we drop it?
I mean, it's no big... deal.
It's... just a splattered bug on the windshield of my life.
A bug?
A dim-witted, smelly, goofy...
Splattered bug that I will deal with appropriately and enthusiastically.
- Come on.
- As you can see, I'm stillJon's favorite.
See ya later, Garfield.
Good luck with the bug thing!
Come on.
This is payback for the liver thing, isn't it?
Payback.
He's a nut.
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.
And, uh, the TV over there.
- And, uh, the kitchen.
- Hm.
You wanna go see it?
Okay, go see the house. Go see it.
Why don't you draw him a map?
Okay, I've gotta... remain calm, that's all.
Jon's a cat guy, not a dog guy.
This'll last a week, maybe 10 days. Tops.
Boy, this puppy is stupid gone wild!
Nah, this is just a bad dream. I'm gonna close my eyes and when I open them... everything will be back to normal.
Ah! That's not normal.
Not close.
Oh, great.
Dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.
This is a nightmare. L...
I just need a little quality time with man's real best friend... television.
No, no, no. No, no. No.
Hey, new guy, let me hip you to the rules, okay?
Number one... that's my chair, all right?
I even see you raise a leg, and it's on, it's go time, pal.
Very well.
Yeah, I think I just may have a mental advantage on this guy.
Leave me alone.
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.
Pop a worm pill and hit the road. I'm busy.
You wanna play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.
Go jump in the pail, and we'll shoot you into outer space.
Come on. It's real simple.
Here, I'll even throw your ball in there.
Follow the ball, andjump in the pail.
Come on, Odie.
Just like this.
Come on over here and just jump right into the pail, and help me.
Come on. No.
Just in here like this.
Uh-oh.!
Don't touch that.!
Aaah!
Oh, no.!
Whoa!
Aaah.!
Oh, no!
Houston, we have a problem.
Odie, get off the pail.
Would you get off the pail, please?
Okay, time for a new game.
It's called
"my claw in your butt"game.
Come here! Get back here!
Come on!
I'll just use my left claw.
If my legs were longer,
I'd have caught you by now. Come here.
Just wait for one second.
Slow... down.
Ahhh... -
Well, well, well.
I've got you now, fat cat.
Hey, Luca, is that a new chain you're wearin', fella?
Looks good on ya. You look great.
You been working out?
Oh, I've been waiting years for this.
Would that be regular years or dog years?
What the... Get away from me, pip-squeak.
Uh, Luca, this is Odie.
Odie, Luca.
Luca, do me a favor and eat him for me, would you, please?
- Garfield, are you all right?
- I think so.
Luca's about to have Odie for lunch.
If it wasn't for Odie, you'd be Luca's chew toy.
Yeah, he saved your life.
- Odie's a hero!
- Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?
No, Odie's an imbecile until further notice.
Hey, moondust... if I were you, I'd grab a nice piece of carpet.
Jon doesn't let me sleep up top. Ever.
Odie... You wanna sleep in the bed?
Okay.
Wha...
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?
You want to sleep on the bed tonight?
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
I think I'm going to blow cat-chow chunks.
Good night, Odie.
Good night, Garfield.
Great. Wish me luck with the nightmares.
Another day ruined.
Oh, you little suck-up. Oh!
Whoa! Whoa, baby.
No. Down.
Down, dumb dog.
What part of"no" don't you understand?
The push off the chair?
Off! I don't want to play.
Oh! Look. What am I supposed to say?
"Thanks for saving my hide with Luca?"
Okay, thanks for saving my hide with Luca. Get off!
Where was I? Right here.
I was right here.
Oh!
That was a cheap shot.
Hit a guy when he's not looking? Okay.
Oh, excuse me. L-I think you may have forgotten something.
I saw this and I thought, pretty sure it was your...
Oh, I love to dish it out.
Watch out. You see, you can't touch this.
Come on.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
Don't sneak up on me, baby.
Oh, come on with that.
Get that weak stuff outta here.
Is that butt broken?
No, it's something like this here.
Can you do this?
Uh, shouldn't those hips be in the shop?
Walk this way, please.
I'm-a walking the dog.
Well, step it up a little bit.
Something like this.
Ho, look at this.
Watch out for this thing.
It could go. Uh-huh.
You probably should've practiced in the garage... before you stepped up to someone of my level.
Back up.
Come on.
Fly with me. Maybe something a little bit more challenging.
Hey! How 'bout this?
Out the front door.
Take it outside.!
Look who's here on the porch.
I'm walking the porch.
I'm holding a torch. I'm ready to scorch.
Uh-huh.
That's fancy footwork.
Hey! Look. Garfield's dancing with Odie.
They're like buddies now!
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Odie, what are you doing here?
I was doing a solo dance, and a creepy dog comes up next to me?
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.
Uh-oh.
Here's more trouble.
Look at the goony look on his face.
- Come on, buddy. Come here. Come on.
- Taking him back to the vet?
- Time for our date with Liz.
- Takin'him back to the kennel, right?
Yeah? Are you putting him up for adoption?
Hey, Garfield,
Jon's taking Odie on his date with Liz...
- and he's leaving you behind.
- I know, Nermal.
They're off on an adventure and you're still here.
And your point is?
Well, that's gotta feel bad...
being left byJon while he takes Odie out.
It's like you're not his favorite anymore.
Hey, what do you say we play brain surgeon?
Would you go get my power tools?
This is so sad.
Jon has completely lost his mind.
Doesn't realize how important I am to him.
I need to be so very understanding of him...
at this difficult time.
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!
You forgot me!
Slow down! Please slow down!
I'm right back here!
Waa... oh! I think
I pulled a hamstring.
All right. It's okay.
I'm on. I'm on. Relax.
Oh, my poor nose.
So, if you own Marie, please come and claim her.
So, if you own Marie, please come and claim her.
Thank you very much.
Now, before the show starts, go over to the snack section on the south lawn...
and get those goodies.
We have things there that we're sure...
Yeah, go on ahead. Uh...
I'll catch up with ya.
It's probably just a mild concussion... or... or a skull fracture.
Maybe I'll get a CATscan.
A CAT scan!
I'd like to ask thejudges now...
if they would please take their positions for the viewings.
Oh, watch your step there.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the dog show.
Well, what if I compromise a little?
How 'bout I do the rolling around with the yarn ball thing?
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.
I won't climb drapes though. That's more than you get from some dumb dog.
Oops. Dogs.
Uh-oh.
- Oh, what? You're all gonna take it personally?
- Down, boy. Sit.
- Stay!
- Now, I'm gonna die.
Oh, now I really am gonna die.!
Excuse me.
Can I get through here?
No one under this tarp. Ah.! That's my ear.!
Owners, maintain control of your dogs.
People, control those animals now.!
Music! Music, you idiot!
Yeah, play the music.
That's my bad knee. Stop it. All right.!
Feets, don't fail me now.!
I apologize for this.
Please excuse this outburst.
- This is highly irregular.
- Odie! Odie!
Odie.! Odie, come on.
Come on, buddy. Come on back.
Odie.! Odie, you want a treat?
Huh? Buddy?
Okay. All right.
I need a ride.
I'm a cat in trouble.
I'm hitching a ride in your muumuu.
- Ooh!
- Come on! Let's move!
Go.! Let's move.! Dig.! Dig.! Hyah.! Hyah.!
Come on, Pinkie. Move it out.!
Oh.! Sorry. Sorry.
Move.! Move.! Move, Pinkie.!
Move, Pinkie.! Move.!
We certainly have a new star in the arena.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is amazing.!
Talented little fella, huh?
Hyah, Pinkie! Hyah!
They're gaining on us, Pinkie!
A cat's life is at stake. Whoa.!
Thanks for the ride.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Please call 911.
Please.!
This is exactly what I deserve anyway.
I promise if I survive,
I'll never compete with a dog again.
Okay.! You got me.!
But before I say good-bye...
Oh, isn't this the final irony?
Look who's here to witness this.
The mailman!
You're so stupid.
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo. Whoo-hoo.
Yes!
Odie, come here.
That's a good boy. Oh, hi.
Ladies and gentlemen, Happy Chapman.
That is one talented dog!
You know, this is exactly the kind of dog... that could have a future in television.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chapman, but Odie's just my pet.
And that's... that's all
I really want him to be.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Okay. Well, this is for you.
And, uh... this is for you if you happen to change your mind.
You just ring me up.
You give... "Hello? Hello?
I changed my mind.
I wanna be a star. "
- Okay.
- Okay!
- Okay.
- Let's hear it for Odie!
What a sensational ending to a rather unconventional show.!
- Smile.
- Our winner today...
a fabulous dancing puppy called Odie.!
...the cul-de-sac. Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
N- Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de...
I'm h-home.
- I had fun today. Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.
Would you like to come in?
- Uh, not today.
- I knew that.
- I'm sorry.
- Jon, I wanna come over, just not today.
I have to cover for another vet.
Oh! Really?
How's Sunday?
Sunday is... Sunday's great.
S- Sunday's good. Sunday.
Okay.
So, I'll...
- I'll see you Sunday.
- Sunday.
Sunday.
Why? Why has this happened?
I was the one.
It was all about me.
Not about some stupid, sniveling, smelly... high-maintenance disco dog.
Ahh!
Oh, no.
Huh? Oh...
You just can't do this, Jon. He's trying to tear us apart. Don't you see that?
You know me. I'm too lazy to try to destroy your house.
I was provoked, pushed, prodded, driven mad.
You can't kick me out of my own house like I'm some kind of animal!
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon!
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon!
You know I'm scared of the dark.
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Who's a good boy?
# Used to haveJon to myself #
# Day or night
There was no one else #
# From dawn to dusk my meals would come #
#I'd lounge about in my home #
#But now I'm out in the cold of night #
#All alone till the dawn's first light #
# I'm in a new dog state of mind #
# Used to think I had a home #
#A special place to call my own #
# But now the dog's in and I'm out #
#I've got no jon
I've got no clout #
# I'm in a new dog state of mind ##
Leave me alone.
You've won.
You're inside with him, and I'm out here all by myself.
Odie? You came out here to be with me?
I'm touched.
And you must be touched in the head.
See you in the morning, little fella.
You know, a puppy needs a little tough love every now and then.
I think it builds character.
Hello, Pooky. Miss me?
You know what? I'm gonna make it up to Odie tomorrow.
I'm going to teach him how to drink out of the toilet.
Poor Odie.
- That cat is such a pig.
- Garfield's a pig?
You never put the dog out at night.
Why not?
Because dogs... run away.
Sure, Jon, I'll eat all your lasagna for you.
Oh, look.
What do we have here?
You're a lost dog.
Well, we can fix that.
Oh, do I feel good this morning.
I slept like a fat cat.
Hey, tall, dark and human, what's for breakfast?
Odie! Where are you, boy?
Well, relax. Uh, I think he was going to camp out.
- Odie?
- Well, he probably had a sleepover at Luca's, I think.
Odie! Odie?
Hm. Well, maybe he's fetching the paper for the neighbors.
Where is that silly dog?
I can't go on like this anymore, Wendell.
I've got to get a dog.
I think that's a lovely idea.
I know you've been sad and lonely since the divorce, and I've tried to be a friend...
Not for me, you imbecile.
For the act.
If I could get my hands on a really talented dog... wouldn't WalterJ.
Just choke on his Emmy?
- Like Odie?
- Yeah.
Yeah, now he was good.
Oh, yeah. You know, he was kinda dopey-looking and spry.
- And...
- Lost!
Hmm?
Hi, it's Jon. I was just calling to see if Odie's been over there.
My name is Jon Arbuckle, and, um, I can't find my dog.
I've looked all around the neighborhood, and I can't find him.
I saw him last night, but I haven't seen him this morning.
And, uh, if you see him, give me a call, please.
Uh, I was calling to see if you'd seen Odie?
Um, I think he's run away.
I was giving him a bath, and I forgot to put his collar back on.
You know, 'cause
Garfield hates his collar.
He's about 15 pounds.
He's brownish yellow with brown floppy ears.
Would you mind getting that?
Um, I'm offering a reward.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, and he answers to the name of...
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'd say the refrigerator is unguarded.
Wh... What are you doing here?
We're having dinner, remember?
Right! R...
Dinner.
Th-The two of us.
Tonight. Of course.
- Shall I come in?
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Come on in.
Uh, you know, uh, Liz,
I have a confession.
Uh, uh, it's not really a confession.
More of an admission.
It's a... You know what it is?
It's like a, uh...
It's like a declaration.
I have a... a... d...
I love it when you do that.
- Do what?
- You know, trip over yourself.
It's cute.
It's one of the reasons I had a crush on you in high school.
You had a crush on me?
Yeah. I thought you were really cute, decent.
Not like all those other jerks.
I don't believe it. L...
I had a crush on you too.
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah.
Hilarious.
So, um, what's your confession/ admission/declaration?
Actually, um...
I forgot about our dinner.
Yeah.
Oh, that's okay.
You know, I can... I can go.
No. No, I'm...
I'm glad you're here.
Let me just, uh, get my jacket, and then we'll go.
Okay, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What... What am I gonna do?
I've waited for this night my entire life.
If you tell her the truth, you'll feel much better.
And you won't have to see her anymore.
It's kinda creepy having a vet around the house anyway.
I can't just go out and pretend like nothing's happened, can I?
Well, I sure could. The one thing you can't do is tell her the dog's gone.
- I gotta tell her.
- No.
- I've gotta tell her.
- No. That's not what I said.
Schmuck.
Liz, uh, we can't go out tonight.
- Why not?
- Odie's run away.
- What?
- He got out last night. I feel terrible.
I called the pound.
I put up posters.
I looked everywhere, but I can't find him.
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I guess I figured... he was the only reason you were spending time with me.
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious. I mean, I thought...
No, I mean, come on.
Let's go find him.
O- Oh.
Ayayayayay.
How can this dog be such a problem when he's not even here anymore?
Well, I'm not gonna worry about him.
I believe you've found my dog.
- He answers to "Odie. "
- "Odie"?
Family name.
Oh! Odie!
Oh, come on.
There you are. Oh!
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I can live again now.
How could I ever repay you?
An autograph would be splendid.
Then splendid it shall be.
Hm.
- Uh, no.
- Come on, boy.
Hmm...
Ooh.
This is ridiculous.
- Hey, what are you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. Just lookin' for some company.
Keep walking, creepo.
- What's going on?
- We know how much you hated Odie.
- We know how much you wanted him gone.
- Wait a minute.
All I wanted was to sleep in my own bed.
And to do it, you cast Odie out into the cold, cruel world?
We saw how you locked
Odie outside last night.
Oh, I don't believe you guys.
I didn't know he was gonna run away.
He's a dumb dog.
No offense, Luca.
- Uh, what?
- You can't blame me for that.
- Any one of us could be next.
- Yeah.
There's no room for anybody else in Garfield's world.
Huh? Oh, that's a little dramatic.
Well, I may have been a little tough about protecting my turf... but, uh,
I don't hate the guy.
I understand Happy has a big surprise for us.
A special treat.
What have you got for us, Hap?
Ah, guten Morgen, Chris.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have been working with a very special new friend...
and I would like to introduce him to all of you.
Odieschnitzel!
Lookee here!
It's Odie!
And he's safe and sound.
Although, he seems to have found an alternative lifestyle.
He still can't dance.
Well, this gets me off the hook with Jon and the gang.
- Now I'm gonna be the hero.
- That's one talented dog.
Oh, I'm glad you think so, Chris, because I have a little announcement to make.
Old Happy Chapman and Odieschnitzel...
are going to be climbing aboard that New Amsterdam Limited at 3:00 p. M... bound to New York City, where we have the opportunity...
to be regular contributors on Good Day, New York.
Huh? That's his last name...
Schnitzel?
Thank you for all your help yesterday.
You were... You were great.
Jon, Odie's on TV, and he's wearing lederhosen.
L- I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.
Um, I upped the reward to, um, $200.
And, uh, I'm going to put up some more posters tomorrow.
He's clog dancing, I think, wearing lederhosen.
I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.
- Oh, you're gonna miss it.
- I'm sorry, Liz. I'll call you later.
Garfield's being... Garfield.
Do I have to bark like Lassie?
Come on.
Humor me, would ya?
Arf! Arf! Arf!
Quickly!
While we're young.
Today! Let's go!
Be happy.
Oh, you're gonna miss this. He's the small one.
The small one in the guy's hand.
Garfield, I'm not in the mood.
You know, it's never good when you turn off my TV.
And this may be the worst ever.
Odie's not ready.
H- He's months of positive reinforcement away from consistently performing.
Happy, you promised you'd never use that.
I mean, that collar is inhumane.
This collar... is the dog's future.
Do you have a problem with that?
- No.
- No.
Now we'll see how smart you really are.
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman.
Happy Chapman.
Not now, Garfield.
Jon, you're denser than ever.
I gotta think outside the box here.
Hey, the box!
Wait a second.
My box... My box had something on it.
Let's see. AppleJacks.
Frosted Flakes. Cocoa Puffs.
Kibbly Kat.
Yes, there it is.
Telegraph Tower. That's where they make
The Happy Chapman Show.
Yeah. But how far away can that be?
Maybe...
Hmm, a paw?
Apaw and a half maybe.
This is a done deal. I can do this.
No!
Can't do this.
Reached physical limits.
Shouldn't have tried it without snacks.
Must go back and reload.
Jenny, how are you? Welcome to the show.
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
Ah, and that's the sign that the tank is full.
I can do this. Beyond this intersection is just another intersection.
And another and another.
On the other hand, I wonder if there's any meat loafleft in the fridge.
No. Now's not the time for a plate of meat loaf.
Now's the time for a plate of courage.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.
#He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored #
# He has... ##
Now that's more my style.
Oh, taxi.
Step on it, will you, driver?
No, Odie's not a hound dog.
Yes, I'm sure.
No, I don't want another dog.
Thanks anyway.
Garfield, lunchtime.
I made your favorite... lasagna.
Garfield!
Garfield!
Garfield, where are you?
Can anyone direct me to the pink building... that's shown on the back of the Kibbly Kat box?
Uh, it's the one right by the blue-and-orange tree.
Well, this doesn't feel pink building-ish.
- Hello?
- Now where you going? Oh, what is that?
- Uh-oh, rats.
- Come on! Come on!
- Rats the size of rats.
- Come on, kids.
Is that big orange blob a cat?
Hey, now, why am I being surrounded here?
Some of my best friends are vermin.
Finally, some meat.
Meat? No, it's not meat.
I'm... They measured.
It's 100% body fat.
No nutritional value whatsoever.
Hey, body fat's good with us.
- Mmm. Yea.! Yippee.!
- Uh... Uh... Louis.
- Garfield.! Coming through.
Hey, what's going on here?
- Oh, it's my friend.
Come on, Louis.
I got 3,000 teeny mouths to feed.
Hey, back off. Garfield?
What are you doing here?
Besides defending my life?
Jon got a dog... dog got kidnapped by a TV star,
I'm trying to rescue him.
Seems like you got yourself in a jam, huh?
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.
Louis, I think you and I have an account still, remember?
- The macadamia nut cookies?
- I do love the macadamia.
- Sorry, rat pack, this cat's with me.
- Aw, come on.
Y'all got to roll.
Go ahead. Roll out.
Who wants to go to the Red Lobster alley?
Hey, maybe next time, little critters.
Good luck with the plague and rabies and everything.
Don't push your luck, fat cat.
Garfield, you can't just be wandering around the city.
There are dangers everywhere.
Potholes, subways, animal control.
You think you can get me to Telegraph Tower?
Two more cookies and you got a deal.
But we gotta keep it on the down-low.
How down low do we have to go?
Yo, Garfield, you with me?
Louis, this is a little bit lower than I expected.
If I didn't have a box over my head,
I'd be humiliated.
Okay, hold up. All right.
We're almost there.
Now, when I give you the signal, we gotta cross the street.
- Way over there by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield. Let's go.!
Wait up.! Wait up.!
- Am I dead?
- Garfield, don't move!
Don't move?
Not a problem.
Just wait for the walk signal.
Oh, no, it's a stampede.!
Stampede.!
- If I can just get away from this herd.
- Garfield!
Garfield!
Garfield, where are you?
Garfield, get down from there, man.
No. I'm not coming down.
I'm happy to live the rest of my life up here. Thank you.
Liz! Liz!
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's gone. I think he's run away too.
First Odie, and now Garfield.
Liz, I am the worst pet owner on the planet.
- Wait. What happened?
- I can't find him. You gotta help me.
I can't live without Garfield.
Let's start at the park.
Let's start at the park.
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Garfield, relax.
Look. We're here.
- We're here now.
- Curb service.
The Telegraph Tower in all its splendor.
It looks much smaller on the box.
You gotta go all the way up there?
Good luck, playa.
I'll catch you later.
I don't do the vertical thing.
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Oh, yeah. Hold up, "G."
- What?
- Watch out for the po-po.
- You know, five-oh? Control-oh.
- Huh?
- Animal control, man.
- Oh, that po-po.
- Keep it squeal.
- Hey, thanks, partner.
Oink, oink.
I can't try the door. I couldn't handle another stampede.
Hey...
First thing Monday morning...
I'm gonna get to work on losing those last 20 pounds.
Okay, everything looks good out there.
Looks like we got ourselves a blockage.
Hmm.
Guess we'll just... purge the system.
Oh, pardon me.
That wasn't my stomach, was it?
Ah, there's a cooling breeze.
Ooh. Woah!
Woah.!
- Whee!
- Aaah!
Aaah!
Oh, my poor nose.
Jon, stop the car.
- What?
- It's Odie.
Somebody found him.
52903 Euclid Street.
Let's go.
Odie.!
Odie.!
Ode.!
Ode-ster.!
Ode-man.
This rescue thing is exhausting.
When do heroes get to eat?
Oh, my!
It's Odie.!
O- O-O-O...
Odie.
I found you.
I'm so sorry
I got you into this mess.
Look. We kind of got off on the wrong paw.
But, come on. You can be really annoying sometimes.
And you don't give me enough space.
And you're a major-league suck-up.
But we have a common purpose.
We shareJon.
Jon needs us even more.
And I kinda want you back home too.
So, stand back.
I almost got it.
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.
Do you think he's ready for the audition?
Well, why don't you see for yourself.
Come on, Odie.
Showtime.
Now.
Ah. Good morning, New York.
I know you're gonna flip for Odie because he sure is flipping for you.
Ride 'em, cowboy.
- A shock collar? That's... That's inhumane.
- Tomorrow's science today.
Oh, gosh, hot doggy.
So, when does our train leave?
Oh. Two hours.
Tickets?
Chop-chop.
Poor Odie.
He faces a future of torture... neglect and degradation.
Hey, nobody gets to mistreat my dog like that except me.
Psst.! I'll be right behind you, little buddy.
Surf's up!
Gravity, do your thang!
Ah-ooh!
Ah-ooh.!
Woah!
Housekeeping at 12:00!
Woah!
You know...
I think I had a nightmare like this once.
Woah!
Once again, my life has been saved by the miracle of lasagna.
I said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?
Odie, here I come!
Don't worry, fella.
- I'll rescue you.!
- Halt.!
- Gotcha.!
- Woah. Huh?
Well, what have we got here?
Looks like we got us a cat with no tags.
Hey, McGillicuddy, there's an animal felony...
happening right there behind you.
I'm trying to do some rescue work here, pal.
Hey.!
- Welcome to my world, Red.
- I'm gonna call somebody about this.
- Newbie on the block.
- This is police brutality.
- Here we go.
- I have tags. I just left them in my other fur.
This is abusive now. This is abusive.
- In you go, big fella.
- Huh?
- What is with the cage?
- Okay, lock 'er down.
Oh, now, this is insulting.
You know I'm house-trained.
- Gimme newspaper?
- Settle down, people.
- I oughta give you a bunch of fives.
- Back about your business.
- Rosa, I'm watching you.
- This is all a terrible mistake.
I was trying to save a friend... that's not very smart, needed my help.
I don't belong in here.
I have an owner.
L- I'm not a stray.
- Hi. I'm Jon Arbuckle.
- Hi.
Um, I think you have my dog Odie.
- I think you're mistaken.
- No, I saw the flier. Odie's my dog.
No, he's Happy Chapman's dog.
Happy Chapman?
The gentleman with the cat on Channel 37.
He came and took Odie home.
Odie's the family name, you know?
- Well, uh, good day.
- Wait. Wait.
Happy Chapman took Odie?
You think he's got Garfield too?
L- I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.
Ah, shut up.!
Hey, save it for talent night.
Could you please be quiet?
Guard! Guards!
Oh, this really is too much.
Hey, Persnikitty. Happy Chapman's cat.
What are you doing in here?
I was his cat until I outlived my purpose.
Oh, then he replaced me with a dog and dumped me in this wretched place.
- All humans are the same.
- Oh, notJon, my owner.
No way.
He only does what's best for me.
He puts up with me, and he feeds me.
And he lets you vacation in this charming animal pound. Hello?
Yeah, not for long,
Persnikitty.
Would you please just stop calling me that?
My name isn't really Persnikitty.
- It's Sir Roland.
- Sir Roland?
Yes. Another one of
Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.
I was trained in the classical theater, you know. Uh-huh.
But now, I'm a celebrity cable castoff cat... with a name
I can never live down.
Well, this may hurt a little then.
I'm trying to rescue the dog that replaced you, Persnikitty.
I mean, Roland. Uh, Happy and Odie are getting on a train in less than two hours...
to go to New York to become regulars on Good Day, New York.
Wait a minute.
Did I just hear that right?
You're a cat that's trying to rescue a dog?
It's true. I know.
It's a crime against nature.
At first I thought he was a pain, but he's grown on me...
like a wart you wanna have removed until you realize... it defines you in some funny way.
Do you know, that is absolutely charming.
Let me ask you a question, chubby.
What are you talking about?
How could you understand?
He's my friend.
Oh, my gosh.
How low have I sunk?
Guard, may I have some shoelaces, please?
Well, hello there.
Right on time.
All right. I need a five-count lineup right now. Let's go.
- Move, move, move.
- Hey, what's going on?
Adoption. Looks like one of us is getting out of here.
So, you're here to look at a cat.
All right. Well, let's see if we can't take care of you.
- Careful.
- Let's go, boys. Let's hurry it up.
Can I just say your hands are freezing?
How are you, newbie?
This might be your lucky day.
Come here.
There you go.
Oh, you are a heavy one.
- Excuse me. Muscle weighs more than fat.
- Come on. That's right.
- Come over here.
- Check this.
Hey, what about me?
All right.
Let's line it up.
Paws on the white line.
Tails in the air.
I don't need to be adopted, guys.
My guyJon is coming to get me, I'm sure.
- That one.
- Really.
She picked me!
She picked me! She did!
- She picked me. She picked me.
- Not that one.
That one. The one that looks like the cat on TV.
Back it up, Red.
She went with Trigger.
- Sorry, love.
- Come here.
Better luck next time.
Now you be careful.
- There you go.
- That's not... That's sore. Ow!
Jon's gonna be here in five minutes anyway.
When I give the signal, run like a mad cow.
- What?
- Don't you want to save your friend?
- Do I really have to run?
- Now!
Eat hair ball, Happy Chapman!
Not the red button.!
Once more into the breach, dear friends. Once more.!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- I'm going. I'm going.
Run! Run! Let's go!
Get the door!
Hey, there's a fire hydrant!
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Code blue! Code blue!
We got runners. We got runners.
Halt! Stop! You have not been cleared for release.
- Garfield's been here.
- Uh, excuse me.
- Can I help you with something?
- We're looking for Happy Chapman.
Uh, yeah. He's on his way to the train station.
He's going to New York.
D- Do you guys have a pass or something?
- I'm gonna have to ask you guys to leave.
- Thank you.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, excuse me.
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...
is now departing from Platform 12.
All aboard!
All aboard.!
Good afternoon, gentlemen. What will you be having today... salmon, steak or lasagna?
Steak.
I hate lasagna.
Beep, beep. Cat coming through.
Beep, beep. Going through the tunnel.
- Nyow! I just had to do that.
- It's a cat!
Final call for the New Amsterdam Limited.
The New Amsterdam Limited is now departing from Platform 12.
No. Wait.
Please. Stop.
Wait. Don't. No. Oh.
You monster, Chapman.!
I can't outrun a train.
Whoa.
Watch the train, pal.
- Let's wait here now, honey.
- Hey.
I got it. It's just a train set, only bigger.
- Oh, no, we're too late.
- No.
We're gonna stop that train. Come on.
Somewhere around here... there's gotta be a big table... with all the trains on it.
Yeah, now's a good time to take a 10-minute break, Ted.
Over and out.
He looks like the type.
And this must be where he's got his little table.
I'm very sorry, sir.
There's simply no way to stop that train.
Ma'am, you don't understand.
You have to stop that train.
My dog and my cat are on that train.
I suppose ifJon can do this, I can.
Okay, we gotta find our train.
Let's see what happens when I do this.
Boston Express switching to Track 18.
Well, I'm sorry. Folks in Boston are gonna be a little late today.
Ha!
Let's see what happens when I do this.
- Warning: Seattle Wind...
- No, I don't care about Seattle.
Warning: Collision.
Ma'am, I'm looking for one train in particular.
Just one second.
I'm trying to find my friend.
- The New Amsterdam Limited...
- There's the Amsterdam.
Warning: Collision, 20 seconds.
Gosh, you sound like my mother.
All right, hold up. Everybody stop.
Warning.
- Five, four...
- Stop what you're doing.!
- Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
- All stop.
Yeah!
Okay, everybody.
Let's take it from the top.
Okay?
- You have to stop that train.
- Hold on.
I'll be down to meet you at the station, Odie.
Actually, that train has stopped.
It's returning to the station.
Are we on the right train?
Where are ya?
I think I recognize that whine.
Hey, come on.
See, these are the kinds of seats you get...
when you book at the last minute.
Good to see you, partner.
Let's get outta here.
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...
is making an unscheduled stop on Platform 12.
No, sir, please take your seat.
- No, no, my future is running away from me.
- What's the trouble here?
Please, stay calm and go back to your seat.
- Hey.!
- How rude!
Buddy!
Ah.
Hey, could you slow down?
I've been doing this running thing all day.
And I am over it.
Hey, we-re... we're safe now.
We're free. Oh.
- If it isn't Unhappy Chappy.
- Going somewhere?
Nice accessory, but I don't think
I want to play "dress up"with you, pal.
Let's get outta here.
Let's beat it.!
Oh, right in the nose again!
So, it's gonna get physical, is it?
Did you really think you could just run away from Happy Chapman?
Oh, is this a cry for help.
No dumb dirty animal is ever gonna get the better of me.
And let's see how you feel with 200 volts coursing...
- through that thick canine skull of yours.
- Chapman...
- Come here.
- get your hands off of my friend.!
- Hey, Boomer. What round is it?
- Good to see you, chubby.
- We're here to help.
- Sir Roland?
In the fur!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Okay. Okay.
Rats! Aah!
All right, here's the drill. Cats, scratch like you've never scratched before.
Dogs, bite but don't chew.
And, rats...
- See if you can get that pretty necklace around his neck.
Canines, felines and "vermines"...
it's showtime.
All right, boys.
Dog pile.!
Thanks, boys.
The home team will take it from here.
Better split before animal control gets here.
- Hey, Garfield, shake it easy.
- See you later, Garfield.
- Yeah, good luck.
Odie, would you mind sharing the remote, please?
Every dog has his day, Happy.
- Nice kitty.
- Let's see what's on the news.
Let me tell you something, Happy.
To you, Odie might be just a dumb, stupid, smelly dog.
But to me, he's all that and much more.
He's my friend.
Odie, try something else.
Maybe there's a game on.
Strong finish, little buddy.
Odie? Garfield?
- Odie?
- Odie? Odie?
- Be happy.
- This is for stealing my dog and my cat.
He didn't steal me.
I was doing the rescue work.
Garfield! Odie!
- Come here. Hi.
- Oh, come here.
Oh, I missed you guys so much.
I was so worried about you.
I'm never gonna let you out of my sight again.
Never. You guys are my best friends.
- You had me at hello.
- Oh.
- Get outta here.
- This is WalterJ. Chapman... with breaking news from the Midwest.
Abby Shields reporting.
Whatcha got for me, Abby?
Details are sketchy, but it appears that a deranged man... may be the cause of all the trouble here.
A deranged man?
What is this?
In fact, the police are bringing the suspect out as we speak.
Aah! Good grief.
It's my idiot brother.
Hey, that's Happy Chapman.
He's going for a ride in the police car.
But sources tell me that this incident... somehow involved a dog and a very heroic cat.
- Garfield.!
- Hey, he saved Odie.!
- Now he's a hero.
- Oh, I didn't realize.
Garfield's on TV.
He's a hero.
Garfield.! That's Garfield.
- Garfield's a hero now.!
- Thanks, everybody.
- Hero.!
- Well, thanks for saying so. It's nice to hear.
- We're a whole street full of heroes.
- It sounds sincere. Thank you.
- Yeah. Heroes.!
- Okay.
I've been waiting years for this.
- Whoa.!
- Come on, pal.
- Hey, Arlene.
- Wow. It's nice to be recognized by your peers.
I couldn't have done this without you. L...
We...
You're a really great friend.
Jon, I wanna be more than your friend.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Where do they find the energy?
Yeah, just one big happy family.
Yeah, right!
Hit the floor.
No, seriously, you can come up, buddy.
Come on. Come on.
No, seriously. Come on up.
Down you go. We just hit it off so great... because we both love the same thing, and that is...
Me.
Uh, oops.
Hey, Odie, help me.
I can't get up.
Odie, my friend, bring me some ice.
Will you hurry up, you dumb dog?
I'm in pain.
Some things start out big, and some things start out small, very small.
But sometimes the smallest thing... can make the biggest changes of all.
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!
Plio, be careful.
Dad, get over here.
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go when stuff's happening.
Well, what is it?
- It was an egg. Look.
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea.
- Vicious, flesh-eating.
- Blech.
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.
Babies grow up.
You keep that thing, one day, we'll turn our backs--
It'll be picking us out of its teeth.
- Things like that eat things like us as snacks!
- So, what do we do?
Get rid of it!
What has gotten into you?
Plio, that thing is dangerous!
I'm sorry, little one.
- Okay, get rid of it.
- Allright. I will.
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.
Here.
- It's okay.
- We'll teach him to hate meat.
- Hmph.
- Watch his head.
I-I mean, watch it, he could bite.
This monster's got no teeth.
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.
Does that look like a monster toyou?
- Let me out! Let me out!
Hair ball.
- That was great! Get him!
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!
I can't take it! There are too many of you! Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!
- Help!
Oh, no--
Aladar, you're not dead.
- No!
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?
- You gonna miss seeing all that smooching.
-  Oh, Mom.
- That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found some new material.
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.
That is good.
Oh, that's good.
Girls, I'm known as the "professor of love", and school's in session.
- Yeah, I still got it. 
- I hope it's not contagious.
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.
Let's get goin'. You don't wanna miss
Yar's annual pep talk.
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear the mating advice of an old monkey.
Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard that in his day, that old monkey was quite a swinger.
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it, he put the "prime" in "primate".
Really?
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.
Now, girls, don't jump into the trees after the first boy with a cute back flip.
It's more fun if you keep them guessing.
And if a cute back flip doesn't work, guess.
You're never going to forget this day, so make it one to remember.
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.
Come on, guys!
We don't wanna let 'em down!
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
-  Whoo!
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.
- My charm and your brains? No problem.
Ha-ha!
- Hey, girls, look what just pulled into town.
-  Hey, ladies!
- Your buffet table of love.
- Right here!Right here!
- Hey, beautiful!
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!
Whoa!
Zini.
- Whoo! Wah-hoo!
-  Whoo!
- Yah-hoo!
- You're missin' all the action, pal. Come on.
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies,
- before you know it, they all wanna move to a bigger tree.
- Hmm.
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.
No, we have two.
Well, it's never really been his best event.
He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar, if only there was someone on the island for you.
Well, you know, who looks like you, but prettier.
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?
Whoa!
- What are they?
- I don't know.
Dad?
Something's wrong.
Aladar, where's Suri?
- She's up in the tree.
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!
-Mom!
- Suri!
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!
- Mom!
-  Suri, where are you?
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!
- Yar, come on!
- Zini, jump! Jump!
-  Zini, jump!
- Hold on!
Plio! Yar! Where are you?
Aladar, over here!
I feel bad. I feel bad.
Oh, Suri.
Easy, easy.
They're all gone.
- Shh, shh. I'm here.
Come on.
We can't stay here.
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Look!
- Whoa!
- Did you see that?
-  What?
-  I did.
-  Me too!
-  Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.
- Leave it alone. Hey!
-  Shh, Dad.
-  It's scaring Suri.
-  No, it's not.
Everyone just be quiet.
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-  Yar, grab on!
-  I can't reach!
-  Aladar, they're stopping!
- Huh?
Stay out of my way!
You heard Kron.
Move it!
- Watch it.
-  Zini, get your head down.
Walkin' backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster.
Keep those little legs movin;
Url, or you'll get left behind.
Look at all the Aladars.
- If you're even thinking of joining them--
- Hang on! Hang on!
-Kron, there is a more protected spot further down the--
- We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now.
All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep.
I'm not used to this kind of behavior.
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.
Shoo, shoo.
Will you come on, Baylene?
You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive?
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.
- Oh, sorry about that.
Uh, it'sjust, we overheard you talking, and, um--
Well, my word.
Look at Uri.
- He doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast.
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.
- Excuse me?
Um, he's my grandfather, couple of times removed.
Try a couple of species removed.
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.
We're all that's left.
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.
Baylene's the last ofher kind.
Finding stragglers like her all along the way.
I heard you say something about nesting grounds?
It is the most beautiful place there is, child.
It's where the herd goes to have their babies.
Will we find anybody that looks like us there?
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.
Who knows what we'll find.
The hard job now is just getting there.
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?
Kron, the herd's head honcho.
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself--
It's-- Well, it's positively indecent.
- Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?
Oh!
- Hey!
What's his problem?
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.
- Uh, excuse me!
Kron, you got a second?
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.
Why aren't you uphill with the-- uh, young bloods?
- Well, I was back here talking to these guys.
- I guess they--
They're having a hard time keeping up.
- So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit?
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.
Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar.
- Hey, they need help back here.
- Hmm.
Watch yourself, boy.
Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers, no matter how charming they are.
You sure know how to catch a girl's eye, there, stud.
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye if I was you, especially Neera's.
You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you.
Since when do we take orders from the likes of him?
Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops.
I could hold that monster's brain in the palm of my--
No, Yar, she's right.
Better to keep our heads down with this bunch...
- than get 'em bitten off by those things.
Well, you just consider yourself lucky that's all that's following us.
- Hey, wake up.
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?
Zini, what are you doing?
I believe you left a wake-up call for the dawn of time.
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?
Something's up.
The herd's gathering without us.
Let's check it out.
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.
- Come on. Get up. On your feet.
Huh. The charm never stops around here.
You say something?
Uh, no-- no, sir.
Unless you got a death wish, you and that little parasite better get moving!
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?
Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend.
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what
I'm talkin' about: Neera.
Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.
Yeah, I made a real impression on her.
What you need is a little help from the love monkey.
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!
Ow!
- That, children,
- is what's known as a "jerkasaurus".
- And with that, the ice is broken.
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.
We stop for nothing and no one.
If this is your first crossing, listen up.
- There is no water till we reach the other side.
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out!
-  Oh, my goodness.
- It looks like a very long walk.
-And hot.
If you smell somethin' sizzlin', it could be me.
We're moving too slow.
I'll pick up the pace.
Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit.
That's all I need: a monkey on my back.
- On your feet, Eema.
We can't let those things eat you.
They're out there waiting.
- The lake!
-  We made it?
It's just over that-- that hill, baby.
Oh, thank goodness.
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?
Oh, it's time to refresh my memory.
I'm just gonna walk right into that lake...
- until the water's up tomy eyeballs... and soak it all in.
Maybe the rains collected somewhere else.
What do you want us to do?
Take a scout and check the entire perimeter.
- Enough! You have to be strong now.
The nesting grounds are only a few days away. Keep moving!
- Kron, we've never gone this long without water.
If we keep going like this, we'll lose half the herd.
Then we save the half that deserves to live.
What? They're moving already?
Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.
There was water here, always water here before.
We always had water, always.
- And-- And plenty of mud. 
- Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.
- You gotta get up.
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.
- Baylene, don't move.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Doyou hear that?
- I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.
Ooh!
- Now press down.
I always did like big girls!
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and--
Good. Now, get out of the way.
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!
Ah!
- Oh.
- Eema!
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Let's get out of here.
Now, you come out on three.
One, two, three!
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.
Hey, hey.
What's going on?
The little Aladars haven't had anything to drink.
I think they're scared of me.
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.
-  Come on over, guys.
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.
Come on. He's gonna find you some water.
Here. Now, you just take a foot and press.
- Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?
One, two, three. Press!
Good job, Suri.
- So, where are your parents, anyway?
-A lot of us are on our own now.
You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.
I'm Aladar... the "jerkasaurus".
Ohh. Sorry about that.
You're probably right.
-  Dad, wake up.
-  Huh?
Why did you help that old one?
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?
Oh. You mean, you actually--
Well, that happens all the time.
- You don't survive if you're not--
- Strong enough.
Well... yeah.
Is that you talking, or your brother?
Everything's so different.
I-I don't know what to think anymore.
Look, Neera-- we watch out for each other, we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds.
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not, but it's all I know.
So, um-- Oh, water.
I'll, uh, get you some water.
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.
- Hmm.
-  Oops.
- Sorry.
- No. You-- You first.
One down... and, well, one down.
Kron!
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come this far north.
The fireball must've driven them out.
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!
Move the herd out, double-time!
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.
Kron, what's going on?
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving, they'll catch up to us.
But the others in the back--
They'll never make it.
They'll slow down the predators.
You can't sacrifiice them like this!
- Hold it! That could be you back there! Or you!
If you ever interfere again,
I'll kill you.
Stay away from him!
Ooh.
Aladar, no.
You just--just go. I'll be okay.
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!
- Carno-what?
-Carnotaur.
A mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude. Let's go.
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!
Aladar, slow down.
Oh, joy. Blisters.
I've got blisters on my blisters.
- You don't wanna know where I got blisters.
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.
- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.
- What's the second-worst thing it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!
- That's it. I'm gone.
-  Oh, my goodness!
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.
Oh, it's Bruton.
It appears we weren't the only ones left behind.
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.
- Suit yourself.
- Hmm?
If you change your mind, we'll be in those caves.
Mm.
It's dark, but at least it's dry.
- I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?
- Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.
You coming in or what?
What is it with you?
At least I know enough to get in out of the rain.
Now, come on.
On your feet.
- Uh, you can lie down with us. It's warmer.
May I remind you that he's one of them ?
Well, looks like he's one of us now.
Ahh. Who booked this trip, anyway?
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough.
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.
- You tell him, Eema.
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.
If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.
This plant grew on our island.
It will make you feel better.
Ahh.
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?
It's hope that's gotten us this far.
But why doesn't he let them accept their fate?
I've accepted mine.
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.
It's the way things are.
Only if you give up,
Bruton.
It's your choice, not your fate.
Well, the plant will help.
-Shh.
Carnotaurs.
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.
Oh.
- Ooh.
-  Go! Go!
Hurry!
Move it, Eema!
Oh!
-  Aladar!
Aladar! Oh, no!
- I'll hold them off!.
You help the others!
Bruton!
Bruton! No!
Bruton!
You did what you could.
It's okay, little ones.
We're going to make it.
Okay, okay.
Let's do it again. Let's do it again.
- Uh, I spy with my little eye--
- A rock.
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.
Hold on a moment.
- Zini, what is it?
- Do you smell that?
-  Yeah.
Get a load of that.
-  Good show.
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!
Aladar, look out!
No!
Aladar, we'll go back.
Back to what?
It's gone.
We're not meant to survive.
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?
And how dare you waste that good fortune by simply giving up?
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!
The worst of it is, you allowed an old fool like me to believe I was needed-- that I still had a purpose-- and do you know what?
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.
And I, for one, am not willing to die here.
Oh, dear.
The nesting grounds.
It's-- It's untouched.
Our new home.
- And it comes with a pool!
- Yodelay-yodelay- yodelay heehoo
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!
Ha. Amateur.
Look out below!
- Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?
- Not to mention Neera.
They'll get here--
Mm. Soon enough.
Oh, no.
Eema?
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?
That is the way we used to get in here.
They'll never make it over that.
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.
Let him try.
Mm. I hope Kron's in a listening mood.
Stay here.
We'll find a way around it.
In the morning, we'll climb it.
We have to keep trying.
Our survival, our future, is over these rocks.
Now, let's go home!
You'll make it, won't you, boys?
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!
If they can do it, so can you!
- Kron!
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!
- Keep moving!
-Stop!
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight to the carnotaurs?
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!
There's a sheer drop on the other side!
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it!
- Now, follow me!
- Kron!
They're staying with me!
All right. Let's go!
Neera!
He's led that monster right to us! This way!
- No! Don't move!
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!.
Stand together!
Kron!
- No. No.
Kron.
Welcome home.
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.
I'd say it's been a few years since you've hatched an egg.
- You're right, so let me practice on your head.
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest little small fry I ever did see?
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.
-Ohh. Oh, happy day.
- Well done, little one.
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.
Yep. You're your father's son, all right.
- Hey!
Look what I found! New neighbors!
Any of you ladies up for a game of "monkey in the middle"?
- Easy, now! Easy! Hey!
None of us really know what changes, big or small, lie ahead.
One thing is certain--
Our journey's not over.
We can only hope that in some small way... our time here will be remembered.
[man's voice] Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl.
And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night.
Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming.
[horse whinnies]
It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep.
[crows caw]
For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [gasps]
What?
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!
[sighs relier] Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?
[ Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love]
So she said what's the problem, baby?
What's the problem?
I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love
Think about it every time I think 'bout it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it
If it's love, love
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing
'bout love
Oh, come on, come on
- [screams]
-  Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
Everybody's after love
So I said
I'm a snowball running
Running down into this spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight
Shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love
These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once upon a time in love
Hyah!
We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally
I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
It's so good to be home!
- [distant singing]
- [giggling]
Just you and me and...
[Donkey sings]
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.
[chuckles]
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Taking care of your love nest for you.
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants?
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.
You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon?
Oh, yeah, that.
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.
I thought I'd move in with you.
You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.
Just with each other.
Alone.
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you.
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?
You're bothering me.
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so...
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something.
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?
[giggles] Oh.
I think I remember.
- Donkey!
- [Fiona yelps]
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.
What do you want me to tell these other guys?
[fanfare]
[theme to Hawaii Five-O]
Enough, Reggie.
[clears throat] "Dearest Princess Fiona.
"You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away
"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage
"at which time the King
"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..." uh... "Prince Charming.
"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.
"aka Mom and Dad."
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?
- We're not going.
- [both] What?
I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?
[chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.
Yeah, right.
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club.
Stop it.
They're not like that.
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance.
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?
No! They just want to give you their blessing.
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?
If you want to be a part of this family, yes!
Who says I want to be part of this family?
You did!
When you married me!
Well, there's some fine print for you!
[exasperated sigh]
So that's it. You won't come?
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!
[Gingy] Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.
[all cheer]
- Hey, wait for me. Oof!
- [glass breaks]
[sighs]
[ Chic: Le Freak]
Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!
Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!
Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!
Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!
Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!
Rawhide!
Yee-haw!
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] No.
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Fiona] Not yet.
- [Donkey] OK, are we there yet?
- [Fiona] No.
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] No!
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] Yes.
- Really?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Fiona] No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek & Fiona] No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek mimics]
- That's not funny. That's really immature.
- [Shrek mimics]
- This is why nobody likes ogres.
- [Shrek mimics]
- Your loss!
- [Shrek mimics]
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.
That's where we're going.
Far, far...
[softly] away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
[sighs]
[deep sigh]
[clicks tongue]
[popping]
- [popping]
- [exasperated sigh]
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...
[shouts] ...for five minutes!
- [popping]
- [shrieks]
Are we there yet?
- [chuckles] Yes!
- Oh, finally!
[fanfare]
[Lipps, Inc: Funkytown]
Wow!
It's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on.
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.
[whistle] Halt!
Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it
Hey, everyone, look.
Talk about, talk about movin'...
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.
[Donkey] Swimming pools!
Movie stars!
[cheering]
[applause]
[fanfare]
Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband.
Well, this is it.
- This is it.
- This is it.
This is it.
[fanfare]
[fanfare and cheering stop]
[gasps]
[tweeting]
[baby wails]
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.
[chuckles] So... you still think this was a good idea?
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
- [softly] Who on earth are they?
- [softly] I think that's our little girl.
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?
Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look...
[softly] Happy now?
We came. We saw them.
Now let's go before they light the torches.
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.
That was for my own...
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home.
Harold, we have to be...
Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it.
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...
A disaster! There is no way...
- You can do this.
- I really...
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...
Here!
Mom... Dad...
I'd like you to meet my husband...
Shrek.
Well, um...
It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.
[chuckles nervously]
[gulps]
[belches]
- Excuse me.
- [Shrek & Fiona laugh]
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?
[both giggle]
[Shrek] That's good.
I guess not.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
[slurps]
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.
Mmm!
No, no. Darling.
[chuckles nervously] Oh!
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.
Well...
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and...
[laughing] What?
I know you ain't talking about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.
I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.
- [splutters]
- [chokes]
It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it?
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?
- For his type, yes.
- My type?
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.
Bon appetit!
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.
Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...
Ogres, yes!
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!
That is, assuming you don't eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!
It's so nice to have the family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Shrek!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
[glissando]
Your fallen tears have called to me
So, here comes my sweet remedy
I know what every princess needs
For her to live life happily...
[both gasp]
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.
You're all grown up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!
I'm your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.
With just a...
Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone
With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash
A high-priced dress made by mice no less
Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress
Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse
Confide in your very own furniture friends
We'll help you set a new fashion trend
-  I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
-  The kind of girl a prince would date!
They'll write your name on the bathroom wall...
"For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!"
A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle
Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away
And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon fris√©!'
Nip and tuck, here and there to land that prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush
Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay
You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune
Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs
Cheese souffl√©, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!
Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair
Stop!
[chuckles] Look...
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this.
[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.
- [knocking]
- [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona?
[dog barks]
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.
Oh, uh...
Fairy Godmother, furniture...
[giggles]
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She's just trying to help.
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.
- What?
- I don't want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
[laughs] So I see.
Let's go, Kyle.
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?
I told you coming here was a bad idea.
You could've at least tried to get along with my father.
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it.
Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted?
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!
Here's a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!
- [yelps]
- [roars]
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"
[mimics Shrek roaring]
[sniffling]
I knew this would happen.
[Lillian] You should.
You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.
I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally.
This is Fiona's choice.
But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her.
I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing?
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.
I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable.
Don't you remember when we were young?
We used to walk down by the lily pond and...
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It's not the same!
I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!
Oh, stop being such a drama king.
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!
I'd like to know how it could get any worse!
- Hello, Harold.
- [gasps]
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!
Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!
[chuckles]
I'll just stretch it out here for a while.
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.
[yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What?
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!
So, what's new?
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.
When did you get back?
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.
After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert...
I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
He endures blistering winds and scorching desert!
He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower...
And what does he find?
Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married.
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.
Stop the car!
[crash]
Harold.
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.
[gasps] Where are we?
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings...
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part.
[sighs deeply] Indeed not.
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.
Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Use your imagination.
[whooshing]
[whinnies]
Oh...
Come on in, Your Majesty.
[piano plays, people talk]
I like my town
With a little drop of poison
Nobody knows...
[barman belches]
[clears throat] Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
Ah! There you are. Right.
You see, I need to have someone taken care of.
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.
Um... He's an ogre.
[crowd gasp]
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
[knock on door]
Hello?
Who dares enter my room?
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.
[Eels: I Need Some Sleep]
[snoring]
[chimes]
Everyone says
I'm getting down too low
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinning round
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
[plays tune]
Dear Diary...
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.
Dad says I'm going away for a while.
Must be like some finishing school.
Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
[echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming.
[knock on door]
Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book.
I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over...
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.
Dad. We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt.
A little father-son time?
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.
[sighs]
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?
[birds twitter]
[Shrek] Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.
We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
You were the one who said not to stop for directions.
Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you!
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.
I know! I know.
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.
I just really need to make things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy.
[purring]
[purring]
Well, well, well, Donkey.
I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring?
What? I ain't purring.
Sure. What's next? A hug?
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!
[hisses]
Look! A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.
- [screaming]
- Whoa!
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!
Oh, God. Oh...
No!
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!
Shrek! Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
I'll kill that cat!
Ah-ha-ha!
[coughs]
[wheezes]
[retches]
[coughs]
- [chuckles] Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Se√±or.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Fiona's father paid you to do this?
The rich King? S√≠.
[screams]
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That's what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her.
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.
Hold the phone...
"Happiness."
"A tear drop away."
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Pi√±ata!!"
What is a pi√±ata, anyway?
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!
Don't go projecting on me.
I know you're feeling bad, but you got to...
Aaaahhh!
You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...
What? Is it on? Is it on?
[clears throat]
This is Fairy Godmother.
I'm either away from my desk or with a client.
But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment.
Have a "happy ever after. "
Oh...
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure!
Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots.
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?
[purrs]
Ahh!
Listen. He's purring!
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!
[giggles] Shrek!
[barks]
[barks]
Shrek?
They're both festive, aren't they?
What do you think, Harold?
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.
[sighs]
Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.
How do we know there will even be a ball?
Mom. Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven't.
You should ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.
I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in.
You know, after your little spat last night.
Oh. You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute.
Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you'd be happy for me.
Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
[both whisper]
No, really?
[both laugh]
[Shrek] Shh...
Oh...
[hooter blasts]
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.
She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!
[Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter]
[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.
Hi. I'm here to see the...
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!
[sighs]
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.
Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK?
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.
The union?
We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.
Oh! Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.
They don't even have dental.
Okay, we'll just have a look around.
Oh. By the way.
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here.
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.
[voices and grinding machines]
[explosion]
A drop of desire.
[giggles] Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
[laughs]
And just a hint of... lust!
[laughs]
- [Shrek] Excuse me.
- [gasps]
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm's name are you doing here?
Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy.
Oh-ho-ho!
And there's some question as to why that is?
Well, let's explore that, shall we?
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...
[laughs] No ogres!
Let's see. Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.
The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don't live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me!
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Oh! Sorry.
Ah... that's okay.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
[whistles tune]
TGIF, eh, buddy?
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!
You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds are becoming one.
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.
Shrek, this is a bad idea.
Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,
I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Donkey, keep watch.
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.
I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside.
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."
Sorry. No handsome.
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
[gasps] Donkey!
That'll have to do.
We've got company.
Can we get on with this?
Hurry!
Nice catch, Donkey!
Finally! A good use for your mouth.
[ Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love]
Come on!
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone, ever fallen in love
With someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
Fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom? l shall rend his head from his shoulders!
I will smite him where he stands!
He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.
We'll just have to come up with something smarter.
Pardon. Um...
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
Oh...
I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.
"For you and your true love.
"If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine.
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
[sneezes]
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip.
It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?
You still look like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!
But I love Fiona more.
Shrek, no! Wait!
[gurgling]
[farts]
Got to be... I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Maybe it's a dud.
Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.
Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.
[thunder rumbles]
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!
I'm melting!
It's just the rain, Donkey.
[chuckles] Oh.
Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.
[hisses]
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...
The sun'll come out...
Tomorrow
[yawns]
Bet your bottom...
Bet my bottom?
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
Donkey?
Are you all right?
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?
[groans]
[Puss in Boots shrieks]
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
Dad...
I've been thinking about what you said.
And I'm going to set things right.
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.
I'm going to go out and find him.
And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong.
[Lillian] Fiona, please!
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.
[rain patters]
[Both] Fiona!
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.
[Shrek groans]
Good morning, sleepyhead.
[Shrek shouts]
[All] Good morning!
We love your kitty!
- [Shrek] Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
Uhh!
Aahh!
Oh...
A cute button nose?
Thick, wavy locks?
Taut, round buttocks?
I'm... I'm...
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.
I'm Jill. What's your name?
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.
Get in line.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can whinny.
[whinnies]
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."
Pah!
"Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
"Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!
What?
Se√±or? "To make the effects of this potion permanent,
"the drinker must obtain his true love's kiss by midnight."
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.
I'll be true... enough.
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.
[all] Oh...
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have one satisfied Princess.
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.
Inside you're the same old mean, salty...
- Easy.
- ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.
And you're still the same annoying donkey.
- Yeah.
- [sighs]
Well...
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
First things first.
- We need to get you out of those clothes.
- [all gasp]
- Ready?
- Ready!
- [Donkey screams]
- Driver, stop!
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!
I'm blind! Tell the truth.
Will I ever play the violin again?
You poor creature!
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Well, I guess there is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.
[both laugh]
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.
- [whinnies]
- [Puss in Boots, in angry Spanish]
[Butterfly Boocher: Changes]
[Butterfly Boocher: Changes]
Oh, yeah
Turn and face the strange
Ch-Ch-Changes
Don't wanna be a richer one
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-Ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Halt!
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
Still don't know what
I was looking for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets
Every time I thought
I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
- [screams]
-  Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
- Shrek?
-  Ch-Ch-Changes
Don't wanna be a richer one
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
- Donkey?
Wow! That potion worked on you, too?
What potion?
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...
Now, we're sexy!
Shrek?
[purrs]
For you, baby... I could be.
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Shrek?
Fiona! Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona. It is me.
What happened to your voice?
The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona.
But not the way I feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
- Do you think so?
[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?
[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!
Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!
Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon.
[sighs deeply]
Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
And now she can be.
Oh, sweetheart.
She's finally found the prince of her dreams.
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.
It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She's a princess, and you're an ogre.
That's something no amount of potion will ever change.
But...
I love her.
If you really love her... you'll let her go.
[Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]
[Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]
Shrek?
Se√±or.
What's going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold?
People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
There you go, boys.
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Hey. Why the long face?
It was all just a stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.
Come on. Is he really that good-looking?
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better.
Look, guys.
It's for the best.
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
Except for you.
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.
Aye.
And that's why
I have to let her go.
Excuse me, is she here?
She's, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Fairy Godmother. Charming.
You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming.
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it's nobody's fault.
Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?
- [both] What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?
I can't. I won't do it.
Oh, yes, you will.
If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after.
And I can take it away just as easily.
Is that what you want? Is it?
- No.
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
I need to do Charming's hair before the ball.
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.
Oh. Thank you, Mother.
[Donkey] Mother?
Um... Mary! A talking horse!
The ogre!
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!
(Announcer) The abs are fab and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!
The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.
Everyone who's anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!
Look! Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!
- Oh, aren't they adorable!
- [screaming]
[woman] Here comes Sleeping Beauty!
Tired old thing.
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...
It's the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
Can I get a whoop whoop?
May all your endings be happy and...
Well, you know the rest!
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.
I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!
No, to your left. Your left!
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!
We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.
It's time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won't fly.
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?
You capitalist pig dogs!
[shrieks]
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.
Find Princess Fiona!
I'm a donkey!
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!
Quick! Rewind it!
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!
[knock on door]
Darling?
Ah. I thought I might find you here.
How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?
I'm not going.
The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage.
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.
Change?
He's completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?
You might find you like this new Shrek.
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.
I'd give anything to have him back.
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.
Thanks.
I got to get out of here!
I got to get out of here!
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!
What about my Miranda rights?
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!
You have the right to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.
Shrek? Donkey?
Too late.
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!
Oh...
[ Theme from Mission Impossible]
Fire in ze hole!
[explosion, rumbling]
Look out below!
Quick! Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!
It looks like you most certainly am are!
- I am not!
- What kind?
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Are not!
- Are too!
Here we go. Hang tight.
[Donkey] Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!
Ow!
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!
Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!
We've got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was going to let her go.
I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona.
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?
Because we're gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!
[evil chuckle]
[Gingy] It's alive!
[rattling]
[gasping]
[whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can!
[screaming]
Go, baby, go!
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!
[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
[all shout]
[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!
[Mongo] Pretty pony.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.
[applause, cheering]
Shrek, what are you doing?
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.
Is that glitter on your lips?
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...
[piano plays]
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
Ladies and gentlemen.
[applause, cheering]
I'd like to dedicate this song to...
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
Fiona, my Princess.
Will you honor me with a dance?
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
[all chant] Dance!
Where's the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Since when do you dance?
Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises.
Late at night I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
I need a hero
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!
Man the catapults!
Aim! Fire!
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!
[groaning]
Not the gumdrop button!
[enraged howling]
Incoming!
Ha-ha! All right!
Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Go, Mongo! Go!
Man the cauldrons!
After you, Mongo.
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!
Shrek!
More heat, less foam!
Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning
Splits the sea
I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me
Heave! Ho!
[Gingy, slow-motion] No...!
[Mongo groans]
[whistles] Come on!
[cheering]
Look out!
- Be good.
- [weeping bitterly]
[sobbing] He needs me!
Let me go!
Donkey!
Puss!
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!
Today, I repay my debt.
[all] Aww...
[growling] On guard!
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight
- I need a hero
- Stop!
[Donkey whinnies]
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?
You couldn't just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!
Pinocchio! Get the wand!
I see London! I see France!
Whah!
I'm a real boy!
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!
Catch!
Donkey!
Oh!
I'm a real boy. Aah!
Oh!
- Ha!
- Ah.
That's mine!
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
And Donkey!
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!
No!
- Hi-ya!
- [crowd gasp]
- Fiona.
- Shrek.
Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion!
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.
- [Charming] Mommy!
- Mommy?
[growls] I told you.
Ogres don't live happily ever after.
[screams]
Woo!
Ha!
[breathes deeply]
[gasping] Oh, Dad!
[sobbing]
- Is he...?
- Yup.
[croaking]
He croaked.
Harold?
Dad?
I'd hoped you'd never see me like this.
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.
To both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.
But I can see now... she already has it.
Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing?
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be the man you deserve.
You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.
[ribbits]
[clock chimes]
[clock chimes]
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
Midnight!
Fiona. Is this what you want?
To be this way forever?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this.
You'd do that?
- For me?
- Yes.
I want what any princess wants.
To live happily ever after... with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
[sobbing]
[clock chimes]
Whoa!
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.
Oh, no.
[sighs]
[laughs] Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.
[giggles] Now, where were we?
Oh. I remember.
[giggling]
[applause]
Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having a fiesta?
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

Puss and Donkey, y'all...
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
- Sing it, Puss!
-  I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
Here we go!
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
Living la vida loca
Hey gorgeous!
Living la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out

-  Living the vida loca
[Puss in Boots jamming]
[Puss in Boots]
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!
She'll push and pull you down
Living la vida loca
She will wear you out
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Living the vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
All by myself
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore...
Amigo, we are off to the Kit-Kat Club.
Come on, join us.
Thanks, compadre.
I'm... I'm not in the mood.
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!
[shrieking]
Hey, baby!
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!
Baby, where you been?
- [cries]
- I'm sorry, too.
I should've stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.
What? Say it one more time.
What you talking about?
Are you serious?
- [cooing]
- [gasping]
- Papa!
- [screaming]
- [cooing, squealing]
- [chuckling]
Look at our little mutant babies!
[Donkey] I got to get a job.

{1071}{1115}a journey they must take...
{1115}{1178}a destiny to fulfill.
{1179}{1235}As close|as your imagination...
{1236}{1278}exists a magical place...
{1279}{1343}where wondrous creatures|with incredible powers...
{1343}{1387}help make dreams come true.
{1415}{1483}It's the world of Pokemon.
{2261}{2353}People can capture Pokemon|to be more than just pets.
{2354}{2393}Human trainers|and their Pokemon...
{2394}{2464}compete against others|in amazing contests...
{2465}{2509}of skill and strategy.
{2510}{2613}The best trainers one day|become Pokemon masters.
{2614}{2681}That's a dream that|burns brightly for many...
{2682}{2753}but none more so|than Ash Ketchum.
{2800}{2865}The pride of Pallet Town|began his Pokemon journey...
{2866}{2907}on his tenth birthday.
{2908}{2994}That's the day he qualified|to become a Pokemon trainer.
{3008}{3084}Professor Oak gave Ash|his very first Pokeball.
{3085}{3136}Inside was|an electric Pokemon...
{3137}{3225}with whom Ash would spark|a lifelong friendship--Pikachu.
{3226}{3255}Pikachu!
{3256}{3301}Together, Ash and Pikachu|are determined...
{3302}{3340}to fulfill his dream...
{3341}{3399}of becoming the world's|greatest Pokemon master.
{3400}{3448}Joining them on their quest|are Misty...
{3449}{3489}and yours truly, Brock...
{3490}{3562}in the incredible world|of Pokemon.

{5543}{5566}Huh?
{5567}{5611}Don't tell me|you haven't heard about it.
{5612}{5637}No, I haven't.
{5638}{5673}What's the Voice|of the Forest?
{5674}{5706}Well, it's only a legend...
{5707}{5764}but everyone around here|believes it.
{5765}{5815}They say there's a sound|you can hear...
{5816}{5857}when the spirit|that protects the forest...
{5858}{5884}is time-traveling.
{5885}{5920}Time-traveling?
{5921}{5964}That's one of|its special powers.
{5965}{6043}It can go back and forth|between the past and the future.
{6044}{6077}Wow.
{6078}{6123}So if you hear|a weird sound...
{6124}{6174}stop and stay|completely still.
{6175}{6208}If the spirit|catches you...
{6209}{6257}it could carry you off|to a different time.
{6258}{6300}Don't worry.|I'll be careful.
{6301}{6326}Mm.
{6327}{6363}Thanks. Bye.

{9821}{9858}Celebi?
{9886}{9940}Why should I hand it over?|What do you want with it?
{9941}{9984}I'm a Pokemon hunter, kid.
{9985}{10040}I make good money|off of rare Pokemon.
{10041}{10088}First I catch 'em,|then I auction 'em off...
{10089}{10118}to the highest bidders.
{10119}{10176}Well, you're not gonna get|your hands on this Pokemon!
{10177}{10204}Give it to me!

{10560}{10624}Bi-i-i-i-i-i!

{10944}{10988}Huh?
{10989}{11034}Bi-i-i-i-i-i!
{12291}{12355}I'll tell you why I'm here.
{12385}{12426}I'm here|because I heard a story...
{12427}{12465}that you almost|caught a Celebi...
{12466}{12538}somewhere in this forest|about 40 years ago--true?
{12539}{12590}I'm still a Pokemon hunter!
{12591}{12637}I'm not gonna tell you anything!
{12638}{12704}Heh heh.|We'll see about that.
{12929}{12955}OK.
{12956}{12993}Sneasel! Sneasel!
{12994}{13026}Sneasel!
{13230}{13274}What's that thing?
{13275}{13303}A Dark Ball.
{13304}{13330}What's it do?
{13331}{13384}Allow me to demonstrate.
{13532}{13590}The Pokemon I catch|with the Dark Ball...
{13591}{13628}become evil Pokemon...
{13629}{13718}and their power instantly|increases to the highest level.
{13719}{13777}Come on out, Tyranitar!
{14016}{14055}Hyper Beam Attack!
{14506}{14533}No, please!
{14534}{14579}It's gonna destroy everything!
{14580}{14606}Uhh!
{14607}{14678}Aah! Aah! All right!|All right!
{14679}{14728}I'll show you!|I'll show you the spot...
{14729}{14771}where I found that Celebi!
{14772}{14811}Heh heh heh heh heh.
{14812}{14869}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14870}{14913}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14914}{14986}I thought|you'd see it my way.
{15781}{15823}Today we find our friends...
{15824}{15868}waiting for a ferry|that will carry them...
{15869}{15910}to yet another Pokemon gym...
{15911}{15972}as they continue|their Johto League journey.
{15973}{16012}Brock and Misty are ready.
{16013}{16068}The passengers|are hurrying aboard...
{16069}{16135}and it's almost time|for the boat to leave.
{16135}{16178}But where are|Ash and Pikachu?
{16196}{16270}Well, if they don't come soon|they're gonna miss the boat.
{16271}{16303}T ogepi!
{16303}{16336}Crobat, go!
{16405}{16431}Crobat!
{16459}{16491}Cro!
{16491}{16522}My name's Dundee...
{16523}{16587}and I'm the best Pokemon|trainer in the whole town.
{16587}{16615}Well, my name's Ash...
{16616}{16680}and I'm a pretty good|Pokemon trainer, too.
{16681}{16744}Why don't you pick a Pokemon,|and we can have a battle.
{16745}{16768}Pika!
{16769}{16809}Croconaw, go!
{16841}{16875}Croconaw!
{16921}{16951}A Croconaw, huh?
{16951}{17001}Never battled|one of those before.
{17002}{17067}OK, Pikachu, let's go!
{17067}{17095}Pika!
{17096}{17194}Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon,|Pokemon, Pokemon
{17195}{17231}Let's do it
{18137}{18179}Thunder Shock Attack!
{20519}{20558}So, sounds like|you're all...
{20559}{20610}pretty interested|in Pokemon, huh?
{20611}{20635}Yeah.
{20636}{20681}I come from a place|just up the river...
{20682}{20717}and a lot|of real unusual ones...
{20718}{20753}Iive in the forest nearby.
{20754}{20793}Hey, if you could show us|where it is...
{20794}{20832}maybe we could stop|and check it out.
{20833}{20875}No problem.|We can get off...
{20876}{20908}at the next stop,|and I'll take you...
{20909}{20943}the rest of the way|in my boat.
{20944}{20982}Great. Thanks.
{20983}{21006}Pika!
{21007}{21042}ALL: Huh?
{21043}{21075}ASH: Ohh.
{21101}{21162}Hey, was that a Pokemon?
{21163}{21196}Looked like one to me.
{21197}{21276}You'll see the woods|around here are full of them.
{21336}{21401}There's one more possibility.
{21402}{21442}Did it look|anything like this?
{21443}{21491}Yeah, that's it, Professor.
{21507}{21545}It was a Suicune.
{21546}{21574}A Suicune?
{21575}{21617}What kind of Pokemon|is that, Professor?
{21618}{21664}It's one of the legendary|Pokemon, Brock...
{21665}{21701}and not very much|is known about it.
{21702}{21742}And according|to folk tales...
{21743}{21794}Suicune personifies|the north wind...
{21795}{21840}and it's believed|to have the power...
{21841}{21883}to purify tainted waters.
{21884}{21938}Wow, I hope I get|to see Suicune again.
{21939}{21996}Its sounds like|it's a pretty cool one.
{21997}{22039}Believe you me, kids...
{22040}{22096}those tales|are definitely true.
{22097}{22160}Really? How do you know that|for sure, Professor?
{22161}{22213}Have you ever seen|a Suicune before?
{22214}{22280}Yes, I sure have,|but only one time.
{22281}{22311}Wow! Where?
{22312}{22363}Hey, Ash, come on!
{22364}{22395}We've gotta go!
{22395}{22425}OK!
{22426}{22468}Uh, bye, Professor.
{22737}{22819}I wonder if I should've told him|before he hung up.
{22820}{22855}Hmm.
{22937}{22974}The quicker we get|into that forest...
{22975}{23025}the quicker we can look|for those Pokemon.
{23026}{23072}Maybe even that Suicune.
{23160}{23206}Those twerps won't get away now.
{23207}{23238}They're right beneath us.
{23239}{23285}Of course, they're|beneath us. They're twerps.
{23286}{23354}Now all we do is|swoop in and swipe Pikachu.
{23355}{23403}Uh-oh. Something's wrong|with my leg.
{23404}{23445}All this pedaling|is giving me a cramp.
{23446}{23470}Oh! Ow!
{23471}{23533}Aah! You can't cramp!|We'll crash!
{23967}{23993}All right.
{23994}{24042}What do we do now?
{24043}{24091}Don't worry, Misty.|You'll see.
{24125}{24148}-Whoa.|-Pi?
{24149}{24179}Toge?
{24289}{24343}Toge! Toge!|Toge! Toge!
{24547}{24571}Ha ha ha!
{24571}{24605}Toge-togepi!
{24710}{24746}Well, we're here.
{24747}{24801}Here? Where?
{24802}{24837}Look closer.
{24872}{24904}Tree houses?
{24905}{24938}Togepi!
{24939}{25014}That's right, Brock.|Welcome to Arborville.
{25347}{25370}Pika?
{25371}{25397}-Whoa.|-Prrri!
{25467}{25499}Stop right there!
{25500}{25534}Huh?
{25562}{25610}I suppose you kids|are heading into the forest...
{25611}{25643}to look for Pokemon.
{25644}{25680}Yes, ma'am.
{25681}{25730}Then you're gonna love|what you see in there.
{25731}{25787}I love what I see here!|My name's Brock...
{25788}{25831}and I'm studying to|become a Pokemon breeder...
{25832}{25881}but my specialty|is human relations.
{25882}{25904}Oh?
{25905}{25939}Please tell me your name!
{25940}{26003}My name's Diana,|and that's my grandma.
{26004}{26042}She's been guarding|the entrance to the forest...
{26043}{26073}since she was my age.
{26074}{26121}Listen for The Voice|of the Forest...
{26122}{26179}and if you hear it,|stop and be still...
{26180}{26227}or you will not get away.
{26228}{26263}The Voice of the Forest?
{26264}{26303}It's an old village legend.
{26304}{26353}Yes, it's a legend,|and a true one.
{26354}{26409}If you hear The Voice,|stop where you are.
{26410}{26440}Uh, we gotta hurry...
{26441}{26492}but thanks a lot for|the warning, ma'am.
{26493}{26519}Pika!
{26520}{26587}Diana, why don't you|come, too, and protect us?
{26588}{26640}Then she'd need|protection from you.
{26853}{26906}I wonder what|Diana's grandmother meant...
{26907}{26959}by 'The Voice|of the Forest. "
{26960}{27015}Maybe the sound of the wind|or the trees...
{27016}{27085}the water, or maybe|the voices of the Pokemon.
{27156}{27179}Pi?
{27180}{27247}Ohh. I wonder what that is.
{27248}{27282}Maybe it's The Voice|of the Forest.
{27283}{27311}-Come on!|-Pika!
{27312}{27337}Ash, no!
{27338}{27387}Hey, shouldn't we stand still?
{27388}{27435}Uh...wait up!
{27906}{27949}Bi.
{27950}{27974}Bi.
{28001}{28028}Bi.
{28097}{28139}Hey, it's a kid.
{28151}{28176}Is he OK?
{28177}{28202}He's still breathing.
{28203}{28234}Yeah.
{28235}{28269}Let's take him|back to Diana's house.
{28270}{28294}Good idea.
{28295}{28323}Yeah.
{28324}{28359}Bi...
{28360}{28426}I wonder what that light was.
{28459}{28528}Hey! Diana!
{28529}{28611}Diana! We need help!
{28611}{28668}Oh, dear. What's happened?
{28699}{28750}Hey, Ash, he's waking up.
{28811}{28862}Take it easy.|You're gonna be OK.
{28863}{28892}Pika.
{28893}{28923}Uhh.
{28951}{28976}Uhh!
{28977}{29032}What'd you do with that Celebi?
{29055}{29096}Hey, I'm trying to help you!
{29097}{29139}That's enough, you two.|Knock it off.
{29140}{29166}Settle down!
{29167}{29201}Who are you anyway?
{29202}{29226}Huh?
{29227}{29275}Where am l?
{29275}{29314}Howd I get here?
{29315}{29367}I carried you here|on my back, that's how!
{29368}{29398}What's going on?
{29399}{29430}MlSTY:|We found him unconscious...
{29431}{29478}when we were out|in the forest.
{29479}{29503}Oh!
{29503}{29552}Oh-oh-oh!
{29553}{29611}I can't believe it.|It's really you.
{29612}{29635}Huh?
{29636}{29670}You've come back.
{29671}{29729}Oh, thank goodness!
{29730}{29753}Uh, Grandma...
{29754}{29804}where did he|come back from?
{29805}{29850}Diana, I've told you|the story...
{29851}{29900}about what happened|when I was a young girl.
{29901}{29956}A little boy disappeared|from the forest.
{29957}{30011}But this boy can't be him.
{30011}{30051}Well, maybe it can't be...
{30052}{30092}-but it is.|-Huh?
{30191}{30233}Ah! You're the girl...
{30234}{30284}who gave me|the loaf of bread.
{30285}{30321}Yes.
{30367}{30397}Here.
{30398}{30477}I've kept this all these years|in case you ever came back.
{30607}{30677}This is my sketchbook.|How--
{30678}{30705}You've been away...
{30706}{30760}on a 40-year-long journey,|young man.
{30761}{30790}40 years?
{30791}{30818}What do you mean?
{30819}{30857}The legend says|The Voice of the Forest...
{30858}{30924}can catch a person and take them|on a trip through time.
{30925}{30973}-Huh?|-Through time?
{31133}{31156}Stantler?|Stan--
{31157}{31192}Stantler!
{31393}{31416}Uhh!
{31417}{31450}Where's Celebi?
{31451}{31486}What happened to Celebi?
{31487}{31511}Celebi?
{31512}{31567}Was there a Pokemon|with me in the forest?
{31567}{31609}We didn't see any.
{31610}{31668}The Pokemon you met|that day was a Celebi?
{31669}{31702}Yes.
{31703}{31764}We know Celebi|as The Voice of the Forest...
{31765}{31815}the spirit that protects it.
{31816}{31866}They say that Celebi|can travel through time.
{31867}{31903}You two must've been|in danger...
{31904}{31942}and Celebi just picked|the fastest way...
{31943}{31969}to get you out of it.
{31970}{32006}It's must've|escaped to the future...
{32007}{32039}and taken you along with it.
{32039}{32070}I'm afraid you're right.
{32071}{32138}Celebi lives|deep in the forest...
{32139}{32206}in a place we call|"The Lake of Life."
{32207}{32275}That's probably where|it's gone back to now.
{32275}{32342}I've got a feeling Celebi|still may be hurt.
{32355}{32427}I have to go back into|that forest and find Celebi.
{32427}{32452}I'll go, too!
{32453}{32478}Me, too!
{32479}{32503}So will l!
{32504}{32530}Togepi!
{32531}{32558}My name's Brock...
{32559}{32591}and I'm a Pokemon breeder.
{32591}{32615}I'm Sam.
{32616}{32639}And I'm Misty.
{32640}{32695}My specialty is water Pokemon.
{32695}{32726}My name's Ash Ketchum...
{32727}{32776}and I'm trying|to be a Pokemon master.
{32777}{32802}Pika!
{32803}{32851}Oh, yeah,|and this is Pikachu.
{32851}{32880}Pikachu!
{32881}{32931}Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam.
{32954}{33019}Our glider|didn't glide very well.
{33019}{33087}Next time|we spring for a motor.
{33088}{33135}I wonder where|those twerps are.
{33136}{33192}We may never know.|Huh?
{33193}{33217}-Huh?|-Huh?
{33218}{33278}Well, well.
{33279}{33320}I can't believe my eyes.
{33321}{33355}Looks like it's a good thing...
{33356}{33398}we crashed after|all, eh, Meowth?
{33399}{33449}Come on, let's get down|and tail them twerps!
{33492}{33517}Pika!
{33518}{33554}Pikachu!
{33598}{33640}Pi--pi--pi--pi--
{33641}{33670}Pi--Pika!
{33671}{33700}Guys, look up there!
{33857}{33913}The Pokemon|are all together.
{33973}{34021}I'm coming, too!
{34133}{34179}Ash climbs just like a Mankey.
{34180}{34207}Togepi!
{34237}{34260}Pi!
{34303}{34332}-Aah!|-Pika!
{34401}{34466}Sam, maybe you should wait|down with Brock and Misty.
{34467}{34516}No. I have to find Celebi.
{34517}{34559}I couldn't|protect it before...
{34559}{34595}so I've gotta help it now.
{34645}{34747}I know how you feel, Sam,|but take it easy.
{34764}{34844}Pi! Pi! Pi! Pi!
{35024}{35063}Uh. Ah!
{35064}{35169}Bi...bi.
{35170}{35206}Hey.
{35207}{35237}Is this the Celebi?
{35238}{35261}Mm-hmm.
{35262}{35293}Come on, Celebi.
{35294}{35339}Bi. Bi!
{35375}{35435}Whoa! Unh!
{35435}{35491}Hey! What'd you do that for?
{35546}{35609}I think Ash just evolved|into a primate.
{35610}{35651}We're only trying to help you.
{35652}{35689}Bi!
{35721}{35746}Whoa!
{35747}{35795}What's going on?
{35795}{35851}Pika--
{35851}{35896}No, Pikachu, don't!
{35925}{35959}Don't be mad at it.
{35959}{35997}It's just afraid...
{35998}{36031}and it's hurt, too.
{36031}{36067}A hunter attacked it.
{36067}{36101}That's why it's scared.
{36102}{36151}OK. Here goes.
{36247}{36289}Celebi, we're your friends.
{36290}{36333}We don't want to hurt you.
{36334}{36369}We just want to help you.
{36370}{36396}Bi!
{36423}{36462}I tried to help you before.
{36463}{36508}Don't you remember, Celebi?
{36509}{36556}I got you away|from the Pokemon hunter.
{36557}{36591}It's OK.
{36591}{36637}Bi?
{36674}{36728}You just take it easy.
{36729}{36767}And we will, too.
{36768}{36802}There...
{36838}{36863}Bi.
{36895}{36921}Bi?
{36947}{36993}Uh...
{36994}{37035}Ha ha!
{37273}{37331}You're safe with me, Celebi.
{37331}{37355}Bi.
{37387}{37425}Bi.
{37466}{37502}Pik--Pik--Pik...
{37558}{37591}Brock, it seems really weak.
{37592}{37636}Yeah, we better hurry.
{37637}{37675}We'll take it|to a Pokemon center.
{37676}{37699}Pika-pi!
{37700}{37736}Who are they?
{37737}{37799}Prepare for trouble.|Your future looks grim.
{37800}{37855}And we're not afraid|to go out on a limb.
{37856}{37915}To protect the world|from devastation.
{37916}{37975}To unite all peoples|within our nation.
{37976}{38039}To denounce the evils|of truth and love.
{38040}{38095}To extend our reach|to the stars above.
{38096}{38127}Jessie.
{38127}{38154}James.
{38155}{38187}Team Rocket...
{38187}{38228}blast off|at the speed of light.
{38261}{38319}Surrender now|or prepare to fight.
{38319}{38360}Meowth--that's right.
{38361}{38411}Wobbuffet!|Wobbuffet!
{38412}{38451}Aah!
{38484}{38507}Hmm.
{38508}{38543}Do you think|they're gonna be OK?
{38544}{38579}Unfortunately, yes.
{38580}{38610}Hmm.
{38611}{38660}You twerps got lucky this time.
{38661}{38707}They're always lucky.
{38707}{38751}Wobbuffet!
{38777}{38820}Don't press your luck, blubbo.
{38843}{38879}Hang in there, Celebi.
{38903}{38958}Look, that's|the village up there!
{39001}{39047}Aah!
{39048}{39127}I've been looking|for that little Celebi.
{39127}{39157}Who are you?
{39158}{39196}A Pokemon lover.
{39197}{39225}Leave us alone!
{39262}{39295}What does he want?
{39296}{39363}He must be trying to steal|our Pikachu away.
{39364}{39403}Well, we won't let him!
{39451}{39497}Weezing. Weezing.
{39592}{39623}Huhh!
{39722}{39750}What's that?
{39751}{39779}A Tyranitar...
{39780}{39815}but there's something|funny about it.
{39816}{39846}Hyper-beam!
{40055}{40086}Here it comes!
{40087}{40127}Pika! Pika!
{40128}{40219}Weezing!
{40219}{40300}Two can play|the Celebi-stealing game.
{40523}{40567}Who are you three?
{40568}{40603}Look at that mask.
{40604}{40633}I've seen him before.
{40634}{40696}Yeah, wasn't he in|that Mexican wrestling movie?
{40697}{40744}No, Meowth,|he's from Team Rocket.
{40745}{40795}The lron Mask Marauder!
{40796}{40848}So you heard about me.
{40849}{40876}Yeah!
{40877}{40918}Oh, yes, we've heard|a lot about you.

{41505}{41580}Brock, I twisted my knee.
{41581}{41623}You better stay off it.
{41624}{41662}Pi--Pika!

{55700}{55732}-Hey!|-Hey!
{55863}{55907}Nice catch.
{55907}{55941}It was peachy.
{55975}{56000}Huh?
{56049}{56094}There goes our driver!
{56095}{56147}Wait! Come back!|Don't leave us!
{56148}{56196}We'll even chip in for gas!
{56578}{56625}Sammy, it's the middle|of the night.
{56626}{56671}I know, but I can't sleep.
{56801}{56832}Hey, that's great.
{56833}{56876}Thanks. When I meet|a new Pokemon...
{56877}{56916}I sketch him in this book.
{56917}{56948}Can I take a look?
{56949}{56977}Mm-hmm.
{57013}{57041}Hmm.
{57089}{57168}Oh, these are amazing!
{57169}{57222}This is like|a handmade Pokedex.
{57223}{57288}That's this machine that|has pictures of Pokemon.
{57289}{57351}I guess you know a lot|about the future, huh, Ash?
{57352}{57407}At least more than I do.
{57407}{57461}Yeah, I guess so...
{57462}{57534}but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck|in it like you are.
{57574}{57621}Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
{57838}{57922}Hey, I didn't mean|to make you feel bad, Sam.
{57923}{57956}Honest, I didn't.
{57957}{57988}That's OK.
{57989}{58035}I think I'll like|living in the future...
{58035}{58079}but it'll take|some getting used to.
{58079}{58111}Yeah. Probably.
{58112}{58185}But then I think about my mother|worrying about me...
{58186}{58234}and wondering where I am.
{58235}{58283}And I wonder|if she still wonders.
{58301}{58393}Oh. Yeah, me, too.
{58394}{58446}Hey, what about your mom, Ash?
{58447}{58489}I bet she worries about you...
{58490}{58538}when you're out on|your Pokemon journey.
{58539}{58603}Yeah, she worries, I guess.
{58633}{58689}Maybe that's just what moms do.
{58690}{58713}Mm.
{58757}{58798}Thinking about my mom...
{58799}{58842}gets me thinking|about her cooking.
{58843}{58876}Hey, I have something.
{58877}{58903}Huh?
{59042}{59095}Diana's grandmother made this...
{59096}{59149}but that was about|40 years ago.
{59150}{59195}Still looks|pretty fresh, though.
{59195}{59243}-Mm.|-Mm.
{59243}{59275}It's great!
{59275}{59323}Tastes like it was|made yesterday.
{59359}{59386}Pika?
{59387}{59435}Pika?
{59435}{59483}Bi? Bi?
{59588}{59628}What's the matter, Pikachu?
{59629}{59660}Hey, Ash, look.
{59661}{59685}Huh?
{59795}{59819}Oh.
{59819}{59843}Oh.
{60129}{60178}Oh, cool.
{60179}{60225}Wow.
{60314}{60373}Look at all the Butterfree.
{60405}{60447}I hope you'll be free, Sam.
{60448}{60471}Huh?
{60472}{60516}I mean, to go back in time.
{60517}{60540}Oh.
{60746}{60806}-Oh.|-Oh.
{60807}{60846}Free!
{60847}{60872}Wait for me!

{61221}{61258}Ah. Whoa.

{61508}{61551}Pika!
{61967}{62002}Bi!
{62043}{62105}Well, the village|is real close now.
{62106}{62131}Bi! Bi!
{62132}{62155}Look!
{62156}{62187}Pika!
{62188}{62242}Bi-i!
{62278}{62326}Bi! Bi!
{62359}{62389}Bi!
{62390}{62435}Thought you'd gotten rid of us...
{62436}{62474}didn't you, twerps?
{62475}{62528}But Team Rocket doesn't|give up so easily!
{62529}{62565}Not you again.
{62611}{62659}All right...
{62660}{62733}we ain't leaving|without that Celebi.
{62734}{62839}Pikachu!
{62875}{62917}Nice try!
{62918}{62976}Togepi!
{63085}{63124}Oh!
{63224}{63251}Bi!
{63252}{63277}Celebi!
{63316}{63375}This ought to calm you down.
{63376}{63419}Bi!
{63420}{63458}Hey!
{63459}{63486}Pika-pi!
{63644}{63691}Dark Ball, go!
{63776}{63815}-Aah!|-Aah!
{63874}{63940}Celebi is mine.
{63941}{63984}Let it go!
{64082}{64117}Stupid kids.
{64118}{64163}Aah! Hey! Aah!
{64396}{64424}Pika!
{64633}{64678}-Whoa!|-Aah!
{64771}{64828}Don't worry. I got ya.
{64829}{64857}Aah!
{64858}{64942}I think that Dark Ball|belongs to me.
{64943}{64985}Aah--aah!
{65227}{65250}Ash!
{65251}{65275}-Pika-pi!|-Toge!
{65276}{65319}Huh?
{65546}{65593}Don't waste your time.
{65594}{65666}It's too late to save|your friend Celebi.
{65741}{65766}Stantler.
{65804}{65885}Because the sweet little|Pokemon you used to know...
{65886}{65934}doesn't exist anymore.
{65935}{65972}Here, see for yourself!
{66114}{66186}Celebi, get rid of them all!
{66422}{66458}Aah!
{66505}{66542}Pika!
{66912}{66942}I don't understand.
{66943}{67021}If Celebi's their friend,|I'd hate to see their enemies.
{67022}{67063}Excellent.
{67064}{67123}You're very strong, Celebi.
{67124}{67212}Now show me even|more of your power!
{67413}{67454}[Laughs]
{67455}{67539}With a Pokemon like you,|no one will ever stop me!
{67540}{67593}Celebi.
{67722}{67801}Celebi's building a nasty nest.
{67802}{67841}Oh, no!
{68102}{68125}Oh.
{68126}{68174}Oh, what is that?
{68175}{68199}I don't know.
{68200}{68229}Grandma.
{68230}{68269}We'd better go find out.
{68270}{68298}Right.
{68356}{68386}Mm...uhh.
{68387}{68413}Uhh!
{68414}{68459}Celebi! Uhh!
{68460}{68492}I've gotta--
{68493}{68523}Uhh!
{68524}{68555}Take it easy, Ash.
{68556}{68608}You might be hurt.
{68686}{68717}Hey!
{68718}{68785}Hi, guys! Just stay|right where you are.
{68786}{68837}We're coming down to get you!
{68838}{68883}Diana!
{68883}{68939}I can't believe|they found us!
{69681}{69722}Uhh, this is awful.
{69723}{69771}Forcing the Spirit|of the Forest...
{69771}{69814}to destroy the forest.
{69815}{69872}This is just despicable.
{69931}{69988}Do you think Jessie's|going to be all right?
{69989}{70067}Yeah, but I ain't so sure|about Celebi. Heh.
{70401}{70466}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{70467}{70524}Uh, excuse me,|Mr. Masked Person...
{70525}{70563}but could you let me|out of here?
{70564}{70666}Not yet. I need a witness who|can report back to Giovanni.
{70667}{70716}I want the head|of Team Rocket to know...
{70717}{70771}just how powerful Celebi is...
{70772}{70827}and how powerful I am, too.
{70828}{70910}Celebi, the time has come!
{72360}{72398}I'm very impressed.
{72399}{72461}You and Celebi|are extremely powerful!
{72462}{72498}Now just get me down|from here...
{72499}{72546}and I'll recommend you|for a big promotion...
{72547}{72598}when you give Celebi|to the boss.
{72599}{72632}Ha ha ha ha ha!
{72633}{72724}I control the most powerful|Pokemon in the world!
{72725}{72780}Why would I want to give|something that valuable...
{72781}{72809}to the boss?
{72810}{72840}What do you mean?
{72841}{72902}Now the boss|has to be afraid of me...
{72903}{72978}because Celebi gives me|the power to destroy him!
{72979}{73044}With Celebi,|I can rule Team Rocket...
{73045}{73104}and the whole world,|if I want to!
{73105}{73209}Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{73210}{73246}What is that?
{73247}{73304}The evil Celebi|must've created it.
{73305}{73336}Pika?
{73605}{73632}Celebi!
{73633}{73664}Pika!
{73665}{73704}Oh, you again.
{73705}{73757}Celebi, get rid of 'em now!
{73899}{73922}Celebi!
{73923}{73954}Hold on! Uhh!
{74739}{74774}Is everybody OK?
{74775}{74805}I think so.
{74806}{74835}I'm still alive.
{74836}{74862}SAM: Me, too.
{74863}{74886}ASH: So am l.
{74887}{74918}Pika!
{74919}{74954}Grandma!
{74955}{75033}I'm alive, too, but just barely.
{75034}{75062}Hmm.
{75063}{75143}We have to stop|that horrible thing.
{75224}{75293}We're no match for|that big twig monster.
{75294}{75328}I know.
{75329}{75366}Poor Jessie.
{75500}{75554}All right, Pikachu,|try a Thunder Bolt.
{75555}{75591}Pika...
{75592}{75636}chuuu!
{75668}{75744}Celebi, get rid|of these children!
{75920}{75960}Pika!
{75961}{76018}Celebi, do it now!
{76140}{76170}Huh?
{76171}{76195}Toge?
{76512}{76539}The north wind.
{76540}{76582}The north wind saved them.
{76583}{76613}Suicune!
{76723}{76759}Uhh! Uhh!
{76760}{76785}Aah!
{76831}{76855}Hmm.
{76856}{76930}You must've come here|to help us out.
{76968}{77038}Then we need you to take us|to Celebi right away!
{77108}{77162}Heh heh heh heh.|Nows my chance...
{77163}{77211}to capture a Suicune, too!
{77392}{77463}Tyranitar, Hyper Beam!
{77500}{77524}We've gotta stop him!
{77525}{77559}Go, Onix! Uhh!
{78068}{78111}Hmm.
{78112}{78146}Ohh.
{78185}{78215}Celebi.
{78216}{78256}Celebi!
{79549}{79602}Good work, Onix. Return!
{79659}{79682}Heh heh heh heh.
{79683}{79730}Playtime is over, children.
{79731}{79766}Get them, Celebi.
{79800}{79860}Be careful. This thing could|destroy the whole forest!
{79861}{79894}And the Pokemon!
{79895}{79947}Suicune!
{80363}{80423}Good job!|Now teach 'em a lesson!
{80592}{80675}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!|That's what'll happen...
{80676}{80724}to anybody|who tries to stop me!
{80725}{80766}Pika!
{80890}{80916}Huh?
{80917}{80956}You have to be careful.
{80957}{81002}Celebi's just above us.
{81003}{81029}Thanks a lot.
{81030}{81061}Let's go, Sam.
{81062}{81102}-Right.|-Pika!
{81143}{81206}Uhh! Where are you going?
{81207}{81251}Get me out of here! Hey!
{81365}{81411}Celebi, you have to stop!
{81411}{81441}You're supposed|to protect the forest...
{81442}{81465}not destroy it!
{81466}{81493}Celebi!

{87223}{87267}Yeah, and so is Sam.
{87268}{87310}They've got Celebi, too.
{87311}{87334}Huh?
{87446}{87498}What's wrong?
{87499}{87562}I don't know.|Something bad.
{87736}{87760}The water.
{87761}{87793}Get it into the water!
{87929}{87975}ASH: It's not working.
{87975}{88011}But why not?
{88011}{88055}The forest is hurt.
{88056}{88097}The water's tainted.
{88098}{88148}The lake is dying.
{88149}{88197}But then-wait a second.
{88233}{88308}Suicune has the power to make|the water clean again.
{88309}{88363}Suicune,|if you clean the water...
{88364}{88394}we can save Celebi.
{89249}{89291}The legend's true.
{89292}{89356}The north wind|saved the lake.
{89473}{89558}Celebi, the water's clean again.
{89559}{89608}Pika.
{89707}{89748}It isn't working.
{89797}{89876}All right, then.|We'll keep trying.
{90014}{90114}See? These are those berries|we found in the forest.
{90115}{90161}Here you go.

{90348}{90398}Heh. That's OK.
{90399}{90438}Uhh.
{90505}{90561}Uh, Celebi?
{90702}{90745}Celebi, you can't die!
{91003}{91052}Pika?
{91129}{91194}Celebi didn't do|anything wrong.
{91195}{91251}It was a human being|who forced Celebi...
{91252}{91294}to destroy the forest.
{91295}{91370}Celebi never even had a choice.
{91371}{91418}Uhh! And now--uhh--
{91419}{91482}it can't have a choice.
{91483}{91557}Now it's too late to choose|'cause Celebi is gonna die!
{92762}{92786}Toge-to?
{92787}{92811}Huh?
{92811}{92850}Huh?

{99643}{99697}You tried to destroy|our forest, mister...
{99698}{99764}and we don't take kindly|to that kind of behavior.
{99843}{99905}Scizor, Sneasel!
{99906}{99937}Uhh!
{99995}{100060}This is all a mistake--
{100061}{100113}a big misunderstanding.
{100114}{100152}Ohh!
{100153}{100185}Weedle!
{100255}{100331}I think the Pokemon|understand perfectly.
{100332}{100383}Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
{100465}{100495}Suicune!
{100496}{100526}Thank you!
{100527}{100586}Maybe we'll see you|again someday.
{100587}{100621}Pika!

{101035}{101064}Uh...
{101191}{101227}Bi-i-i-i-i!
{101227}{101266}It looks like|Celebi's getting ready...
{101267}{101306}to travel back in time...
{101307}{101386}and I think it wants|to take you along, Sam.
{101387}{101459}Can you really|bring me back, Celebi?
{101460}{101512}Bi!
{101541}{101605}Looks like|you're goin' home, Sam.
{101606}{101663}Yeah, I guess so.
{101663}{101722}Don't worry.|It won't matter...
{101723}{101815}'cause wherever you are,|or whenever you are--heh--
{101815}{101852}we'll always be friends.
{101979}{102007}Bi.
{102098}{102166}Thank you, Ash.|You're a great friend.
{102167}{102221}Thank you all|for everything.
{102222}{102303}Maybe I'll see you|again...someday!
{102303}{102352}I knowwe will!
{102532}{102580}I'll see you!
{102611}{102683}Good-bye!
{103011}{103080}Pikachu!
{103571}{103608}You were right,|Professor.
{103609}{103667}That Pokemon we saw|was a Suicune.
{103667}{103722}Yeah, and we met|a Celebi, too.
{103723}{103761}It even traveled through time.
{103762}{103804}Well, well,|it sounds like you saw...
{103805}{103885}some very rare and highly|unusual Pokemon out there.
{103886}{103933}Huh? What's the matter, Ash?
{103934}{103961}Uh...
{103962}{104002}You haven't said|a single word yet.
{104003}{104076}Didn't you enjoy your little|adventure in the forest, too?
{104077}{104123}Oh, sure, Professor.
{104123}{104153}But, you see...
{104154}{104197}I met this Pokemon trainer...
{104198}{104231}and we got to be friends.
{104232}{104281}But l--|I just don't think...
{104282}{104327}I'm ever gonna|see him again.
{104327}{104360}He decided to go back...
{104361}{104406}to where he came from,|Professor--
{104407}{104438}to another time.
{104439}{104466}Pika.
{104467}{104506}I wouldn't worry, Ash.
{104507}{104533}Oh?
{104534}{104595}True friendships can withstand|the test of time...
{104596}{104644}and I have a feeling|this one will.
{104645}{104729}I'm sure you and Sammy|will be friends forever.
{104730}{104773}Mm. Heh heh.
{104774}{104830}Thanks, Professor.|I think so, too.
{104831}{104865}Pikachu!
{104914}{104954}I think we'd better|get going.
{104955}{105003}Yeah, I don't want|to miss the boat again.
{105003}{105030}We'll tell you everything...
{105031}{105072}when we get|to Pallet Town, OK?
{105073}{105130}Fine. I'm looking forward to it.
{105185}{105210}Hey.
{105211}{105262}What's the matter, Misty?
{105263}{105320}Howd Professor Oak|know Sammy's name?
{105321}{105353}We never mentioned|it to him.
{105354}{105380}Yeah, that's right.
{105381}{105407}[Toot]|Pika!
{105447}{105555}Professor Oak's amazing!|He knows everything!
{105556}{105605}Pika!
{105606}{105641}Pikachu!
{105849}{105945}Hmm. It seems like|it happened only yesterday.
{106153}{106232}This is amazing.
{106233}{106280}This wonderful water's|washed away...
{106281}{106330}all my annoying aches|and pains.
{106331}{106398}I could just float along|like this forever.
{106399}{106444}Ahoy!|-Huh?
{106445}{106505}Jessie, thank goodness|you're safe.
{106506}{106550}Hurry up. Climb aboard.
{106551}{106577}What took you so long?
{106578}{106605}What have you been doing?
{106606}{106650}We had to wait|till it was safe.
{106651}{106686}But now the coast is clear.
{106687}{106715}Oh, good.
{107153}{107205}Hey, guys,|I feel all tingly.
{107206}{107234}So do l.
{107235}{107295}Heh. Isn't it fabulous?
{107343}{107429}Looks like Team Rocket's|floating away.
{111402}{111454}Yo, man,|we forgot to vamp out.
{111455}{111495}This ain't|the end of the song?
{111496}{111558}-No.|-Oh, man.
{111600}{111900}{C:$00FFFF}Translation and subtitles:|Blake_rsh (Mormegil.inc)
Two days ago, I received a letter from a lawyer in Europe.
It regretted to inform me my mother had died in a helicopter crash.
She was returning from her sold out farewell concert in London.
Her estate was to be turned over to me, the letter said, but my physical presence was required immediately...
Everything had been arranged, a plane ticket to Heathrow, a car waiting... only the timing couldn't have been worse.
Last month I released my first album, it got rave reviews in the US and we were just starting our debut American tour.
Maybe this sounds a little cold-hearted, but the fact is, she has refused to see me or even speak to me ever since she left home when I was only three.
I never knew why...
Everything I knew about her came from the tabloids, how she'd become a recluse rock star, hiding out in a castle nobody'd ever heard of.
But why did she want to give this.. this place to me?
She never returned a single letter
I wrote, never helped with the band, even indirectly.
And after we worked so hard to finally get our big break now she calls me from the grave...
Well, I hope what they say isn't true about curiosity killing the cat
Hello?
Hello?!
Hello, anybody home?!
Anybody alive in here?
What in the...?
Uh... What's goin on here?
Okay, this is getting a little weird.
Hey... What do you want from me?
Whoah, guys.
Look, can I help you with something?
Fellas?
Oooooh...
Hey... Watch it!... Listen,
I think we have a misunderstanding here.
Little help here!!
Wooooooo...
Little help in here please
That felt so good.
Huh? What is this?
We have an uninvited guest.
Let me take care of you, little bird.
Now for you, Johnny.
Welcome. We've been expecting you...
Go upstairs, Johnny.
Mr. D is waiting for you!!!
Looks like I have no choice.
Okay, either I've lost my mind or
I'm having really bad jet lag...
Now what?
Where the heck am I?
Wait a minute. I know that voice..
Mother?
Johnny, your mother was beautiful when she was young.
And she was good, very good,
Johnny.
You're mother could have been a superstar.
She had the talent.
But she drove a hard bargain.
One of the conditions of her contract was that you were strictly off limits.
You were her baby.
A rather touching performance really.
Anyway I kept my end of the bargain of course.
Alas, she could not keep hers.
So you've been summoned, and what was once hers I can now offer to you.
I know exactly what you're getting at.
Really. Enlighten me.
I'm having a really weird dream, and I can't wake up.
This is better than a dream,
Johnny.
This is immortality.
I can make you the the greatest rock legend of all time.
All you have to do is sign on a little dotted line.
Now I know who you are.
No way! I'm not sign-
That's what they all say... at first.
You really believe you have talent to make it on your own?
That's the dream Johnny.
In the real world, you need Mr.D.
He can make you everything you ever wanted to be.
But we understand if you have some... reservations.
Well, perhaps you better look around before you make your final decision.
Just to be sure
Johnny, You must find your way out.
Don't let them get to you.
Don't...
Who are you?
Oh, God!
What have I gotten myself into?
Interesting place don't you think?
Here's the lowdown, Johnny.
Centuries ago, music played a relatively minor part in the larger scheme of things within the corporation.
It was so difficult to find good recruits, not like politics.
We barely met our quotas.
Every now and then a client would try to reneg on his deal-
Musicians don't read contracts very carefully you know - so we would dig a new cave down here and confine the subject to a life of total anonymity and of course perpetual noise.
Drives ya nuts.
Long story short, music just wasn't much of a draw.
At some point there was even a plan within the corporation to scrap our division altogether.
So, fast forward, the Big Idea.
It was really my idea but...
Not important.
At first we wanted to call it
Twist and Burn - little too obvious so we settled on Rock and Roll.
Business went through the roof.
By the time the sixties rolled around our little division was on fuego.
Huge growth.
Our only problem was space.
Let me tell you, when you're dealing with damned souls, storage is always a big problem.
So Mr.D. had to come up with a new scheme.
This you gotta see.
Funny thing about rock stars, the instant they become rich and famous, they tend to think their invincible.
Stop living up to their commitments.
Even have the audacity to try to break their contracts.
But let me tell you, one does not break a deal with Mr.D.
But they tried and we build this place all for them.
You see we use the deal-breakers to provide entertainment for members of the corporation.
Works out rather well.
From time to time Mr.D. gathers the troops
- a little attitude adjustment party we like to call it
- and we have one hell of a good time...
Have fun. AHAA...
Welcome to our show.
If you like the band please applaud as hard as you can.
If not... applaud anyway.
Turn around Johnny.
You must leave this place.
I came this far,
I might as well see the show.
This is not a show you want to see, Johnny.
Once they get to you, there is no turning back!
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself!
But wait, who are you?! Mom?
Man, this is getting too weird.
Welcome to our show.
If you like the band please applaud as hard as you can.
If not... applaud anyway.
Johnny! What are you doing down here?!
I don't know. I just...
This place is off-limits.
Way off-limits.
I HATE this place.
Let's get out of here.
Opera isn't very popular here, is it?
HAAA... you don't know the half of it.
Mr. D used to love opera too, hardcore opera fan.
Then he got involved with an opera star.
Long story, but she left him, broke her deal.
Mr. D went totally berserk.
Opera is now officially taboo upstairs.
Whenever any opera singers break their contract, he gets a little... out of control
Never mind.
Nothing to do with you, Johnny.
Now you must go.
Mr. D is getting impatient.
The time has come...
Good.
Come here, Johnny...
I want to show you something - your future.
You know you have a good voice, but would you like to be a great guitar player as well?
I'll make a Rock legend out of you, it would be all yours, everything you ever wanted, let me show you.
Yes. Good. Goooood. Good.
Johnny?
Mom... this one's for you.
Every night, the same dream, the same strange planet.
But why?
What are they trying to tell me?
It's been 34 years since they arrived on this planet.
And not a day passes that the survivors...
...forced to live in barrier cities, do not live in fear.
I have vowed to end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
The question is, will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
- What's she doing here captain?
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.
- You're coming with us.
- Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it. Let's move, people!
Two coming through the wall!
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!
Ryan, Neil, let's go!
- Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- There's a life form in here.
- There hasn't been life here in years.
- Well, there is now.
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.
Fine! Arrest me. But I'm not leaving without that life form.
It's gonna be one of those days.
Captain, the transport is not going to wait for us much longer.
- I understand that.
- It's in bad shape.
Oh please! Tell me we're not risking our necks for this plant!
I wouldn't even call it a plant.
It's a weed.
- I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.
Phantoms! We have incoming.
- Captain, we need to get out of here.
- Understood, sergeant.
- Could you hurry please Miss?
- Done.
- Captain?
- Yes, Neil?
Just so you know?
I agree with the "let's get out of here thing. "
Duly noted.
- Can I have this, please?
- Thank you.
- We're surrounded!
- No shit!
- Alright everybody! Just relax.
- Captain, we gotta get to higher ground.
Everyone, up top!
Go, go, go!
- Transport, requesting immediate evac.
- Affirmative.
Up here!
- Captain! - They're right behind you! - Captain, come on!
I've got you!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
All right, everybody, here they come.
You okay?
You gonna be all right.
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
- Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.
- Listen captain. I don't have time for this.
Do you realize you just risked the lives of my squad?
Look! I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...
- ... it was worth the lives of you and your men.
- You and your men?
- She thinks you're a man.
- I think she's an idiot.
- I know you're not a man.
- I think you're an idiot too.
- Very funny.
- Well, I do wanna talk about it.
Did it ever occur to you...
...that we would've volunteered to risk our lives had we been given a choice?
Well, nobody asked you to save me.
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit!
Gray?
Yeah. Nice to see you too.
- Welcome back, captain.
- We're clean.
- Let's make sure of that shall we?
- I hate getting scanned.
So, the scanners are probably worse for us than the Phantoms.
No probably about it captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.
And I wanna have a little Neil Jr. calling me Daddy someday.
- That's a spooky thought.
- Why are you always busting my chops?
People, let's just do this thing. Alright?
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you've gained some weight.
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.
I'm working on it.
You know, my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today it doesn't.
Something's not right.
- About this mission? Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
Listen, captain.. I think...
I don't care what you think, doctor.
You're getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
- Captain!
- They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with a Phantom sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
- What level is he?
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.
We have to treat him. Now!
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.
There's no time for that.
Get him to the table.
Hang in there, captain.
Locating pathogens.
Jesus, look at that thing!
- How much more time?
- Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won't be able to hold the alien particles.
Engaging bio-etheric laser.
- What's going on?
- Where'd it go?
What the hell is going on?
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.
- Tracking.
- There's no time.
- Tracking.
- There is no time! You're gonna lose him!
His treatment shield is failing.
Found it.
Come on.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.
Uh.. Doctor, we need to scan you for infestation.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.
Hey, doc.
Thanks for saving him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship.
- What's with her?
- What's with her and the captain?
What's with her and that stupid plant?
What?
Forward me the Phantom data and everything regarding the five spirits collected so far.
Yes, doctor.
Spirits? I thought we weren't supposed to use the "S" word.
Don't get smart with me.
Now let's see if that plant does the trick.
It's a match. We've found it.
Yes.
The sixth spirit.
It seemed today you broke nearly every protocol.
How long do you think this would have survived outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the council and military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered this energy in the Phantoms? You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You. You made it possible to harness that energy...
...for ovo-pacs, scanners, even the barrier.
The council knows that.
They trust you doctor.
We're so close to proving it.
But we still need this part.
And this one here.
Exactly two more pieces and we've solved the puzzle!
And we need to be free to find those pieces.
I want to show you something Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
"All life is born of Gaia and each life has a spirit.
Each new spirit is housed in a physical body. "
- Doctor?
- Go on.
"Through their experiences on Earth, each spirit matures and grows.
When the physical body dies...
...the mature spirit, enriched by its life on Earth, returns to Gaia...
...bringing with it the experiences...
...enabling Gaia to live and grow. "
It's my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago, when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
Remember what happened to Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...
...he said the Earth was not the center of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
If you have any notes or records that could be used against you...
...destroy them.
- Keep them up here.
- Right.
And stay away from your friend, the captain.
He saves your life, you save his life, this leads to that.
I was young once too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one's young anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen of the council...
...could you please explain why?
Zeus was completed a month ago.
If we attack the meteor with this, we will eliminate the Phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon to attack the Leonid Meteor.
We have re-convened today to vote on that very issue again.
Now, I'd like to ask the director of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.
- Dr. Sid, please.
- Thank you.
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest is in the Leonid Meteor...
...that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now are the records of every assault on the meteor to date.
Physical attacks have had utterly no effect.
This scene took place three months ago during a full-scale bombardment.
Now please note the Phantoms outside the meteor are indeed destroyed.
However, inside, many that were dormant come to life...
...and as you see, overall Phantom density remains the same.
The newly risen aliens respond to the attack...
...by burrowing even deeper into the Earth.
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...
...because we see the same thing during surgery...
...when using bio-etheric lasers on Phantom particles, do we not?
Yes, indeed we do.
You see. the injured particles escape...
...burying or digging themselves deeper into a patient's body.
And when we increase the laser power to destroy these deeper particles...
...we have had incidents resulting in further injury to a patient...
...and in some cases...
...death.
And what exactly does that mean doctor?
It means there's a very good chance...
...the beam from the Zeus cannon will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.
Exactly! Thank you.
However, it also means that the beam energy may be too strong...
...injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the Gaia.
- I mean...
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.
Did he say what I think he said?
What are you doing?
I know what I'm doing and whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
Doctor, with all due respect...
...did you come here just to talk about some Gaia theory?
To tell us that the planet is alive?
That it has a spirit?
That's a fairy tale doctor and I'm sorry, but we don't have time for that.
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.
Ahh.. Oh.. So if I point a gun at the Earth and fire...
...I'm not just making a hole on the ground,
I'm killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory has not been proven.
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we still have to remove the Phantoms?
I think if there's any chance of success, we should take it.
- Don't you agree?
- Well, of course i do.
But there is an alternative to the space cannon.
Another method?
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms.
- Please.
As we know, the aliens display a distinct energy pattern.
Now, it is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves...
...placed one over the other will cancel each other out.
It is theoretically possible to construct a wave pattern...
...in direct opposition to the Phantom energy.
We are currently assembling such a wave and are nearing completion.
Members of the council...
...gathering plants and animals...
...from around the world to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
It will kill Phantoms.
Can we afford to wait for some crazy invention...
...some army of touchy-feely plants and animals...
...An invention that offers no solid evidence that it will destroy the aliens?
There is evidence!
Our partially completed energy wave...
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...
...through a terminally-infected patient.
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that a terminal patient has been cured?
Not cured. The wave is not complete.
But we've succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
You may have bought us some time Aki, but i wonder at what cost?
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
Will you listen to me? When we find the seventh and eighth spirits...
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Faith and hard work, girl...
...coz I'll be damned if you're going to die before me.
The council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I tag along?
You'll probably get bored.
So, what are you doing?
Oh, I see. You're giving me the silent treatment.
I'm scanning the city for the seventh spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
- Relax sergeant. Almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?
We're just gonna strand them for a while.
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.
This was your idea?
We're just helping the captain out a little.
Yeah, come on Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?
You've seen how the captain looks at her.
It's amore, baby.
What's going on?
It's probably just a glitch.
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?
Hey! Well, I was just a little upset when you just packed up and left for the Zeus Station without saying a word.
- Well, now you know what was going on. Alright?
- Yeah. Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero grav. Okay?
Fine.
And how about the fact that I was sent there on a job and you wouldn't even see me.
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collect spirit waves.
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.
So will you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you've collected.
I was infected by a Phantom during an experiment.
- Normally, no one could have survived.
- How did you?
Dr. Sid created a membrane around the infection, keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space? It's no fun.
- What am I saying? You probably would love that.
- You're right. I probably would.
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.
- I thought that was number six.
- What?
You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I retrieved the sample in time, but she...
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.
Even the Earth.
I told her that she wasn't dying just returning to the Earth's spirit...
...to Gaia.
She told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I'm sorry.
I have work to do. I have to find the seventh and eighth spirits.
Don't, please.
You don't believe any of this, do you?
I just don't know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don't know how much time I have left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards...
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago did you not?
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporarily reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she reenters the wasteland.
- Understood, sir.
- You don't understand yet, captain.
Report any aberrant behavior in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.
Aberrant behavior sir?
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.
They may be manipulating the doctor for their very own purposes.
Is the general suggesting that Dr. Ross is a spy?
The general is wondering why he's explaining himself to a captain.
She's had prolonged exposure to Phantom tissue.
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest and transported here for observation.
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our men to keep an eye on the good captain.
I'm convinced that these dreams are some form of communication.
Their message still eludes me...
...but they're coming faster now and that can only mean one thing.
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.
- Roger.
- Phantom concentration?
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.
So it's gonna be a real picnic.
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book. Right.
If we drop energy buoys here, here and here...
...we should be able to land, acquire the target, and get out before the Phantoms even know we were there.
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?
- Yeah.
- For a while.
So you're from the 307th's right?
Under General Hein?
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.
Captain, rendezvous for evac at vector 6, coordinate 279.
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.
Looks like they've taken the bait.
The seventh spirit should be just beyond that line of wreckage.
I don't see how any living thing could survive out here?
We'll find out soon enough.
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.
It was supposed to end the war.
My father's in here somewhere.
All right.
Let's move out, people.
I'll be damned.
A survivor.
What's it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
Is that our spirit, doc?
No.
We're closing in on the life form.
- Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.
I don't see anything.
- You're not gonna tell me it's him?
- That's impossible.
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.
How do you explain that? The pacs power our weapons, the barrier cities...
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.
And to create that energy we use living tissue. Single-cell organisms.
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit?
- Yes.
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?
- Captain?
- What? Say again?
You read me captain? We have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.
I need a hand! Sarge!
- Those buoys? They're not working.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Something's not right.
This shouldn't be happening.
Something's attracting them.
Aki!
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast!
- Jane, take the lead.
Fire in the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
- Sir, I would love to, but...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- It's okay, that's it.
That doesn't look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
- You have your orders, sir.
- What the hell is going on here?
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.
Lower your weapons. That's an order!
Sir. We have no choice, but to relieve you of your command.
I won't let you do this soldier.
You'll gonna have to shoot me.
Stand down, captain!
Hang on, everyone!
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!
The Deep Eyes are returning from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently, there was an incident.
It would seem the Phantoms were attracted to Dr. Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross placed under arrest.
All research materials pertaining to Dr. Sid's wave theory...
...are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, major.
The good captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the council will be at our feet...
...thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us...
...to save them from the Phantoms.
How is she, doctor?
- She is dying.
- There must be something you can do.
Aki is fighting with only six of the eight spirits.
We'll have to implant the seventh directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damaged.
We have to repair this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help hold her in this world.
And I can think of no spirit better suited for that task than yours, captain.
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.
You just be with her now.
You keep her here with us.
Aki? Where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I'm not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
I've been having this dream every night for months.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You're really here, aren't you?
What's happening to me?
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit directly into your body.
Then you're my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
Look, I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching what, major?
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in...
...her dreams?
This is it. This is our evidence.
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The council is content to hide powering inside this barrier...
...while the world dies a little more every day.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get together a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing.
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, doctor?
She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.
We'll need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I finished it.
I know what it means.
I know what the Phantoms really are.
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!
We have them, sir.
Sir?
My wife and daughter...
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
I try to imagine what.. what that must have been like...
...seeing everyone around you fall over dead for no apparent reason.
And then, at the end, feeling something next to you...
...invisible...
...touching you...
...reaching inside your body...
You've lost family, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
That's why I trust you.
All of you.
You know what must be done.
Security override.
Perimeter breached.
Major, arrest these men.
- Take it easy.
- Stand up. Go.
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask any questions.
Reduce power to Sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...
What I realize, major...
...is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy.
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.
Lowering power output to Sector 31.
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general.
They're coming through now.
Oh I think we can easily handle a few Phantoms in a contained space.
Relax, major. When this night's over, you're going to be a hero.
- Aki, I don't think...
- You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?
Captain, please, let her continue.
Alright. Why do you think we've never been able to determine...
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?
Excuse me, doc, but what friggin' relationship?
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms, and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...
...and your flying Phantoms and let's not forget my personal favorite...
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.
Down, boy.
He's right. If you've spent as much time in the field as we had...
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.
Precisely. I think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants.
But why would an invading army bring a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?
Unless their ship was kind of a crazy Noah's Ark?
We have always assumed that the meteor...
...was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.
The meteor is a chunk of their planet that got thrown into space...
...when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn't.
Oh. This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
All our strategies are based on one assumption:
That we were fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.
Since then, all they've known is suffering.
They're not an invading army.
They're ghosts.
How many Phantoms?
More than enough to convince the council, sir.
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send a squad out to eliminate them.
Yes sir.
Alert status. Full deployment.
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!
Well, of course you do.
Outside of Sector 31, sir.
And moving at incredible speed.
Major, What the hell is going on here?
They're in the pipes.
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.
That's impossible. No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.
Oh, my God.
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out.
You're our man. Think.
Captain, these walls are titanium alloy and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.
I mean it's not like I can just wave a magic wand and...
- Wow! Neil, I'm impressed.
- That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
- Here they come.
- But the others! Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.
Come on.
What's happening. Why can we see them now?
They must be carrying a residual charge from passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
All aboard, captain!
We need to find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it would be in the military hangar.
That's a big "if. "
Look out!
- Get us onto the platform.
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
We're going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all due respect...
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.
We're going through it.
It's the only way.
So I gather this will be somewhat of a rough ride?
Doc, you've got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody!
Doc?
Interesting.
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.
Ouch!
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- Right.
No wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They're in my ship.
- No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?
You heard the man.
We'll find the ship and be back for you.
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody's staying.
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.
Give him a weapon. Do it!
We'll be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.
Let's move out.
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However, we'll need to replace these spent fuel cells.
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.
Alright. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Gray, be careful.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby'll fly itself.
Flight path is set.
Beginning rotation.
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.
I'm reading an impound tractor attached probably to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No sir. Permission to go outside and detach the coupling.
Do it.
There's the problem.
The controls are locked, naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we're gonna get out of here alive?
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.
You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?
You think this eighth-spirit stuff is really gonna work against the Phantoms?
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.
What's happening down there?
Nothing we can't handle.
- Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.
I want you two back inside.
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating with extreme prejudice.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, captain.
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.
Jane, get out of there.
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!
Get the hell out of there!
The shield is powered and ready.
- Where are you going?
- To the cockpit.
The ship is set on autopilot.
We're in countdown to liftoff.
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!
Over here, you son of a bitch!
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
- No! We can't just leave everyone.
- Everyone's dead!
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
Gray, come on!
I just...
I wish I could believe they were in a better place.
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...
...to include an area that we had previously overlooked.
The impact crater.
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.
Yes, really quite astonishing.
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.
Precisely.
Which suggests that the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.
I can't explain it at the moment, but once we get down there...
- ... you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.
Yes, I expected that's how you would evaluate our chances.
Well, am I wrong?
No, I agree. We probably...
...won't live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater.
Then why should we even try it?
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.
If we can't bring the final spirit here...
...we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.
Yes, exactly.
And how do we do that, exactly?
I can construct a device that...
...would attach to Aki's chest plate to gather the eighth spirit and then...
And then what?
And then we wait and see what happens.
That's it?
- That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...
- and maybe we'll find a compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
What caused the barrier to fail, General Hein?
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time...
...before the Phantoms developed an immunity to our barriers.
But I am relieved to see that you and the rest of the council...
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.
The council has reconsidered your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.
And, general...
...best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
The target, sir?
The Phantom crater.
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we're over the meteor.
Do you have it in sight, doctor?
There are so many of them.
Wait.
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit moving along the crater's surface.
All right. Now let's take a closer look.
Ready to fire in three minutes.
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.
Counter-thrusters are engaged.
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.
We have something on radar over the impact site, sir.
It's her.
Sir?
Just a traitor under the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We'll take them all out at the same time.
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It's a match! It's a perfect match!
- Target scanners ready, sir.
- Fire.
What was that?
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.
- Aki, Captain, are you all right?
- A little shaken. Stand by.
Sid, the eighth spirit is not on our scanner. Do you have it?
The eighth spirit...
...has been destroyed.
- What are we going to do now?
- Nothing. This mission is over.
- We have to get out of here.
- Incoming!
What is that?
If you're getting us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can't hold on to you.
Unable to maintain altitude.
Initiate emergency landing procedures.
Come in. Come in, please.
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?
- What is that thing?
- I don't know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein,
You must cease fire immediately.
What you are looking at in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world.
Their planet was destroyed and part of it landed here.
This is not an invasion. It never was.
I see and what have we been fighting all this time, doctor? Ghosts?
Yes. Spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Right. And these spirits are coming out of this Gaia thing.
General Hein, you have to listen.
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...
...the fact remains the Earth is under attack from an aggressor...
...who must be destroyed at all costs.
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor,
I will take your protest to mean that we are...
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.
So i suggest you take your last few moments and prepare to meet your Gaia.
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.
General, the system is overheating, sir.
We're going to hit it again and again and keep on hitting it until it's dead.
But, sir. We're not even sure if it's having any effect on the creature.
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.
- The system won't allow us to fire again.
- We'll see about that.
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here.
Come on!
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
That's not what I think it is, Is it?
Yes, it's Gaia.
This is definitely not a good place to be.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
Go ahead, I'm still here.
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.
I think this explains why the eighth spirit appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that's it!
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.
If so, it would've been given a different energy signature...
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.
You two could not have hoped for a better location...
...to find a new compatible spirit.
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sounds.
Don't shoot any of them!
You could very well destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, captain, not mine.
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Well? Which one is it? Which one?
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.
With the hope of new life...
...has Gaia changed the Phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here. I need you!
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, doctor.
Oh, my word.
I see now. I understand.
Well, I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?
Give me the ovo-pac.
I need to project the completed wave.
- But we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!
I hope you know what you're doing, Aki.
- We can use the shield to project the wave.
- What?
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.
I'm cured, Gray.
- Are you sure you have the final spirit?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- But how? How can you know that?
- Don't worry. A Phantom told me.
Oh, great.
That's it. Shield on.
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.
If this doesn't work, then it's already too late.
Gray, trust me.
I'll blast you all to hell.
Oh, no. No!
Get down!
- Warning. System overload.
- I know.
- Warning. System overload.
- I know!
But it must be done.
Fire.
Fire, damn you!
Fire!
Don't leave me, Gray.
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray. Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're going to make it.
We both know that isn't true.
Help me.
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no. Please?
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.
Don't leave me, Gray.
You've been trying to tell me that death isn't the end.
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it's warm.
[Squeaks]

[Cackling]
Back, Stanley.
You are going back... back to when it all began.
Are you back yet?
Get back!
We haven't got all day!
[StanleyI [t was third grade.
The teacher was Miss Hudlapp.
She was kinda squat and lumpy.
She smelled funny.
- But she was kind.
- Class!
How many times have I told you?
In this class... we do not pound ten-penny nails into Stanley's head!
[Stanley] You know how some teachers have those kinda flaps on their arms... those big sacks of limp flab that, like, dangle?
- Aahh.
- It sounds weird, but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers,
- I began to feel...
- [Sighs] oddly... aroused.
And then the horror began.
- [Laughing]
- [Gasps]
[Grunting]
Young man, what's that in your lap?
Oh, it was useless...like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument.
And then, all at once, there he was...
Monkeybone!
- Hey, baby, I love your way!
- Oh!
- # Yo, monkey #
# Monkeybone #
- [Miss Hudlapp] Ooh!
- # Monkeybone #
Moo-coo! Moo-coo!
Moo-coo! Moo-coo!
How 'bout it, Doc... can you help me?
All in good time, my boy.
All in good time.
[Laughs Hysterically]
Oh, what a loser!
Oh, roll out the wacky wagons!
[Applauding]
Well, that's our pilot.
And the good news is... the Comedy Channel has picked us up with an order for six episodes.
And now I'd like you to meet the man who got it all started, the creator of America's most disturbed comicstrip, the man behind the monkey, if you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, please... Stu Miley!
- [Cheering, Applause]
- Come on, Stu. Don't be shy!
You can't go yet.
There's a potload of money here.
Besides, you haven't talked to Bill from Bazoom Toys, who's got great ideas.
Oh, Mr. Miley, do we ever!
Check it out. The Monkeybone phone.
Every kid's gonna want three and want their friends to have three.
Check out the slippers. You're walking, your tootsies are warm, you're laughing.
The Monkeybone backpack. If you're goin' to Europe, flip it around...
Stu. Stu. Stu, what are you doin'?
Come on. Come on.
We gotta talk to the guys from Burger God.
Burger God... aren't they the ones that found the rat gut in the french fries?
No. No.
No, they found a pig gut, which is different.
- Mmm.
- That's-That's practically pork.
- [Scoffs]
- It's a lot of real money, the kind of money that can buy happiness.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I got the ring, Herb.
- The what?
- The ring. That ring.
- What ring? No.
- What-What do you mean?
- Tonight's the night, Herb.
- Why?
- Tonight is the night.
That girl pulled me out of a nightmare.
She makes me happy, Herb, not all of this stuff.
Right over here.
Do you see this door?
The cool thing is that you open it, you go out, it closes, and you can't get back in.
- But, Stu, you want to leave?
- Yeah.
- You're a hit! Everybody loves you!
- Come on!
Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of these media creeps.
I just want to be us, home, alone.
Come on. Besides, I have something that I - I want to give to you.
Can't you give it to me later?
Yes, I could, but if later got here sooner, it... it would be a lot better.
Hi, Herb.
- Ah, yes.
- Herb...
Yeah. Oh... Yeah, that'll be good.
You got everything? Ah, yeah.
Stu, these are just prototypes.
They aren't the real products.
Just something for you to take home.
Just spend some time with them, get a feeling for them before you say "no."
- No.
- [Squeaks]
Stu, come on.
One more thing.
Actually, there's a couple of trucks to come with, you know, Monkeybone stuff.
- You guys mind waiting a little longer?
- [Car Starts]
Good night, Herb.
Of course. You guys get outta here.
You're a beautiful couple.
Look at this.
Now he won't let us leave.
- Who?
- The monkey! Hey, Herb,
Can you get this guy to move?
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Come on, please? Help me out here.
Stu, stop.
The monkey is good luck.
- Come on.
- I never had any good luck...
- until I met you.
- Everybody loves him.
You're gonna be a huge success, so just relax and enjoy it.

- [Giggles]
[Truck Horn Honks]
[Stu, Mockingly]
Thank you, Herb!
- What happened?
- I don't know!
- What is it?
- Some sort of inflatable raft.
Oh! Whoa!
[Shrieking]
[Gasps]
Whoa...
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Whoa!
Put on the brakes!
Stop the car!
- Great idea! Wish I'd thought of that!
- [Horns Honking]
Stu, I'm right here, baby.
It's me. It's Julie.
I love you.
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise. I promise.
I'm Dr. McElroy from the Sleep
Institute. This man is my patient.
[Man] There's no response to external stimuli.

Take him to the university hospital.
They have the best head trauma center.

Please exit to the right of the car.
[Panting]

Look at my poor little babybrother!
Oh, God, I can't stand to look at him. Oh, God. Wow.
How you doin', little one, hmm?
You holdin' up?
I'm fine, Kimmy.
Fine.
At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
- The ring?
- Grandmother's engagement ring.
- The one he had me send so he...
- Good morning, Dr. McElroy.
Hello, Doctor.
Kimmy, this is Dr. Edelstein.
- Vital signs have stabilized. Good.
- Listen, Doctor, ... these machines are actually what's keeping him alive right now, right?
- At the moment, yes.
- Okay. Well, do you think...
- you could give me a realistic...
- Comas are unpredictable.
He could wake up today or tomorrow or...
Doctor, hey, sweetheart.
Our father took a long time to die, so Stu and I made a pact... that... when our time came... we wouldn't let it drag out.
So...
- which one's the plug?
- What plug?
The plug?
The one you pull?
Oh, God, Kimmy.
Don't even talk like that.
I need a realistic answer,
Doctor! Give me a date!
All right.
Three months.
There's always some brain damage, but after three months... the chances of coming back shrink dramatically every day.
Well, I want him to have every chance, Doctor.
We could... certainly give it...
[Sighs] three months.
[Owl Hooting]
Oh, poor Buster!
He hasn't eaten all day.
What's that?
[Dog Whimpers]
Stu did this?
Yeah, right about the time we met, when he first came to the sleep lab.
Jesus, honey.
He hadn't had a good night's sleep in years.
The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd just start right in painting.
How do you go from here... to cartoons?
- Switch hands.
- What?
Stu was right-handed, so I made him switch the pen to his left hand... to see what would come out, and we got the first Monkeybone.
- Wow. Two guys in the same brain.
- Yeah.
Which one did you fall in love with?
# [Nightclub Music]
[Bull]
Hey, Stu, why so glum?
At least they haven't pulled the plug yet. Have another 'tini.
No, I'm sick of martinis... and carnival rides and watching other people's nightmares.
- Hmm?
- The one thing I'm really sick of is...
Speaking of dames, I'd like to sing a tune about the beautiful Miss Julie.
She's conscious, boyfriend here's an eggplant.
I'm just kiddin; pal,
'cause you know in your heart...
Miss Julie is faithful, loyal and true.

- I doubt that. [Screams]
- Back in the pack!
[Monkeybone] Monkey-napper!
Help! Monkey-napper!
Let me out. It's not my fault. I happen to be a figment of your imagination.
- Learn to act normally. I had to.
- Normal, huh?
- Hiya, Stu.
- Hello, Kitty!
[Growls, Barks]
- I brought you a refill.
- I'd love a stiff one, but Stu here forgot to endow me, equip me.
- Ow!
- Nothing for him. He's being repressed.
Is something wrong, Stu?
You seem... tense.
It's my girlfriend. I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
- [Monkeybone Struggling]
- Why didn't I just propose?
Right there. At least that way
I'd know what she said.
- I'd know if she's waiting for me.
- She is waiting for you, Stu.
I know she is.
- Guys like you don't come around often.
- Ahh!
[Sighs]
I mean it, Stu.
You're one in a million.

Oh, who am I kidding?
I am never gonna get outta here.
I'm never gonna see her again.
Good golly, Mr. Miley.
Mr. Stu Miley, hmm?
Good golly, Mr. Miley.
Mr. Stu Miley, hmm?

Thank you very much.

Hmm.
What do you think?
Hmm?

I need an opinion. Wake up!
You know, you got fan mail to read... people wanting autographs.

You got 15 minutes of fame, and you're gonna sleep right through it.
Of course, knowing you, maybe that's the plan, huh?
Julie, hi!
- Oh, Kimmy! Hi. Why are you...
- Hey.
Oh.
Listen, this is really hard for me, but, um...
Well, it's been three months, and, um, I gave the order.

- [Hypnos] Stu Miley.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Hey, I'm glad you could make it, man.
We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like...
- Caviar. [Chuckles]
- I just saw a dream.
It was my girlfriend.
She dreamed that they were gonna... pull the plug on me.
[Laughing]
Give us a moment, will you, darling?
Toodles!
You see, Stu, you made this pact with your sister.
- Huh?
- No life support?
Pact? Pact? No life support?
[Cackles]
- Pull the plug! Pull the plug, pleas...
- No!
That's wrong.
Julie would never agree to that.
They're pulling the plug at 9:00 a.m.
Anybody that dumb deserves to die!
- Can't you help me?
- Stu, I'm just the god of sleep.
- This is Death's bailiwick.
- Death?
[Grunts, Sighs]
[Panting]
Cheating Death... and this is extremely off the record... what you gotta do... is go into the Land of Death, sneak up right under Death's nose... and steal one of those Exit Passes.
Well, Hyp, thanks for the idea, and good luck with the shock therapy.
- [Laughing]
- [Hissing] Will you shut up?
He gave you a sign?
It doesn't sound rational, okay?
It's not rational.
I don't care anymore, Alice. We've got exactly six hours to wake him up.
Hey, look! Mr. Green Stain's got a dead one. What do we do now?
[Stu] He's taking her to the Land of Death. We have to hitch a ride.
- Don't worry. I'll protect you.
- Listen to you... Xena, Warrior Princess!
# [Humming]
The gates are closing!
Come on!
[Grunting]
Help, boss, I'm going fast!
I'm dying, boss!
Shh!
Come on, come on!
Look what I found.
[Chuckles]
- Whoo! Well, that's worth knowing.
- [Moaning]
[Both Screaming]
Chart number one is from five years ago.
This is the worst nightmare
Stu had at the sleep lab... abnormally intense alpha wave activity with a peak that lasted over a minute.
And this... Alice... this is earlier today.
- Holy shit.
- Wow.
He's caught in a loop... a nightmare loop.
- Does everybody know what Oneirix is?
- [Man] It's nightmare juice.
If those charts are right,
Stu's swimmin' in the stuff.
- We can decrease the levels.
- No, I want to give him a massive dose.
- That's not gonna stop his nightmare.
- Hutch, I don't want to.
I want to crank it up, take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake.

It says he's gonna live another
40 years. It's a reprieve.
- Let me have an Exit Pass. Yeah.
- Exit Pass?
That means forms.
That means bureaucracy.
You.
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Say something!
- Herb.
- Come here, Herb.
- [Monkeybone] Now?
- Please.
- Stand up straight!
- [Stu] I am standing up straight.
I want you to picture this with me, if you can.
- Y-Y-Yeah?
- You're a customer, you're about to die.
You're a little excited, a little fearful, and here comes the Grim Reaper.
Tell me, Herb, [Shouting] what the hell is he covered in?
- Uh, pea soup?
- [Monkeybone] Guacamole?
- As you requested, one Exit Pass,
- [Gasps]
O mighty wielder of the scythe.
- [Stu] Just behave!
- Exit Pass? Oh, what a coincidence!
I was just heading over to DownTown...
Don't bite me there!
I'd be happy to drop that off for you, if you don't mind!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Look, we only have about five minutes.
Just that, now that I'm leaving, there's so many things I wanted to say to you.
Ah. Don't get mushy on me. I'll be fine, just drop me off at the bar.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal.
I wish I could take you home with me.
Ah, right back at ya, boss.

I want you to know I found the little surprise you left that night.
Mm-hmm?
If you were wondering what the answer was, it was "yes", and it still is.
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
With all my heart.
- And what was the question?
- You asked me to marry you.
- Marry you? [Laughs]
- Mm-hmm.
No, you did. Here.

- King, you pussy. [Laughs]
- Bite me, Poe.
- You set me up!
- Easy, pal. [Chuckles]
Just coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching those Exit Passes.
Steve was the last guy to do it, and that must have been 25 years ago.
Why'd you do it, huh?
Wh-What did I ever do to you?
It's nothing personal, Stu, it's just we need nightmares... fresh nightmares.
We'd die without 'em.
That's why we grabbed your body.
- I'm no nightmare-maker.
- That's the monkey's job.
- Monkeybone? What?
- [Laughs Maniacally]
Let's face it, Stu. Nobody wants to be a figment. It's a dead-end career.
So he gets fed up, he comes to us with a proposition:
We help him swipe your body, he helps us get a heap of brand-new nightmares!
- News flash, buddy: I'm a cartoonist!
- Sure!
But you got a girlfriend who's figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams.
And guess what. She just whipped up a big ol'batch of nightmare juice!
[Laughing]
Oh, we're predicting record box office.
What's plural for orifice? "Orifi"?
No, I wasn't in a coma!
All right, I was in a coma. It wasn't like I was "in a coma" and goofing off.
I was thinking up hilarious new bits the whole time!
[Laughing Wildly]
You see, it's all synergy.
The show synergizes the strip.
The strip synergizes the merchandising.
The merchandising synergizes the religion.
And the religion synergizes the Barbara Walters special!
And then, baby, we are all in... the United Empire of Monkeybonia!
No, really.
He's ready to merchandise, yeah.
We gotta move on this, so get the burger guy, the toy guys... the toy guys and the lunchbox people in here...
Herb, get off that phone right now.
You're exploiting him!
- Am not.
- Herb, he's not himself.
He's your friend. He trusts you, and you're taking advantage of him!
- Am not. I'm on the phone!
- Are too!
- My cocina.
- Hey, hey.
My refrigerator, where I store and chill my food.
And this... the oven, where I cook my food.
And if you'll step this way, you'll find my dining room, where I eat my food.
What is all this stuff about merchandising? You hate merchandising.
I know, baby, I do.
But look at it from another angle:
There's a potload of money here.
# I'm dirty as a manhole #
# Cover #
# I'm looking for my long-lost #
# Lover #
# She turned me out and now #
# I'm sinkin' #
- [Whimpering]
- # I'm just so easily led #
# When the little head does the thinkin' #
You two-bit simian stooge.
We didn't send you up here to shake your booty with a bunch of lingerie babes.
[Slowed-Down Voice]
But it's my fantasy.
I don't care!
We sent you up here to make nightmares!
Now, you get out there, and you get that nightmare juice, and you get to work!
'Cause you may be a free man during the day, but when you dream... your monkeyass is mine!
[Echoing]
[Buffer Whirring]
What the...
[Chittering]
- [Chittering]
- [Gasps]
- [Kissing Sound]
- Oh, baby, I'd really like to, but it'd put me in a lot of hot water.
Why don't you just give that back?
- [Woman] # Lovin'you #
- Oh, do you?
Well, in that case, why don't you give me a little preview?
- [Kissing Sound]
- # Makin'love with you #
# Is all I wanna do #
Sucker.
[Screeches]
Let go! Let go!
Let go of my pants!
- Stu?
- [Snores]
- Where have you been?
- Hmm?
Nowhere.
I was asleep.
Honey, don't lie to me.
I know you went out.
Nope. Not me.
You must be dreaming.
I know what this is about. You've been mad because I haven't proposed to you.
Oh, go on, admit it!
You've been giving me the stinkeye ever since that business with the banner.
- You, you and that dog.
- I have not been giving the stinkeye.
You're giving me the stinkeye right now.
Stu, you're wearing shoes and a poncho... with no pants, in bed.
[Mutters]
I know.
[Distant Screaming]
Well, did you all have sidekicks... figments, monkeys?
A raven.
Mine was a dog.
Man's best friend. [Scoffs]
I went through hell to get that Exit Pass.
And who got to use it? Cujo.
Miley, you got a visitor!
Kitty!
Oh God, Stu,
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you what was going on.
I really, really liked you.
Thank you, Kitty, but that doesn't matter right now.
The woman I love is living with a horny little monkey that looks like me.
- What a lucky girl.
- Kitty, listen.
Is there any way I can get a message to warn her about what Monkeybone is up to?
- Time's up! Break it up! Let's move!
- No, no. No!
- Give me a moment, just to look at him.
- Let's go!
- Stu!
- Feeding time!
As you know, Burger God is prepared to launch... our new Mega Monkey Meal.
- Uh, something wrong?
-A pig gut!
- How much is McDonald's offering?
- Less.
A pleasure to be in business with you.
[Laughing]
Here's another thing. The Natural
History Museum is kicking off... a fund-raising campaign and wanna know if you can appear at a benefit.
Oh, I get it.
We give the public the impression... that we're doing something charitable... brilliant!
Yes.
Yes, that's it exactly.
Now, I think you remember
Bill here from Bazoom Toys.
We have a little something here we think you might just like.
It's a prototype.
Codename: Little Jack Horner.
Go ahead, pull out his thumb.
- [Trumpets]
- [All Laughing]
- No, it's mine!
- Oh.
Say, could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution... of one part powdered chemical enzyme to ten parts water?
- Uh, Jerry?
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah, I guess we could.
- All right!
You've got yourself a deal!
- [Trumpeting]
- [All Laughing]
Shall we shake on it?
Shake on it? That's not the way we do things in Monkey Land.
In Monkey Land, we rub our bottoms together.
Huh?
You heard the man.
Get your asses on the table.
[Cackling]
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting.
It's the nightmare juice.
It's gotta be.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
He's not Stu anymore.
The Stu I love is gone.
He spends all his time in the garage.
He says that he's... autographing.
[Laughing]
Nightmare in a butt!
- [Trumpets]
- [Laughing]
- [Buster Barking]
- Huh?
I think I hear a guinea pig.
[Buster Continues Barking]
Listen, let's bring him in for some tests.
I guarantee you're overreacting.
[Buster Barking]
Oh, actually, no, I don't think
I'm overreacting.
- [Screaming]
- [Barking]
[Growling, Barking]
- [Trumpets]
- [Whimpers]
Sweet dreams, you little bastard.
[Cats Meowing]
[Hypnos] Dog dreams?
This is completely humiliating.
That stinkin' monkey.
I can't believe it.
We give him a body, and he sends us dogs.
Shh.
Let's not think about dogs.
Let's think about... pussycats.
Oh.
[Laughs]
Oh, what a luscious surprise.
[Laughs]
[Both Laughing]
So, I thought, "What the hell.
I'm a big celebrity now.
I can get all the chicks I want.
Why get married?"
On the other hand, if you are married, no more stinkeye.
Plus, they can't testify against you.
Testify about what?
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- Julie, it's Hutch.
- Oh, Hutch. What?
- The nightmare juice... it's gone.
Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid.
Grape Kool-Aid?
But who'd wanna...
Stu, are you sure you just wanna give these away?
- It seems wrong.
- Go, go, go, go!
Stu.
Stu!
Shh. Sh-sh-sh-sh.
Here. You'll need these for your trip.
What?
And this.
Kitty, you can't do this.
You're gonna get in trouble.
You're the one true-hearted man I ever met.
You find a way back to that girl of yours, and you make her happy.
Thank you.
What about the guard?
I'll take care of that rat.
[Purring]
Okay, Stu.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good-bye, Kitty.
- [Guard] Hey, lady, what are you...
- [Kitty Snarling]
[Kitty And Guard Fighting]
[Guard Screams, Gurgles]
- [Gasps]
- Go! Just go!
Well, thank you, Kitty.
I'll never forget you.
And I mean that.
I'll really... never forget you.
[Kitty Snarling,
Guard Screaming]
Last one.
# [Vocalizing]
What kind of idiot sneaks into the Land of Death twice?
One that likes a good stretchin'?
[Laughs]
Shut up.
I wanna hear what he has to say.
Now, Death, I know you're mad at me, and I don't blame you.
But we're both mad at DownTown, and we're both mad at your brother, Hypnos.
So now you're gonna tell me it's all his fault and you were completely innocent.
No, I'm not gonna tell you that.
I wanted that Exit Pass.
I wanted it bad enough that I had to stare you right in the face to get it.
Why?
Because I...
I got a girl up there, and I shoulda...
I-I never...
I wanna tell her that I love her.
Oh, gosh, he loves her.
That changes everything.
- Ow! Okay, uncle!
- Sit down. Sit down right now.
Down, down!
And don't say another word.
Look.
I'm a simple person.
I do an honest day's work.
Why does everybody make it so hard for me?
You're switching bodies.
You're stealing Exit Passes.
I work a long enough day as it is.
Look, you can take my soul.
I-I don't need it.
You can turn me into a paper doll.
Just, please, give me one hour.
That's it.
[Assistant]
Hey, I love my girlfriend.
Well... you're gonna need a new body.
You know...
I don't generally do this, but...
I really like your comic strip.
- Really?
- Yeah, it slays me.
Death, coming from you, that's, you know, that's... Whew!
It's nothin'. But turn around before I change my mind.
- Huh? Oh.
- Turn around.
All right, could you bend over, Stu, please?
- Huh? Bend over?
- Yeah, just bend over.
All right.
Bye-bye.
[Screaming]
Come on. Come on.
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Fresh pancreas. That oughta pay for that new Mercedes.
And preparing to detach my round-the-world cruise.
[All Screaming]
Where am I?
What's wrong with my neck?
You broke it.
You're an organ donor.
[Bones Cracking]
Those are our organs.
Get back on that slab!
I will need this body!
- So, get back!
- Hey!
- 'Cause I gotta...
- It's a bone saw!
Yeah! Aah!
Oh, look!
- Get back here with that body!
- Whoa! Oh!
- What are you doing?
- Sorry! Sorry!
That's our body!
Whoa!
- There he goes!
- Get him! Get him!

Hey, Mr. Snyder, hey!
Oh, wow.

You been good?
You been a good dog? Huh, yeah?
What do you got here for me, huh?
What's this?
I look like an idiot.
Damn!
[Buster Barking]
Stay. Stay.
Good dog.
[Barking]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey, bus, wait!
Hey! Damn!
Hey!
Hi. Sorry.
- The organs are, uh, in transit.
- There he is!
- He's on the bus!
- They're in perfect working order.
They're working even better than we expected.
So, let's see what this... particulate solution is all about.

- Oh! Oh!

Damn, what the hell is this stuff?
[Sighs]
[Door Creaking]
Oh, man.
Oh, this is weird.

[Distant Screaming]
Come back here, you!
Oh, my God, we've got a flasher.
- Isn't that Herb?
- Must be some publicity stunt.
The clothes have turned evil!
They're working together... shirts, socks!
Whole ensembles! For God's sakes, get rid of your tie!
No, no, no,
Herb, you ding-dong.
- [Herb Screaming]
- [Policeman] Come back here. Stop!
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.
[Chuckles]
Forget about the naked man with the purple face.
[All Laughing]
Your incredible, misguided generosity... has made this a very special day for the museum.
And also a very special day for me.
All thanks to a very special lady...
Ms. Julie McElroy.
Julie, take a bow!
On your feet, girl!
Give it up for Julie!
Stand up! Stand up!
Lookin' good.

Uh, well, that's because it is new.

There he is!

We're doctors!
We don't wanna hurt you!

- No!
- Then you'll be sued!
- Fine!
Damn you, dead man!
- Hey!
- Invi... Invitation only.
We don't need invitations, we've got diplomas.
Julie? Operators are standing by.
Offer expires at midnight.
Doc, don't do it!
He isn't Stu.
He's Monkeybone!
All right, let's go.
That's it.
Say, babe, what did that creep call you?
He called me "Doc."
[People Chanting] Show me the monkey!
Show me the monkey!
- Come on, fella, let's go.
- [Struggling]
Please, please!
I have to talk to this man.
Okay.
Who are you? Why did you...
Why did you say those things?
Doc, it's all a mix-up.
We were in the Land of Death, he stole my Exit Pass... and that's how Monkeybone got my body.
See, all they had left for me was this stinking corpse.
- Thank you.
- Doc.
No, don't walk away!
He's only here to give people nightmares.
Doc, the dream... don't you remember?
They were pulling the plug, and I called out to you.
And you heard me, remember?
- [Buster Barking]
- Buster?
Yeah, come here, fella.
Don't lie to me.
Is it...
Is it you?
I had to come back, Julie.
I had to give you this.
I meant to give it to you before, the night it happened.
I was happy, Julie.
I really was.
Just try to remember me like that.
Okay?
Not like this.
[Grunting, Snorting]
What's wrong?
I'm crying too.
I just don't have any tears.
I'm all dried up.
Ladies and gerbils, you know the next part.
It's 50 bucks a swat.
Who's up first?
Oh, yeah.
No, this one's on me.
[Laughs] Here's your bat, babe.
Step right up.
Just cock the bat like this.
That's good.
- It's all right.
- [Gasps, Grunts]
[All Gasp]
We have to stop this. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic.
Oh, that's okay, honey.
No problem.
No.
Monkeybone?
Back in the pack.
- Stu?
- I mean it this time.
Back in the pack!
Eek! Uh...
[Chuckles]
I can explain everything.
I was tired of being a figment.
It's dirty, menial work.
It's kind of like being a pool boy.
But even pool boys have their own bodies. Don't I at least deserve a body?
Not my body!
You get back in the pack, you bastard!
[Whimpering]
Back in the pack?
With the stinky gym socks and the moldy cheese sticks?
No!
I've got the body, and I am never getting back in that goddamn pack!
[Shrieks]
Oh, no, please, they're dangerous!
No, you can't!
[Shrieks, Chittering]
Come on.
Excuse me.
What is he doing?
- He's gonna jump.
- [Cackling]
[Gasps]
I love you.
- No!
- Monkeybone!
Let go, let go, let go!
- Did you sleep with my girl?
- Sleep with her?
- We did the whole Kamasutra twice.
- Oh, yeah?
Where's her birthmark?
[Both Screaming]
Come on.
[Screaming]
- [All Screaming]
- [Screams]
Bingo!
Hey, where'd you get that body?
It's a loner, okay?
- You sprung a leak.
- [Screams]
Ooh!
I think it can be saved.
Put it on ice.
- [Chattering, Yelling]
- Don't move. I'm coming at ya!
- [Screaming] Damn it!
- [Grunts]
- Whoa!
- I'll take that, young man.
Here, have another.
I'm dead.
No, stop!
That's ours!
- Thanks.
- That's mine!
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
[Screaming]
Come on, Monkeybone, let's do it!
Manoamano!
Hey, Stu, I got an idea... joint custody.
- I get the body on weekends, you get...
- Shut up!

I can bring 'em down.
No!

Stu! You think I gilded the lily a little?
I do like to dress up when I come downtown.
So, how was she?
She, uh...
She was beautiful.
Ofcourse, I was decomposing at the time, but at least now she knows how much I love her.
So, I guess I'm yours.
Uh, excuse me, Death.
[Chuckles]
I hate to break up this little lovefest, but my little bladder is about to burst.
[Screams]
But I really gotta go!
[Groaning]
Hey, where... where's Monkeybone?
Back in your head where he belongs.
Stu, I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but on your own, you're a tad vanilla, so I didn't want to send you back without him.
What back? D-Did you...
You're sending me back?
- Yeah, I'm sending you back.
- Thank you, Death.
I like you. I'll take the South Park guys instead.
I hear they're dying to meet me. [Laughs]
Come on, Stu, come on.
Turn around.
- So, I should assume the...
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Stu? A little higher.
- Yeah.
Oh.
- See ya!

Excuse me, that's our corpse.
We've been chasing it all over town.

Get back!
Mr. Tweedy!
What is that chicken doing outside the fence?
I don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.
Let that be a lesson to you!
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!
Morning, Ginger.
Back from holiday?
- I wasn't on holiday.
I was in solitary confinement.
It's nice to get a bit of time to yourself, isn't it?
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left right...
Come on, smarten up!
Discipline! Order!
Back in my RAF days, when an officer called for a scramble, you'd hop in the old crate and chocks away!
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.
How dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer!
Back in my RAF days...
- Fowler, they're coming.
Right, right!
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.
Attention!
Welcome back, hen.
Is there a new plan?
We've already tried going under.
Over. Right.
How's the egg count?
- I laid 5 eggs today.
Well chuffed with that, I was.
Oh no.
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.
She didn't tell anyone.
Is Edwina off on holiday?
We've got to get out of here.
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.
You called?
Nick and...
- Fetcher. - At your service.
Over here.
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.
How about this quality tea set?
A lovely necklace and pendant.
Or this number. All the rage in the fashionable Paris chicken coops.
Simply pop it on, and as the French say: "Voila!"
That is French.
It's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.
Madame, you look like a vision, like a dream.
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.
This will cost.
- The usual: One bag of seed.
You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.
What could we give you?
- Eggs.
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.
So are we.
After you, Fetcher.
After I what?
Move!
Stupid, worthless creatures!
I'm sick and tired of making minuscule profits.
Oh, yes.
Those chickens are up to something.
Quiet.
I'm onto something.
They're organized.
Quiet!
- That ginger one is their leader.
I may have found a way to make some real money.
What are you on about? Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens.
It's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.
It's all in my head.
Now you keep telling yourself that, because I won't hear another word about it. Is that clear?
Yes, luv.
But the ginger one!
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you, they're the most stupid creatures on the planet!
They don't plot, they don't scheme, and they're not organized!
Order! Order!
Quiet, everyone.
Settle down.
I would like to call to order...
- Quiet!
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!
Thank you, Fowler.
- In my RAF days, we never wasted time with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.
Right.
Carry on.
Our last escape attempt was a bit of a fiasco, but Mac and I have a new plan.
Show them, Mac. - We tried going under that wire, and it didn't work.
So the plan is: We go over it.
This is us, right?
We get in like this and wind her up, and let her go!
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.
Farmer's coming!
Operation Cover-Up!
Mr. Tweedy, where are you?
It's all in your head.
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?
We haven't tried not trying to escape.
Might work.
What about Edwina?
How many more empty nests will it take?
Maybe she should have spent more time laying eggs and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs, then getting plucked and roasted is good enough for you?
It's a living.
The fences aren't just around the farm.
They're up here in your heads.
There is a better place out there.
Somewhere beyond that hill, it has wide open spaces and lots of trees.
And grass. Can you imagine that?
Cool, green grass.
Who feeds us?
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?
There is no farmer.
- Is he on holiday?
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?
No egg count, no farmers, no dogs, no coops and keys and no fences!
In all my life
I've never heard such a fantastic load of tripe!
Face the facts, ducks.
The chance of us getting out are a million to one.
Then there's still a chance!
Oh, no!
Who am I fooling?
I can't lead this bunch of...
Heaven help us.
Freedom!
Ladies and gentlemen, you've been a wonderful audience.
That's it.
Inside, quickly!
Here's our way out!
We'll make posters?
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.
Must be important to be on a poster.
I wonder what he does.
Obviously, he's a professional flying rooster.
Flies around giving demonstrations.
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!
No, not in there!
Get out!
Who are you? Where am I?
What happened to my wing?
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon connecting the radius to the humerus.
I wrapped it.
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.
I made the bandage.
- I carried you in.
Back up and start from the top.
Where am I?
How rude of us. We're just excited...
This is a chicken farm.
And we're the chickens.
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.
I don't like his look.
His eyes are too close together.
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's illegal where I come from.
Where is that? - A place I call home of the free, land of the brave.
Scotland!
No! America.
Poppycock!
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister...
My name's Rocky, the Rhode Island Red.
Rhodes for short.
Rocky Rhodes!
Catchy, ain't it?
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?
Who wants to know?
A group of desperate chickens.
If it's you, you may be the answer to our prayers.
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?
All the beautiful English chicks, of course.
Give over!
I'm a traveler.
I did that barnyard thing for a while, but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?
Nope!
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back and point me where the wind blows.
Know what they call me back home?
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.
Isn't that great?
I knew it was possible.
- It's possible!
The answer had to come!
- Amen!
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?
That's ri... What?
Did you say "fly?"
You can teach us.
- No, I can't.
Listen! You hear that?
The open road's calling, and I have to answer.
Bye.
He must have very good hearing.
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps I didn't explain our situation properly.
We lay eggs, day in, day out.
When we can't lay any more, they kill us.
It's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.
Which part of "they kill us" don't you understand?
I got my own set of problems.
Besides, it can't be that hard to bust out of here.
Watch me.
It's not so hard for a chicken or two to get out, but it's about all of us.
All of you? - I've been trying to tell you. - Let's get it straight.
You want to get every chicken out of here at once?
Of course.
- You're certifiable.
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.
Couldn't agree more.
And I will be leaving. That way.
Mr. Rhodes, please!
So that's it.
You're from the circus.
You're on the run, aren't you?
Keep it down!
I'm trying to lay low here.
I should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.
Would you?
- Why not?
Because I'm cute?
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!
You know what'll happen if he finds me? - It's a cruel world.
I don't like you.
- I don't care.
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.
He's valuable, you say?
Sure.
- Get the torch.
Listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.
I'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."
And that's what we want... freedom.
Fancy that, they're coming.
Oh, no! They're onto me!
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if I don't?
Was your father by any chance a vulture?
Do we have a deal?
Time to make good on that deal, dollface. - The name is Ginger.
Comfortable?
- Not really.
Maybe this will help.
Nice hideout.
I had more room in my egg.
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.
What deal?
- Flying.
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I'll teach you everything I know.
Which bunk is mine?
Absolutely outrageous!
Asking a senior officer to share his quarters.
And with a non-commissioned Yank, no less!
Why, back in my day...
You weren't exactly my first choice either.
Scoot over. Your wing's on my side of the bunk.
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!
What is that smell?
Is that your breath?
Absolutely outrageous!
So you want to fly, huh?
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And it ain't going to happen overnight.
Flying takes three things:
Hard work, perseverance and hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!
Because it takes twice as much hard work as perseverance.
Codswallop!
Cocky Yanks think they know it all.
The most important thing is we have to work as a team.
Which means, you do everything I tell you.
Let's rock 'n roll.
The chickens are...
...pecking?
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.
And stop right there.
Yes, down.
Make little circles.
Faster.
Oh, that's the spot!
I thought you were going to teach us to fly.
That's what I'm doing.
Isn't there usually some flapping involved?
Do I tell you how to lay eggs?
Relax.
We're making progress.
Really? I can't help feeling we're going around in circles.
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.
They're ready to fly now.
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.
Up and at 'em!
Let's flap.
Let's see if old Attila the Hen has come to her senses.
It's raining hen!
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.
Want to watch?
- All right.
Careful of those eggs!
Sunny-side up.
Now over easy.
Definitely scrambled.
Poultry in motion.
Birds of a feather flop together.
Great work, ladies.
The pain you're feeling is a good thing.
Pain is your friend.
Just keep the faith...
Agnes. You'll get there.
You flew four feet today.
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little...
That doesn't sound good.
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?
Are we worried?
The circus! Quick! Hide me!
Hide me!
- Come on.
One isn't awarded a medal for flapping about like a lunatic.
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!
In here!
- Get out of here now!
Give it a rest, Pops!
What? I shall have you on charges within the week!
Cheers, mate.
It's all in your head.
What's all this?
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.
No more wasting time with petty egg collection and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?
We've always been egg farmers.
My father, his father and their fathers.
They were always...
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!
But that's about to change.
This will take Tweedy's farm out of the Dark Ages and into full-scale automated production.
Melisha Tweedy will be poor no longer.
I'll put it together, shall I?
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.
And I doubt it's softer than hay.
I hate to be the voice of doom, but I've been calculating.
I don't think we're built for flying.
But I saw him!
He flew in over that fence!
I believe you, but if we could see it for ourselves it might answer some questions.
You're right. We've been at this all week. We're getting nowhere.
If his wing were better...
I'll talk to him.
Where is he?
They didn't give me this medal for being a Yank nanny.
"I don't know" would suffice.
Beware of that one, young Ginger.
That Yank is not to be trusted.
That Yank is our ticket out of here.
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"
Cocktail!
Give over!
So anyway...
Remember those flying tips.
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.
They're swell chicks.
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
Isn't that cute?
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.
A problem?
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.
Good things come to those who wait.
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.
Apples and oranges.
I'm gifted, they're not.
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.
Which we're running out of. Why haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.
I went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.
I didn't get a word of that.
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off, what do they have?
She ain't using real words.
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!
Sure. Thrust and flying are like this.
Flying and thrust.
Will you excuse us?
The wing!
No results by tomorrow, and the deal's off.
No more hiding. The farmers'll find you and back to the circus, fly boy.
You're the first chick I ever met with the shell still on.
Sleep tight, ¬∑ngel face.
The Rock's on the case.
What? What?
A beaut. A fine piece of work.
If I do say so myself.
I say so myself, too.
- Wish I'd seen it.
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.
And we...
Like a fish?
You stupid idiot!
Anyway, here it is.
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.
What're these two crooks doing here?
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.
You guys are the sneakiest, thieving parasites I've ever met.
Don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.
So, how about the eggs?
Eggs? You promised them...
Yep, I promised them every egg I lay this month.
When can we expect the first one?
I'm brewing one up now.
I'll keep you posted.
A pleasure doing business with you.
Sucker.
What?
- You lied to them.
I didn't lie, dollface.
I just omitted certain truths.
I'll give them what I promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.
And what will you give us?
Thrust.
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.
Now this will get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.
The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her.
Release!
Come on, flap!
You can do it. Flap!
Is that your first of-fence?
Roll call!
I haven't laid any eggs.
Three days, not one.
Why didn't you tell us?
- I was so busy flying...
They're coming!
- Hide me!
Hide yourself!
Double their food rations.
I want them all as fat as this one.
All of my life flashed before my eyes.
It was really boring.
Chicken feed!
My favorite!
Wait!
No, wait!
Babs, please! Bunty.
Stop it! Wait!
Stop!
Stop it!
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying, but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.
They're going to kill us all!
Heavy alert!
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.
What are you doing?
Let go!
I've met some hard-boiled eggs before, but you're about 20 minutes.
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.
In America we have a rule:
To motivate someone, don't mention death!
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!
It's been working like a charm.
You want them to perform, tell them what they want to hear.
You mean lie?
Here we go again.
Know what your problem is?
You're... difficult.
Why? Because I'm honest?
I care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger doesn't know about.
- Then I hope you never care about me.
I never will.
- Good. - Fine.
What's all this?
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.
Solid as a rock.
It's supposed to do that.
Perfect, guys.
How's that egg coming?
This is a double yolker.
I don't see what it has to do with...
- You will.
We've been working hard. Let's relax and shake those tail feathers.
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a...
Good heavens!
What's happening?
That's called a beat. Feel it pulsing through your body?
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?
Then go with it, baby!
Look, I'm going with it!
Bunty, what's got into you?
Same thing that's got into you.
Just go with the flow.
I don't recall authorizing a hop.
Shut up and dance.
What are you sobbing about, you nancy?
Little moments like this... it's what makes the job all worthwhile.
Want to dance?
Yeah, all right.
Did you see that? I flew!
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.
Your wing! It's better!
How about that?
- Fantastic!
You can fly for us tomorrow.
Yeah, so it seems.
I flew!
I owe you an apology.
I didn't think you cared, but after all this...
Well, it seems I was wrong.
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.
I might think you're turning soft.
Listen.
I have to tell you something.
No! You'd better wait.
That's champion...
What is it?
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?
Apple.
My favorite.
Chicken pies, you lummox!
Lmagine:
In less than a fortnight, every grocer will be stocked with boxes of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.
Oh, right. How does it work?
Get me a chicken, and I'll show you.
I know just the one.
I've got a score to settle with you.
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!
Quiet, I say!
Let's have some discipline!
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!
What are you waiting for, laddie?
Fly over there. Save her.
Of course! No!
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!
And catch Jerry with his trousers down!
I like that. What's the plan?
The plan...
The plan... Babs!
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.
Look at the size of that thing.
Oh, no.
Chickens go in, pies come out.
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.
Chicken!
Great! Brilliant!
Yo! Baby doll!
I'm coming!
- Hurry!
I'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!
I'm getting there.
Shoot!
I'll be down before you can say... mixed vegetables?
D'oh! Get it?
Dough.
- I'm stuck!
Nothing to it.
Hang on.
Look out.
It's like an oven in here.
Come on!
Wait!
Go over to the...
The door! Come on!
She's gonna blow! Run!
What did you do, you great pudding? - Nothing.
Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!
We've got to show the others. Come on!
Look. I fixed it.
Chicken pies?
Yes, but...
I don't want to be a pie!
I don't like gravy.
Ladies, let's not lose our heads.
Lose our heads?
What I meant was, Rocky sabotaged the machine and bought us more time.
And better still, he's going to fly for us tomorrow.
Once we see how,
I know we'll get it.
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything is going to go much smoother.
Alright, Pops, what did I do now?
A very brave and honorable deed.
In the light of your action today,
I dutifully admit that I misjudged your character.
I present you with this medal for bravery.
And I salute you.
In honor of this occasion,
I surrender the bunk entirely.
I shall sleep under the stars.
I await tomorrow's flying demonstration with great anticipation.
You and me both, Pops.
Oh, were you...?
- Is this your...?
Since you're here...
- I'm glad you're here...
You go first.
- You go ahead.
I just wanted to say, I may have been a bit harsh at first...
What I really mean is... thank you for saving my life.
For saving our lives.
You know,
I come up here every night and look at that hill, imagining what it's like on the other side.
It's funny...
I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet. I'm sorry.
I'm rambling on about grass, and you had something to say.
It's just that... life, as I've experienced it, out there lone free-ranging and stuff...
It's full of disappointments.
So grass isn't all it's cracked up to be?
Grass! Exactly.
It's always greener on the other side.
And then you get there, and it's brown and prickly.
See what I'm saying?
What I'm trying to say is... you're welcome.
You know, that hill is looking closer tonight than it ever has before.
Good night, Rocky.
Good night,
Ginger.
Company, attention!
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. I can feel it.
Finally, we get to see a professional in action.
Start warming up. I'll go get him.
Rocky? Knock, knock.
Everyone's waiting, so I told them...
A cannon.
That'd give you a thrust.
- I knew he was fake all along.
In fact, I'm not even sure if he was American.
What's the next plan?
Face it. The only way we get out is wrapped in pastry.
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away from your infernal knitting!
You always hit him.
See how you like it.
Don't push me, four-eyes!
Quiet!
Quiet, I say! Dissention in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.
A proper squadron work together, just like we did in my RAF days.
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map, and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.
Wingco would give the call, hop in the old crate, chocks away!
That's how you get medals!
Will you shut up about your stupid bloomin' medals!
How dare you!
Forgive me.
As an officer...
Everyone, shut up!
What exactly is the RAF?
What do you mean?
The Royal Air Force is what.
Then what's the "old crate"?
There she is!
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean, you flew? In one of these?
Beautifully built. In fact, there's a bit of a story there.
We were on a reconnaissance flight, when the weather duffed up.
Yes... of course.
We may be able to pull this off.
We're still flying out of here.
Fowler's provided the answer.
- I have?
Oh, yes. Of course I have.
How have I?
We'll make a crate.
Mac, you'll handle engineering.
Babs, manufacturing.
Fowler is chief aviation adviser.
Bunty, eggs.
Eggs?
Right. Like the ones the rooster was going to lay.
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?
Don't they? - It's a lady thing, apparently. Ask your mum.
One egg per item on the list.
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?
What the dickens?
Oh, gnomes now!
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.
Idiot!
That was close. Too close.
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.
Go, go!
Mac! We need the calculations quick.
Agnes, that has to be really secure.
Careful up there, Fowler!
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!
No problem, dollface.
Ah, boy.
Come on.
Please!
Oh, no.
He's fixed it.
Get the chickens.
Which ones?
All of them!
My tools!
Thieving little buggers.
What's the plan?
Attack!
Nice plan.
The chickens are revolting!
Finally, something we agree on.
Help!
Under the hut!
What have we done?
- This is it.
We're escaping!
What? Now?
Now!
But she's not ready.
- Listen!
We either die free chickens or die trying.
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!
Scramble!
The exits are located here and here.
In the likely event of an emergency, put your head between your knees...
...and kiss your bum goodbye.
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.
Behind you all the way.
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.
But back in your day... the Royal Air Force.
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.
You mean you never flew the plane?
Good heavens, no. I'm a chicken.
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens fly a complex aircraft!
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.
You always talk about
"back in your day."
Well, today is your day.
You can do it, you old sausage.
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler, reporting for duty.
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!
Fowler, now!
Roger! Contact!
Cleared for takeoff!
Chocks away!
Full throttle!
We need more power!
I can't work miracles.
We're givin' her all she's got!
Gotcha!
Hard right!
Oh, mother.
Turn her around.
I'll get the ramp.
Put the ramp down!
You are going to be a pie.
Look out!
Clear the runway!
Let's go!
We're flying!
That's for leaving.
And this is for coming back.
Great Scott! What was that?
A cling-on!
The engines can't take it!
My goodness!
Babs! Scissors!
Lower me down.
- But... - Just do it.
Increase velocity!
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!
Lower!
- I'm trying!
Look out!
Fire! Fire!
My eggs!
More ammo! Hurry!
We got no more eggs!
Look out!
No!
Bombs away!
Mr. Tweedy!
That was good! That was good!
The old bird bought it!
I told you they was organized.
We did it, everyone!
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.
You can't see paradise if you don't pedal.
Put your drumsticks into it.
That's what I told them. We were losing altitude, heading for...
A lovely holiday.
I'll be sad to go back.
Safety at all times is imperative.
Wind her up and let her go.
So...
Is it as good as you imagined?
- No.
It's better.
I'll show you how to play cricket.
Here's a thought.
Let's get an egg and start our own chicken farm.
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.
That's where the chicken comes from.
No. Without the chicken where do you get the egg?
From a chicken... that comes from the egg.
But you need an egg to have a chicken.
You got to get the chicken first to get the egg.
Then you get the chicken.
Hang on. Let's go over this again.
The egg, obviously.
Rolling along happily, then crack!
It hatches the first chicken.
But where'd the egg come from?
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling along happily and wonders, where'd it come from without a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.
Without an egg to hatch the chicken there'll be no chicken to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.
What about the first chicken?
- It's in the very first egg.
Guys!
I'm trying to enjoy paradise.
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.
Thanks.
Gitface.
- Pillock.
Thinks he's such a big shot
'cause he's got his name on a poster.
These show biz folk are all the same.
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.
- We do all the work, he gets all the credit.
- But he does get all the birds.
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey was a really clumsy kid
On the first day of first grade
I'll tell you what he did
He tripped over a pencil box
Flew up in the air
Landed on a kangaroo who pulled out all his hair
He needed first aid in the first grade
First aid in the first grade
First aid in the first grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Where is Route 59?
First aid in the second grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey was a really clumsy kid
Lights! Lights!
He fell out of a fishing boat
Splashed into the sea
Landed on a moray eel
Who bit him on the knee
He needed first aid in the third grade
He needed first aid in the third grade
He needed first aid in the third grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
I get to meet Twippo.
Twelfth grade.
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey
Was a really clumsy kid
On the 12th day of 12th grade
I'll tell you what he did
He walked into financial aid
Fell and broke a bone
Showed them all his bills and got a great big college loan
He needed first aid in the twelfth grade
First aid in the twelfth grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Yeah, Twippo.
Let's do another Twippo song.
- I love Twippo.
- Me, too.
But I'm the only one who gets to meet him, because I won the Twippo Sweepstakes.
You don't have to rub it in.
It's great that you won the contest, Laura, but let's try not to brag about it.
Nice one with the lights, Bob.
My pleasure. For the next song, maybe I can drive into the river.
Yeah.
Drive into the river, Bob
Oh, drive into the river, Bob...
Or maybe you could help me with the map.
I'm sorry.
Is there anything you want me to tell Twippo when I meet him?
Look out!
- My ticket.
- Quick, get it.
- The map.
- Sorry.
My ticket.
Do you mind?
I'm stuck.
Get it! Get it! Fix it! Stick it in! Put it back!
Porcupine!
Tree.
Cabin.
Underwear.
Well, I'm glad that's over.
Did you say something?
- Oh...
- Dear.
Am I in heaven?
Smells like Wisconsin.
Well. Nobody got hurt.
Wow. What a shot.
Hey.
What's that?
What's "Seafoo"?
Maybe it's like tofu.
Only saltier.
I can't believe I did that.
Oh, yeah? Well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be in this mess.
I said I was sorry. I'll do better next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time.
Mr. Bob? How are we gonna get to the Twippo concert?
Yeah.
We're gonna miss the Bald Bunny song.
I don't know.
I don't know about any bald bunnies.
I'm a bald bunny
Ain't got no fur
Even if we make it to the concert,
I can't get in. I lost my ticket.
Serves you right. It's your own fault for waving it around in my face.
I have to go to the bathroom.
You know,
I'm usually not that clumsy in the car.
Two flat tires.
Usually, I'm quite dexterous.
How in the world are we gonna change two flat tires?
Where's the phone?
I lost my ticket.
If you hadn't been teasing me with it, we wouldn't be in this mess, Laura.
May we help you?
Porcupine.
- I need to call my wife.
- Here.
May I please use the bathroom?
- Down the hall, first door on the left.
- Thank you.
Captain Ahab's Moby Blaster. My favorite.
What do you want?
Well, sirs. The asparagus hit me in the head with a guitar, and an angry mother porcupine shot out our tires and one of her babies got me.
- And I need to use your phone to call...
- A tow truck.
...my wife.
- I see.
- Next to the Moby Blaster.
- Thanks.
- Well, in the meantime, would you like to have a seat?
Maybe enjoy a nice combo platter?
Steak, steak
Eat it, eat it
Shrimp, shrimp
Need it, need it
Steak and shrimp
Steak and shrimp
Need to, need to eat it, eat it
Do you prefer "poking" or "non-poking?"
Non.
Good one, Phillipe.
You are one clever pea, no?
Voil√†. A skewer for the scampi.
We are
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything
We just stay home and lie around
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I will be back to take your order.
Why don't you two wait here.
I'm gonna go call a tow truck.
Maybe we can still make it to the concert on time.
Yeah, everyone but me.
Hey, it's your own fault for teasing me.
You're just getting what you deserve.
I'm coming with you, Mr. Bob.
See, the guy, one guy, all he does, he just folds these napkins.
The napkin guy.
- He works at night after everybody's gone.
- Yeah.
You know, he used to fold maps.
No. No. Listen to me. He takes one spoon, he takes one knife, and he takes one fork, and he rolls it up in a napkin. He's the one that makes it into that little swan shape.
Excuse me.
- How's it going?
- Hey. What's up?
Who are you?
Who, us?
Yeah.
We are The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.
You know that's right.
- Nothing.
- Zilch.
Nada.
Didn't you hear our song?
Well, yeah, but...
Look, sonny... Can I call you sonny?
- Junior.
- Hey. Pretty close.
Look, Junior, we couldn't help but notice you were having a little thing with your friend over there.
Yeah. You weren't being very nice.
Well, it's her own fault.
She was teasing me, and now she's getting what she deserves.
Right.
Junior, we've seen these types of situations before.
- Happens all the time.
- What you need is a little compassion.
And maybe some scampi.
Hey, I saw that in the menu.
What is that? What's "compassion"?
That's a hard question.
Well, compassion is when you see that someone needs help, and you wanna help them.
That's what I thought you'd say.
- They all do.
- Yep.
We find it helpful to illustrate with a little story.
- A story?
- Yep.
You know, we call ourselves
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, but that's not entirely accurate.
Yeah. Remember when we did that one thing with that one guy?
- Do I ever.
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
Are you guys still doing that pirate thing?
Watch your tongue, matey, or we'll have to...
- What will we do?
- We won't do anything.
We're The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, remember?
That's right.
You got off easy today.
We need more
Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls.
Yeah. And root beer.
I told you, boys, no more cheese curls until you pay your tab.
You still owe me from last week.
But you'll take away our chance to win the Mr. Twisty's Twisted
Cheese Curl Sweepstakes.
Come again?
Inside one of those bags of cheesy goodness is a golden ticket that'll change our lives forever.
Well, you could work here for me.
That way you could earn more cheese curls.
- That sounds good.
- Okay.
So what do you know how to do?
Well, I'm pretty good at lawn darts.
Ping-Pong. I can play Ping-Pong.
Croquet is my specialty.
When do we start?
Monday's good for me.
We were short on cash.
It seems not doing anything didn't pay very well.
So what do we do now?
Nothing.
You are a genius.
Are these fish fresh?
- You bet.
- Oh, yeah.
What?
They were fresh when we caught them.
- That's right.
- Two weeks ago.
Ninevites.
Beside the fact that we were low on funds, this was a memorable day because he showed up.
Jonah.
Now, Jonah was a prophet of God, which means he was one of the very special people
God used to deliver messages to Israel.
He was kind of like a mailman, except his letters came straight from God.
Anyway, Jonah loved helping his friends by bringing them God's messages.
Sometimes the messages were good.
Sometimes they were not so good.
But when a prophet talked, everybody listened.
What's the word, Jonah?
Yeah, what's the word?
Stop right here, Reginald.
Dear people,
I bring you a message from the Lord.
It's a message of encouragement.
Do not fight, do not cheat
Wash your hands before you eat
There is nothing quite as sweet
A message from the Lord
Be a friend
Say your prayers
Heaven loves a heart that cares
That is why I've come to share a message from the Lord
And if you follow God's commands
There will be peace throughout the land
You will live long and happy lives
With your sheep
Your kids
Your wives
Don't eat pigs
Don't eat bats
Don't eat beetles, flies or gnats
Stay away from all of that
A message from the Lord
Do what's right
Don't provoke
Put four tassels on your cloak
Do not laugh
It's not a joke
A message from the Lord
Do not fight
Do not cheat
Wash your hands before you eat
There is nothing quite as sweet
A message from the Lord
All together now.
Be a friend
Say your prayers
Heaven loves a heart that cares
That is why he came to share a message from the Lord
And if we follow God's commands
There will be peace throughout our land
We will live long and happy lives
With our sheep
Our kids
Our wives
Do what's right
Don't provoke
Put four tassels on your cloak
Do not laugh
It's not a joke
A message from the Lord
Don't do drugs
Stay in school
This is quite a lot of rules
Follow them and you're no fool
Follow them and you're no fool
A message from the Lord
A message from the Lord
All right. Good show, everyone.
Thank you very much.
That was pretty much Jonah's life.
Town to town, bringing God's messages to his friends.
Not a bad gig, overall.
So, every night before he went to sleep,
Jonah would pray and ask God if there was a new message for him to deliver.
And this night, there was a message that would change Jonah's life.
A new message? Yes, what's that?
People being unkind? Lying? Stealing?
Oh, dear. Sounds like a standard
"turn and repent" to me.
All right, name the town.
I'll be on my way first thing in the morning.
Where is it? Jericho? Damascus?
What? Nineveh?
I'm not aware of any Ninevehs in Israel.
No, I don't think...
You mean that Nineveh?
That Nineveh wasn't in Israel at all.
It was the capital of Assyria, and it was the biggest, meanest city around.
Now, the people of Nineveh were particularly mean to Jonah's people, the Israelites.
They lied. They stole.
But worst of all, they slapped people with fishes.
They even slapped each other with fishes.
They didn't know the difference between right and wrong.
The Ninevites were so mean, in fact, that most Israelites, including Jonah, wished God would just wipe Nineveh off the face of the Earth.
Needless to say, Jonah was shocked that God would want him to deliver a message to his enemies.
You don't want me to go there.
You don't know what Nineveh is like.
Perhaps you've never been there.
Well, of course you haven't.
A god like you would never go to a place like Nineveh.
Or for that matter, neither would a prophet like me.
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me and my brothers
We are your chosen people
And Nineveh
Well, they're not
There must be some mistake
A big misunderstanding
It's really hard to take
How could you be so demanding?
For years I've been your messenger from Moresheth to Gath
But Nineveh should get no chance to turn
They've earned your wrath
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me and my brothers
We are your chosen people
And Nineveh
Well, they're not
We're the good guys
And they're the bad guys
Please, don't send me there with a message of your mercy
Damascus or Jerusalem
I'll be there in a minute
Any town in Israel, just ask me
I'll be in it
Shiloh, Gilgal, Jericho
Just say the word
But Nineveh
That is just absurd
Joppa, Aphek, Jezreel
They're all just fine
But Nineveh
Nineveh.
No.
Nineveh is where I draw the line
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me
Yep. It sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to the Ninevites.
The tow truck's on its way.
You know, Junior, I love your dad and all, but that's the last time
I pick him for a copilot.
What's going on?
We're telling a little story.
You should listen, too.
As I was saying, it sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to Jonah's enemies.
What's "mercy"?
It's what this whole story is about.
I thought it was about compassion, remember?
The menu?
Yeah. There's that, too.
Better check your menu again.
We got two specials today, and they go hand in hand.
Compassion is when you want to help someone who needs help.
Mercy is when you give someone a second chance, even if they don't deserve it.
This story is about both of them.
That's right, my cucumber friend.
You can't have mercy without compassion.
But mercy is even more important.
Jonah was afraid God was going to give Nineveh a second chance, that he was going to help them, even though they didn't deserve it.
So what did he do?
Well, never before had he gotten a message from God that he didn't want to deliver.
He didn't know what to do.
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?
What? Nothing. There is no word.
Nothing at all?
No. Nothing at all.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm very busy.
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?
Stop it. There is no word. Nothing.
I've got to get out of here.
There is no word.
I have no new messages.
And above all, I am not going to Nineveh.
Sorry, sir.
I can't sell you a ticket to Nineveh.
What? Who are you?
The name's Angus. I sell cruise tickets.
There's nothing like a cruise on the Great Sea to clean the sand out of your wicket, aye?
But you can't sail to Nineveh.
It's landlocked. See?
You can't go by sea. You gotta go by land.
But I don't want to go to...
Hello, Mr. Jonah. What's the word?
He's going to Nineveh.
Oh, really?
I am not going to Nineveh.
Why on earth would I want to go to Nineveh?
In fact, I'm going in the opposite direction.
What's the farthest thing in the world from Nineveh?
Well, if you have a few days, you could sail down to Egypt.
It's lovely this time of year.
There. I want to go there.
Tarshish?
Why, that would take weeks.
It's the other end of the world.
Perfect. How much?
Even if you had the money, no one around here has the time to sail all the way to Tarshish.
Then again.
We couldn't possibly.
We're very busy with cargo and stuff.
You know, pirates have to pillage and plunder and...
That really takes it out of you...
Yeah, and ALF is on in a half hour, so I don't think we should...
And besides that, we don't really sail.
At all.
So, the answer is no.
Money is no object.
Next stop, Tarshish. I'll hoist the mainsail.
- I'll pop the popcorn.
- I'll get the moist towelettes.
Where did we put them?
Hey, Larry, have you seen the towelettes?
- I got it. I got it.
- No, those are baby wipes.
Sorry.
My fault.
Even though we'd never sailed before, we took to it like a fish to water.
Thar she blows.
Where?
Right there. Next to the grill.
Got it.
Six-zero.
Seven-zero.
That's a skunk. I win.
Yeah. All right. Yeah.
What do you say, Jonah? Two out of three?
No. I'm done.
When we get to Tarshish, Ho Hos on me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He winny at the Ping-Pong
We get the Ho Ho and the Ding Dong
Ding dong
Once we finally got out to sea,
Jonah went below deck to rest a bit.
What have I done? What have I done?
You are powerful and attractive.
What? Who's there?
You do not run from your problems, but confront them face to face.
The bag. It speaks.
What did you do that for?
Mr. Twisty?
Who's there? Show yourself.
Hello.
What are you?
Who, me? My name is Khalil.
I am a caterpillar. Well, that's only half true.
My mother was a caterpillar.
My father was a worm.
But I'm okay with that now.
Khalil?
Khalil. You've got to get your gut into it.
I bet you are wondering why I am here.
You tidy up around the ship?
No. I do not work on the ship.
I am a small business operator.
A traveling salesman.
I sell Persian rugs door to door.
See?
- Lovely.
- By the way, do you know where this ship is going?
- Yes, Tarshish.
- Tarshish.
What a trip.
You know, that may be just what I need.
The Persian rug business has not been going very well around here.
But I still have a positive mental attitude because of my motivational tapes.
You are a skilled metalworker.
I am a skilled metalworker.
I did not know that.
Yes, well, that's lovely, Carlyle, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll just get some rest.
Jonah?
You are Jonah.
- You know me?
- Of course I do.
You are the most famous prophet in the whole world.
- Well, I don't know if I'd say...
- I sell your licensed merchandise.
Look. I have the Jonah rugs, the Jonah plush toy with sound chip.
A message from the Lord.
A message from the Lord.
Well, I'm flattered.
You are huge. You are a celebrity.
Well, I...
From town to town, delivering God's messages.
What a life. You are a big shot.
No, it's really...
The man God can count on to deliver his messages.
Yes, well...
You and God are like peas in a pod.
Like two humps on a camel, you always sway the same way.
That is a good one.
You know, humor runs very deep in my family.
My uncle was a big star back at a comedy club in Nineveh.
The Taj Ma-Haha. Standing room only.
And then he was hit with a fish.
I am telling you, those people do not know right from wrong.
Nineveh.
You are sad now, my friend?
Something about Nineveh makes you feel sad inside?
I don't really want to talk about it.
I just need some rest.
You do not have to tell me.
- Good.
- Because I already know.
- You do?
- Yes.
There is a woman in Nineveh, is there not?
A beautiful young asparagus.
- She is waiting there for you, no?
- No.
You were promised to be married, but your job is now in the way.
The woman's father is the head of an international ring of camel thieves.
This very day, you set sail for Tarshish to deliver a message that will break the back of the camel thieves, but in the process, will break the heart of the woman you love.
Insight runs very deep in my family.
Do not worry, the first one is free.
Please, Carlyle, I just need to get some rest.
It's Khalil.
But you can call me Carlyle if you want to.
When we get to Tarshish, you can deliver the message, and I'll sell the plush toys.
We can be a team.
A message from the Lord.
Well, sweet dreams, traveling buddy.
We can make our plans to save those camels tomorrow.
You are a go-getter.
Yes, which way is Tarshish?
Right this way. You can't miss it.
Thank you.
Jonah.
What? Who is it?
Jonah, where are you going?
It's you, Lord.
I'm going to... I'm going...
- Jonah.
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
- Jonah.
- I can't hear you.
Jonah.
I can't hear you.
Jonah.
Jonah. Jonah. Jonah.
No. I can't hear you.
Come on, wake up. We got trouble.
What? What's happening?
We're in a storm. Like I've never seen before.
If we don't do something quick, we're gonna sink.
We seem to have sprung a leak, traveling buddy.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to get off my ship, you lousy leaf eater?
Well, yes.
But, you see, my new friend and I are going to Tarshish to break the back of the camel thieves.
Crime fighting runs very deep in my family.
Why, if it wasn't for this storm,
I'd make you walk the plank.
And you, how can you sleep at a time like this?
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
We're all gonna be fish food if I don't get some help.
Well, what can we do?
Get up and pray to your god.
Maybe he'll have mercy on us and spare our lives.
Somebody up there must be really upset with somebody down here.
Wait a minute. That's it.
All right. You two, follow me.
You got electric eel?
Nope. Go fish.
One more card.
You are one cheating buccaneer.
How am I supposed to cheat at Go Fish?
I don't know.
All right, you lazies.
Game over. Shuffle them up and deal us in.
But...
Okay. Here's the deal.
The way I see it, there is a reason for this storm.
Somebody up there is really upset with somebody down here.
And it ain't gonna let up until we know who that somebody is.
It could be any one of us.
I have my suspicions.
But we won't know for sure until we figure it out scientifically.
All right men, Go Fish.
Loser takes a swim.
- You got a perch?
- No.
- You have any pickerel?
- No.
You got a muskellunge?
Nope. Go fish.
Oh, dear.
I am most desperate for a lobster.
Sorry.
Drat.
You got any bass?
Yeah.
- Octopus?
- Bluegill?
- Tuna.
- Halibut.
You got any trout?
What a goose I am. It's a match.
I had it all along.
I thought for sure...
All right. I admit it. It's my fault. All my fault.
I'm the one to blame.
But I... The worm...
I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the god of heaven, who made the sea and the land.
And I'm running away from him.
He told me to go to Nineveh, but I didn't listen.
You know, I don't like those people.
- Fish slappers.
- Yes.
So I ran. I ran, and I ended up here.
And now everyone's in terrible danger all because of me.
I'm afraid the only thing left is to be thrown into the sea.
You don't have to do that. We've got a plank.
You can just walk off.
Yes. Thank you. You're too kind.
Well, Jonah, old buddy.
It was nice knowing you.
Normally, you'd be entitled to a refund, but under the circumstances, you know, with you dying and all...
No, I don't suppose a refund would do me much good now, would it?
Thanks. You're a trouper. Ain't he a trouper?
But the camels...
Hey. Wait a minute.
I just remembered something.
Maybe you don't have to walk the plank after all.
Every winter, my cousin from Moose Lake asks me to take care of this.
- Cool.
- What is it?
This, my friends, is a Jupiter 1,600 horsepower, high-octane, dual propeller, pull ignition outboard motor.
With the optional chrome trim package.
- Cool.
- What is it?
It gets us back to Joppa.
Well, how does it work?
That I don't know.
Perhaps I could help.
- You know, technical competency runs...
- I know, very deep in your family.
Our reputation precedes us.
Well, then, it appears that one should pull the cord, and then perhaps push this black bubbly thingy.
No. Maybe it's the other way around.
Perhaps if one first pushes the black bubbly thingy and then pulls the cord...
See?
Yep. That's how it works.
It has been delightful, but I must go now.
Oh, Lord, don't let us die for this man's sin.
And don't hold us responsible for his death, because it isn't our fault.
Oh, Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons.
And keep my duckie safe.
- Amen.
- Amen.
That was easy.
Well, should we pull him back in?
I don't see why not.
Something touched me!
There's something in the water!
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- I'm hurrying!
Hold on, Jonah!
- Aim this time!
- I was aiming!
- I can never tell where you're looking.
- You should talk.
Hurry!
Fellows, please!
- Pull it back in. Hurry!
- Okay, okay! I got it!
- Let me do that!
- No, no! I'll throw it!
Fellows, please!
Come on! Give it here!
I said, I got it!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Man the cannon!
Aye-aye, Captain!
We ain't got no ammo!
Yes, we do!
Fire one!
Fire two!
Hello?
Fire three!
I'm coming, traveling buddy!
Traveling buddy? Where are you?
Look, a bowling ball.
If I could only find some pins.
You found better than that, traveling buddy!
It's me!
Oh, my.
So forget about Tarshish.
All we need to do is get this whale to swim to Nineveh!
You give the message. I sell the plush toys.
We'll be right back on track.
Carlyle, please don't speak to me.
I'm having a rather bad day.
Well, you don't need to be so down about it,
Mr. Grumpypants!
Look around you!
We're inside a whale!
We're going to be digested!
Do you know what that means?
Of course I do!
Digestion runs very deep in my family.
I'm just trying to have a positive outlook, you know.
You know, the difference between you and me is that you see the whale as half empty, but I see the whale as half full!
I don't know what that means.
Neither do I.
I might as well face it.
God gave me a job to do, and I disobeyed him.
I ran the other way.
I've done something terrible, and now I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm going to die here in this whale.
Have you ever seen anything so pathetic?
This boy needs some help!
What? Who's there?
Take it easy, Jonah.
We're on your side.
How did you know my name?
How did you get in here?
Were you in the bowling ball, too?
No. That's not how we get around.
No, we came straight from the big man himself.
You mean...
And just like you, we deliver his messages.
- So, you're prophets, too?
- Not exactly.
You see, we work on a slightly higher level.
- You do?
- And, Jonah, we've got a message for you.
You're feeling pretty blue
You didn't do what God requested
Yeah, I'd be moping, too
If I was gonna be digested
This ain't a pretty picture, no
I said, it ain't a pretty sight, no
You ran from God this morning
And you're
Whale chow
Tonight
Hold up
Hang on
Not so fast
Your life ain't over yet
See, we're here to tell you all about
The forgiveness that
You can get
You see, ours is a god of mercy
Ours is a god of love
And right now he gonna lend a helping hand from up above
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored how his love your life enhances
You can be restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god of second chances
Ain't it good to know a god who gives a second chance?
Why, that's enough to get a smile from Mr. Grumpypants
So if you say you're sorry for all the stuff you do
We know that he'll be ready with a second chance for you
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored
How his love your life enhances
You can be restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god of second chances
Our god is the god
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
God gives a second chance
Second chances
Second chances
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
Second chances
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
Second chances
Second chances
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
Second chances
Our god is the god
So, from inside the whale,
Jonah prayed and asked God to forgive him for not obeying.
He told God that if he got another chance, he would go to Nineveh, even though he didn't like those people very much.
So, did he get another chance?
Shouldn't you be looking out for your tow truck?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That can wait.
Did Jonah get another chance?
Well, God saw that Jonah needed help, and he wanted to help him.
That's compassion!
But did he give him a second chance, even though he didn't deserve it?
You know, mercy?
After three days, Jonah noticed something strange happening.
Reginald! Good to see you.
Yes, well...
So God told the whale to burp up Jonah, and Jonah got his second chance.
And just like he promised, he headed straight for Nineveh!
Turn back!
Turn back! Turn back!
The slapping!
Turn back!
Turn back! Turn back!
Go in, give the message, get out.
Go in, give the message, get out.
Who goes there?
Yes. My name is Jonah.
And I'm a prophet from...
You're not from here, are you?
No, you see, I'm from...
That would make you a stranger, wouldn't it?
Well, yes. I suppose so. But I...
We don't like strangers.
No. Yes, I've heard that.
But, you see, I have a...
So why are you here?
Well, I have a message.
A message? For who?
Well, for everyone! For the whole city.
You've got a message for the whole city?
- The whole city!
- That's rich!
I'll alert the king.
"Your honor, a bleached asparagus has a message for us all."
- "Most important!"
- I do not think this is going very well.
Let's just go home! I did what you said.
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
- Jonah?
- What?
It is our friends from the ship!
What on earth? What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Yeah. You were... You were...
Fish food!
The whale spit us out like so much bad couscous, and here we are now, delivering the message to Nineveh.
But they wouldn't let us in, so I guess we're going home.
Hey, I bet we could get him in.
Hey, look! It's the cheese curls blokes.
Right.
Coming back for a visit, are you?
- Yep.
- Yep.
Is that fellow with you?
Yes, he's with us!
You're with them?
Yes, indeed!
Why, I sailed halfway across the world with these fine gentlemen.
All right. You can come in.
Enjoy your stay in Nineveh.
What was that all about?
How did you do that?
Remember that money you gave us?
By the way, you aren't gonna want that refund, are you?
Good. 'Cause we spent it, every last penny, on cheese curls.
- Cheese curls?
- Yep.
One thousand four hundred and fifty-eight bags of Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls!
And you'll never guess what we found in bag 497.
The golden ticket.
We won the Mr. Twisty's
Twisted Cheese Curl Sweepstakes!
And the prize was...
But in addition to our enviably fashionable headgear, we also got a tour of the Mr. Twisty's factory, right here in Nineveh.
Which, despite its unseemly location, was a splendid experience.
And, believe it or not, in this town, we are famous.
Hey, look!
Here comes a city official to greet us.
Hello!
We were in the neighborhood, so we thought we'd...
These are the men. Arrest them at once.
But...
Excuse me. What have they done?
Thievery.
High theft against the Royal City of Nineveh.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
No! Wait! I thought they were free samples.
Take them away!
You can't do that.
I'm sorry, are you with these men?
Well, yes, I suppose.
Hello. What are you doing?
Wonderful. It must be time for my speech.
Hey. I can't move.
I can't move, either.
What? Have I got something on my face?
This doesn't look good.
I'm sorry, guys.
I thought they were free samples.
They were right out there in the open in a big bowl.
- Very misleading.
- Don't go blaming yourself.
No. Blame him.
"Let's put it all in cheese curls," he says.
"No," I say, "We need a balanced portfolio!"
A little stock, a little bonds, a little cash, or cash equivalents.
And then maybe some snacks.
But, no. "Put it all in cheese curls," he says.
Man, you gotta plan for the future.
What? It got us here, didn't it?
Not "here" literally, but...
We were somebody! We were celebrities!
We are going to die!
People of Nineveh.
These four men and that small, whatever it is...
I am a caterpillar. Well, that is only half true.
...have been found guilty of high thievery against the Royal City of Nineveh.
For their punishment, the slap of no return!
What's so funny?
Observe.
What is happening that is making you all cry like little babies?
Why on earth do you take snack food so seriously?
People of Nineveh,
I give you King Twistomer.
It's Mr. Twisty.
Well, that explains it.
He looks happier on the bag.
Your Royal Gourdliness, these are the perpetrators of the heinous act against your curls of cheese.
For their punishment, the slap of no return!
Proceed.
Wait!
Won't you at least give the guilty parties a chance to speak in their own defense?
You may speak.
Well, as I understand it, the snacks in question were right out in the open in a large bowl!
I think we'll all agree this was somewhat misleading.
Don't you think?
Slap them.
No! You don't understand!
I'm not really with them.
I mean, how could I be?
While they were taking the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!
What did you say?
I said, while they were on the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!
But you're not dead.
No! That's just it!
I was in the whale for three days and nights!
Then I prayed to my god, and the great monster spit me up on the shore so that I could bring you all a message.
Asparagus, here in Nineveh, we bow to the Great Fish.
We celebrate the Great Fish in our art.
Yes, I noticed.
If what you are saying is true...
Yes. How do we know if he is telling the truth, sire?
Smell him.
Your Highness?
Smell him.
I'm terribly sorry.
I've been meaning to shower, but...
He has been in the Great Fish.
We must hear the message.
What? The message. Yes.
The message.
- What was the message?
- Come on!
It's been so long, I...
Yes.
Stop it!
Stop cheating. Stop lying.
And, especially, stop slapping people with fishes or this entire city will be destroyed!
A message from the Lord.
Well, the king was very upset.
He had no idea they weren't supposed to do that stuff.
No one had ever told him before.
"A decree from the king!
Let everyone call urgently to God.
"Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
"Perhaps the god that brought this man out of the Great Fish
"will give us a second chance."
And let the asparagus and his friends go free.
So, the King and the people of Nineveh said they were sorry, stopped the fish slapping and started being nice to people.
- Wow! That's great!
- Yeah!
Everyone must've been really happy, right?
Well, almost everyone.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- So long.
- Thank you!
Yes, thank you very much.
You see, Jonah figured God wouldn't really forgive the Ninevites.
I mean, they had done some terrible stuff.
No.
He figured God had something else in mind.
What are we doing?
It's time to watch the fun.
And what fun would that be?
Well, I did what I was supposed to do.
I warned them that they were going to get in big trouble.
So, now that they've had their warning, it's time to watch God wipe them off the face of the Earth!
I picked a safe distance so we won't get singed.
This is going to be great!
The bad guys finally getting what they deserve.
So, Jonah waited for God to destroy Nineveh.
Even now,
God was compassionate towards Jonah and caused a plant to grow that shaded him from the hot sun.
Yes! Very nice. Thank you.
Very nice.
Jonah kept waiting.
But it didn't seem like anything was happening.
He wondered if maybe God was forgetting something.
All right. I did my job.
So, fire! Brimstone! Whatever! You pick!
Right over there!
I'll just sit here under my weed and wait.
What happened?
What? How could you?
All your whining made me hungry.
It was just a weed.
Just a weed? It was my shade!
It was my friend!
Oh, dear Lord, how could you let this happen?
Would you look at yourself!
You care more about that weed than about all the people in Nineveh!
Well, I...
Why are you here now, instead of back in the belly of that whale?
Because God is compassionate!
He wanted to help you.
And because he is merciful, he gave you a second chance!
Oh, yes, and I'm very grateful...
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe God loves everybody?
Not just you! That maybe he wants to give everyone a second chance?
- Well...
- He saw that those people needed help, that they didn't know right from wrong, and he wanted to help them.
And that is why he sent you.
And when you told them what they were doing wrong, they said they were sorry.
They put down their mackerels and their halibuts, and they asked God for a second chance.
And, by golly, he gave them one!
Don't you see? God wants to give everyone a second chance.
And so should we.
Well, if they get a second chance, those fish slappers, well, then it would be better if I were dead!
I wish I were back in that whale!
You are pathetic.
You know, patience runs very deep in my family, but not that deep.
I am out of here.
What? What are you doing?
I wanted to be big and important, just like you.
But the world doesn't need more people who are big and important.
The world needs more people who are nice.
And compassionate. And merciful.
That's what I want to be.
You can find yourself a new traveling buddy. Goodbye.
- You can't just leave!
- Can and am.
But who will I talk to?
You can't just leave me here all alone?
Hello?
Carlyle? Reginald? Carlyle!
Khalil! Khalil! Khalil!
The end!
Wait a minute.
- It's over?
- Yep.
- That's how it ends?
- Yep.
But what did Jonah learn?
The question, my friends, is not, "What did Jonah learn?"
The question is, "What did you learn?"
Well, I learned that we need to help people who need help.
And we need to give second chances, even if they don't deserve them.
But what's that got to do with us?
Hey, Tomato.
Your friend there, the big asparagus.
If I'm not mistaken, he didn't do such a good job helping you with the map.
It was a disaster.
He said he was sorry and that he'd do better next time, but no way.
Mercy.
I guess everyone deserves a second chance.
Yep!
Now get out of here before my crab legs get cold.
You know, that still wasn't a very good way to end a story.
Well, what do you want?
A big musical number?
Well, yeah!
Who do they think I am? Twippo?
Yes?
- Twippo!
- Twippo!
What are you doing here?
Well, I have a concert tonight, but I'm running late.
Can't find Route 59 to save my life!
I stopped here for directions.
We're going to your concert tonight.
At least, we were.
And then porcupines!
And underwear!
And pirates!
And now it looks like we aren't going to make it at all.
Good heavens!
Well, if it's a ride you need,
I've plenty of room on my bus.
You can all come with me.
Yeah. Everyone but me.
Laura, you can have my ticket.
But, Junior, it was my fault.
Why, that was a very merciful thing to do.
Tell you what.
I'll give you all a ride to the concert, and I'll make sure you all have backstage passes!
Speaking of mercy, have any of you heard the story of a man named Jonah?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Well, would you like to hear a song about it?
Is it like the Bald Bunny song?
Not really.
It's more of a big musical number.
Perfect!
When I was a boy
I went to church back home in Arizona
And that is where I heard the tale
Of a man whose name was Jonah
Now, Jonah was a prophet
But that's not why he's remembered
We tell the tale 'cause in a whale
He nearly was dismembered
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Now, Jonah set sail
On a pirate ship in a dreadful gale
Got eaten up by a giant whale
But managed not to be dead
You'd think he would learn a lot from being saved from an awful spot
But the second chance that he had got he didn't want to be spread
So poor old Jonah
Now he's all alone
Gotta use a megaphone to get it through to his head
Hey
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Now, true, in your life you probably don't ride on a camel
And you probably won't wake up inside a large aquatic mammal
But all the same, like Jonah there is something you can do
Everyone deserves to get a second chance from you
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
Jonah was a prophet
I beg your pardon.
I hate to break up the party, but who needed a tow?
Have we met?
This is the song that runs under the credits
These are the credits
So this is where it goes
Has nothing to do with the movie so we'll say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
There once was a song that ran under the credits
That went with the movie
But this is not that song
Has nothing to do with the movie so we'll say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Wouldn't it be nice if the song under the credits
Had something to do with the movie you just saw
But that's not the case
So for now we'll have to say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
There should be a rule that the song under the credits
Remotely pertains to the movie's basic plot
That rule has not been made so for now we'll have to say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Come on
Where you going?
I don't think we're done yet.
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
Come on. We have contractual obligations to finish this one.
They paid for a full 79 minutes of entertainment, pal. Get back in the booth.
Wake me up for the prequel.
Come on. We were just starting to have fun.
Hey. What? Oh, man. I need a Tums.
What? What, are we done?
You mean, that's it?
If you want me, I'll be on the porch.
{793}{856}Dr. Jumba Jookiba--
{857}{911}lead scientist of|Galaxy Defense Industries--
{914}{997}you stand before this council
{998}{1103}accused of illegal|genetic experimentation.
{1247}{1303}How do you plead?
{1304}{1347}Not guilty!
{1348}{1415}My experiments|are only theoretical--
{1416}{1486}completely|within legal boundaries.
{1486}{1595}We believe you actually|created something.
{1596}{1663}Created something?! Ha!
{1664}{1737}But that would be irresponsible|and unethical.
{1738}{1779}I would never, ever...
{1820}{1875}...make more than one.
{2048}{2113}What is that monstrosity?
{2114}{2143}Monstrosity!
{2144}{2272}What you see before you|is the first of a new species.
{2273}{2369}I call it Experiment 6-2-6.
{2406}{2466}He is bulletproof, fireproof
{2467}{2534}and can think faster|than supercomputer.
{2535}{2573}He can see in the dark
{2574}{2637}and move objects|3,000 times his size.
{2638}{2693}His only instinct:
{2694}{2776}To destroy|everything he touches!
{2819}{2860}So, it is a monster.
{2861}{2895}Hey, just a little one.
{2896}{2934}It is an affront to nature.
{2935}{2975}It must be destroyed!
{2976}{3022}Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
{3023}{3082}Perhaps it can be reasoned with.
{3083}{3154}Experiment 6-2-6
{3155}{3239}give us some sign you understand|any of this.
{3240}{3350}Show us that there is something|inside you that is good.
{3422}{3457}Hmm?
{3458}{3517}Meega, nala kweesta!
{3580}{3623}So naughty!
{3680}{3720}I didn't teach it that.
{3721}{3781}Place that idiot scientist|under arrest!
{3782}{3903}I prefer to be called|"evil genius"!
{3904}{3961}And as for that abomination...
{3990}{4047}...it is the flawed product|of a deranged mind.
{4076}{4109}It has no place among us.
{4110}{4181}Captain Gantu, take him away.
{4182}{4217}With pleasure.
{4562}{4593}Hmm.
{4751}{4774}Uncomfortable?
{4775}{4798}Oh...
{4799}{4829}Good!
{4830}{4934}The council has banished you|to exile on a desert asteroid.
{4935}{5006}So, relax... enjoy the trip
{5007}{5054}and don't get any ideas.
{5055}{5151}These guns are locked|onto your genetic signature.
{5152}{5195}They won't shoot anyone but you.
{5224}{5250}Ow! Why, you...!
{5291}{5367}May I remind the captain|that he is on duty.
{5408}{5445}Secure the cell!
{5446}{5490}Aye, Captain.
{5576}{5631}Captain on deck.
{5632}{5681}All ahead full.
{5764}{5862}Do... Does this, uh,|look infected to you?
{6280}{6347}Oh!
{6544}{6577}Quiet, you.
{6671}{6701}Gunfire in the cell bay!
{6702}{6726}Open a channel.
{6979}{7001}He's loose on Deck C!
{7003}{7038}Red alert.|Seal off the deck!
{7239}{7283}Security,|converge on door seven!
{7284}{7337}Deadly force authorized.
{7338}{7381}Fire on sight!
{7382}{7421}There he is!
{7528}{7570}Security to Bridge.
{7571}{7610}It's in the ventilation system.
{7672}{7722}He's headed for the power...
{7747}{7770}...grid.
{7827}{7877}What was that?
{7878}{7939}I don't think he's|on the ship anymore.
{7940}{8005}Confirmed.|He's taken a police cruiser.
{8049}{8107}Yeah... he took the red one.
{8145}{8172}Yee-haw!
{8588}{8617}Hmm?!
{8618}{8651}That's it!
{8652}{8697}We got it.|We got it!
{8774}{8821}Hyperdrive activated.
{8824}{8846}System charging.
{8848}{8894}He's engaged his H-drive!
{8895}{8955}Warning--|guidance is not functional.
{8956}{8979}Pursuit Commander
{8980}{9030}that crazy trog is|about to make a jump!
{9031}{9092}Break formation!|Get clear of that ship!
{9093}{9132}Navigation failure.
{9133}{9192}Do not engage hyper...
{9398}{9473}Get me Galactic Control.
{9502}{9541}Where is he?!
{9542}{9575}He's still in hyperspace.
{9576}{9610}Where will he exit?
{9611}{9637}Calculating now--
{9639}{9739}quadrant 17, section 0-0-5,|area 51.
{9740}{9812}A planet called... Ee-arth.
{9813}{9877}I want an expert on this planet|in here now!
{9906}{9943}What is that?
{9944}{9994}Water. Most of the planet|is covered in it.
{9995}{10030}He won't survive in water.
{10031}{10079}His molecular density|is too great.
{10191}{10238}No...
{10351}{10402}Of course.
{10403}{10442}How much time do we have?
{10443}{10527}We have projected his landing|at three hours, 42 minutes.
{10528}{10564}Oh, we have to gas the planet.
{10565}{10598}Hold it!
{10599}{10625}Hold everything!
{10626}{10692}Earth is a protected|wildlife preserve.
{10693}{10733}Yeah. We've been using it
{10734}{10790}to rebuild|the mosquito population
{10791}{10877}which, need I remind you,|is an endangered species!
{10878}{10946}Am I to assume|you are the expert?
{10947}{11037}Oh, I don't know about "expert."
{11062}{11100}Agent Pleakley at your service.
{11102}{11144}Can we not simply|destroy the island?
{11145}{11190}No! Crazyhead!
{11190}{11262}The mosquito's food of choice,|primitive humanoid life forms
{11262}{11304}have colonies|all over that planet.
{11305}{11359}Are they intelligent?
{11360}{11398}No, but they're very delicate.
{11399}{11467}In fact, every time an asteroid|strikes their planet
{11468}{11525}they have to begin life|all over.
{11552}{11583}It's fascinating, isn't it?
{11584}{11629}With this,|I've been able to study...
{11630}{11685}What if our military forces|just landed there?
{11686}{11725}Well, that'd be a bad idea!
{11726}{11786}These are extremely|simple creatures, miss.
{11787}{11874}Landing there would create mass|mayhem and planet-wide panic!
{11875}{11944}A quiet capture would require|an understanding of 6-2-6
{11945}{11974}that we do not possess!
{11975}{12101}Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would|you send for his extraction?
{12102}{12166}Does he have a brother?
{12191}{12238}Close grandmother, perhaps?
{12317}{12356}Friendly cousin?
{12357}{12414}Neighbor with a beard?
{12925}{12978}He got away?
{12979}{13041}I'm sure this comes|as no surprise to you.
{13042}{13123}I designed this creature|for to be unstoppable.
{13124}{13201}Which is precisely why you|must now bring him back.
{13202}{13229}What? Me?
{13230}{13267}And to reward you
{13268}{13389}we are willing to trade|your freedom for his capture.
{13419}{13490}6-2-6 will not come easily.
{13491}{13554}Maybe direct hit|from plasma cannon
{13555}{13615}might stun him long enough to...
{13616}{13641}Plasma cannon granted.
{13643}{13710}Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?
{13742}{13780}B-B-But it's a delicate planet!
{13781}{13831}Who's going to control him?
{13832}{13879}You will.
{13880}{13916}Very good, Your Highness.
{13917}{13943}I... I didn't quite...
{13972}{13999}Uh, you're notjoking!
{14000}{14101}So, tell me,|my little one-eyed one
{14102}{14221}on what poor, pitiful,|defenseless planet
{14226}{14375}has my monstrosity|been unleashed?

{17905}{17943}Stop. Stop.
{17944}{18036}Lilo, why are you all wet?
{18037}{18080}It's sandwich day.
{18145}{18197}Every Thursday,|I take Pudge the fish
{18198}{18234}a peanut butter sandwich.
{18235}{18272}Pudge is a fish?
{18273}{18341}And today we were out|of peanut butter!
{18342}{18405}So I asked my sister|what to give him
{18406}{18458}and she said a tuna sandwich.
{18459}{18501}I can't give Pudge tuna!
{18502}{18572}Do you know what tuna is?
{18573}{18597}Fish?
{18598}{18637}It's fish!
{18638}{18729}If I gave Pudge tuna,|I'd be an abomination!
{18730}{18787}I'm late because|I had to go to the store
{18788}{18818}and get peanut butter
{18819}{18875}'cause all we have|is-is stinkin' tuna!
{18876}{18956}Lilo, Lilo, why is|this so important?
{18957}{19006}Pudge controls the weather.
{19070}{19106}You're crazy.
{19183}{19209}Please! Please!
{19210}{19259}Everybody calm down!
{19288}{19315}Girls...
{19352}{19384}Shh.
{19385}{19414}Lilo...
{19415}{19443}I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
{19444}{19482}I won't do it again!
{19483}{19537}Maybe we should call|your sister.
{19538}{19572}No! I'll be good!
{19573}{19604}I want to dance.
{19605}{19663}I practiced.
{19664}{19704}I just want to dance.
{19705}{19799}I practiced.
{19800}{19848}Ooh, she bit me.
{19849}{19893}Eww!
{20045}{20086}I called your sister.
{20087}{20173}She said to wait for her|here on the porch.
{20174}{20243}We'll try again on Sunday.
{20407}{20459}Does this look infected|to you?
{20460}{20487}Yeah.
{20516}{20551}You better not have rabies.
{20552}{20579}If you have rabies
{20580}{20638}the dogcatcher is|going to have to cut...
{20639}{20688}Are you going to play dolls?
{20689}{20750}You don't have a doll.
{20751}{20806}This is Scrump.
{20836}{20886}I made her,|but her head is too big.
{20887}{20974}So I pretend a bug laid eggs|in her ears, and she's upset
{20975}{21039}because she only has|a few more days to...
{21498}{21544}Lilo!
{21545}{21595}Lilo?
{21678}{21750}Lilo?
{21751}{21797}Oh, no.
{21835}{21878}You better be home.
{21994}{22039}Hey! Watch where you're going!
{22040}{22071}Stupidhead!
{22199}{22263}# I found a new place|to dwell... #

{22323}{22374}Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!
{22375}{22415}Go away.
{22416}{22459}# ...You make me so lonely,|baby...#
{22460}{22494}Lilo?
{22495}{22539}We don't have time for this.
{22540}{22571}# ...I get so lonely... #
{22572}{22607}Leave me alone to die.
{22608}{22641}Come on, Lilo

{23375}{23421}Oh, I'm going to stuff you|in the blender
{23422}{23463}push "puree",|then bake you into a pie
{23464}{23501}and feed it|to the social worker!
{23502}{23543}And when he says,|"Mmm, this is great.
{23544}{23591}What's your secret?"|I'm going to say...
{23616}{23706}"Love... and nurturing."
{23707}{23754}Hi. Uh...
{23791}{23837}You must be the, uh...
{23838}{23871}The stupidhead.
{23872}{23919}Oh! Oh...
{23920}{23972}Oh, you know,|I'm really sorry about that
{23973}{24050}and if I'd known who you were,|of course I never would've...
{24051}{24103}Uh... I can pay for that.
{24104}{24135}It's a rental.
{24136}{24184}Are you the guardian|in question?
{24185}{24235}Yes. I'm Nani.
{24236}{24285}Nice to meet you, Mister...?
{24286}{24328}Bubbles.
{24329}{24356}Mr. Bubbles.
{24357}{24387}That's a strange...
{24388}{24415}Yes, I know.
{24416}{24480}Are you going|to invite me in, Nani?
{24481}{24553}Uh... I thought we could|sit out here and talk.
{24554}{24605}I don't think so.
{24606}{24657}Right. Uh...
{24658}{24709}# ...It's always crowded... #
{24710}{24744}This way.
{24745}{24789}# ...You still can find|some room #

{25259}{25294}So...
{25294}{25346}lemonade?
{25347}{25398}Do you often|leave your sister home alone?
{25399}{25450}No. Never.
{25487}{25526}Well, except forjust now.
{25527}{25581}Uh, I had to run|to the store to get some...
{25631}{25677}Oh!
{25678}{25747}You left the stove on|while you were out?
{25748}{25773}Low heat!
{25775}{25798}Just a simmer.
{25799}{25822}Mmm!
{25823}{25851}It's coming along great.
{25902}{25931}I found that this morning.
{25932}{25969}Lilo! There you are.
{25970}{26009}Honeyface...
{26010}{26073}this is Mr. Bubbles.
{26074}{26132}Nice to meet you.
{26134}{26165}Your knuckles say "Cobra".
{26246}{26313}Cobra Bubbles.
{26314}{26378}You don't look like|a social worker.
{26379}{26433}I'm a special classification.
{26434}{26501}Did you ever kill anyone?
{26526}{26578}We're getting off the subject.
{26579}{26610}Let's talk about you.
{26611}{26655}Are you happy?
{26720}{26762}I'm adjusted.
{26763}{26798}I eat four food groups
{26798}{26868}and look both ways|before crossing the street
{26869}{26930}and take long naps,|and get disciplined.
{26951}{26975}Disciplined?
{26976}{27049}Yeah.|She disciplines me real good.
{27050}{27082}Sometimes five times a day.
{27083}{27125}-With bricks.|-No...
{27126}{27153}Bricks?
{27154}{27193}Uh-huh, in a pillowcase.
{27194}{27247}Okay! That's enough sugar|for you.
{27248}{27316}Why don't you run along,|you little cutie.
{27344}{27408}The other social workers|just thought she was a scream.
{27409}{27432}Thirsty?
{27481}{27569}Let me illuminate to you|the precarious situation
{27570}{27631}in which you have|found yourself.
{27632}{27755}I am the one they call|when things go wrong
{27756}{27869}and things have|indeed gone wrong.
{28263}{28329}My friends need to be punished.
{28422}{28496}Call me next time|you're left here alone.
{28497}{28547}Yep.
{28548}{28619}In case you're wondering,|this did not go well.
{28667}{28746}You have three days|to change my mind.
{28933}{28975}-Blah.|-Eww!
{28976}{29017}Lilo!
{29699}{29740}Why didn't you wait|at the school?
{29741}{29778}You were supposed|to wait there!
{29780}{29811}Lilo!
{29812}{29914}Do you not understand?|Do you want to be taken away?
{29915}{29946}Answer me!
{29947}{29970}No!
{29971}{30002}No, you don't understand?
{30003}{30027}No!
{30028}{30051}No, what?
{30052}{30090}No!
{30283}{30314}You're such a pain!
{30315}{30401}So why don't you sell me|and buy a rabbit instead?!
{30402}{30480}At least a rabbit would behave|better than you!
{30481}{30527}Go ahead!|Then you'll be happy
{30528}{30586}because it'll be smarter|than me, too!
{30586}{30622}And quieter!
{30623}{30682}You'll like it,|'cause it's stinky, like you!
{30714}{30761}Go to your room!
{30763}{30809}I'm already in my room!
{31188}{31219}Hey.
{31220}{31350}I brought you some pizza,|in case you were hungry.
{31350}{31429}We're a broken family,|aren't we?
{31430}{31469}No.
{31518}{31600}Maybe, a little.
{31603}{31649}Maybe a lot.
{31651}{31702}I shouldn't have yelled at you.
{31703}{31786}We're sisters. It's our job.
{31786}{31826}Yeah, well, from now on...
{31827}{31898}I like you better as a sister|than a mom.
{31899}{31965}Yeah?
{31966}{32009}And you like me better|as a sister
{32010}{32041}than a rabbit, right?
{32066}{32097}Oh...
{32098}{32138}Oh, oh, oh, oh.
{32170}{32209}Yes.
{32210}{32249}Yes, I do.
{32282}{32337}I hit Mertle Edmonds today.
{32338}{32369}You hit her?
{32370}{32414}Before I bit her.
{32415}{32451}You bit her.
{32452}{32489}Lilo, you shouldn't...
{32490}{32570}People treat me different.
{32571}{32627}They just don't know|what to say.
{32628}{32661}I'll tell you what.
{32662}{32732}If you promise|not to fight anymore
{32733}{32849}I promise not to yell at you,|except on special occasions.
{32850}{32922}Tuesdays and bank|holidays would be good.
{32923}{32954}Yeah? Would that be good?
{32987}{33058}Oh! My camera's full again.
{33059}{33123}Aren't they beautiful?
{33378}{33409}A falling star!
{33526}{33574}I call it! Get out! Get out!
{33575}{33613}I have to make a wish!
{33615}{33674}Can't you go any faster?
{33675}{33740}Oh, no!|Gravity is increasing on me.
{33741}{33769}No, it's not!
{33770}{33794}It is, too, Lilo.
{33794}{33833}The same thing|happened yesterday.
{33834}{33929}You rotten sister!|Your butt is crushing me!
{33930}{33973}Why do you act so weird?!
{34058}{34113}It's me again.
{34114}{34201}I need someone|to be my friend...
{34202}{34277}someone who won't run away.
{34278}{34345}Maybe send me an angel...
{34346}{34421}the nicest angel you have.
{35514}{35586}What we when hit?
{35643}{35675}There it is.
{35676}{35718}It stay jammed under the fender.
{35774}{35818}We better call somebody.
{36239}{36298}We're looking for something|that can defend itself...
{36299}{36346}something that won't die...
{36349}{36388}something sturdy, you know?
{36389}{36417}Like a lobster.
{36418}{36449}Lilo, you lolo.
{36450}{36489}Do we have a lobster door?
{36490}{36524}No. We have a dog door.
{36525}{36557}We are getting a dog.
{36697}{36774}So nice|to see your pretty face again!
{36775}{36806}Jumba?
{36807}{36869}We need your name and address|at the bottom of the form...
{36917}{36978}The kennel's back this way.
{36979}{37045}Go. Pick someone out.
{37091}{37140}Hello?
{37188}{37219}Hello?!
{37262}{37334}Are there any "aminals" in here?
{37508}{37545}Hello!
{37790}{37813}Hi.
{37814}{37861}Hoh... ha...
{37862}{37908}Hi...
{37941}{37974}Wow!
{37975}{38001}Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.
{38002}{38045}All of our dogs are adoptable.
{38046}{38089}Except that one!
{38090}{38137}What is that thing?!
{38138}{38169}A dog, I think.
{38170}{38206}But it was dead this morning.
{38207}{38241}It was dead this morning?!
{38243}{38313}Well, we thought it was dead.|It was hit by a truck.
{38314}{38373}I like him!|Come here, boy.
{38427}{38467}Oh! Aah!
{38498}{38542}Wouldn't you like|a different dog?
{38543}{38597}We have better dogs, dear.
{38598}{38637}Not better than him.
{38638}{38685}He can talk! Say hello.
{38686}{38717}He... Hel...
{38718}{38766}Dogs can't talk, dear.
{38767}{38793}He did.
{38795}{38861}Does it have to be this dog?
{38958}{38989}Yes, he's good.
{38990}{39019}I can tell.
{39020}{39067}You'll have to think of a name|for him.
{39068}{39143}His name is... Stitch.
{39144}{39181}Now, that's not a real name...
{39182}{39209}Hmm. Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.
{39210}{39289}...in Iceland...|but here, it's a good name.
{39290}{39325}Stitch it is.
{39326}{39367}And there's|a two dollar license fee.
{39370}{39398}I want to buy him!
{39399}{39464}Can I borrow two dollars?
{39598}{39645}He's all yours.
{39646}{39685}You're all mine.
{39686}{39743}Well, what's he doing?
{39744}{39780}Shh! Keep quiet.
{39781}{39819}He's listening for us.
{39866}{39925}How good is his hearing?
{39926}{39957}I mean, can he...
{40116}{40167}Why don't you run?
{40228}{40263}Coming! I'm coming!
{40264}{40296}Stop!
{40297}{40348}I have just determined|this situation
{40349}{40383}to be far too hazardous!
{40384}{40436}Don't worry,|I won't hit her.
{40437}{40531}No! That girl is a part|of the mosquito food chain.
{40532}{40610}Here! Educate yourself.
{40611}{40668}Using a little girl|for a shield.
{40669}{40716}This is low, even for you!
{40717}{40767}Whoo-hoo!
{40768}{40792}Bah!
{40793}{40861}Tear him apart|with all both my bare hands!
{40862}{40888}Have you lost your mind?!
{40889}{40922}What is it, Stitch?
{40923}{40977}We cannot be seen!
{41018}{41077}Bad dog, barking at nothing!
{41110}{41173}You can't shoot,|and you can't be seen.
{41174}{41201}Look at you!
{41202}{41265}You look like a monster.
{41266}{41298}We have to blend in.
{41303}{41362}Okay, I got to get to work.
{41362}{41422}Stick around town and stay|out of the roads, okay?
{41423}{41451}I'll meet you at 1:00.
{41452}{41495}Hmm?
{41496}{41519}Oh!
{41520}{41543}Ah!
{41666}{41738}Okay, I guess|we should be going.
{41780}{41828}What about Stitch?
{41986}{42015}My friends!
{42113}{42160}What do you want?
{42161}{42193}I'm sorry I bit you
{42194}{42230}and pulled your hair
{42230}{42280}and punched you in the face.
{42281}{42315}Apology not accepted.
{42316}{42388}Now get out of my way|before I run you over.
{42421}{42482}I got a new dog.|His name is Stitch.
{42483}{42571}That is the ugliest thing|I have ever saw.
{42572}{42625}-Yeah.|-Yeah.
{42626}{42659}Eww! Get it away from me!
{42660}{42693}I'm gonna get a disease!
{42815}{42858}Somebody do something!
{42859}{42892}Oh, great! He's loose.
{42893}{42959}His destructive programming|is taking effect.
{42960}{43026}He will be irresistibly|drawn to large cities
{43027}{43069}where he will back up sewers
{43070}{43149}reverse street signs and|steal everyone's left shoe.
{43589}{43664}It's nice to live on an island|with no large cities.
{43757}{43822}Are you okay?

{45634}{45681}# ...Uh-uh-uh... #
{45686}{45794}Yeah!
{46546}{46596}This is you.
{46597}{46680}This is your badness level.
{46682}{46771}It's unusually high|for someone your size.
{46772}{46814}We have to fix that.
{46815}{46848}Ay-yi-yi, Lilo!
{46849}{46895}Your dog cannot sit|at the table.
{46896}{46972}Stitch is troubled.|He needs desserts.
{46973}{47025}Oh, you didn't even eat|your sweet potato.
{47026}{47058}I thought you liked them.
{47059}{47089}Desserts!
{47193}{47239}David!
{47240}{47284}I got a new dog.
{47285}{47331}Oh! You sure it's a dog?
{47332}{47365}Uh-huh.
{47366}{47447}He used to be a collie|before he got ran over.
{47448}{47489}Yum!
{47529}{47564}Hey...
{47565}{47608}Blah!
{47726}{47757}Eww!
{47758}{47799}Howzit, Nani?
{47800}{47878}Did you catch fire again?
{47879}{47913}Nah, just the stage.
{47914}{47954}Listen, I was wondering
{47955}{48017}if you're not|doing anything this...
{48018}{48093}David, I told you, I can't. I...
{48134}{48182}I got a lot to deal with|right now.
{48182}{48252}I know. I just figured|you might need some time...
{48253}{48292}You smell like a lawn mower.
{48330}{48359}Look, I got to go.
{48362}{48434}The kid at table three's|throwing poi again.
{48435}{48483}Maybe some other time, okay?
{48484}{48515}Don't worry.
{48516}{48580}She likes your butt|and fancy hair.
{48581}{48628}I know. I read her diary.
{48629}{48668}She thinks it's fancy?
{48706}{48750}Blech!
{48941}{49004}Oh! Mmm!
{49005}{49051}Aha! Look what I find!
{49052}{49090}Get restraints!
{49091}{49125}Right.
{49126}{49180}Ow! Take that! Hurry!
{49181}{49243}Uh, hold still just a...
{49293}{49316}Aah!
{49590}{49651}Hey, Nani!
{49652}{49683}Is that your dog?
{49684}{49711}Uh...
{49712}{49764}All is well.
{49765}{49810}Please, go about your business.|I'm okay.
{49811}{49879}Oh, your head looks swollen.
{49880}{49927}Actually, she's just ugly.
{49928}{49981}Darling...
{49982}{50013}He's joking.
{50015}{50051}Ugly-- look at me...
{50052}{50100}Uh, this is not working out.
{50102}{50136}Uh, b-but...
{50137}{50164}Mm-mm.
{50165}{50218}Yeah?
{50219}{50280}Well, who wants to work|at this stupid...
{50281}{50332}fakey luau anyway.
{50333}{50381}Come on, Lilo.
{50476}{50570}Did you lose your job|because of Stitch and me?
{50571}{50624}Nah. The manager's a vampire
{50625}{50710}and he wanted me to join|his legion of the undead.
{50711}{50793}I knew it.
{50794}{50830}This is a great home.
{50831}{50868}You'll like it a lot.
{50902}{50924}See?
{50926}{50968}Uh, Lilo...
{50969}{50992}Comfy.
{51025}{51057}-Hey!|-Hey!
{51058}{51097}What is the matter with you?
{51098}{51143}Be careful of the little angel!
{51144}{51178}It's not an angel, Lilo.
{51179}{51221}I don't even think it's a dog.
{51222}{51265}We just have to take him back.
{51266}{51326}He's just cranky|because it's his bedtime.
{51327}{51361}He's creepy, Lilo.
{51362}{51425}I won't sleep|while he's loose in the house.
{51426}{51488}You're loose in the house|all the time
{51489}{51521}and I sleep just fine!
{51522}{51557}Hey, what are you doing?
{51558}{51602}Stop that, Stitch!
{51603}{51640}Hey!
{51704}{51728}Look at him, Lilo.
{51730}{51788}He's obviously mutated|from something else.
{51790}{51825}We have to take him back.
{51826}{51875}He was an orphan|and we adopted him!
{51876}{51924}What about "O'hana"?
{51925}{51969}He hasn't been here that long.
{51970}{52069}Neither have I.|Dad said O'hana means family.
{52129}{52161}Huh?
{52162}{52203}O'hana means family.
{52204}{52235}Family means...
{52236}{52283}...nobody gets left behind.
{52284}{52314}Or...?
{52316}{52348}Or forgotten.
{52349}{52380}I know. I know.
{52381}{52454}I hate it|when you use O'hana against me.
{52489}{52520}Mmm.
{52577}{52626}Don't worry, you can sleep|right next to me.
{52779}{52832}Look how curious the puppy is.
{52833}{52899}This is my room,|and this is your bed.
{52934}{52996}This is your dolly and bottle.
{52997}{53037}See? Doesn't spill.
{53038}{53088}I filled it with coffee.
{53089}{53149}Good puppy. Now get into bed.
{53190}{53214}Hey!
{53214}{53270}That's mine!
{53315}{53348}Down!
{53384}{53420}Mmm!
{53422}{53455}Be careful of that!
{53456}{53494}You don't touch this!
{53495}{53544}Don't ever touch it!
{53683}{53729}No! Don't pull on her head!
{53730}{53783}She's recovering from surgery.
{53827}{53905}No! That's from my blue period.
{54022}{54061}Mmm...
{54062}{54093}There.
{54094}{54158}You know, you wreck|everything you touch.
{54159}{54229}Why not try and make something|for a change?
{54600}{54638}Ah!
{54639}{54681}Wow. San Francisco.
{54922}{54960}Save me!
{55001}{55023}Eek!
{55071}{55128}No more caffeine for you.
{55186}{55248}This little girl is wasting|her time.
{55249}{55334}6-2-6 cannot be taught to ignore|its destructive programming.
{55384}{55415}Ooh!
{55416}{55472}Push that over.
{55505}{55536}What are you doing?
{55537}{55564}Nothing!
{55565}{55608}Uh, say, I want to try it on.
{55609}{55644}No!
{55645}{55675}Share! Let me try it!
{55676}{55745}Hey! Ow! You're justjealous|'cause I'm pretty!
{55746}{55777}Don't move.
{55778}{55857}A mosquito has chosen me|as her perch.
{55858}{55897}She's so beautiful.
{55930}{55962}Look, another one.
{55963}{56040}And another one!|Why, it's a whole flock.
{56041}{56073}And they like me!
{56074}{56156}They're nuzzling my flesh|with their noses.
{56157}{56221}Now they're, um, they're....
{56325}{56376}I think it might be a koala.
{56377}{56405}An evil koala.
{56406}{56437}I can't even pet it.
{56438}{56493}It keeps staring at me,|like it's going to eat me.
{56578}{56629}Hello?
{56630}{56677}Nani?
{56721}{56773}Hello?
{56774}{56841}Are you there?
{56914}{56962}Now, this is interesting.
{56962}{56986}What?
{56986}{57061}6-2-6 was designed|to be a monster
{57062}{57138}but now he has nothing|to destroy.
{57139}{57238}You see, I never gave him|a greater purpose.
{57239}{57344}What must it be like|to have nothing. . .
{57345}{57413}not even memories to visit
{57414}{57487}in the middle of the night?
{57678}{57708}Nah!
{57797}{57832}Hmm.
{57877}{57907}Hmm...
{58243}{58285}That's the Ugly Duckling.
{58286}{58357}See? He's sad|because he's all alone
{58358}{58400}and nobody wants him
{58401}{58473}but on this page,|his family hears him crying
{58474}{58509}and they find him.
{58510}{58562}Then the Ugly Duckling is happy
{58563}{58621}because he knows|where he belongs.
{58682}{58721}Hmm...
{58838}{58909}Want to listen to the King?
{58911}{58988}You look like an Elvis fan.
{59095}{59129}Nani.
{59130}{59165}Nani!
{59166}{59207}Uh... yeah?
{59208}{59252}Look.
{59355}{59447}# We can't go on together #
{59448}{59488}# With suspicious minds... #
{59513}{59536}# ...cious minds... #
{59569}{59627}# ...can build our dreams... #
{59652}{59682}# ...On suspicious minds... #
{59803}{59849}Heard you lost yourjob.
{59850}{59910}Well, uh, actually,|I just quit thatjob
{59911}{59971}because, you know,|the hours are just not conducive
{59972}{60019}to the challenges|of raising a child...
{60044}{60082}Hey!
{60107}{60150}I am so sorry about that.
{60152}{60186}What is that thing?
{60187}{60220}That's my puppy.
{60221}{60294}Really?
{60340}{60390}Thus far, you have been adrift
{60392}{60458}in the sheltered harbor|of my patience
{60459}{60524}but I cannot ignore|you beingjobless.
{60525}{60577}Do I make myself clear?
{60578}{60625}Perfectly.
{60626}{60663}And next time I see this dog
{60664}{60757}I expect it to be|a model citizen... capisce?
{60758}{60818}Uh... yes?
{60819}{60844}New job.
{60847}{60919}Model citizen.
{60952}{60983}Good day.

{61236}{61275}# ...Walk like an angel... #
{61276}{61321}I've compiled a list|of his traits
{61322}{61348}for you to practice.
{61351}{61392}Number one is dancing.
{61393}{61430}I can't talk now, dear.
{61431}{61492}I'm waiting for someone|to answer my ad.
{61495}{61527}That's why I'm here.
{61528}{61558}Hands on your hips.
{61559}{61606}Now follow my lead.
{61664}{61699}Ooh-hoo.

{61954}{61981}Whoa, whoa!
{62011}{62081}Why is everything so dark?
{62082}{62132}I am all about coffee.
{62133}{62163}Let's move on to step two.
{62164}{62197}# ...Walk like an angel... #
{62198}{62228}Elvis played guitar. Here.
{62229}{62258}# ...Talk like an angel... #

{63112}{63190}She looks like|she could use some lovin'.
{63191}{63284}# ...Talk like an angel,|but I got wise... #
{63285}{63328}Oh, we might have something.
{63329}{63370}Good. Now kiss her.
{63411}{63446}# ...The devil in disguise... #

{63524}{63547}I'm all about saving people?
{63548}{63584}# ...I thought|that I was in heaven... #
{63585}{63621}Actually, I do think|we have an opening.
{63622}{63645}Really?
{63646}{63669}Okay, this is it.
{63670}{63703}# ...But I was sure|surprised... #
{63704}{63733}Time to bring it all together.
{63734}{63765}Oh, that'd be so great!

{66006}{66100}but I know that there's|no better cure for a sour face
{66101}{66182}than a couple of boards|and some choice waves.
{66183}{66242}What you think?

{71367}{71402}Lilo!
{71427}{71455}What happened?
{71456}{71550}Oh... some lolo must have|stuffed us in the barrel.
{71551}{71585}Where's Stitch?
{71646}{71670}Get off of her!
{71702}{71738}What happened?
{71739}{71794}Stitch dragged her down.
{71975}{72022}We lost Stitch!
{72637}{72705}Lilo? Lilo, look at me.
{72706}{72745}Look at me, baby.|Are you hurt?
{72746}{72795}No.
{72888}{72979}He's unconscious,|but I think he's alive.
{73291}{73356}David, take Lilo.
{73357}{73406}This isn't what it looks like.
{73407}{73434}We were...
{73435}{73495}It-It's just that...
{73571}{73617}I know you're trying, Nani
{73618}{73710}but you need to think|about what's best for Lilo...
{73711}{73802}even if it removes you|from the picture.
{73891}{73993}I'll be back tomorrow morning|for Lilo.
{73994}{74041}I'm sorry.
{74163}{74286}Nani? Is there something|I can do?
{74287}{74317}No, David.
{74318}{74419}Uh, I need|to take Lilo home now.
{74420}{74505}We have a lot to talk about,|Lilo.
{74506}{74579}Thanks.
{74644}{74767}You know, I really believed|they had a chance.
{74768}{74859}Then you came along.
{75449}{75521}Lilo, honey...
{75522}{75616}we have to, uh...
{75655}{75686}Don't worry.
{75687}{75757}You're nice, and someone|will give you a job.
{75758}{75822}I would.
{75891}{75929}Come here.
{76079}{76194}# Aloha Oe #
{76195}{76317}# Aloha Oe #
{76318}{76540}# E ke onaona noho i ka lipo #

{77440}{77508}That's us before...
{77510}{77604}It was rainy,|and they went for a drive.
{77606}{77721}What happened to yours?
{77722}{77786}I hear you cry at night.
{77787}{77830}Do you dream about them?
{77905}{77960}I know that's|why you wreck things
{77961}{78009}and push me.
{78136}{78248}Our family's little now|and we don't have many toys
{78249}{78352}but if you want,|you could be part of it.
{78353}{78470}You could be our baby|and we'd raise you to be good.
{78558}{78604}"O'hana" means family.
{78605}{78725}"Family" means nobody gets|left behind
{78726}{78835}but if you want to leave,|you can.
{78968}{79073}I'll remember you, though.
{79074}{79159}I remember everyone that leaves.
{79850}{79909}L... L...
{79910}{79968}Lost.
{80142}{80215}I'm lost.
{80333}{80382}Help!
{80383}{80433}I don't like the ocean!
{80493}{80529}Oh, look,|a friendly little dolphin.
{80559}{80598}They helped sailors|in the war...
{80599}{80642}It's a shark!
{80643}{80684}It's a shark,|and it ain't friendly!
{80685}{80712}It looks like a dolphin.
{80713}{80739}Tricky fish! Tricky fish!
{80740}{80772}Oh, octopus, come and help me?
{80773}{80844}An octo... octopus is worse|than a shark!
{80845}{80884}I hate this planet!
{81013}{81061}Oh...
{81062}{81142}little monster!
{81290}{81353}Uh, Agent Pleakley here.
{81354}{81412}I have lost patience|with you both.
{81413}{81493}Have you captured 6-2-6 or not?
{81494}{81518}Um...
{81519}{81557}Uh-uh...
{81558}{81610}Consider yourselves fired|and prisonbound.
{81611}{81701}Your incompetence is nothing|short of unspeakable!
{81730}{81757}But, uh... mm...
{81798}{81858}We're fired!
{81859}{81918}Now we do it my way!
{81919}{81946}Your way?
{81973}{82011}Oh... uh, wait!
{82012}{82074}It seems I have overestimated|Jumber and Blinkley.
{82075}{82128}Uh, Jumba and Pleakley.
{82129}{82195}Whatever. The mission|is in jeopardy.
{82196}{82314}This could be your chance to|redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.
{82315}{82391}How soon will you be prepared|to leave?
{82392}{82463}Immediately.
{82809}{82832}Don't run.
{82833}{82877}Don't make me shoot you.
{82878}{82953}You were expensive.
{82954}{82997}Yes. Yes, that's it.
{82998}{83061}Come quietly.
{83062}{83105}Mm... waiting.
{83106}{83129}For what?
{83199}{83254}Family.
{83255}{83309}Ah!
{83310}{83358}You don't have one.
{83359}{83421}I made you.
{83422}{83502}Oh... maybe I could...
{83504}{83552}You're built to destroy.
{83553}{83660}You can never belong.
{83660}{83723}Now come quietly|and we will take you apart.
{83724}{83772}No, no, no, no,|don't, don't run!
{83773}{83800}Don't run!
{84173}{84200}Lilo.
{84225}{84269}I didn't hear you get up.
{84325}{84367}Baby, what's wrong?
{84368}{84409}Stitch left.
{84410}{84441}Really?
{84442}{84498}It's good he's gone.
{84499}{84580}He didn't want to be here,|anyway.
{84582}{84620}We don't need him.
{84698}{84748}Lilo...
{84750}{84818}sometimes you try your hardest
{84819}{84933}but things don't work out|the way you want them to.
{84934}{85005}Sometimes things have to change
{85006}{85107}and maybe sometimes|they're for the better...
{85109}{85144}even if...
{85181}{85254}Nani!
{85255}{85299}David!
{85300}{85336}I think I found you a job.
{85337}{85366}You what?!
{85367}{85430}Old man Kukhkini's store,|but we got to hurry.
{85431}{85499}Oh, um, okay. Lilo?
{85500}{85537}Baby, this is really important.
{85538}{85587}I need you to stay here|for a few minutes.
{85589}{85622}I'm going to be right back.
{85623}{85701}Lock the door and don't|answer it for anyone, okay?
{85735}{85814}Things are finally|turning around.
{85815}{85866}Aw, David, I owe you one.
{85867}{85904}That's okay.
{85905}{85967}You can just date me,|and we'll call it even.
{86112}{86163}Come back here, you little...!
{86244}{86283}Stitch?
{86284}{86311}What is it?
{86312}{86343}Shh!
{86379}{86433}Oh, hiding|behind your little friend
{86434}{86465}won't work anymore.
{86466}{86495}Didn't I tell you?
{86496}{86539}We got fired this morning.
{86570}{86621}New rules.
{86622}{86665}Ha!
{86666}{86689}Ooh.
{86719}{86758}Oh, ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!
{86795}{86845}# You ain't nothin'|but a hound dog... #
{86846}{86876}What are we going to do?
{86877}{86910}# ...Cryin' all the time... #
{86911}{86939}Ooh! I love this song!
{86940}{86964}Pliers.
{86989}{87012}Screwdriver.
{87013}{87038}Check.
{87039}{87062}Come out, my friend
{87063}{87097}from whomever|you're hiding behind.
{87100}{87145}# ...Well, you ain't never|caught a rabbit #
{87148}{87188}# And you ain't no friend|of mine... #
{87189}{87220}What the...?
{87221}{87273}Ooh!
{87316}{87340}Come on!
{87340}{87366}What's the big deal?
{87401}{87460}I'll put you|back together again.
{87460}{87527}I'll make you taller|and not so fluffy!
{87528}{87575}I like fluffy!
{87576}{87614}No... No...
{87615}{87654}No!
{87696}{87767}Oh, leave my mother|out of this!
{87801}{87851}You could do with a makeover.
{87852}{87909}I tried|to give you my good looks
{87910}{87979}but let's face it,|something went wrong.
{87980}{88007}No!
{88103}{88128}Quick! Follow me!
{88129}{88153}If we make it to...
{88156}{88177}You're alive!
{88180}{88207}They're all over the place!
{88239}{88286}Running away? Here...
{88287}{88323}let me stop you.
{88376}{88427}You always get|in the way!
{88428}{88452}Where's the girl?
{88452}{88486}What have you done|to the girl?
{88487}{88516}Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
{88517}{88574}Aliens are attacking my house.
{88575}{88640}No, no, no!|No aliens!
{88700}{88751}Blue punch buggy!
{88788}{88819}No punch back.
{88844}{88871}They want my dog!
{88872}{88914}There's no need|to alert the authorities.
{88915}{88943}Everything's under control.
{88944}{88991}Lilo, who was that?
{88992}{89041}Oh, good,|my dog found the chainsaw.
{89042}{89070}Lilo! Don't hang...!
{89257}{89297}Ha!
{89298}{89324}You shouldn't play with guns.
{89325}{89348}Oh, okay.
{89349}{89372}Thank you.
{89408}{89451}Oh, I just remembered.|It's your birthday!
{89452}{89475}Happy birthday!
{89476}{89499}Merry Christmas!
{89500}{89523}It's not Christmas.
{89524}{89547}Happy Hanukkah!
{89548}{89571}We're leaving Stitch?
{89572}{89595}Trust me.
{89596}{89628}This is not going to end well.
{89629}{89663}-One potato.|-Two potato.
{89664}{89699}-Three potato.|-Four.
{89700}{89735}-Five potato.|-Six potato.
{89737}{89768}Seven potato, more.
{89769}{89816}My... mother... told... me...
{89816}{89840}you... are... it.
{89840}{89872}Oh, I win!
{90055}{90094}Thanks. Mahalo plenty.
{90095}{90122}You won't be disappointed.
{90123}{90178}I'll show up early to help|with the morning deliver...
{90263}{90310}Oh, don't turn left.
{90376}{90410}No.
{90527}{90611}One of them had a giant eye|in the middle of his face.
{90612}{90648}Oh, Lilo!
{90699}{90751}Please don't do this.
{90752}{90805}You know I have no choice.
{90806}{90847}No! You're not taking her!
{90848}{90895}I'm the only one|who understands her!
{90896}{90944}You take that away,|she won't stand a chance!
{90944}{90994}You're making this harder|than it needs to be.
{90995}{91047}You don't know|what you're doing! She needs me!
{91048}{91099}Is this what she needs?!
{91100}{91176}It seems clear to me|that you need her
{91177}{91239}a lot more than she needs you.
{91334}{91400}Lilo! Lilo!
{91401}{91432}Lilo!
{91433}{91476}Lilo!
{91477}{91515}Lilo!
{91668}{91705}Lilo!
{91706}{91755}Lilo!
{91970}{92021}You ruined everything.
{92191}{92257}You're one of them?
{92282}{92307}Ooh!
{92308}{92348}Get out of here, Stitch.
{92427}{92474}Surprise!
{92508}{92584}And here I thought|you'd be difficult to catch.
{92585}{92663}Ho-ho-ho. Silly me.
{92664}{92688}Lilo?
{92720}{92771}Lilo!
{93042}{93112}There you go,|all buckled up for the trip.
{93147}{93207}And look-- I even caught you|a little snack.
{93361}{93428}No! Stop!
{93666}{93711}Lilo.
{93753}{93784}Aah!
{93785}{93816}Okay, talk.
{93817}{93861}I know you had something|to do with this.
{93862}{93893}Now where is Lilo?
{93894}{93961}Talk! I know you can.
{93998}{94057}Okay, okay.
{94128}{94195}Where's Lilo?
{94196}{94239}Lilo...
{94316}{94355}Now all your washing is up!
{94356}{94387}You're under arrest!
{94388}{94418}Read him his rights.
{94419}{94467}Listen carefully.
{94531}{94569}Hello? Galactic Command?
{94570}{94634}Experiment 6-2-6 is in custody.
{94635}{94683}We'll wait right here.
{94869}{94898}Huh?
{94899}{94971}Don't interact with her.
{95055}{95092}Where's Lilo?
{95093}{95116}Who?
{95117}{95144}What?!
{95197}{95268}Lilo... my sister.
{95315}{95384}Uh, sorry, we do not know
{95385}{95447}anyone by this, uh...
{95448}{95492}Lilo! She's a little girl--|this big!
{95493}{95534}She has black hair|and brown eyes
{95535}{95581}and she hangs around|with that thing!
{95582}{95613}Uh...
{95660}{95704}We know her.
{95705}{95767}Bring her back.
{95768}{95811}Oh, we can't do that. Uh-uh.
{95812}{95873}That would be a misuse|of Galactic resources.
{95876}{95969}See, problem is...|we're just here for him.
{95971}{96025}So she's gone?
{96026}{96059}Look at the bright side.
{96060}{96113}You won't have to yell|at anyone anymore.
{96338}{96379}Come.
{96624}{96655}O'hana.
{96656}{96680}Huh?
{96680}{96711}Hey! Get away from her.
{96713}{96768}No! What did you say?
{96769}{96866}O'hana means family.
{96867}{96913}Family means...
{96914}{96978}...nobody gets left behind.
{96979}{97023}Or forgotten.
{97024}{97056}Yeah.
{97110}{97151}Hey...
{97152}{97228}What?!|After all you put me through
{97229}{97304}you expect me to help you|just like that?!
{97305}{97347}Just like that?!
{97348}{97379}Ih.
{97380}{97419}Fine.
{97420}{97462}Fine?|You're doing what he says?
{97463}{97517}Uh, he's very persuasive.
{97518}{97603}Persuasive?!|What exactly are we doing?
{97604}{97630}Rescue.
{97631}{97664}We're going to get Lilo?
{97665}{97693}Ih.
{97748}{97823}Oh, good! I was hoping|to add theft, endangerment
{97824}{97896}and insanity to my list|of things I did today.
{97897}{97926}You, too?
{98067}{98108}Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
{98109}{98161}What? Did you think|we walked here?
{98200}{98277}This is Gantu, requesting|hyperspace clearance.
{98278}{98326}Stand by for clearance.
{99382}{99463}Clearance is granted|on vector C-12.
{99464}{99504}Connect me|to the Grand Councilwoman.
{99505}{99553}Gantu, what's going on?
{99554}{99586}I thought you'd like to know
{99587}{99631}that the little abomination|is... is...
{99751}{99797}Yes, Captain?
{99854}{99915}I'll call you back.
{100016}{100065}How did you get out of there?
{100151}{100201}So what exactly are we doing?
{100202}{100260}Don't worry,|is all part of plan.
{100262}{100299}We are professionals.
{100300}{100360}Hey! Get that out of your mouth!
{100535}{100591}Hold on!
{100803}{100869}Okay, is show time!
{101207}{101240}This is it!
{101378}{101422}Go! Go! Go!
{101707}{101771}Little savage!|Get off my ship!
{101884}{101920}Stitch!
{102235}{102323}Computer,|locate Experiment 6-2-6.
{102324}{102374}6-2-6 located.
{102375}{102431}We finish this now.
{102496}{102532}Stitch is unconscious.
{102533}{102563}What do we do now?
{102564}{102587}We stay close.
{102588}{102619}Hope for a miracle.
{102620}{102659}That's all we can do.
{102928}{102959}No!
{103003}{103048}Don't leave me, okay?
{103049}{103078}Okay.
{103137}{103184}Okay.
{103281}{103334}Okay.
{103509}{103554}Target 6-2-6 is in motion.
{103555}{103586}Speed is 84.
{103587}{103637}Impossible!
{104248}{104277}Stitch!
{104278}{104303}Hmm?
{104336}{104373}Abomination.
{104374}{104406}Stupidhead.
{104531}{104571}Yee-haw!
{104630}{104652}Aloha!
{104688}{104745}You're vile! You're foul!|You're flawed!
{104747}{104810}Also cute and fluffy!
{105115}{105155}You came back.
{105156}{105211}Nobody gets left behind.
{105417}{105443}Lilo!
{105588}{105631}Good dog.
{106001}{106043}Auwe!
{106044}{106094}David!
{106095}{106121}Hey, Lilo.
{106122}{106175}Can you give us a ride|to shore?
{106176}{106203}Uh...
{106237}{106271}Sure!
{106272}{106339}But I have to make two trips.
{106354}{106406}So you're from outer space, huh?
{106407}{106443}I heard the surfing's choice.
{106444}{106499}We have 6-2-6.
{106500}{106543}Take him to my ship.
{106544}{106575}Leave him alone.
{106576}{106599}Hold on.
{106600}{106647}Grand Councilwoman,|let me explain.
{106648}{106679}Silence!
{106680}{106778}I am retiring you,|Captain Gantu.
{106779}{106848}Actually, credit for the capture|goes to...
{106848}{106878}Goes to me.
{106880}{106943}You'll be lucky if you end up|on a Fluff Trog farm
{106944}{106989}after we sort this thing out.
{106990}{107021}Uh...
{107022}{107051}I think I should...
{107052}{107075}You!
{107076}{107105}You're the cause of all this!
{107106}{107146}If it wasn't|for your Experiment 6-2-6
{107147}{107170}none of this...
{107171}{107218}Stitch.
{107219}{107251}What?
{107252}{107295}My name Stitch.
{107296}{107327}Stitch, then.
{107328}{107403}If it wasn't for Stitch....
{107435}{107491}Does Stitch have to go|in the ship?
{107492}{107559}Yes.
{107560}{107607}Can Stitch say good-bye?
{107638}{107672}Yes.
{107673}{107721}Thank you.
{107820}{107887}Who are you?
{107925}{107985}This is my family.
{107986}{108076}I found it all on my own.
{108079}{108162}It's little and broken...
{108164}{108210}but still good.
{108211}{108275}Yeah. Still good.
{108510}{108546}Does he really have to go?
{108579}{108672}You know as well as I|that our laws are absolute.
{108672}{108758}I cannot change|what the Council has decided.
{108759}{108859}Lilo, didn't you buy|that thing at the shelter?
{108951}{108980}Hey!
{109020}{109099}Three days ago,|I bought Stitch at the shelter.
{109100}{109146}I paid two dollars for him.
{109147}{109192}See this stamp? I own him.
{109193}{109283}If you take him,|you're stealing.
{109321}{109396}Aliens are all about rules.
{109398}{109456}You look familiar.
{109457}{109560}CIA. Roswell. 1973.
{109561}{109630}Ah, yes. You had hair then.
{109631}{109689}Take note of this.
{109690}{109799}This creature has been sentenced|to life in exile
{109800}{109922}a sentence that shall be|henceforth served out here...
{109923}{110033}on Earth...
{110034}{110128}and as caretaker|of the alien life-form, Stitch
{110129}{110229}this family is now|under the official protection
{110230}{110300}of the United Galactic|Federation.
{110300}{110372}We'll be checking in|now and then.
{110373}{110438}I was afraid|you were going to say that.
{110439}{110525}This won't be easy to explain|back at headquarters.
{110526}{110610}I know what you mean.
{110686}{110754}Don't let those two|get on my ship.
{110985}{111022}CIA?
{111024}{111047}Former.
{111048}{111097}Saved the planet once.
{111098}{111151}Convinced an alien race|that mosquitoes
{111152}{111191}were an endangered species.
{111192}{111251}Now, about your house...
{111320}{111364}Wait.
