My name is Alice.
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security...
...at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
But there was an incident.
The virus escaped and everybody died.
Trouble was...
...they didn't stay dead.
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.
But I survived.
Myself and one other...
...an environmentalist named Matt.
When we emerged, we were seized by Umbrella scientists.
Matt and I were separated.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...
...and assemble the team.
We're reopening The Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
We thought we'd survived the horror.
But we were wrong.
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.
It's 6:10 in the a.m. And already the temperature has reached...
...a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues.
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a light breeze coming in from the west.
And as a special bonus just for you, we have a pollen count of 0. 7.
That's a record low for this time of year.
Good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers.
All in all, it looks like it's gonna be another beautiful day.
Stay with us. After the break...
...we're gonna look at your favorite holiday hot spots.
Advance team, proceed.
Sir.
Holy shit.
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.
How bad is it?
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?
You don't understand.
She's left for school.
This is U-Gamma 7, evacuation complete...
...but we just lost contact with Gamma 12.
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup at city hall.
Still no explanation for this wave of unexplained killings...
...that is sweeping across the city.
A deadly crime spree with no end.
Backup, we need backup now!
Just like Valentine told us...
Off-duty law enforcement personnel, report for duty immediately.
Give us a hand over here, this guy's insane!
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.
- Valentine!
- They're infected.
Somebody get this ugly bitch off of me!
I told you. Shoot for the head.
Please, somebody get her.
No! Don't shoot! Don't...
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.
Everyone's leaving the city.
We've received reports of Umbrella Corporation...
...dispatching armed guards and troop carriers.
Move in an orderly fashion to security checkpoints.
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.
The only way out is this bridge.
All citizens must pass through medical scanning.
Sir! You better take a look at this.
Family members must pass through security checkpoints together.
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!
No pushing, please. Keep in line.
Can we get some reinforcements down here?
Chopper Delta, new orders.
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.
Reinforcements urgently needed.
Copy that, base. On our way.
Get it.
No! Get off!
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!
No! Get back!
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.
I can't. We have our orders.
No! Get back! No!
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!
She's a civilian. We have orders.
Fuck orders!
Nicholai, tie me off.
Get back! No!
Wait!
Now!
Take us down! Down, now!
Hey. Hey, you okay?
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.
I've seen what happens to you once you've been bitten.
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.
No!
Move! Peyton!
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!
Everybody, stand back!
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!
Get back!
It's here. It's reached the gate.
Why are you here? You should've got out while you had the chance.
These are our people, Jill.
- Close them.
- Sir?
Seal the gates.
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.
Oh, my God, they're closing the gates!
This is a biohazard quarantine area.
Due to risk of infection, you cannot be allowed to leave the city.
What the fuck is going on here?
All appropriate measures are being taken.
The situation is under control.
Please return to your homes.
You won't get away with this!
Let us out!
You have five seconds to turn around...
...and return to the city.
Do it.
Use of live ammunition has been authorized.
Five.
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.
Three.
- Get them back!
- Two.
- Move!
- One.
Everybody, clear out!
Kilo and Romeo squads, rendezvous at sector 01...
...and secure against enemy.
- Grenade!
- Grenade!
Squads three to seven are on full retreat.
No, sir. Suppression measures have failed. We can't contain it.
The infection is spreading faster than anyone anticipated.
Dr. Ashford.
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.
I was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone.
You're too important to Umbrella to be at risk.
I'm not leaving without my daughter.
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.
She may have survived the crash, but we couldn't find her anywhere.
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.
You do what you have to do.
I'm staying.
There has to be someone left alive.
Come on.
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.
Prepare her for exposure.
Up the dosage.
Just do it.
Inside.
Inside.
Let's get under cover.
You have to get out.
This is my place. I'm hiding here.
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
And, you, take it easy.
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...
...have any comment on what those things are?
What's that you got there?
My Emmy.
That's if any of us make it out.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
It's my sister. She's not well.
- Maybe I can help.
- No.
Out of my way.
Just get out.
You're feeding her? You're sick.
Just leave us alone.
No!
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.
Hey! Hey, no!
Oh, my God!
Hey, help us! Come on!
Get it in there!
What the hell was that?
There!
Jesus.
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?
Get back here.
Peyton.
Terri.
Peyton.
I know.
I count three of them.
They got us boxed in.
What are we gonna do?
Let's go.
Jesus.
We're gonna need more ammo. I'm out.
Shit. I'm out.
Move.
Who the fuck are you?
GTA, motherfucker!
Oh, yeah!
Ten points!
Yuri. You okay?
Bite this.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Pull back!
This way.
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.
We need to find somewhere to stop for a moment.
I don't think that's a good idea.
There might be more of those...
...things.
If there were more, we'd have seen them by now.
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...
...from Umbrella labs beneath the city.
How come you know so much about Umbrella?
I used to work for them.
Damn it.
Hold it.
What do you think you're doing?
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.
I'm fine.
You should take care of him now.
It'll be more difficult later.
You know that.
No.
If it comes to that...
...I'll take care of it myself.
As you wish.
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...
...you'll be dead.
And moments later, you'll become one of them.
You'll endanger your friends, try to kill them...
...probably succeed.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
Help me!
There's too many of them.
Let's get out of here.
This way!
Sir, T-virus infection has reached critical levels.
This is a perfect opportunity.
Ensure all data streams are recorded.
Activate Nemesis Program now.
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.
No. No! Don't leave!
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.
Maybe a radio. One that works.
Take Yuri.
Hold on, Yuri.
Nicholai, put me down.
Okay, rest here.
What is this?
Looks like weapon cases.
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!
These weren't meant for us.
Yuri!
Plenty to go around.
Don't shoot!
I got the power.
Thank you! Owe you one, man.
Shit!
Maybe I was safer outside.
Get them guns out of my damn face.
Motherfucker, please. Look...
...my shit is custom.
What the fuck is that?
Shit!
You're going down, you son of a bitch!
Fuck.
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy, got a rocket launcher.
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.
Fire!
Back! Fall back!
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.
S.T.A.R.S.
Oh, shit.
Respect.
Those were some pretty slick moves back there.
I'm good...
...but I'm not that good.
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?
They did something to me.
I barely feel human anymore.
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.
Keep moving.
- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.
All four of you.
But first we have to come to an arrangement.
Are you ready to make a deal?
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...
Runs the genetics and viral research division of Umbrella Corporation.
What's he want with us?
His daughter, Angela, is trapped in the city.
Umbrella was to evac her, but she didn't make it.
She's hiding out in her school.
We find her, he'll help us escape the perimeter.
No fucking deal.
We find the building with the thickest walls and doors...
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.
There won't be any help.
Umbrella knows they can't contain the infection.
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.
What do you mean by "sanitized"?
A precision tactical nuclear device.
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...
...and all evidence of it.
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!
No fucking way would they get away with that!
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.
Cover-up's already prepared.
A meltdown at the nuclear power plant.
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.
Not capable?
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.
So, what do we do now, huh?
I think we should be out of here by sunrise.
What if there is no way out and he's watching us on these cameras...
What if there is no way out and he's watching us on these cameras...
...like this is some kind of sick game?
- What is it?
- What's going on?
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.
No.
- There's something down there.
- Where?
There.
I don't see anything.
That doesn't alter the fact that there is something down there.
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!
Peyton!
No!
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. Members.
Nemesis.
Run. Just go!
Primary target is identified.
Gentlemen, this is what we've been waiting for.
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.
The Nemesis Program is now fully activated.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.
Let's just get to the school and find this kid.
This bite...
...it won't stop bleeding.
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?
The chopper. We were right there in the street in front of the hospital.
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.
What do you mean?
We're assets, Nicholai.
Expendable assets.
And we've just been expended.
Stop!
I'm not one of those things.
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't been bitten or anything. Look.
Climb aboard.
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.
You can call me L.J. on account of the informal situation.
We're gonna have to split up to search this place.
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going out there by myself.
I can go with you.
You, take the first floor.
You, take the second.
I'll take the basement.
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.
Try to hit them in the head.
I see you, mother...
Oh, shit!
So did you get the call as well?
- What?
- You're here for the girl?
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal with someone else.
I guess we're partners.
Shit.
Angela?
It's gonna be okay.
There's no need to be afraid.
We're gonna take you home.
Oh, my God.
Help me!
Terri?
You can't help her.
Not now.
I've seen what they do.
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.
We should hurry before they come back.
Hold this.
Angela Ashford, huh?
That's a pretty grown-up name for a little girl.
I'm not a little girl.
Besides...
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?
I like that.
Those things are in here.
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.
No.
Not them.
Them.
Get back.
Stay.
Thought you might need a hand.
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev, at your service.
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.
Oh, shit.
From now on, stay right beside me.
It's blocked.
What do we do now?
Wait here. Eyes:
Okay?
Thank you.
You two know each other?
She's infected.
She's infected on a massive level.
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.
You're infected? When were you gonna tell us that?
- Let me see.
- No.
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.
Let me see.
It's the antivirus, the cure to the T-virus.
There's a cure?
How did you get this?
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.
He just wanted to stop that.
When I was little...
...I had to walk on crutches.
They said I'd never get better, just worse.
He found a way to make me stronger.
The T-virus.
Then they took the invention away from him.
Get out of my house!
He's not a bad man.
He didn't mean for any of this.
It's okay.
Don't shoot! He's cool.
He made a deal with Dr. Doom, same as you.
How many of you guys are there?
What do you mean?
Nicholai.
When were you bitten?
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?
It's your lucky day.
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.
There's a helicopter already being prepped.
It takes off in 47 minutes.
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.
I take it this helicopter isn't laid out just for us.
No. It has another purpose, but it'll be lightly guarded.
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?
Soon. These people will bring you to see me.
I'll see you very soon.
Put the lady back on.
Where do we have to go?
The helicopter will be at city hall.
I suggest you make haste.
Computers...
...so unreliable.
Just like people.
You really thought I didn't know?
So, what are you injecting me with?
The antivirus.
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.
Basically, bringing the dead to life.
Or in a living human, it can cause uncontrollable mutation.
Or it can help her walk again, if the virus is kept in check with this.
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.
The cellular growth is enough to regenerate her...
...but not enough to cause mutation.
And they infected you with the T-virus as well?
Yeah.
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
Here.
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.
My name is Alice.
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
Let's go.
You missed one.
We have to hurry.
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?
We've been expecting you.
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.
- Angie!
- Daddy!
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.
Discard primary weaponry.
The two of you showed such promise, but we had to see you in action.
And most impressive you've been.
You're like brother and sister.
Heightened speed, strength, agility, the same killer instincts.
Parallel strands of research.
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.
Fight him.
No.
Fight him, or they die.
What makes you think I care?
Daddy! Daddy, no.
No.
He was a valuable asset to the corporation.
I don't even care about these people.
Begin.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Cellular structure breaking down.
T-virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation.
We're seeing similar cellular regeneration.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.
Finish him.
I said, finish him.
No.
No.
Don't you understand how important you are to me?
That creature is one thing, but you...
...somehow you bonded with the T-virus on a cellular level.
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.
- I became a freak.
- No.
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.
With my help, just imagine what you can achieve.
What about him?
Evolution has its dead ends.
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...
...and come with me.
No.
You're such a disappointment to me.
All that strength...
...but no will to use it.
What a waste.
Prepare for takeoff.
Sanitation of Raccoon City to commence on my mark.
Kill her.
What are you doing?
Get us airborne.
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.
Detonation set at T-minus 5 minutes.
Angie, get down!
Why haven't we taken off?
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.
Surrender, or we open fire.
Drop it.
Alice!
Drop your weapon and surrender.
Let's get this thing in the air!
You have to get up.
Matt...
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.
Come on.
Get up!
If you expect me to beg, I will not.
Wait.
Killing me won't put things right.
No...
...but it's a start.
Are you going to be all right?
Hang on to something!
We're going down!
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.
We've located the crash site.
Fetch the medical team.
What about the others?
No other bodies found, sir.
We have unconfirmed reports of disaster at Raccoon City.
These shocking images just in.
A mysterious plague or viral outbreak has run rampant...
Implicating Umbrella Corporation in deaths of innocent citizens.
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7 anchorwoman Terri Morales.
New evidence now discredits earlier reports...
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.
Nothing more than a big hoax.
Playing on the very real tragedy...
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.
The reactor at the nuclear power station went critical.
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.
The state governor personally thanked the Umbrella Corporation...
...for their swift action.
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...
...now being sought for questioning by the police.
Alice.
Alice, wake up.
Can you hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good.
Begin the purging process.
Her recovery's remarkable.
And her powers, both physical and mental...
...are developing at a geometric rate.
Where are you?
You're safe.
Come on.
That's it.
There we are.
Do you know what that is?
It's a pen.
You see?
You try.
That's it.
Pen.
Look at me.
Can you remember anything?
You remember your name?
My name?
My name.
I want her under
24-hour observation.
A complete set of blood work.
Chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day.
My name.
- My name.
- Sir.
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.
My name.
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.
Sir!
What is it?
My name...
...is Alice.
And I remember everything.
This is central.
Request immediate backup.
Maximum response.
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.
Sorry, sir.
Let them go.
Good to have you back.
Are you all right?
Program Alice activated.
What did they do to you?
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.
Our business is life itself.
Some side effects may occur.
You're late!
Can't get her to go to college with you, but you have to pack her shit.
That’s just pathetic.
He's a big dinosaur now, mom.
Pathetic is that you're not even going out with her anymore... and you still have to pack her shit.
You'll always have a room here.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye!
Don't get too busy to give us a call once in a while.
Bye!
That’s why you're not dating her anymore.
I forgot something.
- Bye.
- Love you.
Shut up!
- Hello? Where do I sit?
- Right here, babe.
- So where's the party tonight?
- Genius!
- I'm the one going to Harvard.
- So did the Unabomber.
Oh, my God!
We should at least try to meet people.
Why?
Good question.
She thinks she's hot.
She's not so hot.
She really isn't.
Thanks.
This is our last night together. Do you think we can do something else?
- I could probably think of something.
- Yeah?
I am definitely not cut out for the Greek life.
You'll be all right.
You'll join the swim team, you'll meet people.
Plus you've got Annie, your best friend, right here with you.
My best friend will be 2 thousand miles away, in California.
What are you thinking?
I'm picking it up.
Wait! I got it. You're thinking...
I'm thinking... I'm thinking...
I'm thinking my ass is getting wet!
I knew it was something about your ass.
I'm going to miss you.
I love being with you.
I miss you already.
Close your eyes.
If you ever want me... just come to this spot... and I'll be here.
One last kiss before they say good-bye.
- I think I'll puke.
- After that, can we go somewhere?
- I want to have some real fun!
- I'm ready for that.
- Let’s go to the club I heard about.
- What club?
I don't know. It’s out of town.
It’s kind of a moving party.
But I can't move.
Try not to act like a college boy because they're not allowed.
Come on, you guys, let’s do this thing. Come on!
Isn't this great?
I just can't control her anymore.
Look out!
Come on, let’s dance!
I want that blonde tonight.
Look at those ravers.
Come on, let’s go!
Come on, it’s time.
We're doing it!
Get off!
Annie, come on!
There is no light
- This is a church.
- One more minute...
All of a sudden, I feel that we are making a mistake saying good-bye.
Cassie, you know how I feel.
I don't care how young we are.
You're the one I want to be with, that’s it.
I feel that way too.
So we're lucky.
Most people never find that.
We have our whole lives ahead of us.
Right?
I can wait.
I know what I want.
I love you, Cass.
You've never said that to me before.
No one's ever said that to me before.
That makes two of us.
How do you feel?
You know.
Is there some reason you can't say it?
Like what?
Like maybe you're still thinking about Matt?
No.
No, it’s just...
I don't want to say it and then... have you leave me tomorrow.
- Okay.
- But I feel it.
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
I...
- What are you doing out here, man?
- Drinking.
I was going to go get Annabel, but now I think I'm going to...
Right.
All right. I'll get her.
It’s freezing out here.
Can you unlock it?
Here. Warm it up.
You're driving.
The darkness is here!
Harvard laid our serious financial aid for the brain cells you're trashing.
They're still my brain cells.
They don't know me yet.
Besides, I lied.
I'm not really drunk.
I'll miss you.
Sorry.
It’s not very fair, is it?
You know, Matt...
...I care for you, but then...
- Please.
Not the "I care for you, but..." speech.
I got that last summer, remember?
Yeah.
- I guess I'm just a bad loser.
- It’s not a competition.
Right.
Right.
Well, I'll settle for nothing less than friends for life.
- Deal.
- And one last kiss.
I'm sorry. I won't end the most meaningful relationship of my life... with a lousy handshake.
I'm not a business man.
All right, forget it.
I'm sorry I asked.
You know, sometimes you can be a real shit.
2O years from now, when you and Sean are married... and you're a mom with your rug rat children in your suburban home... do you think it will really matter whether we shook hands or kissed... the night we said good-bye?
One last good-bye forever, my former love.
A kiss.
And it 's in the past...
What a cold rain!
Sean!
- Where did you guys go?
- Nowhere.
- Sean, it 's not what you're thinking.
- Really? What am I thinking?
Matt just...
We were just talking, and he...
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, yeah. You?
Sean, don't walk away from me, please!
Sean?
Look, it was nothing!
I'm sorry!
If it was nothing, why are you sorry?
Sean, please, talk to me.
Hello? What 's the drama?
Yeah, Cass, tell Annabel what the drama is.
Come on, it 's freezing back here.
Come on.
Let’s go! It 's freezing!
I know what it looked like, but believe me, it 's not what you think!
Cassie, watch the road.
Will you talk to me?
Oh, my God! Cassie!
Cassie, break!
Can you hear me? Hello?
Anybody in there, can you hear me?
How much did you have to drink tonight?
Watch it now.
The loss of a young life is a most terrible thing.
...our beloved Sean will...
...for we have loved...
Matt 's taking me back to school.
Why don't you come with us?
I'm not sure I'm going back.
All right, class, remember.
This coming midterm, we'll...
Are you still thinking about Matt?
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
Cassandra?
Cassandra?
This test is critical.
Hey, excuse me.
I wasn't here last week.
Do you have a study guide?
Sorry.
How much did you have to drink tonight?
If you ever want me, just come right here to this spot...
Just come to this spot, and I'll be here.
Hello.
Maybe tonight you should tell me how you feel.
I love you, Cassie.
Cassie!
I've been out there pounding!
It took me 5 minutes to try the door.
Hello?
You look like shit.
- What have they got you on?
- It 's for headaches.
Zombie food!
Lovely, lovely.
You're not going like that, are you?
Going where?
To the club! Don't you remember?
God, Cass! We've got to get you ready, girl!
I have to study.
I have a midterm.
Everybody has a midterm.
Cass...
You remember when my mom died?
And went into, like... this black hole and...
If it wasn't for you...
You've got to get out of here, girl!
Join the living!
This is my friend, Raven.
Hello.
- Hi.
- I've got to pee.
Who's this?
He was my boyfriend.
He died three weeks ago.
He's here now... Sean.
Inside you and Matt... in the car that night...
He's afraid.
You're in trouble!
So, are you coming?
- No.
- Cass?
- Just go, okay?
- You wanted to meet people!
I'll call you later.
Don't run, baby!
You're mine, baby!
Cassie!
Hold on, Cassie!
Cassie!
Hey.
Welcome back to the world.
What happened?
You fainted.
Some priest brought you here.
He was walking around outside like somebody died. Scared me.
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. It sucks, but... somebody's got to do it.
Not me.
What about Harvard?
It will be there when I get back.
The doctor said you can go... but they want you to come back to do some tests... to make sure it has nothing to do with your injury from the accident.
- Is there something wrong?
- They're just covering their asses.
You know doctors.
They love tests.
Well, I hate tests.
I borrowed your keys and I did a little shopping.
That 's incredible!
You're so sweet.
- And there.
- Thank you so much.
I talked to Annie.
She said you're not doing so well.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- He shouldn't have died that night.
It 's not your fault.
Yeah... I think that it was our fault.
Because if it wasn't for us then
Sean and I wouldn't have fought... and I wouldn't have lost control of the car!
Those guys we hit were trashed.
They did a18O right in front of us.
There's no way you could've stopped.
There's no way anyone could've stopped.
Matt, it 's not that I miss him.
I saw him!
You saw him?
- Tell me exactly what happened.
- I was running... and someone put their hand on my shoulder... and they turned me around, they said my name...
- It was him.
- Why were you running?
Do you remember that guy from the club that night?
The one that grabbed me when me and Annie were dancing?
- Yeah, you shoved him.
- He's here, he's on campus!
No, he's not, Cassie.
Sean isn't either.
You know that, don't you?
You could've died that night too!
- But I didn't, did I?
- No, and you feel guilty about that.
- What about school?
- I'm not going anywhere.
But Harvard is, like, your life, you know... that 's all that matters to you, it always has been.
You're all that matters now.
Shit!
Hello? What's the drama?
Cassie, watch the road.
- It's included.
- What's the cranial pulse?
Well, Cassandra... the tests indicate you have a hemorrhage.
We're going to relieve the pressure on the right part of your brain.
I want you to breathe normally... and count back from 1OO.
Feeling better?
You're the one that saved me.
You're the priest?
I try not to wear my collar when I'm around here.
I do volunteer counseling once a week.
My name is Jude.
- Cassie.
- Hi.
I've got a minute before my next appointment. You want to sit down?
Sure.
So...
Do I call you "father"?
I'm sort of a lapsed Catholic.
I think all Catholics lapse once in a while.
Probably especially during midterms.
Yeah...
I've sort of been having a rough time, actually.
I lost my boyfriend recently.
Can I ask what happened?
Car accident.
I was driving.
It was really sudden, and there was something that I wanted to tell him.
But I never got the chance.
It 's... difficult to be a survivor.
But you've got to remember... that it 's up to God who lives and who dies.
I know it sounds crazy, but... sometimes I feel like he's still here with me.
I mean, really here.
Like he's not gone yet.
Maybe he is still with you.
Oh, that 's my friend.
I've got to go.
Well, feel free to come by anytime.
You're going to be okay.
- All right.
- Bye!
Hey!
- Didn't mean to interrupt confession.
- You didn't.
Come here,
I want to show you something.
Come on, come on.
Alright. You can kick all their asses at the free style.
Matt...
I just want to see you in a bathing suit again.
Come on, I've got another idea.
It was about time!
We saved you a roller.
I'm a brush chick.
Here.
There's more paint on my shirt than you have on your walls!
Here.
Oh, my gosh.
- So how's Raven?
- Interesting.
- Talks about you a lot.
- He does?
Raven thinks you're not really here with us.
He says you're still kind of with Sean.
Maybe I am a little.
Do you feel that way too?
You know how I feel more than anything?
That I'm finally free. We're on our own for the first time, Cass.
We can do anything, no boundaries.
Don't you feel that way?
I wish I did.
Don't worry.
We'll get you there, Cass.
Cassie?
Cassie, what is it?
Cassie, it 's okay!
What happened?
It 's okay!
It 's nothing, sweetie.
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- We're going out, right?
Because I feel like dancing.
- We said we'd stay in tonight.
- Yeah, well, now...
I want to go out.
Fine. I'll see you guys later.
Matt, let her go.
I want to sleep.
Why are you doing this?
Is everything okay?
Hey, there.
I miss you. I'm sorry.
- It 's okay. Just hang in there.
- I want you.
Make love to me!
Matt?
Hey.
What 's wrong? You don't look so good. I'm going to get your pills.
- We didn't... Tell me we didn't...
- What?
Tell me we didn't sleep together last night.
You don't remember?
No.
- What happened?
- You said you missed me, that you...
What?
Annie?
Hi.
- Okay, I get it.
- No, Annie, it 's not what you think!
Stop it, Cass!
I'm quicker than that.
Not as quick as you, though.
- Annie, let me just...
- Let me talk to her.
Sudden, don't you think?
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It 's not what you think...
I can't even believe you.
Get away from me.
Hi.
Cassie?
Listen to me. I can't talk to you if you're afraid.
If you want me to leave you alone,
I will. I'm not going to haunt you.
This can't be happening!
You came here... because I said that I would be here.
So here I am.
It 's okay.
It 's really you.
I miss you.
It 's okay.
Come on.
I must really be crazy.
You're not crazy.
I'm here.
Don't let go, don't let go.
Come with me.
Where?
Away from here.
The guys are going to keep tracing you.
Cassie?
I want you with me!
Do you love me?
I don't want to die!
If you stay here, you're going to die.
Cassie.
Cassie!
I've been looking all over for you.
Cassie, let me explain.
Look, you called out, you said you missed me... and that you wanted me to be there.
You said, "Make love to me".
I thought you had feelings for me again.
I'm so sorry, Cassie.
I was wrong.
Tell me how I can make it up for you. I'll do anything.
I just need to be alone for a while.
Cassie?
I just need some time.
Annie!
- What 's wrong?
- This guy was...
This guy was chasing me.
He was trying to...
- Who was chasing you?
- I don't know.
I think it was one of those weird guys from the club.
He had a scar on his face, and he had long hair...
- Oh, God, I was so scared.
- All right, you're in a safe place.
You don't believe me!
I'm worried about you, Cassie.
I think you should talk to someone.
You think I'm crazy?
I am not crazy! Everyone else is!
Nobody is chasing you, Cass.
I saw what I saw.
Why don't you believe me?
I believe you believe it.
But I also think you haven't accepted what 's happened yet.
So it 's like it 's still happening to you in your head.
I want to help.
I love you.
- Matt, I don't...
- No, it 's okay.
You don't have to love me back.
Just let me take care of you.
I'm going to go get your medicine.
Hi, mom, it 's me. Can you call me as soon as you can? I need to talk.
How did you get in here?
I copied your key while you were in the hospital. Here.
You need to get some rest.
There were two girls in the locker room. They didn't see anybody.
Do you always get here before everyone else?
No, I'm trying to get my time down.
I have first meets Thursday.
You had a pretty serious head injury in that car accident, didn't you?
Dr. Haverston?
Excuse me.
Hi. Why wasn't my grade posted with the others?
There is no grade for this kind of test.
- Wait!
- Cassie.
Cassie?
Cassie?
Come in, come in.
Sit down.
Let 's see now...
What 's wrong?
Everything.
Everything's wrong.
I don't know what 's happening to me.
You feel alone in a world that you don't understand.
You don't know who to trust.
But you're trying very hard, I know that.
How do you know?
Because you're not the first person to be here.
And I promise you, that whatever happens, you'll find your way.
You just have to be strong.
I don't want to be strong.
I'm so tired.
Lie back, Cassie.
Try and rest.
I want you to have something.
This is Saint Jude... one of those guys that they made you learn about in Sunday school.
He looked after people that were lost... and that 's who my father named me after.
I'm so tired.
Rest.
Thank you.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Jude.
- Who?
- A priest.
I don't know his full name. Jude?
- Father Jude?
- Yeah, do you know where he is?
Sit down.
- I really can't stay.
- Are you a member of the church?
No, I met Jude when
I started school this fall.
Is there something wrong?
I can't stay.
I really need to find him.
- What 's your name?
- Cassie.
Well, Cassie, perhaps there's been some confusion, but...
Father Jude was head of the church here until he passed away in 1981.
I don't understand.
Well, I don't either.
It must be a different priest.
I need to find him. I'm in trouble.
Maybe there's something I can help you with, Cassie. But first...
I really need to know if you're a member.
What the hell are you doing?
Go, Cassie! Let 's do it!
Hang in there, Cass!
You're going to make it!
All right, Cassie!
Incredible!
You looked like you were in trouble, but you pulled it on. Nicely done.
Yeah! What got into you?
I saw Sean.
And that guy with the mask from the club.
- What guy?
- And the one with a scarred face.
I saw you talking with him.
He went back there.
What do you guys do there?
- What 's going on?
- Nothing's going on. Take it easy.
I did go back. I went back to tell those guys to leave you alone.
Yeah, but I saw him at school with you.
You're paranoid.
You're hallucinating.
And I saw you with Raven that day at school and...
That 's it, okay?
We've got to get you out of here.
We'll hop in the car, drive you to your folks. We'll drive all night.
No.
Come on! We'll make a little road trip out of it. It will be fun.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
This whole thing with Sean is screwed up. You're screwed up.
Let us help you, Cass.
Just come with us.
No.
Sean's not coming back! You want to be with us or with him somewhere?
- Take it easy.
- I'm sick of waiting for you to decide.
You're with us or you're not!
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.
You want to stay here, don't you?
That way you get it all, I mean... you get Sean, Matt and you get everything, and we don't get shit!
That 's enough!
- Raven was so right about you.
- Stop it!
Look, I know you're angry at me about Matt and about Sean...
- Please...
- People from the club are dangerous.
- Those people?
- One of them tried to kill me!
Isn't that ironic?
What?
You're the murderer.
Cassie!
- Annie! Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- You're going to die.
Annabel! Let 's go!
Trick or treat!
Let 's go.
I need to go back and get my stuff, and then I'm going home.
Okay, I'll drive you to your parents.
- I'll be right out.
- I won't let anybody in.
Matt?
Matt?
Hello?
Got you!
Wait. Come back!
Cassie, are you okay?
Wait, it 's me. It 's me.
It 's okay!
He tried to kill me.
He's back there and he's dead.
- What is it?
- I killed him. He's in the water.
What are you talking about?
I was just up there.
There's nobody up there.
I promise.
I promise, there's nobody up there.
Come on.
There's nobody up there.
Come on!
There's no one out here.
He was here.
He was right there!
Take me home.
Take me home to my mom.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
What are we doing here?
You said you'd take me home!
I am, take it easy. I'm just going to go get Annabel. Then we can go.
I'm not leaving her here.
- I'm not going in there.
- Fine. Stay in the car.
Wait!
Matt!
Welcome to the party, Cass.
We're getting out of here!
I'm not going anywhere.
I like it here.
- Annie?
- Let her go.
- She belongs here now.
- Go back to the Addams family!
Your friends are not your friends anymore, Cass.
You belong to Sean.
Go now, while there's still time.
- Jeez! What are you doing?
- When you kissed me that night... it wasn't just good-bye.
You liked it.
What are you talking about?
Let 's get out of here!
How do you think I feel when
I gave up my first semester... to take care of you, and you haven't even said thank you?
What? Let 's just get out...
- How did you hurt your hand?
- How do you think I feel... when I'm here for you, and you're still hung up on a dead guy?
Let me go!
You kill me, Cassie.
One last good-bye forever kiss is all I want.
Get off me now!
When are you going to wake up?
Why do you think Annabel hates you?
Sean is the only one who didn't betray you, and you killed him!
Sorry...
God.
Annabel?
It 's her.
Miss?
I... I killed them.
I killed them.
Cassie, hold on.
Hold on.
I killed them.
No, you didn't.
- Don't leave me.
- I won't leave your side.
Stay with me, Cass.
I'm here. I'm right here.
Stay with me.
Look at me.
Look at me. I'm right here.
Stay with me, Cass, stay with me!
Your tests indicate you have a hemorrhage... as a result of your accident.
Why wasn't my grade posted with the others?
There is no grade for this kind of test.
Mom!
Mom!
Miss?
Try to take it easy!
Don't be afraid.
You have to fight.
Eternal father, I offer you the precious blood... of your divine son, Jesus.
Eternal rest grant onto them.
And let perpetual life wash over them.
May they rest in peace.
I'm dying.
Fighting!
You're very strong, Cassie.
But all this time...
It 's been another kind of time.
It 's like a dream that your mind is creating... to keep you from waking up to what you're not ready to accept.
- You're fighting.
- They said that you were dead.
I fought my own fight years ago.
And I know that even a dream of life is better than facing death.
But what about Annabel, and Matt, and the others?
They're lost.
- Sean?
- He survived.
I loved him very much.
- I don't want to die.
- Lf you were to die... so that he'd live, would you feel absolved?
I would.
I would die for him.
Do you love him enough to live for him?
I don't want to die!
Sean...
Sean!
Sean?
Sean, I'm sorry.
It 's okay, it 's not your fault.
I never told you.
- What? Tell me now.
- I...
Love...
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
You made it, honey.
You made it!
We told you to hang on, and you did!
We told you not to leave us!
How long have I been here?
It 's been two days.
Sean kept talking to you all the time saying...
"Don't give up.
Keep fighting."
I know. I heard him.
I heard all of you.
I heard all of you.
Oh, thank you.
Pretty peaches.
-How you been?
-l`m pretty good, l reckon.
You had any health problems since l saw you last?
-Ma`am?
-Have you been sick?
-Back`s been hurting a little.
-No, it`s not your back.
Have you been bleeding somewhere?
Yes, ma`am, a little. Yeah.
Have you been to a doctor? l don`t much like going to no doctors.
Well, l think, maybe you should go.
No, it`s not a venereal disease. lt`s some kind of kidney or some...
...bladder infection. But it`s been around for a while.
Could lead to some more serious problems.
Do you want me to call a doctor for you?
-All right.
-Okay.
You kids get on to bed now. lt`s nearly 9:00.
Ah, mama, can l stay up just a little bit?
No, you heard me, mister.
Mama? What does
``fuck`` mean? lt`s a bad word, hon, for something nice.
But what does it mean?
Well, it means making love. lt`s how your daddy and me...
...made your brothers and you.
Take his turtles off, hon.
-Mike, did you hear me?
-What? l said get to bed.
Oh, Mike, your lip`s dragging the floor.
-You act like l`m a kid.
-You are a kid, honey.
Valerie, you may as well take your glasses off...
...l know he`s been hitting you again.
-l see your lip.
-l know. lt just embarrasses me. lt`s okay.
Take them off.
He got worse. l went to the store yesterday,
`cause he`s out of some things...
...and he got home from work early, before l could get back.
He was waiting with a razor strap.
My legs are all cut up and l got...
...welts the size of footballs on my back and my legs. l feel guilty, you payin` me money to tell you...
...to get away from him.
You got to get help!
Legal help.
You don`t know Donnie
Barksdale, Annie.
He`ll kill me if l leave him.
He`ll find me.
He said he would.
No, he`s not crazy enough...
...to kill anybody.
He`s just an insecure redneck.
What? l think he`s got a woman on the side.
Yeah, he`s been laying out at night.
Excuse me, but the school`s on the phone.
They say Mike`s in some kind of problem.
Mrs. Wilson. Hi.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
-Where... where`s Mike?
-He`s in the infirmary.
Now, it`s nothing to get worked up about. He`s fine.
He`s got a few, um... sit down.
He`s got a few nicks and bruises. l think he might have a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.
-He was in another fight?
-Yes, he was.
His grades are getting worse too.
How`s he doing at home?
Um, not much better.
He`s real distant.
Mrs. Wilson, l don`t pretend to be a psychologist...
...but it`s obvious to me that your boy`s got...
...a lot of anger in him.
Well, it`s about this time last year...
...his daddy passed away, he`s still real messed up over it. l never knew your husband. l understand he was a fine man.
Yes, he was.
Well, l don`t know how you feel about therapy, but...
Mike don`t need a... lf you think Mike needs somebody to talk to, l know...
Mike doesn`t need a therapist.
He can talk to me.
Well, Mrs. Wilson... do you think he will, though? l`m sorry, Wayne. l didn`t know you had anybody in here.
-Hi. Ruby wasn`t at her desk.
-Yeah, she`s out sick today.
Uh, Mrs. Wilson, this is
Jessica King, my fiancee.
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.
We`re just going to be a couple of minutes.
Uh, l gotta go anyway. l got people waiting.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Collins...
...l`m really sorry about all this. lt`s my job. He`s just a boy, that`s all.
You`re not that Wilson that`s a fortune-teller, are you?
-l don`t call myself that.
-Would you read my fortune? l`m pretty booked up.
Do you think we`ll live happily ever after?
What`s the matter?
You see something bad?
Of course not.
No, l`m sure you`ll be...
...real happy together.
Hey, Mrs. Wilson. How you gettin` along today? l`m fine, Buddy.
Except the fact...
...l just can`t keep my car door...
...from just flying right open. Can you fix it? l can get to it... about an hour or two.
Uh, you wanna wait?
Uh, no. l got to get home. l got people coming.
You just wanna leave it here and l`ll carry you on home? l can have it to you probably by
6:00. That gonna be all right?
-Yeah, yeah, that`s fine.
-All right.
-Buddy?
-Yeah? l`m a little low on money this week... l was just...
-Oh, don`t you worry about...
-No, really. l feel bad.
For all that you`ve done for me...
...l just think the world of you.
You`re about the only one l call a friend to me.
Thank you. l`ll get the truck.
Take your time.
How you been, Buddy? l`ve been having some, uh... bad thoughts lately.
But l, you know... yesterday l was feeling so happy.
-On top of the world.
-Good on you. l didn`t even feel like l needed my medicine. l took it anyway. l`m getting hooked on that stuff.
Well, l think you`re gonna have a lot of happy days, Buddy.
Yeah, you`re gonna get better and better. l believe you when you say so.
Buddy? Honey?
Honey, what`s wrong?
You have to tell me now. l`ll tell you, hon. lf l look into a blue diamond...
...and l think a negative thought...
...am l gonna die?
No...
...you`re not gonna die.
You`re not gonna die, Buddy.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Well, thank you, `cause if you had said ``yes``...
...l would have to kill myself before the sun goes down.
Oh, Buddy... oh, honey....
You don`t have to kill yourself, honey.
You know l`ll always tell you, Buddy. l`ll always tell you, Buddy.
You`re fine. You can always talk to me, Buddy.
-Don`t use that, honey.
-l feel embarrassed.
-l want you to have it.
-l can`t soil that.
-Buddy, l want you to have it.
-This one`s Ben`s..
He`d want you to have it.
-You all right?
-l`m all right. l can walk home. You don`t have to drive me.
No, l`m good... l`m good.
-You sure scared me, hon.
-No, l`m all right.
You just take it nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
Could l help you?
Yes, ma`am. l`m
Donnie Barksdale. l`m sorry to bother you so late...
...but l believe you know my wife Valerie.
Yes, l do. l know who you are.
Can l come in and talk to you? lt`s about my wife, something`s happened to her.
What`s happened?
-She okay?
-Well, no, she`s not, ma`am.
Ma`am, l promise. l`ll just take a minute.
All right.
What`s happened to her is she`s getting her head...
...filled full of shit...
...by a goddamn
Satan worshipper...
...or a damn good con artist. l know she`s been...
...coming over to see you and your damn voodoo.
You tell her bad things about me, don`t you?
You ain`t no better than a jew or nigger!
Do you know what this is? lt`s a voodoo doll. l`m gonna use this voodoo doll on you.
Some of your own medicine...
...if you don`t stop seeing my wife. l`m stickin` me a pin in this thing every night.
Go back to bed.
Everything`s fine. l bet you love those little children, don`t you? l bet they need their mama, don`t they?
What`s your name?
Get your ass out of my house!
Don`t you threaten me or my kids!
Now, what l do here is my business! lf your wife has any sense, she`ll leave you so far behind.
Now you get out of here before l have you thrown in jail.
Messing with the devil is gonna get you burned.
Everybody knows that. l`ll see you soon, boys.
Go back to bed.
Come on.
Something smells like cat pee. lt`s perfume, Ben and you`re not supposed...
...to cuss in front of appointments.
-Sometihng smells like cat pee!
-Be quiet!
He`s got a great sense of humor.
He loves you...
Valerie... no honey, you know, you shouldn`t be here. l`m sorry about the other night.
That`s okay, l can take of myself. l hate coming over here, but...
...really need to talk to you.
Maybe you could read for me...
...under a bridge or something all right? l`ll read for you, but you got to start listening to me. l can`t leave him.
Don`t you understand?
He`s gonna keep hurting you till...
...he puts you in the hospital. l don`t have anything to look forward to.
Maybe...
...you can give me some hope. l don`t know how to make myself any clearer.
-Annie, it`s him!
-No... calm down.
-l`call the law.
-You`re my friend, you won`t. l`ll deal with you later, you goddamn bitch!
You witch!
Get your ass in the truck!
That ain`t fast enough! l told you not to come here!
Get in.
Mike, you stay there!
What did l fucking tell you!
Mike, y`all bring miss
Francis her clothes!
Thanks, hon.
-Granny!
-Hey, Anabelle!
Granny, what are you doing here? l brought you some persimmons, hon.
Remember how you like persimmons when you`s little?
You`re not supposed to be here.
How`d you get here? lt ain`t far to walk.
That boy`s got your granddaddy`s eyes.
Well, hon, l better get back.
Looks like there`s a storm coming.
No, granny... it`s clear.
Annie, always use your instinct, honey.
Now you tell miss Francis l`ll be home by 9:30, okay.
-l love you too, mama.
-l love you too, hon.
-Be good!
-Bye, mama.
You ready? l don`t know why l let you talk me into this.
`Cause it`s time you quit living like a nun, that`s why.
You`ll be the prettiest girl here, next to me.
You still a married man? l don`t know about that.
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-Do we pay him now or...?
-l sign for it later. ls it good?
Annie, there he is.
Who?
That guy l was telling you about.
He`s right over there by the bar.
Don`t he just look like Antonio Banderas?
My God, he saw me!
Shit!
He saw me staring at him.
Get your cards out, quick.
Tell me if he`s gonna come over here. l don`t have my cards with me. l`m off duty.
-Hello, Mrs. Wilson.
-lt`s Annie.
Wayne, sit down. You`re blocking my view.
Sorry. You remember Jessica? l didn`t know you were a member of the Country Club. l`m not. l kind of tagged along with Linda.
-How nice. lt`s a great outfit.
-Thank you.
What`s Mike up to night?
He`s moping around his baby-sitter`s.
He`s a great kid. l was actually thinking...
...you should have him come down to school and...
Let`s not talk shop tonight, all right?
Let`s just have fun, okay?
-Hi there, fun-seekers.
-Hey, there.
-A dance with daddy?
-Of course l will, handsome. l don`t know if you know, uh Annie Wilson?
Yeah. l think l`ve seen you at church.
That is quite a dress, Miss Linda. l`m glad somebody noticed.
You want to give it a try?
No, l don`t think so.
No, thank you. l asked you to dance, not walk on hot coals.
When was the last time you danced? l think it`s so long, l`ve forgotten how to do it. l`ll make you look good then,
`cause l`m a terrible dancer.
Wayne? l`ll dance.
Good luck!
Missed your big chance.
Somebody might come in here. l guess you better fuck me fast.
You having a good time?
Me neither.
You seen Jessica around?
She up and disappeared on me again.
What do you think of Jessica?
She`s very beautiful.
About her, she`s just...
...so full of life.
We`re a little different in that respect. l`m used to tennis shoes.
This kind of reminds me when l was a kid. l`d have some many thoughts, just couldn`t count`em.
How`d you wind up in Brixton?
My husband. He got a job here at the cable plant.
What?
Did you know something was going to happen to him? ln an E.S.P. kind of way?
-Well, l don`t know...
-You don`t believe in it. l don`t know, l guess l just...
...l don`t believe there are any great mysteries in life. l kind of figure what you see is what you get. l didn`t know that there was going to be an explosion but...
...the night before, l had this real bad dream, you know. l dreamt that l was all by myself. That Ben...
Tried to stop him going to work the next day, but...
You can`t keep a good man from work, right?
You kind of remind me of him.
Wayne? l`ve been looking for you everywhere. l`ve been right here. l see...
Let`s go talk to daddy, he`s feeling real depressed tonight...
...that big deal he`s working on went bad.
We got a major crisis here Annie. Excuse us?
-See you later, alligator.
-Good night, boys.
-What`s that, hon?
-Blueberry muffins.
Whatcha doin` with muffins in your pockets?
Miss Francis cooked them.
But what are they doing in your pockets? l put them there when she wasn`t looking...
...l didn`t have to eat them.
Her blueberry muffins is terrible, mama.
Uh, y`all wait there a minute, take Ben, hon.
Mama, is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything`s fine.
-You sure?
Yeah, time for you to go to Bed. Come on.
He`s a buddy of mine. l don`t think that Donnie... l`m telling you it was him!
What makes you think he`d want to bust into your house?
Well, his wife, she`s a client of mine...
...and he thinks l`m trying to break up their marriage.
Are you? Listen, um,
Donnie`s high-strung.
You know, ain`t no doubt about that.
But l don`t think he`s the one that busted into your house.
Listen, l appreciate the coffee and everything. Take care. l just can`t get through a wall of some kind in my head.
Or my soul. l don`t even know the difference between my head or my soul. l think everybody has that trouble, Buddy.
Your daddy...
...when you were a little boy.
Do you understand that?
He seen me playing around with something like a toy...
...or something he`d just take it away from me.
Did he take other things away from you?
Why you hate him so much?
My daddy`s a good man. l don`t hate my dad.
He`s good to mama and me.
Every kid needs a hit with a belt sometime.
You got to try to get past this wall that you`re talking about.
You need to talk about your daddy!
Why l hate him?
You`re the goddamn psychic!
You`re the goddamn psychic! l think l better go. l have to go home, right now. l`m sorry l yelled at you. lt`s all right. l just need your help. l just keep thinking about that blue diamond.
You think about these things in your childhood, hon...
...and you face up to them, then l`ll be able to help you. l think you got to do some thinking on your own.
-l`ll help you there.
-Okay, you put it up there.
Hello...
You got a lot of pretty things.
You ever seen anybody skin a squirrel?
Yoi stick a knife in its belly and zip.
That`s what l`m going to do you and your children...
...you ever call the police again.
Mama?
-You`re not asleep?
-l don`t know.
What`s that bat for?
Don`t worry, honey. l`m just working on my swing.
How come we never go to the cementery and see daddy?
Well, we went out there, just last month on his birthday.
Honey, l`m real busy, you know that.
Well, it seems like you have time for a lot of strangers.
They`re my appointments, they`re not strangers.
They`re the ones that put food on our table.
But how come we don`t even talk about daddy?
Mike, l`m trying to read.
-Annie!
-Hey. l know why Kenneth King wasn`t in church today.
-Why?
-His daughter disappeared.
Jessica? What do you mean she disappeared?
Kenneth woke up this morning and Jessica wasn`t there...
...and her bed hadn`t even been slept in.
You think she ran off? l know her and Wayne were supposed to be married in June.
-She got cold feet.
-Maybe.
Maybe this will clear the way for you and Wayne.
What are you talking about?
Come on. l saw the way y`all were looking...
...at each other
Friday night!
-You had stars in your eyes.
-Oh, Linda, that`s nuts!
-Annie, love is nuts.
-Come on. Go home. l want you get some rest.
You look terrible, okay?
Bye, boys.
-l got to go.
-Bye, Miss Linda.
Missing girl...
...in Brixton since 4 days ago.
Ben, get your hand out of there!
That`s for y`all`s cake tonight.
What am l gonna ice the cake with?
-l like icin` Mama.
-l can see that, punkin.
Miller!
Would you go ask Miss Francis...
...she`s got another can of icing, please?
Where you going, son?
You wanna ride in the truck?
You know my wife Valerie?
She been around to see your mama lately?
Hey, boy. l asked you a question.
Get my hat.
You know, l feel sorry for you and your brothers. l mean, your mama being a witch and all.
She don`t stop her evil ways.
Some day somebody`s gonna burn her up.
And then you boys are gonna be without a daddy or a mama.
You all right?
He said mama`s a witch and they`re gonna burn her up!
Oh, he did?
Buddy, you better mind your own business. l intend to, Donnie.
Motherfucker!
Goddamn it! Fuck!
Look, fucker!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Shoot me, you motherfucker!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
You all right?
Tuscan rouge!
What was l thinking? l want icin`, mama.
Hon, you`ve had icing enough to put you in a coma. l want to know where you all are every minute of the day.
Mike, l`m gonna start driving you and Miller to school. l wish daddy was here.
Well, he`s not, hon.
But mama is. Okay?
Eat your cake.
Hello.
-Uh, this is Kenneth King.
-Mr. King! lmagine you, uh...
...you heard about my daughter`s disappearance?
Well, Mrs. Wilson, l don`t believe in what you do...
...l`ll just be straight with you not only that...
...l don`t like it but we`ve got to the end of the road...
...and our investigation... looked under every rock...
...there is to look under and we`d like you to tell...
...what you can to help us.
Now, no hocus-pocus and chanting and carrying on.
But we know you talk to a lot of folks hereabouts...
...know a lot of folks business.
You might have heard something or something.
One of sheriff Johnson`s men found my daughter`s car...
...sitting out on the parking lot...
...of that Honky-Tonk called at Jay`s...
...but nobody that was there on Saturday night...
...admits to having seen her...
...l`m afraid she might have been kidnapped or something.
Oh, Mr. King. l`m sorry. l don`t know anything about your daughter`s disappearance. l think we were just hoping... ls there anything you can tell us? l could read for you.
That`s about all l could do. l need you to cut the cards for me.
Thank you.
All right.
You ready?
When were you getting married again, Wayne?
-June 20...
-We`re supposed...
-...to ask the questions.
-Shut up! Goddamn it!
Look, l have a hard time concentrating with more...
...than one person in the room. l`m staying right here. l`m the law and...
...l need to hear this.
Please, ma`am, just try to tell us what you see. l`m trying. All right. l`m picking up. lt`s like a...
...it`s a fence... like a split rail fence.
Do you know how many fences there are in this county?
...and some pillars, like with an opening going through.
And there`s lots of white flowers...
Yes, and, uh, is that where Jessie is? l`m seeing.
This is just mishmash. l told you this...
...wouldn`t lead to nothing. lt won`t. l can`t concentrate. l`m sorry, Mr. King. l really do hope you find your daughter...
...l`m just not the person to help you with this.
Hey, Butch...
And it was horrible...
...but that same chain that was wrapped around...
...her when she was floatin`...
...in my tree, it was the same chain that...
...l had in my dream. l don`t know... l just thought...
Dave?
Yes, sir? l could have sworn there was an eclair in there. l didn`t get it.
Tim was in a little earlier.
You saw all this in a dream? lt wasn`t just a dream. l don`t investigate somebody`s dream. l think she`s dead, sheriff.
And l think she`s in a pond.
What do you know about this you ain`t telling me?
You know, you can get in seerious trouble...
...with holding information.
-Sounds like a place you know?
-A bunch of places l know.
Split rail fence, a pond, a stretch of woods...
...every rawbone ol` boy in the county got that.
What about the fiddler?
Tommy Lee ballard plays a fiddle...
...but he wouldn`t kill no body.
-l`ve know him since he`s a kid.
-No, it`s not the fiddler.
Who are his neighbors?
Well, his closest neighbor would be...
...well, let me see here. l guess...
...well, his property borders, Donnie Barksdale.
Do you know Donnie Barksdale?
Tim! On the gate!
Did you get a search warrant? l want everything to be legal.
Didn`t have to. Got permission from the owner.
-Donnie Barksdale gave you...?
-His wife did. l told her it was routine.
Donnie`s gone fishing today.
Excuse me. Sheriff Johnson?
How much longer y`all gonna be?
Long as it takes.
You just said you`re gonna be a few minutes.
We`re going on two hours.
Pearl, l think l got something!
False alarm, it`s just an old bicycle.
None of y`all brought a thermos of coffee out here?
That day at school...
...you looked kind of strange at me and Jessica.
Did you think something bad then?
-Donnie called. l told him...
-Pearl! Shut your mouth!
Goddamn it, Pearl, what are you doing on my property? l`m on Sheriff`s business, l got permission from your wife.
You think l let that little ninny talk for me?
How`d your arm get all scratched up?
Stray cat. She didn`t like it when l killed her.
-Now what brought you here?
-Just routine investigation.
We`re checking all the ponds in the county.
-l knew it was you!
-No! l`m on county business, Donnie.
Don`t fool with me.
-Pearl!
-What?
You need to take a look at this, watch him!
Haul it up, boys! lt`s her!
Donnie?
Get those hooks out of my baby!
Get her off them hooks!
Cuff him!
Get an ambulance. l think he`s having a heart attack!
-l didn`t do this!
-Get him out of here!
This ain`t right! Pearl!
Bitch! Bitch!
Come in!
Somebody might come in here. l guess you better fuck me fast.
You want some coffee?
Mrs. Wilson?
-You want some coffee?
-No, thank you.
Have a seat.
Why have you called me here?
Mrs. Wilson, tomorrow Donnie goes on trial for murder. l feel that we have a powerful case. ln fact, today the coroner verified Donnie`s tissue...
...under the victim`s fingernails.
Now, l only have one weak link l got to worry about.
-What?
-You?
You see, you`re how...
...we found out where the victim`s body was.
That might open up a real can of worms for us.
Psychic phenomena, E.S.P., dreams, visions...
...the defense could go to town on you.
And if that`s not bad enough, l understand that...
...there was bad blood between you and Donnie.
-He threatened my kids.
-That`s what l heard. l also heard that you threatened him right back.
Told his wife to leave him.
Donnie`s quite a ladies`man.
Were you involved with him?
What? l can deal with any revelation...
But at the trial there can`t be any surprises. ls there anything l need to know about you or Donnie...
...or Donnie`s wife or the victim?
No. Will that be all?
Yes, ma`am.
You know, Mr. Duncan...
...the victim had a name. lt was Jessica King.
Mr. Hawkings, how long have you worked out at Jay`s?
About ten years.
Now, were you working at Jay`s on Saturday night, April 8?
Yes, sir.
Did you see Donnie
Barksdale that night?
Yes, sir.
Could you describe the circumstances?
The circumstances were...
...l come outside to throw out some trash.
-What time it was?
-About midnight, l reckon. l see Donnie out there by his truck...
...havin` an argument with this white lady.
She scratched his arm and he slapped the tar out of her.
About that time, l go back inside.
-ls this the woman you saw?
-Yes, sir.
Your honor, let the record show that l`ve just shown...
...Mr. Hawkings a photograph of Jessica King.
Your attention was drawn to the defendant`s pond.
Drawn in what way?
Me, Wayne Collins and Kenneth
King went to see Annie Wilson.
What made you think she would be able to help you?
Well... word around town was... that she was a...
-l don`t know the right word.
-lsn`t it fortune-teller? l guess so. What did this fortune-teller see?
When she looked into her little crystal ball.
Well, she didn`t have no ball.
She had these special cards.
She didn`t actually see nothing then?
But next day, she come to see me and...
-She had this dream.
-She had a dream?
Yes, sir. She`d seen this pond and it looked a...
...lot like Donnie
Barksdale`s and...
...then she woke up from her dream and she went outside...
...and looked up in this tree. l`m all ears.
She`s seen Jessica King... floatin` in the tree...
...half-naked, with a chain wrapped around her.
-Floatin` around a tree?
-Yes, sir.
Floatin` in a tree... half-naked...
...with a chain wrapped around her.
Thank you, sheriff.
That little squirrel, Weems, is just mean and skinny.
Never have known a
Weems worth a damn.
Well, he was just doing his job.
Uh. Mrs. Wilson, can l talk to you for a minute?
-Just call me later on, okay?
-Oh, okay. Okay, bye.
Buddy, l got a lot on my mind. lt`s not a good time, okay?
You did tell me to do some thinkin` and talkin`.
-And l`ve been thinking.
-What? What?
Can you tell me why l do things to myself...
...when l think about my daddy?
Bud, you call me later, hon, and we`ll talk, all right? l need to talk to you. l`ve been thinking about my daddy...
...and l`ve been touching myself.
-Touching yourself? How?
-Why do l do that?
-Buddy, honey...
-Why do l do that?
-lt`s not unusual.
-Something`s wrong with me.
And l keep thinking about that blue diamond.
You look into the blue diamond...
...you won`t think a negative thought. l promise. Now, hon, l`m going through a hard time myself. l just... l can`t talk to you now, okay?
You`re gonna burn in hell, Annie Wilson!
Now, Mike, l know you skipped school and went to that trial.
-How`d you know?
-A little bird told me. lt`s about time you started making things easier on me. l`m very disappointed in you.
The phone`s ringing, mama. l`m gonna have to testify at that trial tomorrow.
-The phone`s ringing, mama!
-l`m not deaf, Miller!
Let the machine get it.
Barksdale`s side they`re gonna try and give me hard time. l just want y`all to be prepared...
...f you hear any bad stuff about me, all right?
We`re all gonna have to be sticking together on this one.
Annie Wilson, it`s Buddy`s mother. Buddy`s gone crazy.
He`s threatening to kill his daddy!
He`s got Dell tied up, accusing him of horrible things.
-Have you called the police?
-He said if l did that...
...he`d kill Dell, he wants you.
Put that strap down and tell me!
What he`s done to you? l`m here, Buddy... like you said you can talk to me, honey. lt`s too late for that! lt`s too goddamn late!
This here is a criminal!
And he`s gonna be punished!
You shut up! You shut up!
Get away!
Where were you? l`m sorry, Buddy, l`m sorry.
You knew everything and you did nothing!
You ruined me!
You ruined me! l was just a little boy, daddy! lt got so l was embarrassed to go to school, daddy!
How could you do that to your little boy!
No, Buddy!
You put that down!
No, Buddy...
You put that down, Buddy,
You put that down!
-You listen to me!
-You get away! You get away!
All right, Buddy, All right.
Why didn`t you help me, Annie?
-What?
-Why didn`t you help me? l had you for a friend and then... l am your friend, Buddy.
Now! Now l have nobody! l`m gonna kill this thing.
Help me! Help me!
Look at that goddamn thing...
...and you tell me what kind of thoughts you have?
You look! You look!
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson?
Your husband,
Ben Wilson senior...
...was one of the men killed last year in the explosion...
...rout at the reinhold cable plant.
Yes, that`s right.
You were left with three small children to raise on your own.
Yes, sir.
How do you provide for you and your sons? l get a little bit of money...
...from social security.
-From my husband`s death.
-Psychic readings?
Yes, sir.
What does being psychic enables you to do? l see things... and l, you know... l sense...
...well, they hadn`t happened yet...
...or they were happening someplace else.
My granny told me that l had a gift that...
...runs in my family...
...l shouldn`t be afraid of it. l should just always use my instinct and l`d be all right.
You`re swearing, before this court that you didn`t get...
...your information about this tragedy from any...
-...other means?
-Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mrs. l have no further questions.
Mr. Weems.
How many fingers am l holding up behind my back?
Objection, your honor!
My client is in this courtroom on trial for his life...
...partly because of powers that this woman claims to have. l believe l should be given the opportunity to test...
...the alleged powers instead of taking her word for it.
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.
Can every one see how many fingers l`m showing?
How many fingers,
Mrs. Wilson? l don`t know.
You don`t know?
-Seven! Seven fingers!
-That doesn`t prove anything.
Your honor, l can`t do this...
...you know, at the drop of hat.
Then, ma`am, how about doing it at the drop of a dolar bill?
What are you trying to say? l`m trying to say maybe this special gift of yours doesn`t...
``No money, no honey.``
No, that`s not true.
Are you aware that in hatcher county it`s against the law...
...for a phychic to set up a shop and charge people money? l don`t charge money.
You just testified that you do charge money. l accept donations.
People give me gifts.
A distinction worthy of a lawyer.
Wilson, you a rich woman?
-No.
-Why not? lf l had psychic powers like yours...
...l`d be filthy rich. l`d be playing the stock market, betting on the dogs. l`d certainly warn my husband...
...not to go to work on the day...
...l know the reinhold plant`s gonna blow up...
...leaving 3 little children to be raised in a carnival.
Well, it doesn`t work that way, sir...
...l can`t use my gift for personal gain.
Except for those... what you call `em... donations?
Have you had some personal trouble with Donnie?
Yes, l have.
You told him, l believe the exact words was...
...you was gonna have his ass thrown in jail.
But he was threatening my kids.
That a few weeks ago in one of those readings of yours...
...when you were doing your
ESP you told Donnie`s wife...
...that Donnie was just an insecure redneck...
...and that he wasn`t really crazy enough to kill anybody?
Yes, l did say that.
Then why today are you saying he did kill somebody?
Wait a second. l`ve never said that.
You might as well have, ma`am.
You wanted his ass in jail...
...and he`s on trial for his life. l just told the sheriff what l saw.
And how could any of us ever forget that?
Jessica King just floatin` up in that tree...
...naked, with a chain wrapped around her. lt must be so much fun for you.
You must be having the time of your life...
...entertaining yourself with your dreams and your visions.
You think it`s fun seeing...
...decomposed bodies in my tree, do you sir?
Do you think it`s fun that l have...
...people trying to strangle me in my sleep?
Now l`m blaming myself
`cause some poor crazy man...
...just tried to burn his daddy half to death.
And you think l`m sitting here having fun? l`m sorry, sir. You`re crazy if you think that.
No more questions, your honor.
You`re dismissed.
Let`s just cut to the chase.
Did you or did you not kill Jessica King? l did not.
Did you or did you not see Jessica King...
...on the night she was killed?
Yeah, l seen her.
Would you describe the circumstances, please?
Well, l`d been seeing her for quite a while.
Would you clarify what you mean by ``seeing``. l mean, her and me had been having sex.
Okay, go ahead.
Well, she called me about 1 1 :00. l told her l`d meet her out at Jay`s.
And l told my wife l was going out for a beer.
-What happened after that?
-Well, we got in an argument.
-She didn`t want to see me.
-Did she tell you why?
She was getting married in a couple of months and wanted...
...to stop playing around at least `till after the wedding.
And during the course of this argument with with Miss King...
...did you at any moment strike her?
Yes, sir.
What happened after you struck her?
She banged her head pretty hard when she went down...
...l decided to take her to the hospital.
-Did you reach the hospital?
-No, sir.
Are you feeling okay? l`m fine... l wanna go back. l don`t wanna go to the hospital.
Someone might see me.
Then she said she was feeling better anyhow...
...l took her back to Jay`s. l dropped her off, then l went on back home.
And that was the last time you saw Jessica King alive?
Yes, sir.
Are you guilty of the charge against you? l`m guilty of cheatin on my wife of being a bad husband...
...a bad christian, but l ain`t guilty of killing Jesse. l swear to God.
No more questions, your honor.
Mr. Duncan.
You`re a wife-beater, aren`t you? l`ve swore to tell the truth here today.
Yeah, l`ve hit
Valerie before... l guess it ain`t no secret.
You admit to having a history of violence against women...
...and also to having beaten up the victim...
...on the night that she was murdered. l wouldn`t exactly say that l beat her up.
You`re the expert.
You tell me.
Just how badly do you have to beat a woman...
...before it fits your definition of ``beating up``?
Now, your story is that you`ve been having an affair...
...with the victim.
But tell us why a beautiful young woman like Jessica King...
...from one of the finest families in Brixton...
...just about to be married to a good...
...decent professional man with a bright future...
...why would a woman like that get involved with you? l asked her that myself on time.
She said l was the only man...
...in town who knew how to fuck.
You`re really disgusting.
You know that?
-Objection, your honor!
-Objection sustained.
You will refrain from making those personal comments. l apologize, your honor.
Let`s get this straight.
Let`s clarify this.
You`re saying it was just a coincidence...
...that on the very same night you physicall assaulted her...
...someone else put her body in your pond? l`m not saying it was a coincidence. l`m saying l got framed!
What an original defense.
Did you think of Jessica
King as a stray cat?
Did you tell sheriff Johnson a stray cat clawed your arm?
Did`t you just tell the court
Jessica scratched your arm?
Didn`t you tell him you got scratched by the stray cat...
...because she didn`t like it when you killed her?
-But l was lying.
-Maybe you`re lying now. l`m not, goddamn it. lt`s her, goddamn it!
-Be seated, Mr Barksdale!
-She`s the reason l`m up here!
She`s a goddamn witch!
Witch! Witch! ln Brixton today, a sensational murder trial was concluded.
Donald Barksdale was found guilty...
...in the sex and strangulation killing...
...of Jessica King...
...daughter of the Brixton businessman, Kenneth King. ls everything gonna be all right now, mama?
Yeah, hon.
We can get on with our lives now. l guess l`m the last person...
...you wanna see.
How you been?
Terrible.
Annie, if you tell me to get going, l will...
...l wouldn`t blame you...
...but l need you to read for me.
Give me a hand. l feel like l can`t hold on any longer.
You know Donnie`s mean and everything, but...
...l feel real lost without him.
You know, l ain`t never been on my own before. l`m scared, Annie.
You don`t need to be scared, hon. You`ll be fine.
You see that in the cards?
Right through here.
But can you see what l`m thinking?
What do you mean? l`ve been thinking some real bad, bad thoughts...
-...un-Christian thoughts.
-Like what? l`m glad that girl`s dead, Jessica.
She was messin` around and she deserved what she got.
No one deserves that.
Like l said, l know it`s un-Christian.
What? What, are you seeing something bad? l don`t know. lt`s not clear.
Fuck you!
Wayne?
Wayne? lt`s not normally like this.
You need to lie down. l`m really not sleepy. l think if you sleep, you`ll feel better.
Thank you, Annie.
Wayne, l don`t think this is a good idea.
No. lt`s not. l just thought we could forget...
...all this for a while.
You want to, don`t you? l know there`s something between us. l can`t. l guess l still feel married.
You`re not, though.
-He`s gone.
-l know.
You gotta learn to deal with that.
Like l gotta deal with the fact that Jessica`s gone.
She`s dead.
Oh, Wayne, l`m so sorry.
-lt`s okay.
-No, it`s not okay. l don`t think Donnie
Barksdale killed her.
-No, no, Annie...
-l`m really sorry. l can`t. l can`t do this. lt`s finished. l know. l wanna let that bastard rot in jail.
But he`s guilty.
No, Wayne, l see it. l see he didn`t do it.
Do you see who did?
Uh, l`m trying but l, l... don`t know yet.
What are we gonna do?
Well, if l had a piece of clothing...
...or maybe l could go out to the pond or see if l... lt`s not over.
Jesus.
Come in.
What brings you out here?
Well, l`ll just come straight out and say it. l don`t think Donnie Barksdale killed Jessica King.
Well, sure he did. lt was an open-and-shut case. l`m telling you, he didn`t.
The person that killed Jessica is still out there someplace.
What`s the deal? The Barksdales been threatening you?
No. l`ll talk to Pearl Johnson.
This has nothing to do with the Barksdales. l know that Donnie didn`t kill Jessica the same way...
...that l knew that her body was in his pond.
And do you know who did kill her?
No.
So, what do you care?
The son of a bitch is in jail. l think somebody`s gonna try and kill me.
-What do you want me to do?
-Re-open the case and...
-...find out who really did it.
-l can`t. He`s been convicted.
-You can talk to somebody.
-l`ve got no basis to open it.
-l`d look like a fool.
-l don`t give a damn.
Now, you listen to me. l know you had an affair with Jessica.
So, how do you think you`re gonna look if people find out...
...you had sex with the victim...
...the night before she was killed?
Do you want money? l want you to re-open the case.
There`s a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie.
You think you`re in danger now?
Look at it logically.
The real danger begin if this case gets re-opened...
...and someone starts worrying that you`re gonna have...
...another one of your damn dreams.
All l know is the wrong man`s in jail. l don`t care how awful he is.
And l helped put him there. l can`t live with that.
So you find a way to re-open this case, sir or l will.
Buddy, l`m here if you...
-Hello, l`m back.
-How are the boys?
They`re fine.
They went to sleep.
You want me to bring `em over?
No, no, listen. Could we stay over your house tonight?
-Sure you can. You all right?
-Oh yeah, l`m fine.
Come on over. l`ll make a bed for you. l`m just gonna lock up.
-Okay, thank you.
-Bye-bye.
Buddy!
Oh! Did you see Buddy Cole?
Buddy? No. l thought he was at the hospital over in Benton.
Oh, maybe l imagined it.
Are you okay? l don`t know. What l`m gonna do. Ever since you told me...
...what you told me today...
...l feel like l`m going crazy.
Annie, l can`t stand another night of this. l need you to read for me. lt`s no good.
Try it again. l can`t make it happen.
How about what you said today?
-What?
-The pond.
What if we did go back out there?
You think it might help you? l... l don`t know.
Yeah. Uh, maybe.
Yeah, okay. Well, it`s worth a try, right?
You mean tonight? No Wayne. l can`t do that. l got my kids.
You know, it`s a police matter now.
How long do you think that`s gonna take, Anne? lt`s gonna sit on somebody`s desk for three or four months...
...and nothing`s gonna happen. lt`s over for them. They`ve got their man. lt`s up to us. l know that. But l`m telling you l don`t see anything. l can`t keep running from things.
Maybe if you just sort of walk around.
All right.
Jeez, you all right?
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
What are you doing here?
You seeing something? l`ve been thinking some real bad, bad thoughts.
Annie? l`m glad that girl is dead. Jessica.
She was messin` around with my husband...
...and she deserved what she got. l couldn`t sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.
Take off your clothes.
Aren`t you taking yours off too?
There`s a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie.
You just fucked him, didn`t you?
Donnie Barksdale?
So?
Why would you do this to me? l love you.
Maybe l wanted to be with a man for a change.
-Watch your mouth!
-You watch your mouth.
Fuck you! We`re through. l don`t like being spied on.
The only reason l`m with you is...
...`cause my daddy likes you.
You horrible little bitch! l`ll show you a bitch if you don`t let go of me. Let go!
-l think we better go back.
-Nothing`s coming to you?
No... nothing.
You know. l knew if l got you close enough to it you`d see it.
-Wayne, l told you.
-No, no, it`s okay. l swear to God,
Annie, it`s okay. l wanted you to see it so bad. l mean, that`s why we`re here. l`m not some killer,
Annie. l`m not.
You don`t... l mean, do you know what it was like with her?
She was so fucking hurtful and spiteful and all of it...
Wayne, l`m not gonna...
But all of it just happened in this flash of a moment.
Wayne, l.... listen to me. l`m a good man.
All right? lf it had been you with me...
...instead of her, none of this would have happened.
Wayne... l won`t... l won`t tell... l won`t... l won`t tell anybody.
No, Annie...
You all right,
Mrs. Wilson? l thought you were supposed to be in the hospital. l escaped, Mrs. Wilson. l`m free.
Buddy, l`m so sorry l wasn`t there for you.
-l should`ve.
-Now, don`t say another word.
You was the only one that was a friend to me.
And l love you.
You`re the soul of this town, Mrs. Wilson.
And just need to keep doing what you`re doing. l washed it.
Will you come back into town with me?
Yeah.
You know you`re gonna have to go back.
Yes, ma`am, l know.
Can l have your key`s, ma`am?
Well, l just talked to Wayne...
...he pretty much admitted to everything. l`ve known that boy half my life. lt just goes to show...
...you can know somebody and...
...not know `em.
How`s his head?
Well, you put a pretty good dent in it.
No, sheriff...
...l told the deputy it wasn`t me... who did that.
-Buddy Cole saved me.
-No, it weren`t Buddy. l mean, why don`t you just ask Wayne? l did.
He don`t remember what happened.
Head injuries is funny.
Sheriff, l`m telling you it was Buddy Cole. What l`m... lt couldn`t have been Buddy. l just called up at the state hospital...
He told me he escaped. Ma`am.
Buddy Cole is dead.
He hanged himself in the shower room...
...6:00 this evening.
SUBTlTLED BY
VlDEO OMEGA, S.A. DE C.V.
He came back again last night and tore me like paper.
He opened me like a flower of pain...
...and it felt good.
He sank into me and set me on fire...
...like he always does.
Made me burn from the inside out.
How did you know it was the devil?
I know what you're thinking.
I know you think
I'm talking about my stepfather...
...because you don't believe in the devil.
Okay, let's talk about your stepfather.
You know about my stepfather.
You know I cut his throat.
I cut his Adam's apple in half...
...like a piece of fruit on a summer day...
...so he wouldn't say a word.
I sat next to him and watched him die...
...slowly.
It was the only way to help him stop.
Stop what?
Stop fucking me!
You're not listening.
I am listening, Chloe.
You're not listening with your heart.
Just your brain.
Your brain is the problem.
You have no idea how it feels not to be trusted.
You've got to trust me too, Chloe.
You can't trust someone who thinks you're crazy.
Okay. I think that's enough for today.
But I do think we made some really good headway...
...found out some new things...
Do you know what it is to burn from the inside?
- Do you know? Because you are dead!
- Let her go, Chloe.
I am. I'm not touching her!
I'm not touching her! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go.
Thank you.
You're driving me crazy! Stop!
- Stop it!
- Let go!
Stop it!
I can walk by myself!
Stand up!
Look at that.
"I'm a doctor."
"Open this door."
Hey, you are dead!
Get in.
She's nuts.
Hey.
Sorry.
I need to cross-reference some files with you on Monday. How's your morning?
- Check with Anna. She'll fit you in.
- Thanks. Sorry.
I'm not discharging her, period.
If you want to pursue this, sir, have a judge order her transfer.
Until then she's mine.
Thank you.
Lawyers.
Hey, come on in.
What's up?
Chloe. She's embellishing her rape story again.
She says that the devil is visiting her in her cell.
- Okay.
- Well, it's the third time in three months.
It has something to do with her stepfather, possibly remorse...
...but instead of assessing the memory and accepting it...
...she just falls into these satanic meanderings.
Time. Give it time.
I've given it time. Time and Elavil.
And Mellaril and Haldol.
Maybe they're just...
...too medicated.
I know we all create our realities to some extent. Yes, true.
But what she creates is so far from any objective reality...
Chloe's mind only runs on one track.
Well, right now, my mind is running on empty.
Come here.
You have a brilliant mind.
You'll figure it out.
Throw it on the mirror.
This is what she sees now.
- A distorted image of herself.
- Who are you in all this?
- I'm the mirror.
- You are the mirror.
If I'm the mirror and she's the image...
...then who are you?
I can see both of you...
...so I'm God.
Or just an overworked hospital bureaucrat.
"God" is good.
Always remember, the ability to repress...
...is actually a vital survival tool.
Without it...
...Chloe might not have survived.
Sorry, am I interrupting the happy couple?
Dr. Graham. We were just discussing repression as a survival mechanism.
Oh, yeah, I had a date last week.
I barely survived it. I'm trying to forget it.
I'm sure your amorous adventures are fascinating, doctor...
...but sadly, I'm on my way out.
- Well, don't let me... I'll just...
- No, no, no, I'm leaving.
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek.
Meet the new contractor.
I'll be here. See you at dinner.
Keep an eye on my wife for me, Pete.
I know you will. Here.
- No, thanks.
- No, let me circumcise it for you.
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh.
- Good night, boss.
- Good night, kids.
Why don't we share one of those golden-crust, cheese-filled specials.
- It sounds like a great offer...
- Here's the file.
...but I got work to do.
- I'm buying.
- It's cold when it gets here.
- We could warm it up.
- I hate pizza.
- Who doesn't like pizza?
Come on, you gotta eat.
Not with you.
Come on, we're supposed to celebrate.
I just got circumcised...
- Who's inside?
- We have Shelley for observation.
- Why? What happened?
- She had another attack.
- What'd you do, up her meds?
- Yeah, 25 milligrams.
That's extreme.
That dose is way too high.
I want a copy of that on my desk by Monday, okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Damn generator.
Not again.
Irene, is that you?
This electric system's gonna give us trouble.
Fourth time this week.
I'm going for my swim.
Well, I'm gonna do my job, as long as these damn lights stay on.
- Good night, Joe.
- Hey, how many laps, doc?
Fifty-five, but who's counting?
Oh, you've outdone yourself.
Hey, safe drive home.
- Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me.
- Will do.
All that education but you can't remember an umbrella.
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah, I got your note. Your business note.
Right. So how was your date with...?
With what's-her-name? It was like all of my dates. It was brief. It was pointless.
She didn't respond to my sense of humor, my boyish good looks...
...so I started talking about work.
She said that was not a suitable topic for a first date...
...and that was it.
I mean, it was just drinks, you know.
I mean, we didn't even have dinner.
She's not right.
When you know, you know.
I know.
- I'll follow you down the hill.
- You don't have to.
- No, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
- Since when did you ever listen to the boss?
Severe showers all over northern
Connecticut and New Hampshire.
- I know, I see that.
- rain in Lennox County...
- flooding throughout
Lennox County and closure...
- I can't let you through. The road's closed.
- What's going on?
- I got this.
- There's a sinkhole.
- Hi, Bob.
- You picked a hell of a night for a drive.
There's a sinkhole up here, you can't get through. Sorry.
- What should I do?
- Go a quarter of a mile down, take a left...
You know that bridge that Doug and I fish at?
- Yeah, the little white one?
- That's the one.
- Yeah.
- You can go across there.
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, tell Doug to give me a call.
Will do.
- Doug, you're home?
- Yeah, where are you?
I got detoured, so I'll be home in a few minutes, okay? How was Willow Creek?
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big mess.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Doug.
Doug!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Hey!
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm a doctor. I'm gonna take you to the hospital. I'm a doctor, honey.
I'm gonna help you, okay?
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna help you, okay?
Help me!
Somebody!
Dr. Graham!
You better tell me why I'm in here, Irene.
She got up wild.
- Bring your ass back in here.
- Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan.
- Get your hands off me.
- Stay in the cell.
- Keep her off.
- Restrain her.
Keep her off of me. Get off of me.
Do you hear me? Get off of me.
Hold on. Calm...
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?
Thank you, nurse.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she calmed down.
This is so sad.
Miranda, this is very awkward.
I suppose that technically
I shouldn't even be treating you...
...but I managed to get the court to grant us a waiver until you're transferred.
Anything we discuss is in strict confidence...
...and won't go anywhere but this room.
How long have I been in here?
Three days.
Why? Why?
You were admitted to our neurosurgical unit, you were seizing violently.
We did scans and they revealed left-sided weakness, numbness...
...severe frontal-lobe deficits.
You received Haloperidol, Ativan injections.
When you came out of it, we tested.
You were negative for PCP.
But you were put in restraints for a day and a half so you wouldn't injure yourself.
And then you basically went into a state of catatonia.
This is the first time I've seen you lucid.
I wanna talk to my husband.
Where is he? Where is he?
You know, you're the most logical person I know, bar none.
You rely only on the facts.
So why am I telling you this?
You're establishing my personality.
You think I'm a rational person.
You don't think I'm impulsive or emotional.
And following this pattern of analysis, we are about to discuss...
...a traumatic event which has rendered this psychological profile useless.
- You think I'm in denial.
- Don't analyze yourself...
...just focus on remembering.
Miranda...
...what's the last thing you remember?
I remember Chloe.
I was having my Friday night session with Chloe.
How did that go?
She was embellishing her rape story.
- I saw Doug.
- Dr. Graham.
You were there.
When I went back to my office,
I worked on Chloe's file.
I decided to call it quits, I went down to the pool, had a swim, 55 laps...
...saw Joe, got my keys.
Went to my car. You walked me to it.
- Yes.
- But...
- There was a detour.
- Oh, hey, tell Doug...
I had to go over the bridge, so I went over the bridge.
I wonder what else happened.
Try to remember.
I got home.
I saw Doug. He was on the couch.
Try to remember.
There was a girl.
- Yeah, there was a girl.
- No, there was no...
Yeah, there was a girl.
- A girl at the bridge.
- There was no report...
- There was some kind of accident.
- No.
- The girl was bloody. On the bridge...
- I want to ask you about Doug.
What's the last thing you remember?
Why are you asking about Doug?
I'm telling you about a girl I saw.
Was there any trouble in your marriage?
No, there was no trouble in my marriage.
And why are you using the past tense of the word?
Miranda...
...you don't remember anything about Doug? Anything at all?
Don't tell me something's wrong with Doug.
I have to tell you something.
Something very difficult.
No, no, no...
- Don't tell me there's something with Doug.
- Miranda...
...Doug is dead.
You killed him.
- No! No! No!
- Orderly!
I didn't.
- No, I didn't.
- Orderly!
I didn't! I didn't do it! No!
No! No! No, don't do it!
- It's okay.
- I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I'm on your side.
I'm on your side.
One little bit more.
Rita. Let go.
It's Dr. Grey.
Look it up. Don't look at me like that.
I'm the official champion again.
Hello, Miranda. Welcome.
You're one of us now.
You know I don't belong here, Chloe.
If you're here, it must mean that you belong.
You are not a doctor in here.
And even if you tell the truth...
...no one will listen.
You know why? Because you're crazy.
And the more you try to prove them wrong...
...the crazier you appear.
You are invisible now.
Can you feel it?
Don't touch me.
Are you scared?
No.
You should be.
I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming.
Dream logic, primary process, that's what this is.
I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming.
Rise and shine, honey. It's a new day.
I wanna talk to Pete.
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time, but now I want you to have some breakfast.
- Why are you doing this to me, Irene?
- I'm just doing my job.
You don't want me to get Jim to help me, now do you?
Good girl. You're doing good.
Come on, sweetheart, now it's time for a shower.
Come on, honey, time to wash away your sins.
You're a nut.
Yeah, it's you. You.
Get away. Get away.
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
I looked away for a second.
It's unacceptable.
It's not your fault.
Patients always find a way to hurt themselves, if that's what they want.
I never pegged her for a cutter, that's all.
Neither did I.
Shelley says Chloe's been threatening Miranda...
...so I put her in isolation for the day.
How is she?
She's a mess.
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly.
I've never seen that before.
She cut herself 35 times, a lot of blood, but it's superficial.
- What was the implement?
- Probably a scalpel...
...though how anybody got it in there, I have no idea.
Hey, Tony. We're fine.
Come on.
You think I did this to myself, don't you?
Did you?
No.
Well, I don't know.
Who would it be, then? Would it be...
...Chloe, or...?
I don't know.
By your own admission you have difficulty...
...distinguishing what's reality from fantasy, so is it possible?
Yeah, as a doctor,
I understand why you think that.
But something is really happening to me.
What about this moment, right now?
What about it?
Is this a hallucination?
Is it?
I suggest that we simply increase the medication...
...until things make sense.
Or maybe until I can get myself a new doctor.
Pardon?
Since I'm hallucinating and I can't seem to remember things...
...you can help me with something.
Yeah. Inhale.
Did we have an affair?
No.
Did you want to?
Yes.
Did you think I wanted to?
Yes.
Then why didn't we?
Because you were married to the boss.
But I'm not now.
I'm here... I'm...
I'm trying to help you.
Why don't you trust me?
Because you can't trust somebody when they think you're crazy.
Phil.
Hello, Miranda.
I need to talk to you for a minute.
This is about Pete.
What about him, Miranda?
I don't think he's the best doctor to be treating me.
Is your complaint about him on a personal level?
Pete's the best doctor
I have on my staff now.
And he has my full support.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miranda.
- Miranda.
- Hi, Teddy.
- How are they treating you?
- Like I'm crazy, Teddy.
- They think I did it, but I didn't do it.
- All right. Thank you.
- I didn't do it, Teddy.
- Have a seat.
Let's not...
Let's not talk about what you did or didn't do, all right?
What's important is what
I can do for you now.
Now, the DA is pushing for a hearing as early as next week.
Next week? We haven't even had time to investigate.
We can't have a hearing next week.
As your attorney, I gotta tell you the evidence is overwhelming.
You've been placed at the scene.
The sheriff saw you driving home.
The neighbors heard the screams.
They've got the murder weapon with your prints on it.
Your prints are on the floor, walls, everything.
Yeah, but what's my motive?
I don't have a motive, Teddy.
Why would I do that?
Maybe one of his ex-patients came.
Has anybody checked the files?
Has anybody escaped?
That person would have a motive.
I was there, and I would scream.
- Maybe I went into shock.
- Miranda.
The only shot we have is to plead temporary insanity.
And I don't even know if that's gonna work.
You're a brilliant psychiatrist.
That will make jurors think
"If she wanted to kill somebody...
...she could probably fake insanity and get away with it."
I'm not crazy.
- That's the point.
- No, the point is...
...I'm the only one around here that believes I didn't kill my husband!
Do you think I'm crazy?
That's all right. Forget it.
Forget it.
Sheriff Ryan is here.
He'd like to talk to you.
You know he was Doug's best friend, so I'd advise against it.
It's fine, Teddy.
I don't have anything to hide.
Five minutes.
Hi, Bob.
Miranda.
I just have a few questions that we need to clear up.
When you first came in and he was sitting on the couch...
...the way we reconstruct the crime is that the first blow came from in front of him.
Which means he must have seen it coming.
And what we don't understand is how he...
- Why did you do it?
- Sheriff.
How could you kill Doug like that?
He loved you.
- That's the only question I need answered.
- You don't have to answer any questions.
I don't have any answers to the questions, Bob.
You don't? You better start thinking of some answers, because you're in some trouble.
- Sheriff, that's enough. That's enough!
- No, no, no.
I need her to tell me why she did it.
Okay, we're done. Enough!
Let's kill your friend, see how you feel!
- You said no shock treatment.
- Here's some shock treatment!
- Stop it. Why would you take these out?
- Don't look.
Don't look at them.
I had to pick him up off the floor, Miranda.
In pieces!
Miranda, what's that?
It's okay. It's okay, Miranda.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Miranda, let's just go. We're done.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?!
Come in, Miranda.
Please, take a seat.
So...
You wanted to see me.
I was there.
I was there when Doug was killed.
But I wasn't alone.
I wasn't there alone, and that's what "not alone" means.
- Who was there with you?
- I don't know who it was.
I don't know. I don't know who it was.
But somebody else was there.
Miranda.
We know you have no family left.
We are your family now.
I know. I know you...
I know.
I want you to know that we're gonna do everything we possibly can...
...to help you and to make you feel secure.
And to make you feel that you can trust us here.
But there's a hearing scheduled.
- Miranda. Sit down.
- Just... Come on, sit down.
Miranda.
Who is this girl?
- Put the picture back.
- Who is this girl?
That's my daughter, Rachel.
No, this is the girl I saw at the bridge.
This is the girl.
- No.
- How is she? Where is she?
- It's impossible.
- This is the girl I've been seeing.
This girl, right here.
She's dead.
Rachel died four years ago.
I'm a rational person.
I believe in science.
I don't believe in the paranormal.
And I don't believe in ghosts.
But if you are the ghost of Rachel Parsons...
...then you would let me out of this cell.
Bob, you leave this?
Shit. Pete's office.
Chloe.
Chloe!
Help me!
Let me go! Let me go!
Check Chloe! Check Chloe!
She needs help!
- Did you talk to Chloe?
- Yes.
- Was she raped?
- Was she raped? No.
- Why?
- Did you check her?
Did I...? She was checked.
Of course she was checked.
- He didn't have time.
- He?
- What about her face? She had a cut.
- She ran into a wall. She did that to herself.
I saw a tattoo. Did she talk about a tattoo?
- Why don't you sit down. A tattoo?
- Yeah, a tattoo.
A woman in flames, hands up like this:
Like a Biblical image.
The Anima Sola?
- Yeah, the Anima Sola. That's what I saw.
- It's a common archetypal image.
I mean, it's the woman in chains, awaiting her fate.
I'm talking about something I saw on the chest of a man.
- That's what I saw.
- You're in crisis.
This image is tailor-made for your state of mind.
A woman in purgatory.
I need you to explain this to me, though.
- Rachel Parsons did not commit suicide.
- She jumped off a bridge.
- When I saw her...
- She was washed downstream five miles.
- She was cut up.
- You saw her?
- Yes, I saw her. Someone did that to her!
- Police, newspapers, coroner are wrong?
- Let's reopen the case.
- Maybe they should!
- I saw her. And she's connected to me.
- Delusions, hallucinations...
- How, I don't know.
...disorganized speech, incoherence...
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit!
I know it like the back of my hand!
Good.
Saves me the trouble.
Glass cells are having electrical problems.
I'm gonna transfer you to a Psych Ward cell.
One strike, you're going to solitary.
Don't screw up.
Rachel Parsons was there.
Dead or alive, I don't know.
That girl came to me.
She came to me.
Hi, Chloe.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I need you to tell me who did this to you.
Tell me his name, Chloe.
Chloe, tell me.
Tell me anything. Tell me.
I'll tell you one thing:
He can have my body...
...but he will never have my soul.
Never.
The devil.
It's okay.
It's okay.
He said you're next.
- Try to stay awake.
- Yes, ma'am.
If you need me, I'll be in the coffee room.
Lights out.
Leave me alone!
- Doesn't even look like a real ant.
- It's got disco balls for eyes.
- '50s B movies, man.
- Giant bug movies are great.
Hey, what is that?
It's Dr. Grey.
She's trying to kill herself.
Level C, we've got suicidal behavior in cell 33. Sending backup.
Open it!
Dr. Grey's in trouble!
Number 33, open it now!
Oh, damn.
Damn, what a mess.
- Hold her, I'll medicate her.
- What the hell for? She's already out.
Don't argue with me.
Jesus! Easy, easy.
No, don't hurt me.
Stop her! She's got my keys, stop her!
Shit!
Hey! Hey!
Wait! Hey!
We got a runner! Inmate escaping!
Block Three!
- Stay with me.
- All right.
She's gone this way. Let's go!
Clear!
Split up! Keep moving!
She's going up the North Tower!
Shit!
Shit!
Hey! It's already open!
She's on the upper level!
Hold it right there!
- Dr. Grey!
- We're on Three, she's heading for One!
Go! Go!
Go the other way!
Circle back.
Come on, Hank.
Don't think she made it to this building anyway.
Yeah, but even so, there's no way she can get out.
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts, the more overtime we make.
- You should be a professor.
- Professors always nail the pretty students.
Let's go. I don't think she's in here.
I got it.
Is it clear there?
We checked corridors Four and Five.
- It's cool. We're headed to Six and Seven.
- Yeah. It's Joe, up at the desk.
- What's going on down there?
- Looks dark down there.
What do you mean, what do I mean?
Look, this is the fourth time this month this has happened. Never mind.
- Ye... Thank you.
- Finally.
- Took long enough.
- Shit.
Hey, Joe.
You see something?
Yeah, just now when the monitors came on.
Corridor Six, something flashed in front of the camera.
Frank, East Wing. Don, take the West.
I'll take the stairs.
Here, take my car.
Go. Go.
Go on.
What do you want from me?!
Okay. Now what?
Miranda, no!
Doug?
No. No, Miranda, no.
Miranda, don't! No, don't, please!
Please! No! Miranda, no!
No, please!
Please! Don't do this to me! No!
Don't! No! Miranda, no, wait!
Don't do this to me, please, Miranda!
Miranda, no! Don't! No!
Don't do this to me, Miranda!
Miranda, please!
I love you.
What did I do?
Why?
Why?
Why me?
Why? Why?
Willow Creek.
How was Willow Creek?
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big damn mess.
I'll see you in a couple of days.
It's good to be God.
I love you.
- Drop the knife!
- Drop the gun!
Put it on the ground now!
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the knife!
- You drop it!
- Holy Christ.
What?
Help me, please!
Help!
Carter, get down here now!
Help me, please!
Please!
All I can tell you is that the girl has been identified as Tracy Seavers.
She was reported missing two weeks ago.
She was found this morning by two patrolmen in Willow Creek...
...at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas Grey.
She is now hospitalized.
Can she speak?
Has she told you anything?
- We can't comment on that.
- Are there others?
We can't confirm that. Excuse me.
Sheriff, is the FBI taking over this investigation?
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI?
We need her at the hospital for medication.
Consider house arrest pending trial, given the circumstances.
Last night, your client dropped a guard...
...assaulted a nurse, escaped from an institution, stole a car...
And saved a girl's life.
- How did she know she was there?
- I don't know.
- But the point is...
- The woman is still a murder suspect!
Come here.
The FBI says there could be more victims.
There were needles down there, a video camera.
Once the press gets ahold of it, it'll get big and ugly.
Now, I need some answers, and I'm running out of time.
So your client isn't going anywhere until my team...
I need to talk to her.
It's hard to believe
Doug did something like this.
We worked together a long time.
I thought I knew him pretty well.
How could I be so blind?
Well, you weren't the only one, Phil.
Do you think my daughter could also have been a victim of Doug's?
Yes.
That's what "not alone" means.
Rachel was trying to tell me that she was not Doug's only victim.
And all this time...
...we thought our baby had committed suicide.
You see...
...even after she was gone...
Well...
What?
I had this recurring dream about her.
Eventually I took medication to block it out.
What kind of dream?
She was burning in flames, in terrible pain.
I couldn't save her.
I saw her exactly the same way, burning in flames.
What does that mean?
Miranda, I... I...
I wouldn't look for a real-world explanation.
It's a dream, a delusion.
A delusion that we both seem to share.
- Yeah.
- Pete.
I was just talking to Parsons.
I've been wrong about everything until now.
It's finally clear to me.
The image is finally clear.
The man raping women in prison is connected to the murders.
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo.
Miranda, you have to stop doing this.
Do you understand me?
Every time people start taking you seriously,
you start talking about delusions again.
I'm not deluded, Pete, I'm possessed.
I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I, but they believe in me.
Great, just great.
Let's go. Come on.
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan.
He's working with the FBI team.
He won't be back tonight.
It's really important.
I'll leave him a message.
Thank you.
Screw it.
I got a message you wanted to talk to me?
Yeah, Bob.
I wanna talk to you.
Maybe this time you can actually hear me.
Because the last time, all you wanted to do was scream and yell and accuse me...
- Is this what you wanna talk to me about?
- No. I wanna talk about the facts.
They're a little different now, right?
Do you have any idea what happens to a small-town sheriff when the FBI takes over?
- If you know anything, anything...
- Not alone.
What?
Not alone.
I know what it means.
There are two killers.
Parsons and I both saw a girl burning in flames.
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body.
A woman burning in flames. Get it?
Okay, it's crazy. I know it sounds crazy.
Pete has told me it's crazy.
- You told Pete? When?
- Yes.
Yes.
This afternoon. Why?
I don't think you're crazy at all.
And I don't know why he would dismiss it.
- You actually saw this tattoo?
- Yes, I saw it. On a man.
I've heard of serial killers who hunt together.
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome.
So we're looking for the disciple?
Who could it be?
- I don't know.
- You're a psychiatrist.
What kind of guy would this have to be?
Okay.
He would have to be someone who grew up in a household...
...that had an absent father.
He developed...
...an obsessive, over-dependent relationship with his mother...
...which then turned into some inappropriate sexual attraction.
He probably even got off torturing little animals as a kid.
And as a man he is totally confused about his sexuality.
That's who he is.
Man, that's screwed up.
But a guy like that could seem smart and normal, right?
Yeah, they usually do. Yeah.
Look, Miranda, I don't wanna scare you...
...but if there is a second killer out there, he is frantically trying to cover his trail.
You're a big threat to this guy.
Who knows how much more you know?
I don't know anything else.
You saw the tattoo, found the girl at the barn.
Yeah, but I found all that by instinct.
This guy is facing the electric chair.
He doesn't have the luxury of believing in instinct or ghosts.
He's gotta believe that Doug confessed to you what he was doing.
But he didn't confess.
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud, but...
Well, you know, you're a psychiatrist.
There's a lot of ways to confess.
I'm just trying to put myself in this guy's place.
Then why didn't he go back to Willow Creek?
- Take care of the girl, clean up evidence?
- Yeah.
Well, that's how you get caught.
You panic.
Better to let the dust settle.
But about you...
...he's desperate.
- Yeah?
Desperate enough to...
...talk to me?
Well, you're right.
I do fit the profile.
Longtime friend of Doug's, access to the prison.
I never did get a kick out of torturing animals, though.
Stop it!
- No!
- Yes!
- You can't kill me!
- I'm not gonna kill you.
After this kicks in, I'm gonna have a lot more fun with you than Doug ever did.
Help!
Miranda!
Damn it!
Help me! Help!
Help me!
Okay.
You tried to escape, Miranda.
That means I can do whatever I want to you.
Rachel wasn't the first, you know.
Doug killed a girl when he was
15 years old!
I helped him bury the body.
What are best friends for?
We got older. But I gotta tell you...
...you never lose your taste for the young girls.
Then we stopped for a long time.
But then Dougie saw sweet Rachel and...
That was an itch way too deep not to scratch.
And then we had the time of our lives out at Willow Creek.
Everything was perfect.
Those girls would do anything.
We were their god.
Until you...
Miranda!
You and I both know you're not getting out of here.
So let's be logical...
...and end this thing.
Thank you, Miranda.
Rachel?
This isn't logical.
You're already dead!
Logic is overrated.
I'm sorry, Miranda.
So it's been almost a year and I still have bad dreams.
Sometimes I wake up screaming.
That's normal.
No, not these dreams.
Everyone thought you and I were crazy...
...but we were seeing the truth.
More than they could see.
Once you open the door, you can never close it.
Not true. I closed it.
Then I locked it...
...and then I threw away the key.
I really hope that's true.
You know, my train leaves in half an hour.
Okay. I'll get you on your way.
So good luck with your job, okay?
I wanted to thank you for what you did.
You really helped me.
You helped me.
You taught me how to listen.
Thank you.
We made it.
No!

Towards, I cannot without.
I cannot without.
Towards, return.
Have you still dead presidents?
- Lenny, him return his pair of spectacles but.

Do not work hard you from, maid. Close but
At the back in the file for Blake.
Do do not want to hear you the remainder then?
- No, I that story am so sat.
But this is not just a story.
- Tell further.
Abel Frye a pus was.
He got what with the girl
Of the part of the school.
That boy pestered Abel always.
- That had to miscarry.
She gave him the ticket stuff everyone
In was. He wept as a kid.
And in the forbidden wing ...
- Keelde he her.
He slaughtered hair.
The forbidden wing?
- If there deaths fall, is the forbidden.
Look, after he her
Had stabbed to death, he hung up.
His spirit roams now by the school
And he gets everybody that 'm calls up.
Like Ian Snyder
And his club with madmen?
How come you to this?
- Crystal Sparks' work hangs everywhere.
Abel has foreseen it now
On the spetters from it football-team.
Jimmy Boltz was the third all.
What smell you, jochie?
What there occurs, jochie?
Is that it?
What smell you well, Max?
There something sits
On this ticket of 50 dollars.
Do your him know occasional?
Listen Lenny,
She nothing deserved.

Apart can break?

We be even busy.
Do be sometimes problems?
We be busy, I said.
Twister is nice, he?
- Get 'm, Blake.
Against that study spheres?
There I fail on along.
Stuff has Abel his neck opgerekt?
- In the forbidden wing.
That we evade.
- Why?
That you see still.
- We do not go there in, heard.
The old wing has been renewed,
Just like the whole school ...
Maartoen runs out the money.
He, he is open.
In the dictionary is mentioned bans
A picture of dead bystander.
Do you do not go along or yet?
He hangs there no more, heard.
The spirit escaped
In it lop in the walls.
Then he must be in the master builders
And not in us.
Stuff is them along busy?
- She is crazy.
Does everything be fine still, maid?
- Yes, other allows I call well know.
You have a bump on your head, but
With what ice pulls off that well again.
Knocked down by a spirit?
What have been taken place, rate?
- Something has or someone struck me.
Really not ordinary cases?
What is it last what you have seen?
- Stars.
She is again the old man.
And before?
- When I have seen someone.
From this world,
Or from the next?
Why did not close you the school?
The half of the parents intends that also,
The remainder wants that their offspring succeeds.
The school management intends probably be that
That footballers the case not bottles.
Abel Frye has been the only exiled.
- De Jongs that hung up.
I accept that everybody at school
This picture has seen well once.
Abel Frye is rather
A school legend be.
... There is something wrong goes without food.
- Completely not.
You have such tin of on-school-sits
A-boy-that-I-find-nice.
Nonsense. We be now undercover,
So I must stay well in my role.
Everybody has fallen
For my role as popular maid.
I not. I am older then you.
- 2 minutes.
But this is something otherwise.
I know jou.
Can you keep a secret?
- Yes, that I vow.
It is something between jou and me
And everybody that I call later tell.
Goh what funny, Elijah.
If I would find someone there nice
And I do not say that that so is ...
Maarstel, what can go wrong there then?
We move frequenter then gypsies.
I am pleased quite with this life ...
But sometimes I wonder well once
How mean other life.

STACEY: Josie should let him take some nudes.
STACEY: Wayne takes awesome nudes.
TOM: That's gonna happen.
- You have a problem with that?
- Yeah, a huge problem.
I don't want my girlfriend's naked body all over the Internet.
Nudes, idiot. Not girlie pictures.
Wayne's an artist.
He's not a pornographer.
- Here, you don't believe me?
- No.
Look.
TOM: Yeah, fine, whatever.
They're ethereal.
They're sensual and erotic.
They're naked pictures.
Look at them. Just say it how it is.
You're afraid when everyone sees what a hot piece of ass Josie is, you'll lose her.
It's safer just to keep her as a part-time waitress.
I am not afraid of losing her.
Okay, then what's the big deal?
- Be supportive. Stop being a prick.
- Me?
You started this. You talked her into this whole damn thing.
"You should be a model.
You'll make a load of money."
Why not? Your chick has it going on.
Besides, she ain't gonna pay for medical school by waitressing.
You should stop treating her like a possession.
She's a smart girl.
Money won't buy her. So stop trying.
Why does she keep breaking plans with me? That's what I want to know.
All right, so why are you asking me?
'Cause you're her friend.
That's right. I am her friend.
And I don't talk about her business.
Did you and Josie have another fight?
You guys sit around and talk about it?
What happened to not talking about other people's business?
Okay. You did get in another fight.
You know what? Fuck you. Fuck her.
And fuck both you guys.
Yeah. In your dreams.

Officer down!
[Tense instrumental music]
McGOWAN: Oh, my God!
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[DarkWolf growling]
[DarkWolf growling]
McGOWAN: He tore through the back panel... between the prisoner compartment and the driver's cab... killed the driver and Detective Hartigan, then got away.
Broke through the access doors.
I've never seen anything like it.
Hey. Where are we going?
Do yourself a f·vor, McGowan.
Don't ask any questions right now.
This is some secret operation, right?
You're DEA.
FBI?
Or maybe working with the DEA or FBI?
I need a little help understanding here.
We just bailed on a crime scene.
What's going on around here?
Why the shiny guns?
What happened in the truck?
They teach you to ask all these questions back in school, McGowan?
Just because you were assigned to me for a few days to learn the ropes... doesn't give you the right to come in here and start asking.
All right, I understand on graduation day at the Academy... they make you feel bright and shiny... and on top of the world, like you know everything.
But you don't.
This is the real world.
Things go on out here.
Things you've never heard of
Things you can't explain.
Never seen anything rip through steel like that, that's for sure.
I really don't have time to get you up to speed.
I suggest you do what I say, when I say... and maybe we'll make it through tonight in one piece.
- That's not good enough for me.
- I lost my partner tonight!
He's dead!
There are people out there... that are going to die tonight that have no idea!
That thing that killed him
is still running around.
I suggest we focus.
All right, McGowan.
I'll give you the 99-cent answer to all your questions.
Take good notes, because I'm only going through this once.
Remember the Moonlight Slasher murders?
McGOWAN: Yes, of course.
The Moonlight Slasher is a werewolf
McGOWAN: A werewolf
TURLEY: Yes, a werewolf
Half man, half wolf.
Try to keep up, McGowan.
- I don't understand.
- Stop trying to understand.
Listen.
McGOWAN: But werewolves?
TURLEY: Yes, I know. Werewolves.
They exist. They're very real. Get over it.
I'm gonna tell you exactly what Hartigan told me two years ago... when I first came onto this detail.
There's werewolves and there's hybrid werewolves.
The werewolves are normal.
Normal werewolves.
You're shitting me.
You must've got cracked in the head back there.
You saw what that thing did back there.
You saw what happened to Hartigan.
Tell you something?
Around 900 years ago... a human Saxon knight mated with a werewolf
Boom. We got hybrid werewolves.
The biker guy back there, the one that got away... who killed Hartigan and the other officer... ripped through solid steel, made you shit your pants?
He's a hybrid werewolf
And he's out there right now... searching out the next matriarch pureblood.
He needs to mate with her.
Breed out the next generation of pureblood werewolves.
That's the end of the history lesson.
This is where we come in.
I don't give a shit how or why these hybrids exist.
But they do.
They are enough of a problem... that there's an office behind the Detective's Bureau... dedicated to dealing with them.
That, before tonight, was Detective Hartigan and me.
TURLEY: Now it's just me.
McGOWAN: Wait.
Just slow the fuck down!
You expect me to believe all this crap?
I really don't care what you believe!
All right?
My partner is dead tonight.
A very good cop was killed, a good friend of mine.
I sure as hell don't plan on letting that thing get away with it.
You're either with me or you're not.
You have exactly zero seconds to decide.
McGOWAN: Give me a second!
Fine! Okay? Fine!
Welcome to the party.
McGowan?
The day started out so normal.
[lndistinct talking]
Soup and salad and grilled cheese sandwich.
I'll take Mary's dinner.
Mary, got your f·vorite.
MARY: Bless you, child.
You shouldn't have gone through all the trouble. I do just fine.
It's such a relief to sit down.
It's a beautiful moon.
I could sit and stare at that for hours.
Are you feeling all right?
Yeah. I'm feeling fine. Why?
Maybe you should just take it easy tonight.
Go home early. Curl up with a good book.
Tonight is not a good night to be out.
What are you, a fortune teller or something?
No, I just know things.
Then tell me my future.
Tell me that I'm going to be rich and f·mous... and that I'm gonna be accepted to medical school... and do something really important and really special.
I don't know. Sometimes...
I feel like there's something... that I'm supposed to do.
Like a calling or something.
I don't know.
How long have you felt like this?
My whole life.
More so lately.
Why are you always so concerned about me?
You're always looking after me.
How come?
I suppose you could just say it's in my blood.
Well, go on. It's your f·vorite.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to touch you.
It's all right.
I'd better get back to work.
Good night.
Good night, Josie.
DISPATCHER: 19-Adam-4, please respond.
2- Adam-7, please respond.
That's us.
No. No more radio.
- Not tonight.
- But how...
Never mind.
These look like silver.
You don't miss much, do you, McGowan?
[Deep growling]
[lntense instrumental music]
You can't be hungry.
I gotta talk to somebody.
Mary?
Lance is gone, Mary.
We had him.
He tore through solid steel.
Killed Lance, got away.
[Tense instrumental music]
TURLEY: It was unlike anything
I'd ever seen before.
He was stronger than all the others combined.
Detective McGowan. She's all right.
What did he look like?
Biker. Low-rider type.
Leather, denim, tattoos.
DarkWolf
Who's a dark wolf
It's not who, it's what.
Help me stop it.
I have been protecting this bloodline for 900 years.
I'm sorry, can someone clue me in here?
For nine centuries this has been handed down... from protector to matriarch on the eve of her first transformation.
The beast that you encountered tonight is like no others.
He's much stronger and much more dangerous.
He's a dark prince.
A king in waiting. DarkWolf
What's he waiting for?
He's not waiting for, he's searching for.
He seeks the girl.
He desires to mate with her.
Wait. You're saying this dark prince... is Prince Charming and this girl's some sort of Cinderella?
You're catching on, Snow White.
How do I stop this thing before anyone else dies?
DarkWolf is not going to be easily defeated.
He can only be killed with silver through the eye.
The man that you met, the biker, he is the human form of DarkWolf
You know, if this thing is looking for this girl... seems to me you got the girl, you get the bad guy.
You're just as smart as a dull tack, aren't you?
I've had just about as much as I'm going to take from you two.
Mary, she's right.
If this girl's in danger, she should know so she can be protected.
No. There can be absolutely no interference.
The girl must see the signs for herself
She must feel the burning of the first transformation.
Without that,
she will never know her destiny.
If he tracks her down and mates with her, my race will perish... and there will be more soldiers of darkness coming.
And without us, they will conquer your race as well.
Humans will be no more.
[Tense instrumental music]
[lntense instrumental music]
[Deep growling]
[Eerie instrumental music]
McGOWAN: Where's the fire?
JOSIE: Sorry.
McGOWAN: Let me help you.
JOSIE: Thank you.
Thanks.
No turkey sandwich tonight, Turley?
No, not tonight.
Just waiting for a couple of coffees to go.
Here. I'll get that.
TURLEY: Nice.
What's that?
Sunglasses.
Who's that in the bathroom?
Where's Hartigan tonight?
He died earlier tonight.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
TURLEY: You didn't know. It's all right.
JOSIE: What happened?
Arrest went bad.
God. You guys come here all the time.
I'm really, really sorry.
Thanks.
Hey, girl. You're looking hot. You ready?
Hey, babe. What's up?
I just gotta go clock out.
You guys go sit in a booth over there.
I'll be there in a minute.
STACEY: Move it, chick.
Tom.
Right, we'll be in this booth right here.
What is the matter with you? Trying to mess things up between the two of you?
- Who does this guy think he is?
- Who?
This guy right here.
- You mean that guy there?
- Yes.
Yeah, you know something, you're right.
The nerve of that asshole.
He's just sitting there, saying nothing, paying no attention to us... totally minding his own business.
I say we kick his ass. Come on.
[Deep growling]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Screams]
- Thanks for the coffees.
- I'm sorry about your partner.
[McGowan screaming]
TURLEY: Somebody call an ambulance!
McGOWAN: I saw it, tried to shoot...
TURLEY: Don't talk.
Mary.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Loud growling]
Hang on. Help's on the way.
Stay back!
Take her quickly, before it returns.
Who? Take who?
The girl. Take the girl.
Who's the girl, Mary?
I don't know who the girl is.
Her?
You have to protect her now.
I can't any longer.
What about the other protectors like you?
I am the last.
I'm not a protector, Mary.
I can't baby-sit some girl.
If you have the girl, it will come to you.
Don't let her touch anyone.
- What?
- lf she touches the skin...
DarkWolf will follow that scent... and it will kill them.
She's a waitress, Mary.
She could have touched hundreds of people.
You are all she has now.
The silver bullet... will protect you.
[Police siren blaring]
What's going on? What happened?
Are you okay?
TURLEY: Come on.
Wait. Where are we going?
You're just going to leave her here?
Detective McGowan's inside.
TURLEY: Come on.
TOM: In a fucking minute!
Back off!
- Who are you?
- Police.
Back off.
I'm her boyfriend. She's coming with me.
We'll wait for you in Wayne's apartment.
This is so not cool.
OFFICER: Everyone needs to go back.
STACEY: Come on. Let's go.
OFFICER: Did anybody know this woman?
What is this?
[Eerie instrumental music]
[lntense instrumental music]
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
You were friends with Mary?
She was a nice old lady.
She never caused any problems for anyone.
I used to bring her food when she'd show up.
Mary ever talk to you about anything?
Sometimes. Why?
TURLEY: Anything in particular?
Where are we going?
- Am I under arrest or something?
- No, you're not under arrest.
Look, if I'm not under arrest, I want you to take me back to my friends now.
- I can't do that.
- What?
I know my rights, okay?
I didn't do anything.
You're in protective custody, all right?
- A material witness.
- A witness to what?
I didn't witness anything.
In f·ct, I was busy talking with you... when either of those things happened, if I recall!
TURLEY: It probably isn't making sense...
JOSIE: It's making no sense!
I'm just a cop caught up in the middle of this.
I'm not Mary. I can't do her job.
What does Mary have to do with any of this?
She was protecting you.
A homeless lady?
From what?
All I can do is tell you what she told me, okay?
You're going through a change, a kind of a transformation right now.
[lntense instrumental music]
And because of that, someone's...
Something is trying to track you down.
Why?
To mate with you.
You're saying... that there's something out there... who wants to hook up with me?
Let me go! Damn it!
Let me go! What do you want from me?
I understand this is a lot to deal with right now, okay?
I understand.
I've seen what that thing can do.
Every full moon, this thing goes on a rampage...
Iooking for you.
It's not gonna stop till it finds you.
What am I supposed to do?
I didn't ask for any of this.
It's not your f·ult, all right?
I'm gonna do my best to protect you... but protecting you isn't gonna solve the problem.
I gotta find this thing. I gotta stop it.
TURLEY: You understand?
JOSIE: No.
Josie, I need you to understand.
Okay?
Shit.
- What?
- There's a book.
A book Mary gave me. I lost it.
She gave me a book to give you.
- To give to me?
- Yeah.
She said it would explain what you were going through.
The transformation.
I must have left it back there when I was running around.
Obviously it would've explained everything a hell of a lot better than I can.
Where are we going?
[Sexy instrumental music]
WAYNE: Wow. That's good.
Oh, yeah.
STACEY: Hey, babe.
WAYNE: Where you been?
Whole bunch of shit went down at the diner.
A cop was attacked, and some bag lady got killed.
- Seriously?
- No, I'm kidding. Yeah, seriously.
STACEY: Probably gonna be on the news.
WAYNE: Where's Josie?
Some cop took her away in a car.
Apparently she's some sort of witness.
So we're not shooting?
You pick up on things real f·st.
Well, shit.
I mean, I rescheduled because of her.
Sorry. What do you want me to do?
[Phone ringing]
JOSIE [Voicemail]: It's Josie.
Nice.
Yeah, Anna, Stacey.
Hey.
WAYNE: Shit, Miguel! The film's cold, man!
MIGUEL: It was in the refrigerator.
What do you expect?
You were supposed to take it out of the refrigerator.
I'm a fucking makeup artist, okay?
I'm not a fucking cook, okay?
What is this? She looks like a slut.
I didn't do her makeup, she did.
- You look like a slut.
- Ain't that a bitch.
So what are we doing here?
Waiting to see, I guess.
Cop didn't say how long they'd be.
Assholes!
TOM: Nobody can tell me where she is.
STACEY: You try calling her cell phone?
Yeah, I called her cell phone.
I got her voicemail.
She never turns it on.
- So what do we do? Just sit around?
- Tell me about it.
She'll call when she's done.
You know what? This is bullshit.
I'm not waiting for her to call.
TOM: I'll find out where she is.
STACEY: Where're you going?
STACEY: You don't know where they took her.
I'll start at the nearest police station.
Jeez.
Hey, you.
[lntense instrumental music]
[Loud growling]
[Howling]
[Door slamming and locking]
TOM: Christ!
Son of a bitch!
Don't read someone's private shit.
What's wrong with you?
I thought this was yours.
You're saying if it was mine, it's okay to go reading it?
Maybe there's a name somewhere, a phone number... and we can get it back to them.
Don't go looking through everyone's private shit.
WAYNE: What the hell is this?
This is some weird shit.
Will you guys stop being so goddamn nosey?
This is someone's private thoughts.
No, it's not, babe. I mean, look.
It's some kind of notebook or something.
It's got pictures and drawings and maps and shit.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I don't know. What am I thinking?
No?
[Anna howling softly]
- Dude, I like it.
- And then we go to the roof
Shoot against the moon. Rocking!
You guys are seriously weird.
[Techno music playing]
WAYNE [Recorded voice]: Leave a message.
TOM: Pick up, somebody. Hello?
Yeah, it's Tom.
I went out the wrong door...
and locked myself in the alley.
Come down and let me in.
[Techno music continues playing]
[lntense instrumental music]
[Deep growling]
How's LAPD's finest doing? Any better?
Looks like we need to change this for you.
I'll be right back.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Loud growling]
[Suspenseful music intensifies]
Is this is your girlfriend?
What?
Is this your girlfriend?
No, it's my sister.
She died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
It's got to have made the news.
Expecting to go to war?
Yeah.
TV NEWSCASTER: ... Los Angeles, where
a homeless woman was found dead...
outside this local diner...
ironically, just moments after a police
officer was unexplainably attacked...
inside the diner's restroom.
Now, police sources as of yet
are making no comment.
But the rumors are starting to fly...
that both the homeless woman
and the police officer...
were possibly victims of a wild dog attack.
Now again, this is pure speculation.
There is no need for panic.
That's the guy.
TV NEWSCASTER: Reporting from
downtown...
Who?
The guy I'm looking for.
[Eerie instrumental music]
Do you have a bathroom?
Right there.
Maybe I should...
JOSIE: No, you aren't coming in the bathroom.
[Eerie instrumental music continues]
You okay?
Help me!
You're gonna be all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
[Josie sobbing]
I'm so scared.
Mary was right.
It's happening.
It reversed itself
It may not reverse next time.
That guy on TV... he's the one who's after me?
Yeah.
He's a lycanthrope in human form.
But he has to mate as a wolf
Thank you.
For what?
For being here... helping me.
How did you get involved with all this, anyway?
They have a sign at your office down at the police station... that says Werewolf Hunter or something?
No. Not exactly.
I just sort of backed into it.
A couple of years ago,
I was assigned to my partner.
My former partner.
A lot of the larger metropolitan areas...
Chicago, New York, LA, they have special divisions.
They're assigned to deal with special issues.
- Like werewolves.
- Yeah.
- So they got one for vampires, too?
- Funny you should ask.
No.
There's one good benefit, though.
What's that?
We get to hear all the great werewolf jokes.
Great werewolf jokes?
Yeah, like, what happened to the werewolf that ate too much garlic?
- What?
- His bark was worse than his bite.
That's bad.
- Why was the werewolf running so f·st?
- Why?
He was in a "hairy."
Why was the werewolf arrested in the butcher shop?
Why?
TURLEY: Because he was "chop lifting."
JOSIE: That's awful!
- Or...
- No more! That's bad.
[Soft instrumental music]
You're okay, Steve Turley.
TURLEY: Yeah. You're okay, too, Josie.
I don't even know your last name.
Pagano. Italian.
[Cell phone ringing]
Turley.
What?
When?
I'm on my way.
[Eerie instrumental music]
[Deep growling]
[Howling]
You guys ready?
Let's do it.
[lntense instrumental music]
[DarkWolf growling]
[lntense instrumental music continues]
[Growling]
[Stacey moaning]
[Loud growling]
[Girls moaning]
[DarkWolf growling ferociously]
[Girls sighing heavily]
I got to develop this shit right away.
You don't need to see that.
Why did he attack her again?
Doesn't make sense.
JOSIE: What are you talking about?
TURLEY: Doesn't make sense.
What?
- Who have you touched tonight?
- Touched? What are you talking about?
TURLEY: Have you touched anyone?
Detective McGowan. At the diner, you said you ran into her, right?
JOSIE: What?
TURLEY: What are you talking...
JOSIE: The diner. In the bathroom.
- You said you saw Detective McGowan.
- Yes.
Did you touch her?
I don't know.
- Did you touch her?
- I don't know!
I bumped into her. I dropped my purse and she helped me pick it up.
Yes. She helped me. I did. Why?
Mary said anybody you touched tonight would be imprinted.
What does that mean?
Your touch.
Your touch, your scent.
Anybody that you touch physically, that you have contact with... your scent will be imprinted on them.
He'll seek them out looking for you.
What?
This is my f·ult?
Do you mean that Mary's dead because of me?
Anyone I touch is going to die?
[Somber instrumental music]
Oh, my God.
Tom! Tommy, he touched me. He held me.
When we were watching you and Mary, he held me. He touched me.
Where is he?
Where is he?
I don't know!
He's at my friend Wayne's apartment.
Come on.
- Wayne in the darkroom?
- Yeah.
- Who called?
- I didn't check the machine.
CAROLINE: Hey, Wayne, this is Caroline.
You got my pictures yet?
Bitch.
TOM: Pick up, somebody. Hello?
Yeah, it's Tom.
I went out the wrong door...
and locked myself in the alley.
Come down and let me in.
Oh, my God.
He's been down there this whole time.
We gotta go down and let Tom in.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Tom! You out here?
I wonder how long ago it was he called.
[Heavy metal music playing on headphones]
Maybe he already got in.
Tom!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[DarkWolf growling ferociously]
Somebody let him in.
There's no other way out of here that I know of
Somebody must have let him in.
Let's just check up here a little bit further.
- You coming?
- What the hell else am I gonna do?
[Banging on door]
Somebody answer the fucking door!
Everybody go and no tell me nothing!
What?
- Please, what do you want?
- Where is she?
MIGUEL: Who?
The girl! Where is the fucking girl?
I haven't touched her, whoever she is!
The girl from the diner!
What diner? Josie?
BIKER GUY: Where is she?
MIGUEL: I swear. She didn't show up!
[Heavy metal music playing on headphones]
[Tense instrumental music]
No more, please.
[Growling ferociously]
Fuck me!
[Howling]
Wayne, Stacey, this is Josie.
Get out of there now. No time to explain.
There's something in there. You gotta get out of there! Somebody pick up!
They're not answering.
Tom!
- Where does this go? You know?
- I have no idea. But Wayne would know.
Kind of looks like somebody may have pulled it open recently.
Maybe it leads out.
Tom!
Oh, my God, my phone. I'll just call him.
[Heavy metal music playing on headphones]
What the hell?
[Tom's cell phone ringing]
- You're going in there?
- Yeah, come on.
[Tom's cell phone continues ringing]
STACEY: The ringing, that's his phone.
Tom, where the hell are you?
Watch out.
ANNA: Shit!
I can hear it. Where is it?
Oh, my God!
[lntense instrumental music]
Damn it, knock! What if I had been in the middle of something?
Tom's dead.
He's been stabbed or cut up. Something!
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on!
Oh, dude. This is harsh!
[DarkWolf howling]
Oh, my God!
You saw this and you didn't say anything?
We didn't come up this way.
We came up the back stairs.
We should call the police.
Miguel.
Miguel!
[Eerie instrumental music]
- Over there, you guys.
- No!
Oh, my God! What the hell is going on?
[DarkWolf growling]
STACEY: Help!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Wayne! The fire escape!
Holy shit! Come on!
[Suspenseful music intensifies]
WAYNE: No.
[DarkWolf growling]
Oh, my God. Where are we?
WAYNE: Let's go.
[Howling]
What the fuck is that thing?
I've never seen anything like that before.
This fucking wild animal that escaped from the zoo?
- That's the thing that killed Tom.
- Dude, I don't know.
It looks like... maybe something I saw when I was developing the film we shot.
What are you talking about?
In every shot there was something in the background.
First I was pissed because I thought my lens messed up. You know?
But when I looked at the negative really close, there it was.
It was in every shot.
That thing was up there all that time?
What the hell is it? Fucking rabid dog?
It sounds like a massive wolf or something.
I think you just nailed it right there, babe.
- Nailed what?
- Werewolf
STACEY: Are you sure it wasn't Dracula?
WAYNE: I'm serious, Stace.
I mean that book you found,
the one that we used?
What the hell was that shit all about?
You're saying I brought that thing because of that damn book?
No.
I don't know.
But I know one thing.
I saw what it did to Miguel, Anna, and Tom.
I mean, this thing has got some serious issues.
We gotta get out of here.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
JOSIE: That's Wayne's assistant!
JOSIE: Wayne, Stacey, it's Josie.
Get out of there now. No time to explain.
There's something in there. You gotta
get out of there! Somebody pick up.
[Josie groaning in pain]
Oh, no!
TURLEY: Are you all right?
[Josie screaming]
It's okay.
[lntense instrumental music]
[Josie sniffing like an animal]
Josie.
You can change again.
No!
Transformation.
Transformation.
"First transformation.
"On the night of the first transformation...
"she must be led into the light of the full moon...
"or else she will be locked forever...
"in a limbo between human and werewolf form."
[Josie screaming]
[Howling]
[Josie sobbing]
It's okay.
You think that thing's still down there?
WAYNE: I don't know.
[Banging and howling]
That's a definite resounding yes.
There's a loading dock on the basement floor.
If we can somehow get to that...
That thing's on the ground floor.
That's the way we came in.
You don't wanna go back down there.
I'm going to call Josie again.
God, I hope she didn't go
to the apartment.
- We should get going.
- I know.
[Phone ringing]
JOSIE: Hello?
STACEY: Josie!
Stacey. Where are you?
STACEY: Get out of there.
Josie, get the hell out of there.
There's this thing. It's chasing us.
I know about it already. Where are you?
Wayne and I are stuck in a freight elevator in the old warehouse building.
Tom's dead.
STACEY: That thing got him.
Are you there?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Jo-Jo. I really am.
[Somber instrumental music]
You okay?
Tommy's dead.
My boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
Stacey said the wolf' s got her and her boyfriend trapped... in some freight elevator at the warehouse on Seventh Street.
This is Turley. Where exactly are you?
Hold on. Tell him where we are.
Hi, we're in that old warehouse across from my apartment.
Yeah, I know where it is.
There's a loading dock in front of my building.
All right.
We can be there in a couple of minutes.
Can you make a break for the dock?
Like we have a choice?
TURLEY: How are you doing?
Fine.
[lntense instrumental music]
Yeah. We're at the loading dock.
They're here.
[Whispering] One, two... three!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[DarkWolf growling]
TURLEY: It's close behind us! Move!
What are you waiting for? Go!
JOSIE: Come on, go now!
[DarkWolf growling ferociously]
[All screaming]
I'm sorry about Tom, Jos.
TURLEY: No. Regular bullets won't affect this thing.
Get back to me as soon as you can.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna move you guys down to the basement into a secured structure.
It's an old f·llout bomb shelter.
It has heavy steel doors. They should hold.
I'm not going down to hide in some bomb shelter.
You have to, Josie.
This thing's coming for you.
We've got maybe an hour if we're lucky.
With you safe, I can do what I have to do.
And probably be killed in the process just like your partner. No!
Nobody else is going to die tonight because of me. Especially you.
You're going down into the shelter.
You said it yourself, Steve.
This thing won't stop. It won't give up!
It won't stop, ever!
- I want to help.
- Out of the question.
- I can maybe distract it.
- No.
Long enough for you to get to it.
Look, I don't want to run anymore.
I don't want any more people dying because of me.
This thing ends tonight.
Whatever it takes, it ends tonight.
And I'm helping.
And you understand what you're risking?
I gotta agree with the cute cop here, Jos.
I don't like the idea.
You putting yourself out there like some bait for this thing.
JOSIE: It's my decision.
I need to help.
All right. But you two are down in the shelter.
If she's not going, we're not going either, right, Wayne?
JOSIE: This isn't your problem.
You have to go.
No way.
Look, I can protect her, maybe.
That's gonna be hard enough.
- But all three of you, impossible.
- Deal with it, dude.
I can order you down into the shelter, all right?
And we'd resist. And then you'd have to arrest us and put us in jail... and we'd still be here.
All right. We don't have a lot of time.
Maybe 30 minutes left of full moon.
This thing's gonna step up the chase.
That means we gotta be ready.
Let me introduce you to a very good friend of mine.
DESK SERGEANT: Thank you, ma'am.
God damn it!
Man, that was smart.
[Tense instrumental music]
Hey, slick, you forgot to sign in.
Shit!
[Biker Guy growling]
Freeze!
OFFICER: What the hell!
Stay here.
Stay here!
TURLEY: He's in the building!
What do you see?
STACEY: There's a whole bunch of shit going down!
[Guns firing]
It's here.
[Guns firing]
[lntense instrumental music]
OFFICER [Over radio]: Are you there?
What's going on?
What's happening?
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Machine gun firing]
[Rumbling]
[Growling ferociously]
[Guns firing]
[DarkWolf approaching]
[Tense instrumental music]
[DarkWolf growling ferociously]
What the hell is going on out there?
[Crashing]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
We gotta get you guys out of here. Now.
TURLEY: Go.
STACEY: Oh, my God, no.
[DarkWolf growling]
Well, if it isn't the big, bad wolf
What say you and I go for a little walk?
There's a full moon tonight, fucker!
It will be romantic.
[Growling ferociously]
[DarkWolf approaching]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Come on!
I hate to end all this fun but this date is over!
[Josie screaming]
[DarkWolf howling]
JOSIE: Help!
Shoot him in the eye!
Shoot him in the eye!
[Somber instrumental music]
Looks like some fleas are gonna be looking for a new home tonight.
We're done. It's over.
[Soft instrumental music]
So what do you think you'll do now?
I don't know.
I don't think I'll stay here after all this.
Maybe I'll go home and spend some time with my f·mily.
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.
Think you'll tell them about all this?
When they're ready, maybe.
Guess no one's really ready for something like this.
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
Mary would've been proud.
You were a great protector.
Thanks.
You need a lift?
No. I'm okay.
Stacey and Wayne are gonna pick me up.
Okay.
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Yeah, you, too.
[Soft instrumental music continues]
Hey, Pagano.
- Why did the werewolf cross the road?
- Why?
He saw you coming.
No more stupid jokes, Turley.
[Mystical instrumental music]
[Eerie instrumental music]

GRACE: Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?
Then I'll begin.
This story started many thousands of years ago... but it was all over in just seven days.
All that long, long time ago... none of the things we can see now-- the sun, the moon, the stars, the earh... the animals and plants-- not a single one existed. only God existed... and so only He could have created them.
And He did.
[Screaming]
[Sobs]
[Panting]
[gasping]
[Laughter]
MRS. MILLS: Simpson. what a character he was.
I wonder whatever became of him?
MR TUTTLE: Oh, I imagine he's dead like all the rest.
MRS. MILLS:
Ah, those were the days.
[Bell rings]
Mr Tuttle, your hair.
[Lock clicks]
Yes?
Good morning, ma'am. we've come about the--
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
You are...?
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.
And this is Edmund Tuttle.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You must be the gardener.
That's right. The gardener.
And this young lady is called Lydia.
Have you had much experience in service?
Oh, don't let that angel face fool you, ma'am.
She's older than she looks.
Can you iron?
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?
She can't talk, ma'am.
The poor little mite's a mute.
Oh.
Oh, but she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.
All right.
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl... will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs.
-And you, Mr...
-Tuttle, ma'am.
You could sleep in the shed around the back.
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected... since the servants disappeared almost a week ago.
You mean they just vanished?
GRACE: Into thin air.
No notice, nothing. They didn't even collect their wages.
They... they just left us.
MRS. MILLS:
What a strange thing to do.
GRACE: You'll soon find out there are times... when this house is not exactly an ideal home.
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper... requesting honest, hard-working people.
There's nobody more honest or hard-working than us.
Isn't that right, Mr Tuttle?
Oh, aye, we're very honest.
And, um, very hard-working.
The kitchen.
I have breakfast at 8:00... the children at 9:00.
Lunch will be served at 1:00 and dinner at 7:30.
MRS. MILLS:
And the master, ma'am?
The master went off to war... a year and a half ago.
I've had no news since the war ended.
Which of you does the cooking?
MRS. MILLS:
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Which of you does the cooking?
You'll notice what I'm doing.
In this house, no door must be opened... without the previous one being closed first.
It is vital that you remember this.
It's not as easy as it may seem.
There are 15 different keys for all of the 50 doors... depending on which area of the house you're in at the time.
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards...
I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge.
Yes, ma'am.
The music room.
That old piano was already here when we moved in.
Please do not let the children thump away on it.
It sets off my migraine.
Silence is something that we prize very highly in this house.
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio... or anything else that makes a racket.
Oh, we don't have electricity, either.
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off... so we learned to live without it. Let's continue.
Ma'am, there's no need to show us the whole house.
GRACE: Yes!
Yes, there is.
Most of the time, you can hardly see your way.
It's often difficult to make out... if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard... or one of my children playing hide and seek.
What do you mean, ma'am?
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.
[Lock clicks]
Mr Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.
Yes, ma'am.
You two can start closing the curtains.
All of them.
Come.
I'll wake them.
You wait here.
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.
Wakey, wakey.
Now, come on.
Eyes closed, hands together.
CHILDREN:
Let it be, at light of day...
Jesus, to whom now I pray.
Blessed be the Virgin pure... whom I greet with faith too short.
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose... keep us till this day doth close.
They're still half asleep.
MRS. MILLS:
What sweet little children.
Well... what do you say?
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Mills... but you can call me
Bertha if you like.
What are your names?
-Anne.
-Nicholas.
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.
ANNE: Are you going to be our new nanny?
Mm-hmm.
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.
It's time for their breakfast.
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter.
[Keys jingle]
The doctors were never able to find a cure.
For what?
Their condition.
The children have a very serious allergy to light.
They are photosensitive and must never be exposed... to any light much stronger than this. otherwise, in a matter of minutes... they will break out in sores and blisters... and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.
MRS. MILLS: Good heavens.
I don't like this toast.
Oh? Why not?
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.
That's because before, somebody else made it.
When are they coming back?
They're not coming back, child.
Just like Daddy.
Daddy is coming back, though.
Mrs. Mills, our father's fighting in a war in France.
NICHOLAS: It's the World War.
I know, but he's in France.
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.
Are you going to leave us, too?
Of course not!
Why should I leave you?
The others said they wouldn't... but they did, and then it happened.
Be quiet!
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?
Mummy went... mad.
-Nothing happened.
-Yes, it did.
-No, it didn't!
-Yes, it did!
GRACE: Be quiet.
What's going on?
I want those plates empty... in less than a minute.
Is that clear?
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?
I'd like a word with you.
Yes, ma'am.
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.
But I just checked the letter-box... and this week he hasn't.
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.
This letter should have been collected... and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published... would you explain what you're doing here?
Oh, I understand.
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you... when you opened the door to us.
The truth is that we just come by... on the off chance.
A big house like this... is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.
You've served in a house like this one before?
This may come as a surprise to you, ma'am, but...
We, in fact, used to work here.
Here?
Oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am... they were the best years of my life.
That's why we come by, because this house... means a lot to us.
Perhaps I'd best show you our references, ma'am.
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.
So you say you know the house well?
MRS. MILLS:
Like the back of my hand.
That is assuming the walls haven't sprouted legs... and moved in the meantime.
GRACE: The only thing that moves here is the light.
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.
It's rather difficult, to say the least.
One might almost say... unbearable.
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I don't like fantasies.
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?
I think so, ma'am.
My children sometimes have strange ideas.
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.
Children will be children.
Yes, of course, ma'am.
All right. You can stay.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
It did happen.
NICHOLAS: "The Roman governor tried to make them...
"change their minds afterwards..."
"To make them change their minds." Full stop.
-"Afterwards..."
-Mm-hmm.
"He ordered them to be beaten.
"But Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid...
"rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ.
"When he saw this...
"the Roman governor was filled with rage...
"and ordered their heads to be cut off."
[giggles]
[Snickers]
What do you find so amusing?
Well...
Well, what?
Those children were really stupid.
Why?
Because they said they only believed in Jesus... and then they got killed for it.
And what would you have done, deny Christ?
ANNE: Well, yes.
Inside I would have believed in him... but I wouldn't have told the ROMANS that.
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?
I see.
So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.
You'd have saved your heads from the ROMANS, that's true.
But what would have happened afterwards?
When?
In the next life.
The one waiting for us after we die.
Where would you have gone?
Ahh.
Where, Nicholas?
To the children's limbo.
GRACE: What is the children's limbo, Anne?
One of the four Hells.
Which are?
[gasps]
ANNE: Me, me, me! Me!
GRACE: No. Let him answer. which are?
There's the Hell where the damned go... then there's Purgatory...
Yes.
And the bosom of Abraham where the just go... and limbo where children go.
At the center of the earth.
Where it's very, very hot.
That's where children go who tell lies... but they don't just go there for a few days.
Oh, no.
No, they're damned. Forever.
Think about it.
Try to imagine the end of eternity.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.
Forever.
Pain... forever.
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.
Now do you understand... why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
[Sighs] All right.
Open your readers at lesson six.
ANNE: Can't we play?
You most certainly cannot.
First you're going to read the lesson... then you're going to learn it by hear.
All of it?
Any more protests... and there'll be no playing at all today.
In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms.
-CHILDREN: No, no, no!
-GRACE: Yes, yes, yes!
ANNE: But we get scared if we're separated!
GRACE: Scared? As if you weren't used to this house by now.
NICHOLAS:
What if we see a ghost?
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?
I haven't told him anything!
If you see a ghost you say "Hello"... and continue on studying.
-Come to the music room.
-Why me?
Because I say so!
Now come on.
Take your book.
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned... in less than an hour.
-Mummy...
- What?
Give me a kiss.
ANNE: "give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss."
Anne, wait for me outside.
You know I can't.
Over there.
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.
My daughter is going to cross the living room.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, Anne.
[Humming]
Darling...
Mummy can't be with you all the time, hmm?
You must learn to be on your own.
Where's your rosary?
Ahh!
Whenever you feel afraid...
I want you to squeeze it with all your might... say an our Father, and your fear will go away.
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.
Don't you see that when you do that... the Lord is with you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
[Blows kiss]
[Lock clicks]
[Footsteps fading]
[Distant door closing]
NICHOLAS:
"The house and the family.
"We all live in a house with our family.
"The family is usually made up of parents...
"children, and their grandparents.
"We must be obedient..."
ANNE: "... and kind towards other members of our family...
"and we must never argue or fight...
"with our brothers and sisters."
Do you have any children?
MRS. MILLS: No.
Mr Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I've got... and I'm all they've got.
GRACE: Was she born like that?
Beg your pardon, ma'am?
The girl. was she born a mute?
No.
I think
I've finished here, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go... and see if Mr Tuttle needs a hand.
[Door closes]
[Sighs]
[Child sobbing]
Nicholas!
Nicholas, I'm coming!
Oh!
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?
Why were you crying?
I wasn't crying.
I was reading.
But I just heard you...
Anne!
[Door closes]
[Child sobbing]
Anne!
Anne?
ANNE:
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't.
I just heard you a moment ago.
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.
I don't.
If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?
No. It was that boy.
What boy?
Victor.
Who's Victor?
The boy that was here a moment ago.
I told him to let me study... but he wouldn't stop crying.
I think he's a spoiled brat.
He said we'd have to leave the house.
GRACE: Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?
Because he doesn't like this house... but he has to live here.
His father's a pianist--
- His father's a pianist?
- Yes.
I already told him he's not allowed to touch the piano.
He isn't, is he, Mummy?
[Sighs]
So, you've spoken to his father as well?
ANNE: No, only with Victor.
His father's with the others in the hall.
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!
Now why were you crying?
It was Victor!
-So where is he now?
-He went out through there!
Would you mind telling me how a boy... can get in and out of this room if it's locked?
[gasps]
GRACE: I thought
I made myself quite clear.
No door is to be opened... without the previous one being closed first.
Is that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship.
The light must be contained as if it were water... by opening and closing the doors.
My children's lives are at stake!
MRS. MILLS: But, ma'am--
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!
Which was the last of you to enter that room?
Lydia?
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.
That leaves you, then.
But I was in the hall the whole time.
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
Do you think that
I would overlook such a thing... and endanger the life of my own daughter?
[Fire crackling]
NICHOLAS: You're not supposed to read at the table.
ANNE: Oh, really?
Who's going to tell Mummy?
You?
Or perhaps you?
[Giggles]
Did you really see a boy?
Yes. He's called Victor.
Is he a ghost?
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.
What are they like?
I've told you a thousand times.
They go about in white sheets and carry chains.
-How do you know?
-Because I've seen them.
They come out at night.
Fibber. Where?
[Inhales]
[Clank]
[Laughs]
-You're stupid.
-Not half as much as you.
I don't believe you saw that boy.
Believe what you like.
You'll soon be begging us to play with you.
ANNE: Nicholas!
NICHOLAS: Huh? what?
Look.
Why have you opened the curtains?
-It wasn't me.
-Who was it, then?
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.
You're lying.
I'm going to tell Mummy.
-So I'm a liar, am I?
-Yes.
Victor, come out from behind that curain... so my stupid brother can see you.
[Breathing heavily]
[gasps]
Leave me alone.
ANNE: So you don't want to see him now, eh?
You're a cowardly custard.
Cowardly cowardly custard.
I'll just have to do it myself, then.
ANNE: That's enough, Victor.
Nicholas. Nicholas.
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.
He won't listen to me.
VICTOR: Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.
ANNE: This is our bed.
VICTOR: No, it's mine.
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.
You be quiet, cowardly custard.
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother... and she'll kick you out.
You don't know my mother.
VICTOR:
And you don't know my parents.
Anne, I'm going to tell
Mummy about you.
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you're real.
[Breathing rapidly]
Aah!
[Nicholas screaming]
NICHOLAS: Mummy! Help!
Help! Help, Mummy!
What is it? What is it?
[Crying]
What is it?
She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet.
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!
I didn't do anything!
"Therefore the Lord god sent him forh...
"from the garden of Eden...
"to till the ground from whence he was taken.
"So he drove out the man...
"and placed to the east of the Garden of Eden...
"cherubims and a flaming sword...
"which turned every way to keep the way...
"of the Tree of Life."
There. I finished.
[Closes book]
Very good.
[Sighs]
Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
What?
That's not what we agreed!
We didn't agree anything, young lady.
Today you're being punished, and you'll do as I say.
You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
How dare you!
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness for something I didn't do!
You told your brother someone else was in the room!
- There was!
- You're lying!
I am not!
[Sighs]
Anne... do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
Children who don't tell the truth end up in limbo.
That's what you say, but I read the other day... that limbo's only for children who haven't been baptized.
And I have!
ANNE:
"And Abraham took the wood...
"of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
"And he took the fire in his hand and a knife...
"and they went, both of them together.
"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father...
"and said,'My father...'
"and he said,
'Here I am, my son.'"
Did you look in on Nicholas?
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I'd prefer to have her where I can see her... but I can't embroider in such poor light.
How long is this punishment going to go on?
It's been three days now.
It's up to her.
She's got to learn to swallow her pride... and ask for forgiveness.
Anyway, it's time she started to read the Bible.
The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma'am.
GRACE: If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.
He knows perfectly well that the children can't go out.
MRS. MILLS:
He told me yesterday... he'd be by as soon as possible.
I'm beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.
This fog doesn't exactly help.
It's never lasted this long before.
Oh, that's true, ma'am.
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.
Anne!
Anne, I can't hear you.
[Anne reading indistinctly]
Ohh!
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I've had to put up with the noise... of Lydia running around above my head.
She's been hurling backwards and forwards... as if there were three of her.
Would you kindly tell her it's not necessary... to kick up quite such a rumpus just to do a little cleaning?
I couldn't bear to get another migraine attack.
I'll tell her, ma'am.
GRACE: Thank you.
[Footsteps receding]
[Anne reading indistinctly]
[Thumping overhead]
[Thumping overhead]
[Sighs]
[Louder thumps overhead]
[Thumping, glass rattling]
[Banging overhead]
Now she's really gone too far.
Lydia! Lydia!
[Anne reading]
"... in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
"And the angel of the Lord-- "
What's going on up there?
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading.
-Did you hear it as well?
-Hear what?
"And the angel of the Lord...
"called unto Abraham out of Heaven...
"the second time and said...
"'By myself, I have sworn,' saith the Lord-- "
Shh!
[Faint squeaking]
What was that?
I don't know.
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.
I can't tell you, Mummy.
You tell me.
I told you there was someone in the room... and you punished me.
Now I don't know what to say.
Anne, I want the truth.
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.
There. In that junk room.
ANNE: Mummy, you're letting the light in.
[gasps]
[Steps on glass]
[ghostly voices whispering]
Shh!
-She's a woman.
-She's what?
[gasps]
[Creaking]
Where did they go?
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?
Which way did they go?
Over there, over there, and down there as well.
[Door closes]
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.
And they're going to take the curtains down.
Ma'am, stay calm, please.
I will not stay calm!
For five whole years during the occupation...
I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house... and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors.
Ma'am, this is a very old house.
The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks--
There were voices.
I'm telling you.
ANNE: Mummy, look.
A boy and two women, talking together.
Mummy, look!
I did it yesterday.
This is the father, this is the mother... this is Victor, and this is the old woman.
What do these numbers stand for?
ANNE: That's the number of times I've seen them.
I've seen the old woman the most.
Oh, god in Heaven.
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr Tuttle.
We have to search the whole house immediately... before it gets dark.
-Yes, ma'am. There, now.
-Mummy!
Yes, darling. It's all right.
Nothing will happen to you while Mummy's here.
ANNE: Look, Mummy.
She really scares me.
It's as if she's not looking at you... but she can see you.
And she's always around saying "Come with me "--
No, Anne, don't lie to me.
ANNE: Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.
Victor told me she's a witch.
What does she ask you?
Things.
Her breath smells.
We have to open all the curtains.
I don't want any dark corners where someone could hide.
Yes, ma'am.
You both search the right side, and I'll take the left.
Then we'll search upstairs.
[Sighs]
NICHOLAS:
Perhaps they're ghosts...
Who lived in this house before.
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.
Ghosts go about in white sheets... and carry chains and go "OOO. "
MRS. MILLS: Now, Anne.
Why do you make up such stories?
ANNE: I don't.
I read them in books.
Well, you shouldn't believe everything... that you read in books.
That's what our mother says.
She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish... and then she expects us... to believe everything written in the Bible.
And don't you believe it?
I believe some things.
But, for example,
I don't believe... that God made the world in seven days.
And I don't believe that Noah... got all those animals into one boat... or the Holy Spirit is a dove.
No, I don't believe that, either.
ANNE:
Doves are anything but holy.
They poo on our windows.
[Chuckles]
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
Oh.
[Knocking]
MRS. MILLS: Ma'am.
Yes?
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.
I see.
Mrs. Mills.
Yes, ma'am?
Do you have any idea what this might be?
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.
No, but look.
They're all asleep.
Look.
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.
'Tis a book of the dead.
In the last century,
I believe... they used to take photographs of the dead... in the hopes that their souls... would go on living through the portraits.
There are even group portraits.
[gasps] And children!
Oh, it's macabre!
How could these people be so superstitious?
Grief over the death of a loved one... can lead people to do the strangest things.
GRACE: get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.
MRS. MILLS: Yes, ma'am.
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?
Thank you very much, ma'am.
So... tell me about when you worked here before.
Did you have to look after children then?
No, I was in charge of organizing the housework.
Hmm. were there many servants?
Oh, about fifteen.
Though in the end... there were just the three of us left.
Why?
My employers moved to London.
They came here less and less... it being so out of the way like.
So gradually the house just became empty.
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.
My family left in the summer of 1940.... just before the invasion.
That was the last
I've heard of them.
Ohh.
I don't blame them.
Actually, we left, too.
Although, you know... sometimes when you leave a place... it's like it's there with you all the time.
I always felt like I never left this house.
Why did you leave?
Oh,'twas on account of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.
Ohh.
Was that when Lydia went dumb?
Yes, I think so... though my memory's a bit rusty these days, ma'am.
What happened to her?
It was suddenly one day.
She just... stopped talking.
There must've been a reason.
People don't just stop talking.
These things are always the result... of some sort of trauma.
Something must've happened to her.
Did your employers treat you well?
Oh, they were always very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.
I'll never be able to get up in the morning.
Off you go.
I'm going to stay here a while longer.
Yes, ma'am.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.
Can you forgive me?
Anne.
NICHOLAS: Mummy.
What?
When's Daddy coming home?
When the war's over.
Why did he go to war?
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.
Daddy went...
Daddy went because he's very brave... and because he wasn't prepared... to let the Germans tell him what he had to do.
NICHOLAS: why?
[Sobbing]
Charles...
Where are you?
[Piano playing]
[Piano playing]
[Music grows louder]
[gasping]
[Music stops]
[Muffled thumping]
[Creaking]
[Lock clicks]
[Creak]
[Bang]
-[Slam]
-Oh!
[Door locking]
Mrs. Mills!
Mrs. Mills!
What's the matter, ma'am?
The key to the music room, give it to me! Quickly!
- What's happening, ma'am?
-Come on!
Oh, my god.
Ohh!
I checked that room myself.
It was empty.
Take these tablets, ma'am.
They'll do you good.
And yet I felt as if there was someone else there.
And it wasn't human.
There is something in this house.
Something diabolic.
Ma'am...
Something which is not... not at rest.
[Sighs]
I know you don't believe it.
You don't believe it, do you?
I don't blame you.
I used to not believe these things.
[Sighs]
I do believe it, ma'am.
I've always believed in those things.
They're not easy to explain... but they do happen.
We've all heard stories of... the beyond... now and then... and I think sometimes the world of the dead... gets mixed up with the world of the living.
But it's impossible.
The Lord would never allow such an aberration.
The living and the dead... will only meet at the end of eternity.
It says so in the Bible.
Ma'am... there isn't always an answer for everything.
[Door opens]
MRS. MILLS: where are you off to, ma'am?
I'm going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.
If he won't come here, then I shall go to him.
I shall bring him back.
Ma'am, you should wait till the weather improves.
I've waited long enough.
Ma'am, the priest told me that--
I don't care what he told you!
I want him to tell me personally!
He must come today!
MRS. MILLS: But what are you going to tell him?
That we have searched every room inch by inch... and now I need them to be blessed.
MRS. MILLS:
Ma'am, please, wait.
Still, it's very early.
-Mr Tuttle.
-Morning, ma'am.
I need you to search the garden for gravestones.
Gravestones?
Yes. when my husband bought this house... we were told there was a little cemetery.
I think it was over there, amongst the trees.
I've not seen anything.
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.
Yes, ma'am.
I need to know if there was a family buried here... and if they had a little boy-- Victor.
[gate squeaking]
Now she thinks the house is haunted.
Do you think it's safe to let her go?
Oh, don't worry. The fog won't let her get very far.
Oh, yes, the fog.
The fog, of course.
And when do you think... we should bring all this out into the open?
All in good time, Mr Tuttle.
All in good time.
Speaking of which.
Oh!
[gasping]
Wha--
Oh.
[Footsteps]
Oh!
Charles?
Grace?
Ohh.
Oh!
Oh!
You're here. You're here.
They said there was no hope.
They said I should give you up for dead.
They say a lot of things.
GRACE: Ohh.
Ohh!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.
Every night I prayed for this... begging God to bring you back.
Bring the children their father back.
Bring him...
But where have you been all this time? out there... looking for my home.
[Sighs]
You're so different.
So different.
Sometimes I bleed.
[Laughs]
[Front door closes]
Ma'am--
Mrs. Mills... this is my husband.
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.
He's very weak.
Here.
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.
And something to eat.
Right away, ma'am.
How are my little ones?
Daddy!
ANNE: [Kiss] why did you take so long?
[Crying]
Hello, Nicholas.
I told you, you see.
I told you he'd come back.
[Kiss]
Have you both been well-behaved?
We've been very good.
Have you been good to your mother?
Very good.
We study every day for our First Communion.
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
[Door closes]
Oh! Here he comes!
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.
Are you coming down or would you prefer--
[Door closes]
ANNE:
When's Daddy coming down?
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.
ANNE: He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.
Shh.
Mummy, when people die in the war...
Where do they go?
Oh, what a question.
-It depends.
-On what?
Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.
Your father, for example, fought for England... on the side of the goodies.
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
[Sighs] That's enough questions.
Eat your food.
You'll never go to war.
We'll never go anywhere.
Ohh.
You're not missing out on anything.
You're much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy... who love you very, very much.
And the intruders.
There are no intruders here.
But you said that there were.
No, I said that there are no intruders here.
I don't want to hear another word on the subject.
-But you said--
-That is enough!
Can I say something?
-No!
-Why not?
Because you can't!
[Fork clatters]
[Breathing heavily]
Anne, stop breathing like that.
You heard me. Stop it.
Stop breathing.
Right, you go to your room.
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.
[Sighs]
[Anne sobbing]
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.
Oh, stop that here.
Look what an awful face you've got when you cry.
-I don't care!
-There, there.
You listen to me.
I've seen them, too.
You have?
Yes.
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.
There are things your mother doesn't want to hear.
She only believes in what she was taught.
But don't worry, sooner or later... she'll see them.
Then everything will be different.
How?
Oh, you'll see.
There are going to be some big surprises.
There are going to be... changes.
Changes?
Now she's behaving as if nothing had happened.
What about her daughter?
Oh, she's not so stubborn.
The children will be easier to convince.
No, it's the mother who's going to cause us problems.
Do you think her husband suspects anything?
No. I don't think he even knows where he is. ohh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.
Mummy made this veil especially for you.
-Hmm?
-I look like a bride.
Yes. You do.
[Sighs] I need to shorten the sleeves a little.
-You can take it off now.
-No.
This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.
I promise I won't dirty it.
Just let me wear it for a little longer.
Oh, just a little?
All right.
I'll be back shortly.
No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.
No.
[Locks door]
Monsieur, would you like to dance?
[Deep voice] I'd love to.
[Humming]
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.
OOOO.
[giggles]
[Humming]
# In the sky #
# I don't know if it's cloudy or bright #
# But I only have eyes #
# For you, dear #
# The moon may be high #
[Humming]
[Humming]
[Crying]
[Anne humming]
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.
[Humming]
[Sighs]
Anne, are you listening to me?
Anne?
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
ANNE: But it's clean.
It makes no difference.
Why can't you ever do as you're told...
[Humming]
[Anne's voice]
What's the matter?
Where is my daughter?
[giggles]
What have you done with my daughter?
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.
[gasps]
No! You're not my daughter!
[Anne screaming]
No! No!
[Fabric tearing]
Aah!
You're not my daughter! No!
-Aah!
-No! Aah!
[gasping]
[Sobbing]
Ma'am, I heard shouts.
She wants to kill me!
She won't stop until she kills us!
She won't stop!
MRS. MILLS:
Hush, child. Come with me.
ANNE: You're wicked!
You're wicked! wicked!
[Door closes]
ANNE: wicked!
[gasps]
[water running]
How is she?
There's no calming her... so I've left her with her father.
Oh!
She insisted on speaking with him.
What happened?
Why did you fight?
GRACE: It wasn't her.
It was the old woman with the strange eyes.
She was imitating my daughter's voice.
I'd swear to god that it wasn't my daughter.
Oh, God. God help me.
God help me.
What's the matter with me?
I don't know what's the matter with me.
MRS. MILLS:
You must get more rest.
You can't take on the whole responsibility of this house.
Leave it to us.
We know what has to be done.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting--
There's nothing to suggest.
Who do you think you are?
You have no idea what has to be done.
[Softly] or do you?
What are these?
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.
The ones you always take.
Please,
I need to be on my own.
Yes, ma'am.
Come, child.
[Door opens]
[Footsteps]
CHARLES: Anne told me everything.
I wish I had an explanation, but I haven't.
At first, I thought there was someone else in the house.
Even thought there were ghosts.
I'm not talking about the ghosts.
I'm talking about what happened that day.
I don't know what you're talking about.
CHARLES: Tell me it's not true.
Tell me what happened.
Happened?
[Sighs]
I don't know what came over me that day.
The servants had left during the night.
Hadn't the courage to tell me to my face.
They knew that I couldn't leave the house.
They knew. [Sobs]
Anne.
Anne, what happened?
She hit me.
She went mad like she did that day.
Do you remember?
No.
You must forgive me, Charles.
Not me. The children.
They know that I love them.
They know I'd never hurt them.
I'd die first.
What are you going to do?
Are you angry with me?
I just came back to say good-bye... to my wife and children.
Now I must go.
Go where?
To the front.
No. The war's over.
The war is not over.
What are you talking about?
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once already.
You can't go!
Why?
Why did you have to go to that stupid war... that had nothing to do with us?
Why couldn't you have stayed here like the others?
The others surrendered.
We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied!
What did you expect?
[Sighs]
What were you trying to prove by going to war?
Your place was here with us.
With your family.
[Sighs]
I loved you.
That was enough for me.
Living in this darkness...
In this prison.
But not for you.
I wasn't enough for you.
That's why you left.
[Crying]
It wasn't just the war.
You want to leave me, don't you?
[Sighs]
Ohh.
[gasps]
[Screaming]
Anne!
Nicholas!
[Children screaming]
[Screaming]
What is it? What--
Ohh! Ohh!
[Screaming]
Oh, my god!
Here! Oh, my god!
Oh! Oh!
Here!
Oh!
Aah!
Where are the curtains?
[Screaming]
GRACE: Mrs. Mills!
Let me see. Let me see.
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!
I want my daddy!
[Crying]
Daddy's gone.
It's not true!
Yes, it is.
It is true.
[Sobbing]
I love you, Mummy.
[Sighs]
Find the curtains.
Who was it?
Who did this?
Tell me!
Tell me!
[Struggling]
You know what's happening here!
You know because it happened to you, too!
You'll tell me.
You write it down.
Write it down! Please!
MRS. MILLS: That attitude won't solve anything, ma'am.
Anyway, she can't write.
- Where are they?
- What?
The curtains!
The curtains my children's lives depend on!
Someone has taken the curtains!
I have noticed, ma'am.
There's no need for you to raise your voice.
Oh, Mr Tuttle. I was just on the point of calling you.
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
The curtains?
Oh, dear.
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
To let some daylight into this house, I imagine.
Daylight. of course.
Someone wants to kill my children.
Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
Are you mad?
I told you.
I already told you!
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!
Yes, but that was before.
The condition could have cleared up by itself.
If you never expose them to daylight... how do you know they're not cured?
My sister-in-law had terrible attacks of rheumatism... in her legs and back.
Then one fine day... they disappeared.
I am going to find those curtains... and when you have finished helping me hang them... you will leave this house!
And what about the master, ma'am?
What has he got to say about all of this?
Give me your keys.
I want your keys now!
I know what you want.
You want to frighten us.
You want to get us out, me and my children.
You've wanted to take over this house... ever since the first day you arrived.
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.
You should try and calm down, ma'am.
Give me the keys.
Give them to me.
And now get out of here.
[Door closes]
You know something, Mr Tuttle?
I think I've reached the end of my tether.
What about you?
Oh, yes. Definitely.
We'd better go and uncover the gravestones.
[Clattering]
[Keys rattling]
[Footsteps]
[Door slams]
What's Mummy doing?
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.
Liar.
-She's gone mad!
-Liar, liar!
Night-time.
Where are you going?
I've had enough.
I'm going into the woods to look for Daddy.
Are you going to run away?
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.
It's very easy.
[wind whistling]
NICHOLAS: If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.
ANNE: Yes, yes, yes.
NICHOLAS: Anne, wait!
I want to come and look for Daddy, too.
Liar. You just don't want to be left on your own.
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!
Be quiet!
[Thumping]
[Noise]
Anne, I think we got lost.
We still haven't left the garden yet, silly.
-I'm scared.
-Shouldn't have come, then.
-Say something.
-What shall I say?
I don't know. Anything.
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.
I'm walking and my name is Anne.
[Creaking]
What's that over there?
I think they're graves.
Don't go near!
Why not?
What if a ghost jumps out?
Graves don't have ghosts. only skeletons.
[Sighs]
There's something written here.
NICHOLAS: Let's go!
Wait! [Brushing]
[gasps]
Oh!
Anne! what does it say?
[gasps]
MRS. MILLS: You must be strong now, children.
ANNE: Nicholas, come here!
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy we've run away.
Don't speak to them!
Why?
- They're dead!
- What?
ANNE: They're ghosts!
Please come here!
Children!
ANNE: Nicholas!
They're ghosts?
Why aren't they wearing sheets and clanking chains?
You said that--
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!
You're always teasing me and telling lies... and I'm sick of it!
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!
Come here!
[gasps]
Quick!
Aah! Mum! Mum!
Children!
[Screaming]
GRACE: Pun!
Run!
Go! Into the house!
GRACE: Don't come any closer!
Don't move! [Panting]
MRS. MILLS:
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
Tuberculosis finished us off... more than half a century ago.
[Keys rattling]
[Locks door]
GRACE: Go away!
[Doorknob rattling]
MRS. MILLS:
Open the door, ma'am. Please.
What do you want?
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.
We've seen their graves.
Go upstairs and hide.
-Go on.
-I'm scared.
Ohh!
Don't separate! Oh!
Ohh!
Whatever you do, don't separate.
Go hide. Go. Go.
MRS. MILLS: We've been trying to make you understand.
Understand what?
About the house.
About the new situation.
GRACE: What situation?
We must all learn to live together... the living and the dead.
Ohh
If you're dead, leave us in peace!
Oh. Leave us in peace!
GRACE: [Echoing]
Leave us in peace!
In here. get inside.
MRS. MILLS:
And suppose we do leave you.
Do you think they will?
Who?
The intruders.
There are no intruders.
MR TUTTLE:
They took the curtains down.
There are no intruders.
Oh, yes,
I assure you it was them.
And now they're in there with you and the children.
-Waiting for you.
-No!
Yes. And believe me, sooner or later... they'll find you.
Listen, wait here, and I'll be back in a minute.
No, no, no. Mummy said we shouldn't separate.
We can't leave her on her own.
[Panting]
Stop breathing like that.
[Breathing]
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.
Stop breathing!
[Breathing]
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.
WOMAN: Come with us, children.
Come with us.
[Screaming]
Aah!
Nicholas?
Anne?
Where are you?
Answer me!
MRS. MILLS:
The intruders have found them.
MR TUTTLE:
There's nothing we can do now.
MRS. MILLS: You'll have to go upstairs and talk to them.
[gasping]
[Rattling]
Our Father, who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
Thy will be done on earh... as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
[Nicholas whimpering]
WOMAN:
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don't you want us to be your friends?
[whimpering]
Come on. Speak to us.
Speak to us.
Tell me what happened.
[whimpering]
NICHOLAS: Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!
MAN: "Don't tell her. "
ANNE: If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.
NICHOLAS: Mummy!
MAN: "Mummy."
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
[whispering]
Something about a pillow.
Is that how she killed you?
[Rosary drops]
With a pillow?
She didn't kill us!
Children, if you're dead... why do you remain in this house?
ANNE: We're not dead!
[Sobs]
WOMAN: Why do you remain in this house?
We're not dead!
NICHOLAS: We're not dead!
We're not dead!
WOMAN: Why do you remain in this house?
"We're not dead. we're not dead. "
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!
We're not dead!
[Yelling]
Oh!
[gasps]
[Exhales]
MAN: Are you all right?
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.
What happened?
They made contact.
All three?
Apparently, yes.
The mother and the two children.
Quite interesting, don't you think?
MRS. MARLISH: Interesting?
I was scared out of my wits!
Darling, calm down.
No. So far, we have handled this matter your way... but now you listen to me.
We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.
It is quite clear these beings do not want us to live here.
We don't know anything about them yet.
Yes, we do!
We know the woman went mad... smothered her two children, and then shot herself.
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.
There's nothing wrong with Victor.
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.
He says he has seen that girl... and even this lady has been possessed by her.
Please, let us leave this house.
All right.
We will leave tomorrow morning.
Oh, thank god for that.
I'll just go and check on Victor.
Once again, thank you so much for coming.
MAN: A pleasure.
I hope we've been of some help.
MR MARLISH: Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...
At first,
I couldn't understand... what the pillow was doing in my hands... or why you didn't move.
But then I knew.
It had happened.
I had killed my children.
[Inhales]
I got the rifle.
I put it to my forehead.
Then I pulled the trigger.
Nothing.
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.
Ahh.
You were playing with the pillows... as if nothing had happened.
And I thought the Lord in His great mercy... was giving me another chance... telling me, "Don't give up."
"Be strong."
"Be a good mother."
"For them."
But now... now... what does all this mean?
Where are we?
MRS. MILLS: Young Lydia said the very same thing... when she realized the three of us were dead.
And that was the last time she ever spoke.
But I couldn't tell you that before now.
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?
The intruders are leaving... but others will come.
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.
Other times, we won't.
But that's the way it's always been.
Ma'am.
NICHOLAS: Mummy...
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?
GRACE: Yes.
Will we ever see him again?
I don't know.
If we're dead, where's limbo?
I don't know if there even is a limbo.
I'm no wiser than you are.
But I do know that I love you.
I've always loved you.
And this house is ours.
You say it with me.
This house is ours.
NICHOLAS:
This house is ours.
This house is ours.
[All repeating]
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.
No one can make us leave this house.
Come along, Victor.

{4626}{4672}We warned you!
{4673}{4720}- What is this?
{4721}{4841}This'll be|the last warning you get!
{4896}{4955}- Good night, Polly.|- Gonna be a long night, Mary.
{4956}{5051}Too bloody long.
{5144}{5203}- It's quiet, isn't it?|- Like the devil's laugh.
{5204}{5329}- You had any luck?|- No, not very much.
{5456}{5571}- A penny for a suck.|- Piss off.
{5572}{5647}- Where's Kate?|- Across the street.
{5648}{5695}Take it easy, now.
{5696}{5743}Here we are.
{5744}{5802}Slow down.
{5803}{5882}- Miss? Mary, isn't it?|- Yeah? What do you want?
{5883}{5921}Shut your hole, bitch.
{5922}{6008}I know you.|You're Geordie from Nichol Street.
{6009}{6076}Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?
{6077}{6189}I'd never forget you, McQueen.
{6199}{6309}You stop that now.|Buttons are hard to come by.
{6310}{6360}What does a whore|need buttons for?
{6361}{6478}I warned you and your friends|payment was expected Monday.
{6479}{6579}I'm working, ain't I?|We all are.
{6580}{6646}And I... am makin' sure... 
{6647}{6732}that no one troubles you.
{6733}{6792}I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly... 
{6793}{6844}and I expect to be paid.
{6845}{6928}Or else you will be|very troubled.
{6929}{6998}Now, you tell... 
{6999}{7090}your five friends... 
{7091}{7156}to bring me my money|by tomorrow... 
{7157}{7299}or this friend of mine here|will be your next customer.
{8047}{8120}- It's gotten hard for me, and then...|- Oh, God.
{8121}{8201}- You're bloody filthy this morning.|- I bleedin' stink.
{8202}{8249}What'd you get up to|last night?
{8250}{8321}You don't wanna know about it.
{8322}{8415}Give us a look.
{8538}{8590}Mary!
{8591}{8660}Oh, thank God I found you.
{8661}{8718}He's comin'.|Albert's comin' today.
{8719}{8810}And, well, I need you|to look after the baby.
{8811}{8866}Let's have a hold.|Ohh!
{8867}{8932}I'm so proud of her.|I love her to bits.
{8933}{8982}She's the most gorgeous|little girl.
{8983}{9049}- Isn't she beautiful?|- She's so beautiful.
{9050}{9097}She's lovely, isn't she?
{9098}{9144}I'll be seein' you in a bit.
{9145}{9192}Get us ajar of gin, will ya?
{9193}{9256}- Looks like me as well.|- You look fine, Ann.
{9257}{9337}Must be nice havin'|a rich man lookin' after ya.
{9338}{9416}She has your eyes and her father's brow.|Don't you think?
{9417}{9476}- Oh, yeah.|- Yeah.
{9477}{9572}She is a perfect love. But, Ann,|we're all in a terrible way for money.
{9573}{9632}- The Nichols gang...|- They want our blood.
{9633}{9700}- Know what they said they're gonna do?|- Don't start that now.
{9701}{9744}Or what?|What's she saying?
{9745}{9805}They want a pound a week|from each of us.
{9806}{9928}You count your self lucky that you got|a wealthy man to take care of ya.
{9929}{10028}We're needing four pound to pay him,|so I can't spare the time.
{10029}{10110}I'll get you the four pounds|from Albert.
{10111}{10182}- He might say no.|- He won't.
{10183}{10230}I know he won't.
{10231}{10290}He's been in France on business.
{10291}{10350}He wrote he sold|a lot of his paintings.
{10351}{10422}He's sure to have full pockets|and feel generous.
{10423}{10474}- To you, perhaps, but...|- I'll ask for myself.
{10475}{10607}I'll get you the four pounds.|I promise, Mary.
{10797}{10868}I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.
{10869}{10917}Remember me?
{10918}{10996}Remember who I am?
{10997}{11069}Your charge will be coming down|sooner than expected.
{11070}{11140}Much sooner than expected.
{11141}{11212}Be a good man, Netley.|Get him home quickly.
{11213}{11327}Quickly and quietly.|Understood?
{11356}{11403}Well said, Netley.
{11404}{11497}Very well said.
{12409}{12478}- Take them out.|- What is the meaning of this?
{12479}{12586}- Kidney, what are you doing?|- Ohh! Albert! Aaah!
{12587}{12640}Albert!|My baby!
{12641}{12712}- I want this room in pieces.
{12713}{12801}Oh, no! No!
{12848}{12905}Release me at once!
{12906}{13004}- I demand an explanation!|- It's Albert.
{13005}{13083}Go!
{13102}{13180}- Albert! Aaah!
{13181}{13232}- Get off me! Get off me!
{13233}{13276}Shh, shh, shh.
{13277}{13324}- Please, no!|- Go!
{13325}{13411}Get off!.
{13458}{13535}Who knows?
{13536}{13605}I didn't know.
{13606}{13653}I swear I didn't.
{13654}{13713}How could I tell anyone else?
{13714}{13761}Tsk, tsk, tsk.
{13762}{13849}Who knows?
{13904}{13991}Who knows?
{14068}{14143}I don't know.|I don't know who they could be.
{14144}{14206}Albert must have mixed in|with something terrible.
{14207}{14327}- She's hungry and cold, poor thing.
{14328}{14429}I've got to take her to 'em.|I've got to take her to Ann's parents.
{14430}{14505}All right, you go.|Leave Baby Alice with them.
{14506}{14654}I'll get to work, and I'll|meet you later at the Ten Bells.
{16906}{17008}Mostly Jews live here.
{17430}{17540}Notice something, Inspector?
{17850}{17921}I paid.|I already paid.
{17922}{18041}I'm not after you, Emperor.|Where is he?
{18042}{18088}Move it!
{18089}{18169}Hey!
{18265}{18348}Get up.
{18397}{18480}Get up!
{18510}{18603}Hello, darling.
{18926}{19012}Sergeant.
{19021}{19068}It's night.
{19069}{19153}Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.|Indeed, it is night.
{19154}{19200}The genius has returned to us.
{19201}{19248}Thank you, gentlemen, and remember... 
{19249}{19346}if you ever wish to escape the dreary|confines of your present duties... 
{19347}{19394}this never happened.
{19395}{19488}Cut along, now.
{19494}{19540}Have I lost a day?
{19541}{19612}No, Inspector. Indeed, it's only|four hours since you left here.
{19613}{19721}Oh, deepest apologies|for the, uh, rude awakening.
{19722}{19782}I suspect you enjoyed that.
{19783}{19854}I must be cruel only to be kind,|as the poet said.
{19855}{19944}Although I would happily wallop you|every time you chased the dragon.
{19945}{20016}Well, I had a sneaking suspicion|you might interrupt.
{20017}{20080}You've seen something.
{20081}{20177}What did you see?
{20188}{20284}Are her petticoats|saturated with blood?
{20285}{20392}You know, they used to|burn men like you alive.
{20393}{20466}Sometime this evening a bang-tail|was murdered in George Yard.
{20467}{20540}That doesn't sound much|out of the ordinary.
{20541}{20588}'Twas the way she was done,|Inspector.
{20589}{20648}'Twas the way|the bang-tail was done... 
{20649}{20775}that cries out|for a man of your talents.
{20952}{21079}Her name was Martha Tabram. I don't|know what sort of name Tabram is.
{21080}{21142}It sounds foreign to me.
{21143}{21202}This is not what I saw.
{21203}{21271}Not the woman of your dreams?
{21272}{21358}- You sure?|- Yeah.
{21359}{21413}- Show him.|- You show him.
{21414}{21560}Why do I have to be exposed to this|degradation over and over again?
{21561}{21673}I've looked at the mess twice!
{21722}{21805}Before he cut|her throat, he removed her livelihood... 
{21806}{21898}as a keepsake.
{22087}{22170}Gentlemen, we are indeed|fortunate today... 
{22171}{22242}to be able to observe|an entirely new approach... 
{22243}{22310}to the treatment of insanity.
{22311}{22361}It is... Oh, Dr. Ferral.
{22362}{22456}I was just saying, we're here|in the hope that you will permit us... 
{22457}{22504}to observe|this new treatment of yours.
{22505}{22584}Well, I wasn't expecting such|distinguished visitors, Sir William.
{22585}{22648}But you're all welcome, of course.
{22649}{22692}I'm ready to begin right now.
{22693}{22752}- Who is your patient?|- Ann Crook.
{22753}{22812}An unfortunate, Sir William... 
{22813}{22872}who's hysterical and violent... 
{22873}{22932}and has severe delusions|of persecution.
{22933}{23040}Oh, poor girl.|Uh, do please proceed, Dr. Ferral.
{23041}{23128}Gentlemen.
{24253}{24358}We have one tap above... 
{24410}{24521}and one into the left lobe... 
{24550}{24592}and... 
{24593}{24668}one on the right... 
{24669}{24747}and this unlucky patient's dementia... 
{24748}{24798}will no longer take a violent form.
{24799}{24882}Thanks to this simple procedure... 
{24883}{25031}we can now permanently alleviate|the poor girl's suffering.
{25109}{25192}What could I do? I had to|leave the baby with Ann's parents.
{25193}{25241}Rich man. Thought he was|gonna take care of Ann.
{25242}{25312}Knew that was|too bloody good to be true.
{25313}{25372}They're gonna kill|every one of us.
{25373}{25432}Who is this Albert, anyway?|Who is he?
{25433}{25517}Oh, for God's sake, who cares|about Albert and Ann's troubles?
{25518}{25616}What are we gonna do? We can't|stay clear of the Nichols boys forever.
{25617}{25688}You know, they say|they held poor Martha down... 
{25689}{25785}and watched her bleed until she|passed out, and then cut her throat.
{25786}{25848}- Oh! Shocking.|- McQueen is mad.
{25849}{25896}He enjoys hurting women.
{25897}{25990}That's insane. They want four pounds.|How we gonna get four pounds?
{25991}{26098}Not with my old cunny.|I'd be lucky to get four pence.
{26099}{26170}Oi, oi, oi!|Behave yourselves or bugger off!.
{26171}{26218}Yeah, you can bugger off... 
{26219}{26277}We work, girls.
{26278}{26349}We work the streets|harder than ever.
{26350}{26441}Right? Right?
{26463}{26534}All right, we can do it here.|But hurry up.
{26535}{26582}The bobbies are fussing us tonight.
{26583}{26654}All right. Gotta get|the old man off first, right?
{26655}{26726}- Give it here. I'll put it in meself.|- Oh, that's ni... 
{26727}{26774}Ooh!
{26775}{26822}- Eh?|- Yeah, yeah.
{26823}{26882}- Is it in?|- Of course it is. Come on.
{26883}{26954}No, it's not. You got it|stuck between your bleedin' legs.
{26955}{27117}- No, I haven't. Come on, get a move on.|- I knows it when I feels it.
{27321}{27392}- Oh!|- That's mine, Polly.
{27393}{27488}That's my money.
{27546}{27608}I could pop your eye out.
{27609}{27646}Customers wouldn't mind.
{27647}{27768}They don't mind|if a whore can't see.
{27770}{27817}- What's that?
{27818}{27869}What have I got here?
{27870}{27936}What have I got here, Constable?|Only a little thing.
{27937}{28020}Only a little thing to you,|but a great thing to me.
{28021}{28141}Move, or I'll bash|that smart mouth.
{28145}{28245}You're a dead woman.
{28389}{28472}- He won't bother you again tonight.|- Yeah, that's right.
{28473}{28544}Look, one for the Nichols. Yeah?
{28545}{28612}- And one for me. Right?
{28613}{28664}Oh. Come here. Come here.
{28665}{28719}Hey. Shh.
{28720}{28775}Hey, we work the streets together.
{28776}{28893}I'll keep my eye on you, love, eh?
{28956}{29007}Oh, you pig!
{29008}{29108}You disgusting pig!
{29129}{29180}Yeah, I'm a pig.
{29181}{29252}I'm what's wrong with the world.
{29253}{29300}Be on your own, then.
{29301}{29356}Oh, no!
{29357}{29457}You don't want the company of a pig!
{29458}{29517}What the fuck are you lookin' at?
{29518}{29614}I slept with you!
{29920}{29967}Thirsty?
{29968}{30048}Mmm.
{30088}{30159}That was the thing|that was in my dream.
{30160}{30207}What's it called again?
{30208}{30260}Cleopatra's Needle.
{30261}{30308}Mmm. Cleopatra.
{30309}{30357}She was a beauty, wasn't she?
{30358}{30493}It was carved 1,500 years|before the Son of God was born.
{30494}{30541}Mmm.
{30542}{30613}Six men died to bring it here... 
{30614}{30702}from Egypt.
{32152}{32263}May the Good Lord have mercy.
{32541}{32612}She was like that when I found her...|all murdered.
{32613}{32684}What kind of monster did this?
{32685}{32817}- Woman, I told you.|- Who was the first to see her?
{32818}{32954}You go in. Keep to the streets.|Settle back, now.
{32963}{33029}The boys have made their rounds of the|taverns and the delightful domiciles... 
{33030}{33097}that make up|this charming little street.
{33098}{33156}Would it surprise you to learn|that nobody heard a sound?
{33157}{33237}Throat was cut, but there's|no arterial spray on the wall.
{33238}{33350}She was killed somewhere else.
{33402}{33523}- It rained last night, didn't it?|- Mm-hmm.
{33524}{33600}She's dry.
{33601}{33664}She was brought here|in a carriage or something.
{33665}{33724}Throat must have been cut|in the carriage.
{33725}{33780}I imagine they stopped it|just over there.
{33781}{33808}"They"?
{33809}{33833}"They"?
{33834}{33951}- There's more than one, then.|- Most definitely.
{33952}{34003}This was all in your vision?
{34004}{34074}- Take your missus home.
{34075}{34132}Where were the coppers last night?
{34133}{34188}Oh, Jesus.
{34189}{34248}So... 
{34249}{34296}definitely more than one person.
{34297}{34425}Has to be a message from|the Nichols boys. Am I right?
{34426}{34470}What the hell?
{34471}{34520}That's grapes, isn't it?
{34521}{34662}What the hell would a bang-tail|be doing with grapes?
{35661}{35732}I'd like to give them an answer.
{35733}{35792}- What are you talking about?|- The Nichols boys.
{35793}{35840}I would welcome the opportunity... 
{35841}{35912}to give them an answer|to their bloody message.
{35913}{35972}There is most definitely|a message here.
{35973}{36081}- You're right about that.|- And what am I wrong about?
{36082}{36188}Martha Tabram was raped,|tortured and killed.
{36189}{36236}That's cruel.
{36237}{36348}But I've seen that sort of cruelty|in the East End before.
{36349}{36412}This is methodical.
{36413}{36460}The butchery's irrational... 
{36461}{36573}yet meticulous and deliberate.
{36596}{36712}Altogether a different|breed of killer.
{36713}{36784}As soon as possible|I'd like to know what he took.
{36785}{36864}What? What do you mean,|what he took?
{36865}{36936}- Didn't you notice?|- What?
{36937}{36996}He's taken at least one|of her organs.
{36997}{37080}Oh, no.
{37224}{37311}I want every veterinarian,|butcher... 
{37312}{37383}and furrier in the district|interviewed.
{37384}{37445}Furrier? What did he do, sir?|Skin her?
{37446}{37513}- Pipe down, Withers.
{37514}{37609}When the inspector is talking,|you are listening. Do you understand?
{37610}{37660}Yes, Sergeant.
{37661}{37732}He disemboweled her.
{37733}{37816}After he cut her throat,|he stabbed her in the chest... 
{37817}{37864}cut open her stomach... 
{37865}{37981}and, uh, took out her intestines.
{38001}{38076}At least one|of her organs was removed.
{38077}{38228}I'm waiting for the police surgeon's|report for more details.
{38233}{38300}I see.
{38301}{38348}Well, one thing's for certain:
{38349}{38457}an Englishman didn't do it.
{38459}{38560}Maybe one of these red Indians... 
{38561}{38716}wandered into White chapel|and indulged his natural inclinations.
{38720}{38772}With all due respect, sir... 
{38773}{38821}I believe this was done by someone... 
{38822}{38878}with at least|a working knowledge of dissection.
{38879}{38950}- An educated man, such as a doctor...|- An educated man?
{38951}{39063}That's preposterous.|No well-bred man would do this.
{39064}{39124}Probably a tradesman or a butcher.
{39125}{39233}A tradesman is|a possibility, sir, yes.
{39234}{39306}But there's a strong|indication against it.
{39307}{39368}There was a sprig of grapes|found under her body.
{39369}{39404}What are you driving at?
{39405}{39505}No one in Whitechapel,|no matter what their trade... 
{39506}{39548}could afford grapes.
{39549}{39604}Obviously they were|given to her by the killer.
{39605}{39684}And it follows that|he must be someone with money.
{39685}{39773}What about the Jews?|A Jew butcher.
{39774}{39839}Or a Jew tailor|might have money.
{39840}{39888}There are plenty of them|in Whitechapel.
{39889}{39969}Well, sir, for the sake|of public safety in general... 
{39970}{40096}I'd like to be careful about spreading|the rumours that it might be a Jew.
{40097}{40144}Inspector, I know your reputation... 
{40145}{40216}for making brilliant guesses|that turn out to be right.
{40217}{40304}Someone told me you claimed|to dream the answers.
{40305}{40390}Frankly, it doesn't matter to me|what your methods are.
{40391}{40468}But be certain you don't|proceed without proof.
{40469}{40522}- Is that clear?|- Of course, sir.
{40523}{40570}Personally, I don't care.
{40571}{40640}The fewer pinch-pricks|on the streets, the better.
{40641}{40748}But the sooner you find|this butcher or tailor, Inspector... 
{40749}{40860}the sooner we can all|celebrate your promotion.
{40861}{40957}Keep me informed.
{41277}{41348}He didn't know nothin'!
{41349}{41420}Bloody Jew did it!|It's gotta be!
{41421}{41516}Murdering kikes!
{41517}{41588}Every cellar!|Every stable!
{41589}{41636}We'll find him out!
{41637}{41683}Some bleedin' Jew! Come on!
{41684}{41801}That's enough!|Let's burn 'em out!
{44625}{44677}I have wonderful news.
{44678}{44725}Tell me.
{44726}{44791}Surely you, of all people,|can guess.
{44792}{44897}I don't want to guess with you.
{44898}{44996}Dr. Marbury says... 
{45009}{45093}Dr. Marbury says?
{45094}{45226}Dr. Marbury says|I'm going to have your child.
{45915}{45990}Aye, to die... 
{45991}{46041}and go we know not where... 
{46042}{46169}but to lie in cold obstruction|and to rot.
{46177}{46248}A simple "rest in peace"|would suffice, Godley.
{46249}{46296}Yes, sir.
{46297}{46368}In the midst of life|we are in death.
{46369}{46456}Of whom may we seek for succor|but of thee, O Lord... 
{46457}{46530}who, for our sins,|are justly displeased?
{46531}{46664}Yet, O Lord, God most holy,|O Lord most mighty... 
{46982}{47037}Good afternoon, ladies.
{47038}{47109}I'm Inspector Abberline.|This is Sergeant Godley.
{47110}{47203}We're investigating the murders|of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.
{47204}{47273}Yes, we understand that they|were both friends of you ladies.
{47274}{47357}Close friends. We're rather hoping|you'd be able to help us out.
{47358}{47405}Don't know nothing.
{47406}{47453}Me neither.
{47454}{47532}Why you botherin' us?|You ought to be botherin'  McQueen.
{47533}{47605}- Is he the boss on Nichol Street?|- He's the heart and soul of the gang.
{47606}{47736}Isn't it your job|to be knowin' that small detail?
{47737}{47808}And what makes you think McQueen|did this to your friends?
{47809}{47906}Can't prove nothing by me.
{47907}{47969}- You're Mary Kelly. Is that right?|- That's right.
{47970}{48060}Well, Mary Kelly, unless one of you|is willing to testify against McQueen... 
{48061}{48128}I can't do nothing.
{48129}{48176}Surely, Inspector... 
{48177}{48229}a strong, handsome man like you... 
{48230}{48344}you could do anything|you put your brilliant mind to.
{48345}{48444}I'm a coward and a weakling and I can't|help meself. What's your excuse?
{48445}{48557}Why are you so bloody useless?
{48589}{48706}Come on, Mary.|That won't help us.
{49218}{49308}Is that you?
{49313}{49393}Before my mother died,|back in Ireland.
{49394}{49450}- Is that when you came here?|- Yeah.
{49451}{49509}When I was eight.
{49510}{49557}When things was good.
{49558}{49698}We were starvin',|but we were starvin' in fresh air.
{49706}{49765}I was thinking... 
{49766}{49844}we ain't ever gonna earn enough|to satisfy the Nichols boys... 
{49845}{49937}and feed our own mouths.
{49938}{50006}You said, right...|You said those men, yeah?
{50007}{50090}The ones who took her rich artist man|and who took her as well.
{50091}{50194}You said they was clean shaven|and their clothes was neat.
{50195}{50270}- Yeah, right.|- Well, they weren't no criminals then.
{50271}{50342}I mean, they weren't the likes|of the Nichols boys.
{50343}{50388}They was unusual.
{50389}{50437}Perhaps even official.
{50438}{50526}What are you gettin' at, Annie?
{50527}{50584}Maybe we could go with the papers.
{50585}{50632}Get paid for the story, you know.
{50633}{50691}"Where is Ann Crook?"|That sort of thing.
{50692}{50755}The papers are always desperate|for things bad about the government.
{50756}{50796}And it's a mystery to boot.
{50797}{50854}It's not a bad plan.|What do you think, Mary?
{50855}{50938}I'm thinkin' we should talk to that|inspector, the one at Polly's funeral.
{50939}{50986}Oh, fuck me, no!
{50987}{51082}If we go to the papers they might|hurt Ann or do something to her baby.
{51083}{51172}What, worse than what'll happen to her|in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?
{51173}{51282}I don't know for sure, but I think we're|better off talkin' to that inspector.
{51283}{51395}Lord, you are young after all.
{51427}{51509}Four bitches.|That's what I thought.
{51510}{51566}You only paid|for one bloody person.
{51567}{51614}- They're my guests.|- Guests?
{51615}{51678}Well, let me welcome your guests.
{51679}{51748}- Go on, get out!
{51749}{51796}Go on, get out!
{51797}{51877}Get out of here, you bloody whores!|Go on!
{51878}{51925}When you have four pence... 
{51926}{52031}you can come back with your|ladies-in-waitin', Your Grace.
{52032}{52079}Oh, shut up!
{52080}{52127}Ow!
{52128}{52175}Back to work, then.
{52176}{52247}- Well, let's try and stay together.|- You know we can't.
{52248}{52319}Then stay good and clear|of Nichol Street.
{52320}{52393}Come on!
{52394}{52441}- All right, Annie?|- Ehh.
{52442}{52489}Bloody bastard.
{52490}{52610}- How's your head?|- Oh, very funny!
{54363}{54444}Hyah!
{55401}{55481}Boo!
{55519}{55605}I didn't frighten you, did I?
{55606}{55653}I been lookin' for ya.
{55654}{55702}I been lookin' all over for ya.
{55703}{55758}You been looking for me?
{55759}{55830}Not for me.|On behalf of my gentleman.
{55831}{55902}A very fine gentleman.|He sent me to find ya.
{55903}{55972}Your gentleman sent you to find me?
{55973}{56068}Oh, get off. I might be unfortunate,|but I'm not a blitherin' idiot.
{56069}{56156}It's the truth.|It's the God's truth.
{56157}{56205}He seen ya.|He likes ya.
{56206}{56314}And he said tonight only you'll do.
{56315}{56386}So he said to find ya,|take ya to Hanover Street... 
{56387}{56444}where he's waitin' for ya.
{56445}{56546}- You're very pretty.
{56565}{56633}Go on, then, get in.|I'll take you there.
{56634}{56691}Oh, I almost forgot.
{56692}{56782}My gentleman got you a present.|You like grapes?
{56783}{56864}Yeah.
{56889}{56960}Whoa!
{56961}{57060}Your gentleman,|he must be very refined.
{57061}{57116}- Very refined indeed.|- Get in.
{57117}{57235}- I'll take you there.|- All right.
{57436}{57526}Here we are.
{57685}{57756}- I'm like a lady.|- You are a lady.
{57757}{57833}Your gaffer,|does he want anything special?
{57834}{57905}Just the usual, I expect.
{57906}{57985}Now, this alley|takes you to a yard.
{57986}{58033}My gentleman, he's quiet.
{58034}{58105}He doesn't like disturbances.
{58106}{58157}What I wanna know, right... 
{58158}{58283}is at off like him,|how much is he offerin'?
{58284}{58331}Here. Two florin.
{58332}{58379}That'll do me.
{58380}{58438}Let me see ya. Go on.
{58439}{58486}- Down here?|- Yeah.
{58487}{58568}Straight down.|Straight down to the door at the end.
{58569}{58622}Shh.
{58623}{58660}Shh.
{58661}{58756}Straight down there, yeah?
{58757}{58838}Oops.
{58864}{58942}No!
{59401}{59460}- Bugger off!.
{59461}{59540}You watch your mouth!
{59541}{59588}Anymore information?
{59589}{59660}- My readers wanna know this stuff...|- Oh, do they?
{59661}{59720}Found a piece of leather apron|in her mouth?
{59721}{59776}No, Mr. Best,|but if it's your fancy... 
{59777}{59860}I'd be delighted to stuff your mouth|with a piece of leather.
{59861}{59933}Come on, give us a tip.|Put your picture on the front page.
{59934}{59980}Cover-up!
{59981}{60058}You're supposed to do something|about it! This is ridiculous!
{60059}{60124}There's a bleeding|murderer on the loose!
{60125}{60223}What about my wife?
{60935}{60992}This is Annie.
{60993}{61064}Yes. Another of|the circle of friends.
{61065}{61140}Annie Chapman.|Dark Annie, they called her.
{61141}{61268}You still say this|isn't the Nichols boys?
{61274}{61348}Did the constable show you the leather|they found down by the water spout?
{61349}{61420}Could be part of a butcher's apron.
{61421}{61492}Leather apron. Dear God.
{61493}{61560}We could be looking|for a butcher after all.
{61561}{61626}I saw her.
{61627}{61718}- This one?|- Yeah. Last night.
{61719}{61812}I saw her face.
{61872}{61929}Don't trample over this area.
{61930}{61993}Let us see the body!
{61994}{62060}- Come on, let us see!|- Oh, God.
{62061}{62096}There's your typical Londoner... 
{62097}{62169}imbued with the Christian spirit|of sympathy for his fellow man.
{62170}{62223}Or fellow whore, in this case.
{62224}{62292}He's really out done himself|this time, hasn't he?
{62293}{62340}He not only severed the intestines... 
{62341}{62409}he carefully arranged them|around the neck and shoulders.
{62410}{62536}I think he's taken|more organs this time.
{62634}{62727}Grapes again. Why grapes?
{62728}{62799}Only Polly and Dark Annie|were given grapes.
{62800}{62885}Only they were disemboweled|in such a meticulous fashion.
{62886}{62981}This ain't killing for profit.
{62982}{63030}This is ritual.
{63031}{63132}Yeah, but why grapes?
{63293}{63413}So they'll trust whatever he offers.
{63613}{63668}I've never fully understood|that tradition.
{63669}{63705}They're for the ferryman... 
{63706}{63801}who takes the body across the river|into the land of the dead.
{63802}{63885}If she don't have|the money to pay him... 
{63886}{64033}she'd have to wander forever,|lost between the two worlds.
{64156}{64219}I need to consult a doctor.
{64220}{64261}Are you ill, Inspector?
{64262}{64317}A surgeon, to be specific.
{64318}{64411}The killer removed the victim's uterus|and its attachments.
{64412}{64480}My God.|He's out of his mind.
{64481}{64544}That's very astute of you, sir.
{64545}{64616}I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.
{64617}{64676}I'm sorry, sir.|I meant nothing by it.
{64677}{64745}You already have a surgeon|at your disposal.
{64746}{64831}I need a man with a strong stomach|and a sober mind.
{64832}{64882}The police surgeon has neither.
{64883}{64954}- No. Request denied.|- Why?
{64955}{65002}Are you questioning my decision?
{65003}{65056}No, sir.|I simply want to know why.
{65057}{65130}There's already too much nonsense|and gossip in the press.
{65131}{65178}You start consulting doctors... 
{65179}{65244}and all sorts of wild notions|will be printed.
{65245}{65345}No one else is to see the bodies.
{65346}{65393}It is my honour... 
{65394}{65524}to present this...|unique medical phenomenon.
{65525}{65600}Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick... 
{65601}{65648}John Merrick.
{65649}{65696}I beg your pardon.
{65697}{65744}Mr. John Merrick... 
{65745}{65808}was an attraction at a side-show.
{65809}{65864}Now he's being cared for... 
{65865}{65945}at England's leading hospital... 
{65946}{65993}and with your generosity... 
{65994}{66096}we will be able|to continue to do so.
{66097}{66168}Ladies and gentlemen... 
{66169}{66264}Mr. John Merrick.
{66309}{66399}Turn around.
{66525}{66572}Oh, please.
{66573}{66619}I can't stand it.
{66620}{66745}Oh! He should have|been killed at birth!
{66869}{66961}- Good health!
{67109}{67240}That'll be the last one,|Your Royal Highness.
{67490}{67584}These hands are a gift from God.
{67585}{67650}- The psychotic patient is...|- Pardon, sir.
{67651}{67712}- You Dr. Ferral?|- I am, yes.
{67713}{67789}I'm Inspector Abberline,|assigned to Whitechapel.
{67790}{67850}- My lord, you're the Ripper case.
{67851}{67904}- Am I right?|- Yeah.
{67905}{67976}Jolly good.|You've come to the perfect place.
{67977}{68033}We've got butchers aplenty here.
{68034}{68081}- I see.
{68082}{68172}I could use the expertise of someone|like yourself to help solve this case.
{68173}{68244}They tell me you're|the best young surgeon in London.
{68245}{68296}Really?
{68297}{68392}I don't see how a reputable surgeon|could know anything about it.
{68393}{68454}This country's over run with foreigners.
{68455}{68504}Orientals and... 
{68505}{68556}Jews.
{68557}{68669}Socialists trying to stir things up|against our monarchy.
{68670}{68721}That's who you should be pursuing.
{68722}{68769}Don't you think?
{68770}{68821}Excuse me.
{68822}{68934}You don't belong here, do you?
{68942}{69037}I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers|from the surgeon's malady.
{69038}{69084}And what's that, sir?
{69085}{69137}Want of feeling.
{69138}{69195}He knows everything|about anatomy... 
{69196}{69264}and nothing about the soul.
{69265}{69326}How may I assist you, Inspector?
{69327}{69398}Well, forgive my ignorance,|sir, but, um... 
{69399}{69446}are you a surgeon?
{69447}{69494}I was.
{69495}{69564}Unfortunately, I suffered|a brain seizure six months ago.
{69565}{69700}- Sorry to hear that, sir.|- These days I limit myself to teaching.
{69701}{69834}So you see, I'm accustomed|to answering questions, Inspector.
{69835}{69888}Well, sir... 
{69889}{70036}could you tell me what sort|of a knife, uh, would this be?
{70194}{70265}I think you mean to|draw a Liston knife.
{70266}{70337}It's named for Liston,|who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.
{70338}{70397}Because there was no anaesthetic|on the battlefield... 
{70398}{70458}he had to carry out these amputations|very quickly.
{70459}{70506}Uh... 
{70507}{70592}do you, by any chance, have|the police surgeon's report available?
{70593}{70640}Yes, I do, sir.
{70641}{70687}May I?
{70688}{70810}- We must keep this confidential.|- Of course.
{70811}{70919}- There it is.|- Thank you.
{70983}{71063}Hmm.
{71081}{71161}Yes.
{71214}{71261}Wouldn't someone|have heard their screams?
{71262}{71346}Not if you cut their throats first.
{71347}{71394}Yes.
{71395}{71496}And how can you be sure they wouldn't|react to seeing the Liston knife?
{71497}{71565}Grapes.
{71566}{71612}He offers them grapes first.
{71613}{71697}- Ah.|- Grapes are very tempting.
{71698}{71761}Yes, of course.|They'd gobble them up, wouldn't they?
{71762}{71833}And he might offer them|a drink to ease them down.
{71834}{71910}A drink laced with laudanum.
{71911}{71958}How do you know that?
{71959}{72030}I found a sprig of grapes|on both victims' bodies... 
{72031}{72088}and I smelled the laudanum|on their lips.
{72089}{72180}Laudanum is a derivative of opium.
{72181}{72331}Apart from doctors and addicts,|not many would recognise it.
{72361}{72494}How long have you|chased the dragon, Inspector?
{72524}{72608}Well, these should help|with the headaches.
{72609}{72677}And, um... 
{72678}{72749}opium leeches minerals|out of the body... 
{72750}{72801}so I've also given you a tonic... 
{72802}{72849}that will help to|restore your appetite.
{72850}{72956}Thank you very much, sir.
{72982}{73029}I'm a fool.
{73030}{73116}I don't think you're a fool.|Far from it.
{73117}{73205}I ought to have known, sir, that you're|Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family.
{73206}{73253}Well, yes, it's certainly an honour... 
{73254}{73321}but it's an honour|best owed on many doctors.
{73322}{73398}Now, about our friend here,|I can tell you this much:
{73399}{73496}He cut their throats from left to right,|therefore he's right-handed.
{73497}{73544}Excuse me.
{73545}{73635}He had to slice through|four layers of tissue... 
{73636}{73695}and up to an inch|of subcutaneous fat.
{73696}{73743}After that... 
{73744}{73791}he entered the abdominal cavity... 
{73792}{73872}so he would have had to use more|than just merely the Liston knife.
{73873}{74013}Perhaps he was carrying a portable|amputation kit similar to this.
{74014}{74111}What do you think?
{74239}{74310}Is it possible, sir, that the killer|is an educated man... 
{74311}{74358}perhaps someone who studied medicine... 
{74359}{74456}but who is, in fact,|not a surgeon himself?
{74457}{74504}The intestines are simple enough.
{74505}{74560}But, uh, the uterus?
{74561}{74644}The liver, especially. Hard to locate,|unless you know what you're doing.
{74645}{74702}And he was working quickly, in the dark.
{74703}{74764}I had held out hope that this... 
{74765}{74812}monster was a veterinarian... 
{74813}{74881}or a furrier or an... 
{74882}{74946}especially well-educated butcher.
{74947}{75035}No, I must admit, if I were you... 
{75036}{75160}I'd look for someone with|a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.
{75161}{75247}Damn him.
{75893}{75952}Do you want me to suck it?
{75953}{76012}I can suck the Thames dry.
{76013}{76123}Don't be frightened, dearie.
{76462}{76589}How far advanced|is our grandson's malady?
{76611}{76696}Uh, no lesions have appeared, ma'am.
{76697}{76786}There is some neural damage...|a slight trembling of the right hand.
{76787}{76838}But I'm hopeful...|more than hopeful... 
{76839}{76886}that treatment will arrest the disease.
{76887}{77006}He seems to us to be suffering|greatly in his mind.
{77007}{77068}Is the disease affecting his emotions?
{77069}{77143}Yes, well, of course|his mood is depressed... 
{77144}{77240}because of the news of the diagnosis.
{77241}{77340}But that should improve|as he regains his strength.
{77341}{77415}You are a true physician, Sir William.
{77416}{77507}In all ways, you attend|to the health of our empire.
{77508}{77559}We are grateful.
{77560}{77656}Thank you, ma'am.
{77949}{78012}If this is the beginning... 
{78013}{78078}of a five-pointed star... 
{78079}{78158}- A bloody Jewish star.|- Withers!
{78159}{78241}Inspector is talking,|which means you are what?
{78242}{78340}- I'm listening, sir.|- Yes.
{78341}{78415}This area would form a likely point.
{78416}{78492}I want double shifts within|these streets until further notice.
{78493}{78566}And don't only worry|about Jews and butchers.
{78567}{78621}You stop anyone suspicious... 
{78622}{78678}including well-dressed gentlemen.
{78679}{78726}And by the way, Withers... 
{78727}{78843}the Star of David has six points.
{78863}{78984}Right. Once more into the breach,|dear friends.
{78985}{79072}Dismissed!
{79236}{79346}Why have you called me here?
{79359}{79428}It's just... 
{79429}{79541}It's just you say three more|have to be killed.
{79542}{79595}I can't take it, sir.
{79596}{79721}It's everywhere.|It's in all the papers.
{79756}{79811}I'm just a simple chap, sir.
{79812}{79900}I'm not a great man like you.
{79901}{80020}I just don't know|where I am at... anymore.
{80021}{80096}There, there, Netley.
{80097}{80209}I shall tell you where we are.
{80227}{80315}We are in the most extreme|and utter region... 
{80316}{80391}of the human mind.
{80392}{80443}A radiant abyss... 
{80444}{80541}where men meet themselves.
{80542}{80605}I don't understand that.
{80606}{80711}I don't understand, sir.
{80712}{80803}Hell, Netley.
{80824}{80917}We are in hell.
{81140}{81221}- Let me go! Get your hands off me!|- Pull yourself together.
{81222}{81282}Go on!
{81283}{81329}- In with you!
{81330}{81377}Sorry about that, Inspector.
{81378}{81432}She's madly in love with me... 
{81433}{81518}although she hides it well.
{81519}{81581}You said McQueen|killed your two friends.
{81582}{81634}- So what are you doing here?|- Oh, I see.
{81635}{81737}Women are butchered right and left,|and you can't do piss about it.
{81738}{81802}- And I'm the fool.|- We're watching them.
{81803}{81864}Can't arrest them without evidence,|so we watch them.
{81865}{81934}- What else can we do?|- I'll testify.
{81935}{82032}If you keep meself|and me friends alive, I'll testify.
{82033}{82068}To what, precisely?
{82069}{82143}That McQueen said he'd cut me|unless I pay him a pound a week.
{82144}{82196}- No.|- What you mean, no?
{82197}{82296}You asked me to testify.|Are you worried I'll let you down?
{82297}{82364}I won't.|I promise I won't.
{82365}{82441}You testify against McQueen,|maybe he goes in for a year or two.
{82442}{82552}But his boys, they'll take|their revenge on you and your friends.
{82553}{82655}I can't let you do it.
{82750}{82857}It's your round this time.
{82879}{82944}I confess, I have an appetite.
{82945}{83026}One day, I'll be|a great big round woman... 
{83027}{83097}with a skinny little man|for a husband.
{83098}{83188}And a dozen plump children, I imagine.
{83189}{83285}You think that's funny... an unfortunate|like me being a decent mother?
{83286}{83336}No, no, I didn't mean that.|I didn't mean that at all.
{83337}{83394}You'll be a wonderful mother|someday, Mary.
{83395}{83446}Honest. I can see it.
{83447}{83522}I see you in a little cottage|by the sea... 
{83523}{83570}surrounded by children.
{83571}{83687}I can see it, Mary, clear as day.
{83716}{83796}- I really do have visions, you know.|- Are you serious?
{83797}{83916}Sergeant Godley calls 'em my intuitions.
{83917}{83964}As a matter of fact... 
{83965}{84016}I had one about you in this case.
{84017}{84074}You have visions about me?
{84075}{84175}What might those be?
{84221}{84271}I want you to think carefully.
{84272}{84344}Besides McQueen,|besides these awful murders... 
{84345}{84406}has anything else happened to you|or perhaps to one of your friends... 
{84407}{84490}that's a bit out of the ordinary?
{84491}{84585}Ben Kidney? That's Special Branch|she's describing, you know.
{84586}{84660}What the hell would Ben Kidney and|Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?
{84661}{84707}Wait a minute.
{84708}{84761}She's Irish-born, isn't she?|There's your answer.
{84762}{84870}A secret Irish rebel. That's why|they would be after her, right?
{84871}{84929}They were after Ann Crook... 
{84930}{84977}who was having an affair|with a wealthy gentleman.
{84978}{85035}A man she bore a child.
{85036}{85148}A child that's now missing,|along with its grandparents.
{85149}{85266}- Right. Drive on, please, driver.
{85293}{85357}You do not fuck with Special Branch.
{85358}{85456}They fuck with you.
{85596}{85746}I don't know what you're thinking,|and I don't care to know.
{85844}{85904}Inspector Adderly.|Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
{85905}{85940}Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.
{85941}{85995}Didn't say where.|Could be for the night.
{85996}{86060}No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,|and I should wait.
{86061}{86140}Where are you going, sir?
{86141}{86218}He said I should wait in his office.
{86219}{86321}And what floor|is Mr. Kidney's office on?
{86322}{86369}I don't know what floor,|you bloody idiot... 
{86370}{86426}because I haven't been to|his fucking office yet, have I?
{86427}{86478}He told me to have|the desk man let me up.
{86479}{86542}But I'm more than happy|to stand here like a knob... 
{86543}{86622}because you disobeyed|Ben Kidney's order.
{86623}{86670}It's the second floor on the right.
{86671}{86754}Thanks.
{89159}{89250}Free Ireland!
{89258}{89349}Free Ireland!
{89399}{89494}Get inside, sir!
{89710}{89760}Just some gunpowder, sir.|That's all.
{89761}{89837}Little more than a firework.
{89838}{89887}Anyone go in or out?
{89888}{89964}Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.|Yes, uh... 
{89965}{90095}There's an Inspector Adderly|in your office.
{90272}{90388}No, there's nothing missing here.
{90456}{90597}The bastards have been in here, sir.|I can smell 'em.
{91043}{91090}- No.|- Yes.
{91091}{91162}No, not together.|Too suspicious.
{91163}{91254}You wait for me, and if she's in there|you can go and visit her on your own.
{91255}{91302}I'm going with you right now... 
{91303}{91392}or I'm going to the newspapers.
{91393}{91480}I mean it.
{91615}{91694}There's a number of mental disorders|for which it is necessary... 
{91695}{91785}to remove the front part of the brain.
{91786}{91858}Her records indicate|that she was violent... 
{91859}{91943}threatening to do harm|to herself... and others.
{91944}{91991}Does she have any relations?
{91992}{92046}No, she's a ward of the state.
{92047}{92115}- That's a lie.|- Listen to me.
{92116}{92169}You're under arrest.|You're here to assist my investigation.
{92170}{92257}- Keep your mouth shut. Is that clear?|- Sorry, sir.
{92258}{92312}Good.
{92313}{92360}What else do you know about her?
{92361}{92426}All we know is that|she was an unfortunate... 
{92427}{92512}who lived in|the Whitechapel district.
{92513}{92610}I'd like to ask her|a few questions.
{92611}{92693}You won't get any sense out of her.
{92694}{92790}I'm used to that.
{93045}{93142}Hello, Ann.|I brought Mary Kelly.
{93143}{93260}- Do you remember Mary Kelly?|- Ann, you know me.
{93261}{93339}I'm your best friend|in all the world.
{93340}{93447}Go away. Go away. Go away.
{93462}{93538}Ann, I'm gonna find Baby Alice.
{93539}{93598}I'm gonna take care of her.
{93599}{93692}Alice is laughing to me.|Laughing to me.
{93693}{93770}Laughing to me all day long.
{93771}{93837}It's all right.|It's all right, darling.
{93838}{93910}What about her father?
{93911}{94028}Have you seen|Alice's father, Ann?
{94032}{94137}He's a prince. A prince.
{94140}{94226}A prince! A prince!|And I'm a queen.
{94227}{94333}I'm a queen! I'm a queen!
{94347}{94421}How do you know he was a painter?
{94422}{94470}He hired us to pose as artist models.
{94471}{94578}And what exactly does that entail?|"Artist models."
{94579}{94654}We stood very still|so he could paint us.
{94655}{94725}What's the matter?|You think I was born a whore?
{94726}{94781}Oh, I'm sorry.|I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.
{94782}{94830}England doesn't have whores.
{94831}{94918}Just a great mass|of very unlucky women.
{94919}{94983}So, Ann Crook... 
{94984}{95041}and the painter became lovers...|is that it?
{95042}{95152}He married her... in a lovely|Catholic church... Saint Savior's.
{95153}{95206}I was a witness,|as a matter off act.
{95207}{95289}He married her in a Catholic church.
{95290}{95420}What do you think|they've done to Baby Alice?
{95438}{95501}Special Branch|dumped her in Bishops gate?
{95502}{95569}Yeah, as an unknown.
{95570}{95664}- But why?|- When I find out, I'll tell you.
{95665}{95756}- Take me to her. You have to.|- No, not yet.
{95757}{95855}I need to know more first.
{95856}{95941}Look here, I promise... 
{95942}{96002}that I'll help you|with Baby Alice, but not yet.
{96003}{96128}You gotta trust me on that,|at least a little bit.
{96129}{96201}I do. I do trust you.
{96202}{96261}Good.
{96262}{96338}Do you have little ones, Inspector?
{96339}{96422}No. No.
{96459}{96553}A year ago...|No, two years... 
{96554}{96620}I'm sorry, more than two years... 
{96621}{96714}my wife, um, passed away... 
{96715}{96784}giving birth to|what I'm told was a son.
{96785}{96848}I'm sorry.
{96849}{96932}Thanks.
{97014}{97085}I wanna show you some paintings|on the way out, yeah?
{97086}{97192}- Are you gonna take me into the gallery?|- Why not?
{97193}{97278}Come on.
{97786}{97946}- Did you see the look on her face?|- I think she stopped breathing.
{97981}{98028}She's a fright.
{98029}{98093}She has cold eyes.
{98094}{98178}I feel like someone's|walking over my grave.
{98179}{98309}There's one more painting|I want you to see.
{98683}{98743}You know him, don't you?
{98744}{98840}Those whom God has|joined together, let no man put a sunder.
{98841}{98896}I pronounce... 
{98897}{98956}that they be man and wife.
{98957}{99098}In nomine Patris, et Filii,|et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
{99313}{99436}- Sir William Gull, please.|- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.
{99437}{99476}Uh... 
{99477}{99542}Sir William?|It's Inspector Abberline.
{99543}{99591}I need to speak with you, sir.
{99592}{99721}Sir William is ill.|Can't receive any visitors.
{99722}{99768}I said... 
{99769}{99834}you can't go in.
{99835}{99914}It's all right, Dr. Ferral.|I don't mind company.
{99915}{100048}Have Anna bring us some tea,|would you, please?
{100111}{100196}Ah, well, I wish|I could tell you, Inspector... 
{100197}{100296}that your story was fantastical.
{100297}{100370}Unhappily, I cannot.
{100371}{100504}I know for a fact that the prince|has a taste in unfortunate women.
{100505}{100565}And I suppose it's|more than possible that... 
{100566}{100635}he concocted this elaborate deception... 
{100636}{100728}to have some privacy while|he indulged in his secret life.
{100729}{100812}But I know one reason|I have for stating... 
{100813}{100929}that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper|is just incomprehensible.
{100930}{101026}What's that, sir?
{101059}{101153}If you repeat what I'm about to tell|you, both our lives are in jeopardy.
{101154}{101219}Indeed, I hope for your sake|that what I'm about to say... 
{101220}{101290}will steer you clear of|the very real danger you're in.
{101291}{101416}I think I'm well past the point|of safe return, sir.
{101417}{101525}Prince Edward has syphilis.
{101526}{101610}Not a pleasant state secret,|but a vital one.
{101611}{101658}Well, then that proves it.
{101659}{101763}I couldn't understand why the prince|was killing Ann Crook's friends... 
{101764}{101828}especially so savagely, but... 
{101829}{101905}he's not merely killing them.
{101906}{101953}He's punishing them.
{101954}{102011}He wants revenge.|Don't you see, sir?
{102012}{102095}No, Inspector, I don't see.
{102096}{102182}I'm afraid your wild speculations|about the prince's mental state... 
{102183}{102246}clever though they maybe... 
{102247}{102294}cannot overcome|the physical impossibility... 
{102295}{102342}of his committing these crimes.
{102343}{102407}The disease is|far enough along that... 
{102408}{102477}the prince's hands|tremble uncontrollably.
{102478}{102542}He's very weak,|and the killings of Jack the Ripper... 
{102543}{102662}require sure hands|and considerable vigour.
{102663}{102755}And have you forgotten|the most telling fact?
{102756}{102803}Whatever else the prince may be... 
{102804}{102934}he knows little or nothing|of human anatomy.
{103763}{103872}Conduct the candidate to the centre|of the lodge and cause him to kneel... 
{103873}{103980}for the benefit of prayer.
{104061}{104146}Vouch safe thine aid,|Almighty Father of the universe... 
{104147}{104238}to this, our present convention.
{104239}{104309}Who is this?
{104310}{104373}A poor candidate|in a state of darkness... 
{104374}{104445}who comes of his own free will... 
{104446}{104521}perfectly prepared,|humbly soliciting... 
{104522}{104633}to be admitted into|the my steries and privileges.
{104634}{104713}In all cases of danger and distress... 
{104714}{104772}in whom do you put your trust?
{104773}{104816}In God.
{104817}{104910}How did he find out about|the unfortunate and her child?
{104911}{104969}Well, he has|that kind of cleverness... 
{104970}{105039}you'll sometimes find|in the middle classes.
{105040}{105151}A cheap sort of intelligence,|but effective nevertheless.
{105152}{105242}Hmm. Thank God that's not|something you're burdened by.
{105243}{105290}Yes, thank God.
{105291}{105358}Recite the solemn oath.
{105359}{105410}Never to reveal our secrets... 
{105411}{105472}under no less a penalty than... 
{105473}{105536}my throat be cut across... 
{105537}{105606}my tongue be torn out by its root... 
{105607}{105681}and that I be buried in sand... 
{105682}{105770}a cable's length from shore.
{105771}{105835}You don't think Gull|is confiding in him, do you?
{105836}{105924}The old fellow isn't as far gone|as all that, is he?
{105925}{106032}No. He's not that foolish.
{106107}{106224}Let the brother receive the light.
{106545}{106660}'Another beautiful|murder will be committed by me."
{106661}{106720}"Fear me. Jack the Ripper."
{106721}{106802}- They're rubbish, you know that.|- Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.
{106803}{106898}Though why you persist in believing that|red-haired jezebel, I'll never know.
{106899}{106978}Have you considered that she's the sort|of woman who likes to make up stories... 
{106979}{107026}particularly about men?
{107027}{107157}She is, after all, a whore.|She's a woman who... 
{107158}{107281}"A rose by any other name."|Is that it?
{107297}{107377}Frederick, my dear chum, no one|is more delighted than I am... 
{107378}{107450}that you've decided to resume|your interest in the fairer sex... 
{107451}{107500}but please remember... 
{107501}{107570}a woman like that can make a man feel|whatever she wants him to feel.
{107571}{107626}- Sergeant Godley.|- Yes, sir.
{107627}{107666}Arrest the Nichol Street gang.
{107667}{107725}- Right away, Inspector.|- I tried to stop them, Inspector.
{107726}{107786}This arrived with this afternoon's post.
{107787}{107834}Open it up!
{107835}{107926}"I send you half the kidney I took|from one woman, preserved for you.
{107927}{108023}T'other piece I fried and ate.|It was very nice."
{108024}{108096}We demand something be done,|and done tonight.
{108097}{108166}"From Hell."
{108167}{108234}Well, at least|they got the address right.
{108235}{108313}It can't be.|Are you sure he was the same?
{108314}{108383}I know him.|I posed for him twice meself.
{108384}{108460}I stood there naked as a babe|watching him paint me for hours.
{108461}{108517}And he was with Ann for what...|over a year?
{108518}{108609}- Nearly two.
{108635}{108701}Ah, here you are.|Hello, girls.
{108702}{108762}Where have you been?|I told you to wait for me.
{108763}{108841}I can't stay in a pub|and not have a drink.
{108842}{108912}That's cruel.|But look who I bumped into.
{108913}{108993}Remember Ada?
{108994}{109106}- She's from France.|- Bruxelles.
{109107}{109162}- Bruxelles.|- Yes.
{109163}{109250}Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?
{109251}{109338}Not in public, love.|Not in public.
{109339}{109421}Would you give us a minute alone?|We need to speak with Liz.
{109422}{109507}No, Ada, you stay where you are.
{109508}{109557}Come, Mary.|Get a drinksy.
{109558}{109641}- Mary.
{109830}{109900}You don't have to worry|about Nichol Street for at least a week.
{109901}{109971}- I can keep 'em that long.|- Well, that's something, anyway.
{109972}{110033}- Thank you.|- Yeah.
{110034}{110120}- Baby Alice, she's all right?|- Yeah, she's all right.
{110121}{110168}We'll get her out after this is over.
{110169}{110217}"We'll get her."
{110218}{110266}Listen.
{110267}{110336}I want you and your friends off the|streets until I can sort this thing out.
{110337}{110404}- Off the streets? For how long?|- A few days, at least.
{110405}{110452}Well, you better|throw us in jail then... 
{110453}{110518}'cause we have no money for food|and no money for a doss.
{110519}{110588}All right. You take this.
{110589}{110656}Buy some food,|get a room and stay there.
{110657}{110749}Don't tell anyone where you're going.|I don't want to know.
{110750}{110829}In three days, come to the Ten Bells.
{110830}{110952}I'll leave a message|with the barkeep.
{110962}{111041}What? It's not enough?
{111042}{111150}I wish I could show you|the little village where I was born.
{111151}{111206}It's so lovely there.
{111207}{111297}It's by the sea,|the way you said you saw me.
{111298}{111375}I used to think it too small|to spend a life in... 
{111376}{111481}but now I'm not so sure.
{111575}{111630}Don't. Don't.
{111631}{111718}What? Do you think|I'm paying you back?
{111719}{111781}I didn't mean it as business.
{111782}{111844}I'm still a woman.|They haven't taken that away from me.
{111845}{111941}Not yet, anyways.
{112195}{112274}- Enough of that.
{112275}{112381}Now, lad, at least take... 
{112387}{112475}Sorry, sir.
{112891}{113002}There, milady.|One more time.
{113055}{113143}And curtsy.
{113146}{113239}And we're done.
{113423}{113565}Oh, don't be modest, girl.|They don't care what we do.
{113706}{113769}I paid for your supper, remember.
{113770}{113837}Stop shaking your head at me,|you slag!
{113838}{113885}Leave her alone.
{113886}{113936}She is my business.|She's not yours.
{113937}{113984}Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
{113985}{114035}No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!
{114036}{114083}Calm down!|They'll call the land lord on us.
{114084}{114133}Don't go out.|It's not safe.
{114134}{114204}I need something to sustain myself.
{114205}{114260}- I will be right back.|- Liz, don't be so fucking stupid!
{114261}{114320}- Do without for a night.|- No.
{114321}{114435}- I want a fucking drink.|- Liz!
{114457}{114523}Here we are.|Service records.
{114524}{114651}Grenadier Guards.|Lieutenant Benjamin Kidney.
{114652}{114763}There, just as you suspected.
{114766}{114814}Before he joined Special Branch... 
{114815}{114872}Ben Kidney served|in the Grenadier Guards.
{114873}{114963}Part of his duties included|assisting the field surgeon.
{114964}{115030}Let me tell you something, Inspector,|of which I'm absolutely certain.
{115031}{115130}Assisting an expert is different...|very, very different... 
{115131}{115178}from doing it oneself.
{115179}{115246}Think about it. Someone's|gotta clean up after the prince.
{115247}{115325}And whose job is it|to take care of the widow's messes?
{115326}{115382}You've turned into Othello.|Do you know that?
{115383}{115434}Everything is a suspicion.
{115435}{115470}And like that tragic Moor... 
{115471}{115527}all your suspicions|will end up in your own demise.
{115528}{115606}For heaven's sake, man,|these women aren't just being silenced.
{115607}{115696}They're being murdered most brutally.|Why would Ben Kidney do that?
{115697}{115774}To scare people.|To keep their mind off the real point.
{115775}{115805}Which is?
{115806}{115861}Think what's at stake|for Special Branch.
{115862}{115946}Prince Edward married Ann Crook,|a commoner and a Catholic.
{115947}{116013}Married her in a Catholic church.|They had a baby.
{116014}{116121}A legitimate baby, who is, in fact,|heir to the throne of England.
{116122}{116178}All these women were there.
{116179}{116280}All these women|were eyewitnesses to an event... 
{116281}{116401}that could rip the empire to pieces.
{116515}{116597}When she starts drinking,|she'll go all night. You know that.
{116598}{116649}But she knows how dangerous it is.
{116650}{116703}She don't believe you|about the prince.
{116704}{116865}She thinks you're feeding that copper|candies to keep him interested.
{116966}{117019}Hello, sir.
{117020}{117087}Is anything wrong, my dear?
{117088}{117192}No, sir. For a moment,|I thought you were someone else.
{117193}{117258}Oh.
{117259}{117344}Thirsty?
{117475}{117553}Always parched, sir.
{117554}{117630}Perhaps there is somewhere nearby|that we might go... 
{117631}{117720}while my coach man keeps watch.
{117721}{117790}Oh, yeah.
{117791}{117864}Yeah. This way.
{117865}{117952}Follow me.
{118588}{118701}Yeah, it's this way.|Follow me.
{118754}{118826}I dropped my grapes.
{118827}{118905}Oh!
{119139}{119217}No!
{119314}{119441}What the fuck|are you looking at, Lipski?
{119467}{119563}Shut up! Shut up!
{120092}{120152}- I hear someone coming, sir.
{120153}{120235}- Sir!
{120741}{120813}All right, George, that's enough.
{120814}{120878}It's one of them, isn't it?
{120879}{120934}Throat's cut the same way.
{120935}{120990}Yeah.
{120991}{121050}He didn't finish.
{121051}{121145}Well, she's no less dead for that.
{121146}{121258}He won't be satisfied by this.
{121303}{121385}Wilkins?
{121386}{121508}Fetch the ambulance.|Go on, run along.
{122507}{122602}Excuse me, miss.
{123543}{123638}You could be dead... right now.
{123639}{123775}But then there would be|too many bloody questions.
{123792}{123882}Ignore the old man's blathering.|Find a scape goat.
{123883}{123958}Or next time we won't care who asks... 
{123959}{124087}"Whatever happened|to Inspector Abberline?"
{124667}{124776}We should hurry up, sir.|It's clearin' up.
{124777}{124858}Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?
{124859}{124906}Chalk, sir?
{124907}{125032}- They found another one in Mitre Square!
{125262}{125375}Bastards! They did another one!
{125490}{125586}I heard he cut off her nose this time.
{125587}{125672}Nice work, Inspector. You've|encouraged him to do two a night now.
{125673}{125783}Out of the fucking way, cunt.
{125927}{125992}Katherine Eddowes.
{125993}{126052}There's some writing on a wall|just down the road there.
{126053}{126138}You should have a look at it.
{126139}{126243}"The 'Juwes' are the men|that will not be blamed for nothing."
{126244}{126366}It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.
{126374}{126422}I was busy with the children... 
{126423}{126492}Madame, slow down. Slow down.
{126493}{126620}Make sure you get|the apron as well, yeah?
{126810}{126868}It was written by the killer, sir.
{126869}{126926}And how do you know that?
{126927}{127026}I was here three-quarters|of an hour ago.
{127027}{127088}This building... mostly Jews|live here, is that right?
{127089}{127157}- Yeah, that's right.|- Ready now, sir.
{127158}{127270}Put that away and get out of here|immediately.
{127271}{127318}- Abberline.|- Yeah?
{127319}{127353}Wash that off.
{127354}{127397}- What?|- You heard me.
{127398}{127464}- It's evidence, sir.|- Listen to me.
{127465}{127572}In another hour, there will be|a thousand people poking about in here.
{127573}{127661}If those words are seen,|not a Jew in London will be safe.
{127662}{127746}We'll have may hem on the streets.|So wash it off!.
{127747}{127858}That's an educated hand, sir.|An educated man wrote that.
{127859}{127945}- Look for yourself.|- I don't have to look. I've seen it.
{127946}{128034}An educated man|knows how to spell "Jews."
{128035}{128091}I don't know what this refers to,|but I'm sure it's got nothing to do... 
{128092}{128213}with the people who live around here.
{128229}{128333}Sergeant, I want two constables|to wash that off.
{128334}{128448}What are you looking to him for?|Wash it off!.
{128449}{128535}Yes, sir.
{128537}{128605}Half a dozen men have seen it already.|The sergeant has copied it down.
{128606}{128679}I'll remember these words|for as long as I live.
{128680}{128769}So all you're doing|is destroying its value as evidence.
{128770}{128838}No, all I'm doing is taking|charge of an investigation... 
{128839}{128920}that you have bungled|to the point of gross inefficiency... 
{128921}{128974}and I've had enough.
{128975}{129068}You are suspended from duty, Abberline.
{129069}{129168}Inspector Abberline is suspended.
{129169}{129302}- All his privileges are cancelled.|- Yes, sir.
{129620}{129690}You've not seen her, then?
{129691}{129809}Well, if she comes around,|give her this.
{129810}{129895}Long letter, eh?
{129896}{129970}This is for your trouble.
{129971}{130034}The letter's private.|You understand?
{130035}{130140}- I understand.|- Right.
{131295}{131386}Where's this?
{131454}{131510}Recite the solemn oath.
{131511}{131622}Never to reveal our secrets... 
{132036}{132116}Grapes again.
{132117}{132168}Why grapes?
{132169}{132216}This ain't killing for profit.
{132217}{132270}- He's not that foolish.|- You oughta be botherin' McQueen.
{132271}{132412}- Are you questioning my decision?|- Find a scape goat.
{132415}{132508}This is ritual.
{134116}{134221}"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."
{134265}{134350}"Juwes."
{135042}{135133}- It's me, Ada. Me. Only me.
{135134}{135246}I bring everything for supper.
{135257}{135328}You little thief.|I need this money.
{135329}{135404}I just take some money|and buy food for me and for you.
{135405}{135476}Is that bad, Marie?
{135477}{135550}It's fine, dear.|You're a good person, but listen.
{135551}{135645}Until I go away from London,|it's not safe for you to go out.
{135646}{135715}Understand?
{135716}{135806}I stay with Marie.|Beautiful Marie.
{135807}{135894}It's all right, darling.|You don't have to pay for your food.
{135895}{135978}Pardon?
{136012}{136112}Here's to our feast.
{136891}{136988}I'm so sorry to greet you|like this, Inspector, but... 
{136989}{137036}but I'm rather late|for an appointment.
{137037}{137089}Will you excuse me|if I finish dressing while we talk?
{137090}{137137}No, no. Please, go on.
{137138}{137216}Thank you.
{137217}{137349}I'd like to speak to you about|the Freemasons if I might, sir.
{137350}{137463}The arrangement of the coins|at Dark Annie's feet... 
{137464}{137577}and also the locations of the bodies... 
{137578}{137626}form a pentacle star.
{137627}{137702}A pentacle star is a symbol|of the Freemasons, is it not, sir?
{137703}{137783}Yes.
{137796}{137937}And the way that all these women were|killed... throats cut left to right... 
{137938}{138030}organs removed.
{138031}{138154}They're reenactments,|aren't they, sir?
{138155}{138202}Reenactments of what?
{138203}{138282}The Juwes.
{138283}{138345}The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,|founder of the Masons... 
{138346}{138411}that's how they were executed.
{138412}{138510}Ah, yes.|So the great book tells us.
{138511}{138644}So Jack the Ripper|isn't just merely killing whores.
{138645}{138692}He's executing traitors.
{138693}{138770}He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.
{138771}{138833}Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector... 
{138834}{138884}that you won't be permitted|to arrest him.
{138885}{138993}I don't want to arrest him.
{139024}{139093}The Ripper has|one more traitor yet to kill... 
{139094}{139194}and I will stop him.
{139278}{139338}Did they come to you, sir... 
{139339}{139430}as a loyal Mason?
{139431}{139591}Did they ask you to help them cover up|the prince's secret marriage?
{139604}{139658}That's how it started, yes.
{139659}{139775}And then you discovered|the prince had syphilis.
{139776}{139881}He's going to die of it, Inspector.
{139882}{140012}Would you like a tour|of the syphilis wards?
{140026}{140144}You're a physician ordinary|to the queen... 
{140145}{140237}entrusted with the well-being|of the heir to the throne.
{140238}{140303}Only you... 
{140304}{140387}had reason to believe|that these unfortunates... 
{140388}{140443}these whores... 
{140444}{140542}these... traitors... 
{140543}{140651}destroyed your life's work.
{140805}{140889}Below the skin of history... 
{140890}{140938}are London's veins.
{140939}{141071}These symbols...|the mitre, the pentacle star... 
{141075}{141136}even someone as ignorant... 
{141137}{141225}and degenerate as you... 
{141226}{141364}can sense that they course|with energy and meaning.
{141416}{141496}I am that meaning.
{141497}{141593}I am that energy.
{141763}{141870}One day, men will look back... 
{141871}{141997}and say I gave birth|to the 20th century.
{142118}{142244}You're not going to see|the 20th century.
{143167}{143265}Roll up his sleeve.
{143306}{143402}- Don't struggle.
{143415}{143533}You'll only make this more painful.
{145451}{145551}You all right, mate?
{148444}{148514}- Dr. Gull.|- Yes!
{148515}{148614}You were describing|the human heart.
{148615}{148694}Yes.
{148695}{148762}Yes.
{148763}{148826}The human heart... 
{148827}{148926}is a dense and powerful muscle... 
{148927}{149028}much like the organic|equivalent of mahogany.
{149029}{149114}And notoriously difficult... 
{149115}{149200}to burn.
{149238}{149322}About the size of a fist... 
{149323}{149445}it provides the motor power|for the circulatory system.
{149446}{149538}The heart contains two atria,|two ventricles... 
{149539}{149613}and four valves.
{149614}{149710}It is, in effect, a single pump... 
{149711}{149818}powering a double circuit.
{149826}{149977}In the adult the heart rate|averages 70 to 80 beats a minute.
{150008}{150096}Such is the force|of the heartbeat... 
{150097}{150245}that if the body's largest artery,|the aorta, is severed... 
{150257}{150364}- a six-foot jet of blood... 
{150365}{150455}is released.
{151234}{151351}Let the brother receive the light.
{151391}{151499}For you fear no God, arise.
{151538}{151646}Your faith is well founded.
{152547}{152613}Don't. Don't go in there.|There's no need.
{152614}{152683}How bad is it?
{152684}{152759}She's-She's in pieces, sir.
{152760}{152863}Sergeant, he can go in.
{153114}{153186}- Give him to me!|- He'll be taken care of, I swear to it.
{153187}{153269}- I want him.|- He's done. I give you my word.
{153270}{153373}Fuck your word! I'll bring every|last one of you fucking cunts down.
{153374}{153421}You and your fucking brothers!
{153422}{153466}Now, listen to me, Abberline.
{153467}{153526}Your situation...|your difficult situation... 
{153527}{153573}has been thoroughly discussed.
{153574}{153705}You are reinstated.|Indeed, you are promoted.
{153719}{153769}- No! No.
{153770}{153840}Come on. This is not helping anything.|Come on! Come on.
{153841}{153926}Don't be a fool, Inspector.
{153927}{154023}You will be very closely watched.
{154024}{154071}Yeah, you're all there now, ain't ya?
{154072}{154120}Where were you|when this was happening?
{154121}{154197}It's all right for you, standing|around there chatting. What about us?
{154198}{154274}Inspector Abberline is in charge.
{154275}{154400}Give him all the assistance|he requires.
{154503}{154550}No!
{154551}{154620}Remember, you're being watched.
{154621}{154685}All right, come on, you men.|Clear this passage.
{154686}{154816}- Come on. Move 'em away.|- Move back! Back!
{154942}{155052}Shall we proceed, Inspector?
{155465}{155532}Body lies in middle of bed.
{155533}{155657}Shoulders flat,|but axis of body inclined toward right.
{155658}{155710}The left arm is close to the body... 
{155711}{155757}the forearm flexed at a right angle... 
{155758}{155825}resting across the abdomen.
{155826}{155940}The right arm|is slightly abducted from the body.
{155941}{156006}It rests on the mattress|with the elbow bent... 
{156007}{156102}and the forearm supine.
{156103}{156210}The fingers are clenched,|indicating a struggle as she died.
{156211}{156295}Notice something, Inspector?
{156296}{156363}No.
{156364}{156451}No, go on.
{156530}{156577}Came in not long before dawn.
{156578}{156695}A bit of a rush.|Left this for ya.
{156835}{156887}I know you asked me to wait.
{156888}{157005}If I'm to be murdered,|I'd like at least to die in my village.
{157006}{157077}I'm going to the orphanage|to collect Baby Alice.
{157078}{157142}Here's an address where you can find us.
{157143}{157190}We'll wait for you eagerly.
{157191}{157250}I know... I know in my heart... 
{157251}{157312}we can be happy living by the sea... 
{157313}{157377}just as you saw.
{157378}{157444}I hope to be with you soon, dearest.
{157445}{157542}All my love, Mary.
{157790}{157793}We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
{157794}{157870}We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
{157871}{157994}We asked Sir William to remove a threat|to our family and to our throne... 
{157995}{158081}not to engage|in these ghastly rituals.
{158082}{158186}Oh, no, of course not, Your Majesty.|That was unexpected.
{158187}{158257}On the other hand,|he has fulfilled his duties.
{158258}{158318}The threat is passed, Your Majesty.
{158319}{158414}In his way Sir William has been loyal... 
{158415}{158478}and we are grateful for that.
{158479}{158542}The rest is in your hands,|Lord Hallsham.
{158543}{158654}We wish to hear nothing further of this.
{158655}{158712}Knight of the East... 
{158713}{158773}we are gathered here|beneath the God of love... 
{158774}{158872}and before the sight of|the Great Architect to judge this case.
{158873}{158996}You stand accused of mayhems that have|placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.
{158997}{159086}You stand before your peers...|Masons and doctors both.
{159087}{159193}- I have no peers present here.|- What?
{159194}{159282}No man amongst you|is fit to judge... 
{159283}{159357}the mighty art that I have wrought.
{159358}{159450}Your rituals are empty oaths|you neither understand... 
{159451}{159541}nor live by.
{159574}{159652}The Great Architect speaks to me.
{159653}{159788}He is the balance where my deeds|are weighed and judged... 
{159789}{159836}not you.
{159837}{159889}Knight of the East... 
{159890}{159988}hear our judgement.
{161161}{161284}Well, they're not watching you anymore.
{161331}{161413}I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.
{161414}{161461}They think she's dead.
{161462}{161540}If I disappear or|change my routine suddenly... 
{161541}{161610}they might wonder why.
{161611}{161657}You know who you're gonna|turn into, don't you?
{161658}{161741}That boring old bugger in the pub|that nobody wants to sit beside.
{161742}{161793}'Cause as soon as he's had|a few drinks, he goes on and on... 
{161794}{161845}about the girl that got away.
{161846}{161970}Do you want to live|the rest of your life like a ghost?
{161971}{162049}No.
{162055}{162138}What I want is to go to her.
{162139}{162214}But at the slightest hint that she's|a live, they will spare no expense... 
{162215}{162289}no expense and no trouble.
{162290}{162400}So I stay... and watch them.
{163274}{163355}Alice! Alice!
{163356}{163452}Come in, darling.
{163519}{163612}Coming, Mother.
{164614}{164686}Get up.
{164687}{164782}Get up! Come on.

SEPTiCEMiA TEAM
Is it bad tonight?
Bad. That's one way to describe it.
Insane seems a little more appropriate.
It feels like he's breathing down my neck.
It is my professionaI opinion we should get the hell out of here. Now.
Noted.
Clean this place up, then locate our guests.
I just need to take the edge off.
You know the routine.
I need you clear-headed.
First things first.
Now, where is he?
Show me where he's hiding.
Son of a bitch!
You said he only killed nine people.
There are 40 victims here.
Nine when he was alive.
He's added a few since then.
Now where is he, Dennis?
All teams go to alpha. Bring in the cube!
How did this guy get the name
"The Breaker"? Is he a truck driver?
Simple folkIore.
The locaI color exorcising its demons.
Maybe it's because he broke his victims into as many pieces as possible.
I hate being rushed.
This one isn't like the others.
- I'll give you a bonus.
- You don't have that kind of money.
After tonight you'll be surprised.
Now, get to work.
CarefuI, Dennis.
Don't get too curious.
Son of a bitch!
How can you justify what you're doing,
Cyrus? It's out and out slavery!
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, Kalina?
Still carrying around those ridiculous quicksilver flares?
You still have that quaint magicaI book?
These aren't animals you're capturing, they're human beings.
They are dead human beings.
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.
Throw blood on old women's furs.
Who are you to play God?
- Playing is for children.
- You'll never pull it off.
Not without the right spells.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.
Thirteenth ghost?
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time already.
Why did he say thirteenth?
Move the cube into position.
What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.
Yes. Twelve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!
That's not how it works, and you know it!
There's no time to argue.
Release the bait!
What bait? We never needed bait before!
A truck full of blood?
You've got to be shitting me.
Oh, boy.
Now...
...power up the cube.
Start transmitting.
Come.
Come.
Come!
Help me! Help me!
Oh, shit!
Put him down!
Cyrus, I hope you're happy.
You've got your twelve now.
Help me! He's dying!
Hang on, Damon. Somebody help!
Damn you, Cyrus!
Somebody help me, please!
Help me. Do something!
Oh, Cyrus.
Oh, God.
- Swing me!
- Come on, Bobby.
Faster, Kathy.
Let me get your arms.
Try to drag me.
You're the best little brother.
I love you. Let's go!
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you!
Look at those two. She's got him on the run now, but pretty soon...
...he's going to be picking her up and throwing her over his shoulder.
They're perfect.
Watch them. Watch them.
They really love this place.
I love you.
Surprise!
My heart! My heart!
Happy birthday, Dad!
Happy birthday, Arthur.
Here's my present, Dad.
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.
What did you wish for?
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
What's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?
I'll get the kids. Call the fire department.
Dad! Help, Mom!
Get the kids. Get the kids!
Mom! Dad! Help me!
Where's your mom? Where is she?
I don't know where Mom is.
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!
Jean! Jean!
Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her there.
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.
You can't go back in there, sir.
I'm sorry, sir. She didn't make it.
I should have gone back in.
We are gathered here today, to honor the memory...
...and life's work ofJean Kriticos...
...a devoted mother and loving wife...
...who was too quickly taken from this life.
Jean, you will be forever missed, but never forgotten.
I miss you, Mom.
Why did you have to leave us?
I can't do this without you.
I don't want you to go.
Mom, I love you so much.
Please watch over us.
I'll love you always.
Dad, it's...
It's almost 8:30.
Shake a leg or you'll miss your first class.
Today on Death in America:
"Cancer rates are down...
"... but suicide is sky-high.
"We have a speciaI treat for you today.
"A body was found this morning, decolopolated. "
"Decapitated. "
Bobby, find a healthier hobby.
Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.
Good morning, everybody.
Something smells interesting.
Dad, they found a guy without a head behind Dunkin' Donuts.
I love Dunkin' Donuts.
Kathy.
Let Maggie make breakfast for once.
That's why we hired her.
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?
Just that one time.
I heard that. Hell, I cook better than you.
We have to try to get along here.
Dad, tell Kathy that keeping a record of death is healthy.
Kathy, "Keeping a record of death is healthy. "
Because she's being a reaI slut about it.
Bobby. Don't call your sister a slut.
Thank you, Maggie.
I prefer the term "bitch. "
Sluts are girls with loose-
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, did you do your homework?
Because Mr. Peterson-
Damn it! Bobby, that's the third time
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!
- Sorry.
- If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't-
We don't have a big place anymore, do we?
It's the best I can do for now...
...so let's all try and keep our shit off the floor.
All right? Now, Bobby, put away the damn tape recorder.
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Must be the lawyer. I forgot.
Lawyer? I thought our credit was all cleaned up.
No, I don't think it's about that.
They won't make us move again, will they?
It's gonna be all right.
Whatever it is, we'll deaI with it.
Mr. Kriticos?
That's right. You are?
Ben Moss. How do you do?
Please, come in.
Is now a good time, or...?
As good a time as any.
Please, just give me one minute.
Sorry. I'm ready.
I represent the estate of your uncle
Cyrus Kriticos.
We have an Uncle Cyrus?
Had. I only met him a couple of times as a kid.
He wasn't too popular.
My dad said he squandered the family fortune.
We have a family fortune?
No. Cyrus squandered it.
Bobby, isn't that great?
You have a late uncle.
- What is he late for?
- His next birthday.
You mean, he's dead?
- Now we get his attention.
- Pipe down.
Cyrus recorded this message six weeks ago.
He asked that it be played for you in the event of his death.
Arthur...
...it's good to talk to you.
Sadly, if you're watching this now, it means I am no longer among the living.
Happily, that makes you and your family my sole beneficiaries.
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...
...to deliver the essential elements in my last will and testament.
Give it to them, Ben.
A key?
A key to what?
A key to your new house.
What?
This house is the fruit of my life's work.
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.
Is this for reaI?
It is a one-of-a-kind home.
It's my home, actually.
My home.
I have no complaints.
I've led an interesting life.
I have seen some amazing things.
But the only regret I have, is that
I never got to know my nephew Arthur...
...nor appreciate the love of a family, like you have.
This house is my attempt to make up for that.
Enjoy.
Perhaps we'll meet again...
...in another life.
- Wow!
- When can we see it?
The house is yours whenever you like.
I'm heading up there after work.
If you want, you, your wife and kids-
Time-out. I am not the missus here.
My wife...
My wife is...
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.
What? It's true.
That's enough, Robert.
Mr. Moss, exactly where is this place?
A couple hours drive from here, a town called Willow Grove...
...just up the parkway.
It's in a gorgeous area. But I warn you, your uncle liked his privacy.
There isn't a neighbor for miles.
Come on. Hurry up.
S- U-F.
Suffocate. I got it. I win.
So what? You think you're so slick.
Come on, you guys. We're almost there.
- Excited?
- Yeah. Mom would have freaked over this.
Looks like things are starting to get better, right?
Yeah.
That's strange.
Dad, it's beautifuI.
My God. I've never seen anything like it.
CooI!
So futuroic.
It's about time somebody showed up.
Is this your place?
- Who are you?
- I'm the power guy.
Don't touch.
Your house is knocking out the power of the whole tri-quad area.
I need to get inside and check the breakers.
Could you come back tomorrow?
Is that a possibility?
Tomorrow? Let me see.
There are about 5,570 houses right now without power.
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...
Well, that's not really our problem, is it?
Look, buddy, I've been doing this job for about three weeks.
Is there any way you can give me a break here?
Sure.
No problem.
Thank you.
Mr...?
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.
It's quite a place you've got.
Yeah. We're moving in.
One step at a time.
- That's odd.
- Dad, you broke it.
Bobby, give it a rest.
Hello.
Wow! You can see right through it.
You guys couldn't afford any walls?
How weird.
Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen on privacy.
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.
It's like a funhouse.
It's Latin.
Everything's so beautifuI.
Family, just so we're all clear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.
Wow!
What an incredible wealth of knowledge.
A samurai sword.
In your dreams, paI.
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.
Oh, Cyrus.
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?
Goodness.
It's like a cathedraI.
All right, first rule: No throwing stones.
It's marvelous, though, isn't it?
A living work of art.
The sooner you show me where you hid the basement...
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.
I believe it's down the hall.
It's two doors on the right.
Excuse me.
The construction is amazing.
I'm getting dizzy.
Bobby.
Don't touch anything. Okay?
At least untiI we get property insurance.
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign in the library.
After that, I'd love to give you and your family a tour of the house.
Great. I don't want you guys to move from this spot.
We'll be right back.
You're being paranoid and overprotective.
Yeah, of all this stuff.
I know you guys too well. Stay...
...right here. I mean it.
What the...?
Where'd you hide your money, old man?
Shit!
What the hell was that?
Oh, no.
Oh, Cyrus.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Was Cyrus a hunter?
You could say that.
Your uncle was quite a collector of many things.
I've marked where you're supposed to sign, Arthur.
Okay, look.
I didn't want to bring this up in front of the kids...
...but this place is beyond amazing.
I'm just a math teacher.
The taxes alone must be...
I have nothing set aside.
To be honest, a fire took away everything.
Arthur, you don't need to worry.
Cyrus was a genius when it came to finances.
Basically, you and your family never have to worry about money again.
Son of a bitch.
Lookee here. Look, y'all.
Look, look!
Sign.
Arthur?
Arthur, we've got to...
We have to talk.
What is the deaI with the breakers?
Nothing. I'm not a power guy.
My name is Dennis Rafkin.
- You're Dennis Rafkin?
- Who's Dennis Rafkin?
My office warned me about this guy.
I know this will sound completely whacked, but stay with me.
I used to hunt displaced spirituaI energies with your uncle.
I'm sorry?
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths.
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
Okay. I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.
Arthur, I used to...
I used to hunt ghosts with your Uncle Cyrus.
Goats?
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!
Race you to the end of the hall.
No, Bobby, I don't think this is the place-
Come on, slowpoke!
Is that the best you got?
My grandma scoots better than that.
Ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits trapped on earth. Ghosts.
As in Halloween? Boo?
As in Demi Moore and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.
Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.
I'll explain everything...
...as soon as you get you and your children outside.
- What's taking you so long?
- Out of my way.
- I don't think scooting is your game.
- Come on.
- I won.
- You cheated. I didn't get a start.
Got to be on your toes, man.
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.
- I wonder what my room's like.
- This is the coolest room in the house.
I'll be in here.
This place is awesome!
Cyrus has containment cubes all over the basement.
I don't know why they're here...
...and I am not staying around to find out.
- So, if I were you-
- Well, he isn't you.
This guy has been harassing my office since your uncle died.
I see this all the time.
Some rich guy passes away and all the nuts come out!
Next thing, he'll be claiming
Cyrus owned him money or-
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitload of money!
These are some funky-looking specs.
- What do you think? Do I look cooI?
- Let me see.
Not so fast. Cater to my ego first:
"Maggie's the best babysitter you ever had. "
- Come on!
- All right.
I'm getting my ass out of the big glass house!
Grab your children! Do the same.
Are you all right?
Jean! Jean!
We'll go get you some help. Okay?
Don't touch me.
Oh, my God!
We have struck gold.
- Easy.
- Don't.
How's your head?
Not good.
Where's the suit?
Power guy. Idiot.
CooI!
Better have a pair of those in my room.
Bobby, where are you going?
What are you staring at?
Hey, kiddo.
He thinks I'm going to duck.
Nice tits.
What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?
Not bad for an hourly wage.
It's time to leave.
I'll take your word for it.
Kathy?
Come on. This way.
Shit! What the hell? Kathy!
Maggie? Bobby!
I was just kidding before.
A little lawyer humor.
Kathy?
Bobby!
I don't believe it.
Believe what?
- I told them not to leave this spot.
- They're kids, what do you expect?
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I'II look up.
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!
Kathy? Where are you guys?
Bobby!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing up here?
I told you to wait downstairs.
Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbelievable.
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?
He's with Maggie.
Was with Maggie. We were racing and we saw all the glass-
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.
Bobby.
Down here.
Maggie?
Come on down and play.
Is that you?
Maggie?
Stop playing games.
Bobby? I have something for you.
We'll have lots of fun.
Don't come down, Bobby.
Stay upstairs.
Don't follow her.
Down here, Bobby.
Bobby, don't come down.
Bobby? Around the corner.
Don't come down here!
That's it.
You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!
Bobby!
I'll find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.
- But, Dad-
- No "buts"!
I want you both to wait in the car.
I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.
- Why are you freaking out?
- Just this once, don't argue with me.
What happened to the door?
Son of a bitch!
I cannot believe this.
I'm going to have to break it down.
Back away!
It's quite dramatic...
...but you're wasting your time.
It's all sealed up.
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
- Don't go there.
What do you mean, "all sealed up"?
What part of that code are you having trouble cracking?
The entire house is sealed up.
- There must be another way out.
- I've looked.
We'II look again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.
That's all right, I'll wait right here.
I don't know what is going on here, or who the hell you are.
And my son is missing.
So, untiI those questions are answered, you're not leaving my sight.
Now, get up!
All right. Breathe.
Did the lawyer split?
Bobby.
Bobby.
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!
Bobby!
- Bobby.
- Come on out now, paI!
Stop screwing around.
Glass family Robinson, you're wasting your breath.
This is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.
This is shatterproof and soundproof.
What are these?
That's a little harder to explain.
They're containment spells.
Ghosts can't cross those.
- Ghosts?
- Yes, ghosts.
The supernaturaI realm has its own laws.
For ghosts, it's spells.
Written or spoken, the ghosts have to obey whatever the spells say.
The entire basement is filled with ghosts.
In this basement?
Of course, in this basement.
If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!
Dad!
- I can prove it.
- I gave a pair of those to Bobby.
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.
Bobby, come on.
- I don't see any ghosts.
- Because they're locked downstairs.
Dad!
There's more of this crazy spell shit on the floor.
Let me see those.
Bobby! Come on out, paI!
Hidden barrier spells.
Why would he need more protection?
All right, that's enough.
This is not helping.
Do me a favor and stop with all the haunted house nonsense...
...at least untiI we find the kid and figure a way out of here.
Bobby, come on.
I don't know where he could be.
No, no!
Wait!
What did I just say, that there was a petting zoo downstairs?
No!
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.
Right, right. But you also said...
...that they're all locked up. Right?
- No. No way.
- Wait.
Listen.
I'll make a deaI with you.
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...
...if you just help me...
...find my son.
Unbelievable. Get out of my way.
Bobby.
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.
You need to put on those glasses.
Leave me alone!
That's it. That's a good boy.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Go upstairs and find your father.
Mom?
Go on.
Go upstairs!
Go find Kathy.
Watch out.
Watch out.
Bobby! Come on!
You don't have to scream, all right? Just...
...chill.
- This way.
- Hold on. Listen to me.
This will take forever.
This place is just too big.
Kathy and I will head up this way.
You two check down there.
- No, I don't think we should split up.
- It's okay.
Go in a straight line, turn around.
We'll meet back here in five.
Five. Back here.
Don't touch anything.
- I don't want to go with him!
- Go ahead.
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.
There are ghosts down here.
If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.
What the hell? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?
I was down here before.
They weren't open.
- God! I hate it when they do that!
- Do what?
They wait for you to put your face up to the glass, then give you...
...a big, fat "boo"!
Don't do that!
God.
See it?
- It's, it's...
- A ghost.
Just like I've been saying all night!
Finally, a believer!
Ghosts are around us all the time.
Most of them can't hurt us.
Most don't want to.
Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.
But there are exceptions, like this bad-ass behind me.
Those who die violently stay in a tortured realm, so that's all they know.
What is he doing?
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the glasses.
I've had it with this. It's time to go.
- Now! Please!
- Don't touch me.
Will you come on?
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It's time to go.
Dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.
Dad!
Dad.
Listen to me.
He's going to be okay.
We're going to find him.
I am so ready to leave this place.
- Oh, boy.
- What?
- That's the symboI of The JackaI.
- What's The JackaI?
The JackaI is the Charlie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.
We've got to get out of this basement.
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there-
Kathy!
Think about what you're saying.
There is no such thing as ghosts.
Kathy.
Kathy!
What is it? I can't see it!
Tell me where it is!
Get off!
Hold on! Stay with me!
Come on, pull!
- Who are you?
- Never mind, just pull.
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.
Somehow...
...we got behind enemy lines.
Hurry!
Please, hurry!
Hey, little guy.
- How.
- Don't tease the ghosts.
- Will you shut up?
- You shut up. You keep pissing them off.
Go.
- Maggie!
- What?
Where?
I can't see without the glasses, idiot!
Well, I can see.
And I think you should go this way!
Go, go!
It's all right. I've got you.
Look at me.
Daddy.
It's okay.
Who the hell are you?
And what the hell was that?
My name is Kalina Oretzia.
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.
What?
I free trapped souls. Cyrus-
Forget Cyrus, who traps souls, for a damn second.
What are you doing here?
Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.
Oh, my God!
It's over there! It's over there!
Give him your glasses.
Come on!
Oh, my God.
Unbelievable.
Another one of Cyrus's victims.
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.
Victims?
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.
That's why I'm here.
I intend to set them all free.
Listen to me.
I need to know...
...how you got in here.
I slipped through an opening in the house when it shifted.
- An opening where?
- It's closed now. It won't happen again.
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.
Many people died in the quest for this book.
It was written in the 15th century by an astrologer named Basileus.
In it, he describes the making of a certain machine.
One that can see into the future.
He wrote it while he was under demonic possession.
I can't believe Cyrus built it.
Built what? What are you talking about?
Basileus's device.
We're in the middle of a machine, designed by the deviI and powered by the dead.
Listen to me.
I don't give a shit about any machine...
...or deviI or Basileus or anything...
...except getting my family the hell out of this place.
I came here to set the souls in this house free.
You want help, you have to help me first.
Kathy, can you walk?
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not going anywhere without my kids.
Try telling him that.
Come on.
This way. Come on.
Stairs. Let's go.
Go. You go!
Don't touch me!
Wait! The glasses!
You'll need these! Catch!
- Good job.
- Sorry.
Perfect. Another dead end.
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?
- Get away.
- What? What do we do now?
Get away from the glass.
- Why?
- Just do it.
Glasses.
Duck!
Move! Go left!
Do something, for Christ's sake!
We're running out of corridors!
Duck! Go left! Go right! Move!
Get down!
Here. We've got to get to the library.
It has spell protection all around it.
Where is that from here?
Can I rely on you not to get me killed?
I guarantee nothing.
See anything?
- Anything?
- No.
Come on.
I think they're just downstairs.
Nothing.
If we get out of this alive,
I've got to get a pay raise.
That's a big "if. "
Give me the flare.
What's wrong?
Don't start freaking out now. Come on.
What?
- Okay. What?
- Shut up.
Give me the book.
Just back up.
Go. Slow.
- I'm going slow.
- Slow.
Go! Go!
Fast!
- What the hell?
- Who the hell?
What the hell are you doing here?
Shit!
Remember me?
Thanks for taking your time.
Go down the hall. Turn left, then right.
- Where are we going?
- Trust me, okay?
- Arthur?
- Trust her.
Okay, let's go!
- Who the hell is she?
- I'll explain her later.
What happened to Kathy?
I don't know, she disappeared.
How do you lose an entire family in a glass house?
Arthur!
Kalina, give me a flare!
Get him! Go! Get up!
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!
Oh, my God! Go! Run!
Now is not the time to sit around, Arthur! Run!
Get the door. Close the door!
Arthur, are you all right?
God, what's going on here?
Fucking ghosts.
I hate this job.
They don't like you, either. I wonder why.
You got something to say, say it.
All right. Let's start with:
This is all your goddamn fault!
If you hadn't caught them, we wouldn't be running from them.
It was his uncle that built the house!
You helped him. How could you help him without knowing what he was doing?
- I had my reasons.
- Money, you parasite.
You stole people's souls for money!
How depraved is that?
If you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit flashes in front of my eyes.
So, yeah, I'm depraved.
But Cyrus was my friend, and he accepted me.
He didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!
- He used you.
- Shut up, both of you.
Cut him some slack.
What difference does it make?
You didn't tell him, did you?
Tell me what? What now?
About the fourth ghost.
Don't do this. I didn't tell him.
He has a right to know.
What about the fourth ghost?
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.
You're saying my wife's spirit...
...is trapped in this house?
I didn't know you.
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.
Why? In God's name, why?
Tell me, why her?
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them, including your wife.
I figured out who you were and I've been trying to help you.
You call this help? She's right!
This is all your goddamn fault!
Son of a bitch!
You can save her. And your kids, too.
Just listen to me and believe me.
This house is not a house.
It is a machine.
A complete and faithfuI re-creation of Basileus's design.
According to this, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
See these?
They represent the black zodiac.
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.
I don't want to play.
The Torso.
The Bound Woman.
The Withered Lover.
Jean.
Bobby. I love you.
The Torn Prince.
The Angry Princess.
I'm sorry.
The Pilgrimess.
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.
The Hammer.
And here, the sign of Hell's Winter:
The JackaI.
And The Juggernaut.
The machine required the energy...
...of these specific spirits in order to bring it to life.
Once it engages, the spirits are released one by one.
The house then draws them to its center.
Each one adds its energy to the machine, powering it up.
Powering it up for what?
To open the Ocularis Infernum.
What's that?
It's Latin.
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?
Very good.
The Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house with crazy white people...
Go on.
In hell, there is an eye that sees everything, the past, the future...
...heaven and earth, the blessed, the damned.
If knowledge is power, then the man who controls the Ocularis...
...would be the most powerfuI man on earth.
Your uncle.
Great.
So...
...how many ghosts have been set free?
Eleven. And the house needs twelve.
No. Damon said something about thirteen.
That there are thirteen ghosts.
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.
To stop the process, the house needs a sacrifice of life instead of death.
A willing, human sacrifice.
A sacrifice of the broken heart.
The only ghost to be created out of an act of pure love.
You're the thirteenth ghost.
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the finaI configuration.
As the eye opens, the spirit uses the power of life...
...to short-circuit the system.
Uses the power of life how?
By leaping into the eye.
And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?
No fucking way, lady.
That's suicide. I won't let you do it.
You need to come up with something else.
That's not working.
Love is the most powerfuI energy.
Meaning?
In order for you to save your children, you must trade your life for theirs.
Let me see this.
There's got to be a better way.
I don't read Latin.
Well, we can try it the old-fashioned way, my personaI favorite.
Nobody will be here to brag about it afterwards.
We need to come up with a game plan soon. Time's running out.
Are you going to blow the place up?
The last ghost is about to be released.
- I know why you feeI you have to do this.
- Get away from me.
Psychics call it a "linking. "
We linked earlier. I saw everything...
...about Jean, about you.
Shut up.
I'm not going to listen to this from you.
Kalina is talking about suicide.
Anything to save my kids.
It doesn't add up.
It doesn't make any sense.
There's got to be a better way.
"Doesn't add up"?
What does add up here, Dennis?
How much of this equation makes any sense at all?
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
AII I can think about are my kids.
I don't even know if they're alive.
Then let's go out there and find out.
One last time, while there's still time, you and me.
Kalina...
...no matter what I decide to do, or what happens to any of us...
...are you sure you can you stop that machine?
I've got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century.
Okay.
- How many flares do you have left?
- One, why?
We're going out again.
No fucking way, Arthur.
You're going to get yourself killed.
Not if we take that.
Ten minutes untiI the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.
Go.
We'll go down and buy you some time.
After you, Captain America.
Damn. I just got my nails done.
Here. Put these on.
Come on, let's go!
"There's no place like home. "
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
"There's no place like home. "
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.
That would suck.
Rotate.
Is that half the lawyer?
Here, take this. Move it.
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.
Oh, my God. Shit.
GirI, hurry up!
- Ram him!
- He's swinging for the fences!
Kalina, get over here!
This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!
Where is it?
Where is it?
Kalina?
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.
I made sure your pathetic nephew didn't get himself killed!
Kalina!
Where are the spells?
You're not mad at me, are you?
Of course not.
- What is it?
- Oh, shit.
There's only room for one of us.
What are you doing?
Don't worry, I've been looking for a reason to like myself for a long time.
Dennis, don't do this!
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!
Dennis, no!
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?
Your nephew believes that sacrificing himself will save his kids.
But he won't do it unless his kids are in jeopardy.
- Well, put them in jeopardy.
- What?
- Why not?
- But they're kids.
Greatness requires sacrifice.
Now, I have a job to do.
And so have you.
Do it. Do it!
Yes.
And now to finish this.
Oh, my God. Jean.
I loved you so much.
I miss you.
Miss you.
I'm nothing without you.
Don't go.
Don't go.
Fetch the book.
Cyrus! What are you doing?
You just can't teach some people.
I thought I told you, greatness requires sacrifice.
- Kathy!
- Bobby, don't look.
I don't want to look.
Kathy, I'm scared!
Kathy!
Kathy! Bobby!
Daddy!
Bobby!
Dad, help!
Oh, my...
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!
This house is not a house. It's a machine...
...designed by the devil...
...and powered by the dead.
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
They represent the black zodiac.
They represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch:
- The First-Born Son.
- One.
- The Torso.
- Two.
- The Bound Woman.
- Three.
- The Withered Lover.
- Four.
The Torn Prince.
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.
Twelve.
You're the thirteenth ghost.
If I'm the thirteenth...
You son of a bitch!
Release my kids, you bastard!
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
Do you hear? You loser!
I've dedicated my entire life to this.
Every waking moment, for years.
Have you ever shown that kind of dedication? Have you?
The world has no time for little people like you.
It needs people who are willing to do anything!
Anything for greatness.
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.
You will make that leap.
The machine requires a ghost to be created...
...out of an act of pure love.
That's why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic family.
Make it stop, Dad!
Congratulations, you get to become the thirteenth ghost.
Get on your feet.
Come on!
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.
You can finish this.
You still have the power in you.
It's just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.
Dad! Help!
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!
Oh, fuck!
Dad!
Don't move!
Keep your heads down!
Hold on!
Everybody okay?
You okay?
How did you know we'd be safe here?
I didn't.
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.
I love you both so much.
Mom?
I love you guys.
I love you.
This is it for me.
I am on the first plane back to Newark.
I am sorry, family, Kathy,
Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...
...I am sick of this nanny shit.
I've had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
RESYNCHRONiZE AND FiXED BY
' N3krA ' 
SEPTiCEMiA TEAM
Yes!
Winner!
You own this table!
Where's Bernie? They're killing us.
We need him here right away.
Yeah!
Come on, baby.
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Seven out.
Oh, man!
Come to Papa-
Hey, what the hell?!
God damn it, that's supposed to be an $800 jackpot.
- Afternoon, Doris.
- Hey.
- Got any cream?
- Sure.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
Dewar's and-
Fuck!
Dewar's and water, please.
Hi, Natalie.
- Hey...
- Bernie.
Shit, motherfucker!
Yeah, Bernie.
Yo, Doris, have you seen
Shelly around?
He promised to position me at the tables tonight.
I've been on skid row all week.
You didn't settle up with me last night.
No? You sure?
Fuck, I was way under.
It's been like an AA convention around here.
I'll make it up to you tonight,
I promise.
Where have I heard that before?
- If I see Shelly, I'll tell him...
- Thanks.
...that you're looking for him.
Conway, party of 11.
Please check your reservation in the Paradise Lounge.
Hey, Bernie,
Shelly needs you on 11.
All right.
Let's do the Chivas Regal.
And have that- have Natalie bring it over, the one working the nickel slots by the Paradise.
I spoke to Shelly earlier.
He wants her out on the tables.
All right.
I'll take care of it.
Great shot.
How about that?
Hi. It's you, right?
Yeah, over here.
Joe said
I should stick around.
You say something to Shelly?
Um-hmm.
Wow, that was fast.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
It's over here.
I'll win you a fortune on five and nine.
Did you order the Chivas Regal?
Hey, back off, will you, pal?
Can't you see I got a roll here?
- Seven out, line away.
- That motherfucker.
- Thanks for the bet, folks.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
Oh! Shoot!
Better luck next time.
Ah-hh.
- Shelly, they're here.
- Relax, shorty.
Hey. Nicky, you didn't tell me you were coming.
I'm having a manicure here.
You think I don't wash up after going to the john, huh?
Forget about it. You look like a million bucks. How are you?
You should have called ahead.
I would have sent the car.
- No, we figured we'd surprise you.
- Anytime, Nicky, anytime.
I know that, partner.
Shelly, let me introduce you to our brightest VP here.
This is Larry Sokolov.
His numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.
- How do you do, Shelly?
- Can I get you something to drink?
I'd love a vodka tonic, thanks.
...comes out of the confessional and she says, "Move over, I have to gargle. "
So Nicky, what brings you to town?
Shelly, I've got a smart kid here.
He's got some good ideas about how to revitalize the Shangri-La.
Revitalize? What are you talking about?
We did $35 million last year.
Why don't you just hear the kid out, huh?
Shelly, I want you to know that I have nothing but the utmost respect for you.
You've done a tremendous job with the Shangri-La over the last 16 years.
I don't think anybody can dispute that.
Yeah, nobody doubts that, Shell.
But the business has changed.
Just take a look at the Strip, you'll see what I'm talking about.
What?
You mean that Disneyland mookfest out there? Huh?
Come on, you know what that is?
Huh? That's a fucking violation is what that is.
It's something that used to be beautiful.
It used to have class, like a gorgeous high-priced hooker with an exclusive clientele.
Then along comes that Steve Wynn cocksucker and knocks her up and puts her in a fucking family way.
Now, she's nothing but a cheap fat whore hiding behind too much make-up.
I look at her and see her stretch marks.
It makes me want to cry, because
I remember the way she used to be.
Am i right?
There's no arguing the bottom line.
Those places are raking it in... and the Shangri-La as she is now can't compete with that.
You think I'm trying to compete with that?
You think that's what we're about, trying to bring in the stroller crowd, fresh off some "E-ticket" ride, trying to break the house on red and black?
Fremont has never been about that bullshit.
This is where old time and real money come to play.
The numbers don't back you up on that, Shelly. Don't get me wrong.
Nostalgia is great and we love nostalgia...
...but nostalgia belongs in a museum.
I think it comes a time to decide whether you're running a museum... or you're running a casino.
Bernie.
"Mr. Cool. "
You got a minute?
- I was just heading over to 14.
- It can wait.
How's the knee?
I met this orthopedic surgeon at Vegas Memorial.
He tells me... they can rebuild a man's entire kneecap out of titanium.
Oh, of course it costs a shitload of money, but seeing as this gentleman is into us for 500 large, I thought maybe-
I told you, I'm not gonna be here after Sunday.
Where are you gonna go,
Bernie?
Where the fuck are you gonna go that's better than here?
I've got you covered in this town.
People know you work for me.
That's currency in your pocket.
That's fucking respect, when you walk the floor.
Where are you gonna get that, anyplace else?
Seven days, Shelly...
I'm out from under.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
What's your name, darling? Never mind.
This is who I am.
Yeah, that's right. I like to know who's shopping it around in my neighborhood, so what you do is be in my offiice first thing tomorrow morning, if you want to continue to work here at the Shangri-La and you and I will go over the rules together.
I also want you to bring me a clean bill of health. All right, my dear?
- Okay.
- All right, thank you.
How'd you like to "birdie" that hole, huh?
Say the word and she's yours anytime.
I'll keep a running tab for you.
Nah.
What? What? She's not your type?
Are you kidding me?
I've got to go.
Things are heating up on 14.
Let's do it in the room.
Kim, I think we got our laundry mixed up. I- I'll talk to you later.
Come on, let's go back to the room.
$50 bucks only gets you 20 minutes, man.
You're wasting your time.
Your soul is crippled.
I'm gonna change that.
Pray with me now.
Out, demon!
Let the crutches go!
Let the spirit into you!
Run with me!
Fuck me harder!
Harder! Oh!
Oh, yeah, baby.
I like that. Come on.
Come on, come on.
You're so big!
You do? Hallelujah!
The Lord has shown his face once again.
You gonna come all over me?
Oh, yeah, come all over me.
Let's do this, man.
Eight, the hard way.
- $900 for Mr. Pinkerton.
- Seven and Seven.
- Thanks, dollface.
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a fucking klutz.
- No, this stuff happens.
- Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. This guy- fucking hands all over my ass.
You might want to stick around.
I came to play.
Come again, sister, in the name of Pinkie.
Take this.
Hard eight, huh?
How you like that?
Suck on that.
That's right. Give me them dice.
Damn right.
One dollar, hard eight.
All right, everybody, get in. Here we go.
We'll bet $10.
- Out! Seven out.
- Shit! God!
What the fuck are you smiling at, bitch?
Whoa, whoa... easy.
Fellas?
- You think it's fucking funny?
- Take it easy, man.
Think it's funny this place is stealing my- fucking numb-nuts, let go of me.
I'll have you fired, you piece-of-shit bitch! Piece of fucking garbage!
~ But now I couldn't do without my supply ~
~ I need you for my own ~
~ Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day ~
~ As regularly as coffee or tea ~
~ You got me in your clutches and I can't break free ~
~ You're getting to be a habit with me... ~
Oh, Shelly.
I love you, Shelly.
He's the man, he's the best man. Salut.
- No, no, no.
- He hates that shit. He really does.
~ I used to think your love... ~
~ Was something that I... ~
~ Could take... ~
~ Or leave alone ~
~ But now I couldn't do without my supply... ~
- There he is.
- Hey.
Shelly, I was a fucking embarrassment out there, do you understand that?
You should never have talked me into going out there, Shelly.
I should have never let you.
Frank is rolling over in his grave.
I've got strep, man.
You understand that? I've got strep.
Listen to me, Pops, you were pure velvet out there. It was just silk.
And also, looky-looky what was hanging on the doorknob. Huh?
Forget about your tonsils.
When the muff confetti stops coming, that's when you know you got trouble.
Did you get a receipt?
- Excuse me?
- They're on sale in the lobby.
Charlayne's. This is "Victoria's Secret
Valentine Collection. "
What about that broad you got coming here later?
How much did she set you back? Nothing but the best for old Buddy, right?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Gimme, you don't deserve this.
You got all those ladies going home with a nice breeze between their legs,
'cause you do it the way they like it and you're saying I'm some
Buddy Stafford ego pimp, huh?
Hey, fuck you and- fuck you.
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me, man. Come on, come on!
Come on, don't be a prick.
Come on, man.
Come on, give it to me!
Come on, man.
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Do you ever watch any of those nature shows?
What?
You know, those nature shows.
You watch them?
Yeah, I've seen a few nature shows.
Yeah? Well, this one I've seen about a dozen times.
It's about... lions.
It's about... the cycle of life of the lions... and the leader of the pack.
- Pride. With lions it's a pride.
- Yeah.
This old king lion, right?
He's getting on in years and then sooner or later some young male comes along.
He challenges him... and he beats the fuck out of this old lion, right?
He just kicks the shit out of him.
And then... then they push him out of the pride... and he has to go in the jungle and scavenge and he dies alone.
The nature's got some sense of humor, huh?
No shit.
See, but Shelly, it's tragic because... he's past it, this old fucked lion... and he doesn't know it and it would be so much easier for him, if he could just... walk away.
And... he could avoid all the pain and the humiliation.
Hey... that would be like accepting that you were dead already, right?
I think I like it better nature's way, don't you?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Yeah, that's it.
Buy you a drink?
Yeah.
Shelly, you got a minute?
Shelly, this is Johnny Cappella.
- How you doing, Shelly?
- I know you from some place, right?
Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage.
Now Sony is talking about signing him to a three-album deal.
They're going to position him as the new Harry Connick.
And I should be interested in this... why?
Johnny's looking to headline.
I thought we might be interested.
- We?
- Did I come at a bad time?
Even if I was interested,
I got fresh ink with Buddy for the next five years.
I just renegotiated his contract.
Listen, you two need to be on the same page.
Larry, listen, if I don't hear from you by Thursday,
I'm taking the Stardust.
All right? I'm going there.
- I understand.
- Johnny Cappella, gone.
- We'll definitely be in touch, Johnny.
- Assholes.
Your progressed
Venus is in Gemini...
12.5 degrees... and it's in direct motion, which means...
...you're a slow starter when it comes to romance.
Sorry. You know what?
This is real unprofessional of me.
I shouldn't discuss your chart with you until I'm all done.
I can tell by the look on your face you think this is all a lot of B. S.
No, I just... I know what the outcome's gonna be.
There's not like one particular outcome.
A lot of things come into the picture, like...
- the planets, the moon phases-
- The outcome won't change with me.
- It'll be all bad.
- Oh, my God.
I have never met anyone who was so down on themselves.
Do you know what I do at the Shangri-La?
I asked around.
You're a cooler.
- You turn winners into losers.
- Do you know how I do that?
Listen, I know there's a lot of stuff that happens in casinos all the time.
I do it by being myself.
People get next to me, their luck turns.
It's always been that way.
Well, that sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.
There's a whole chapter of that in my book...
I only got six more days.
Well... really almost five.
I'm leaving town.
Only five more days?
Then we shouldn't waste any more time.
You want to go back to your place?
If this is-
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure I can afford...
- I can't afford to-
- Christ.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Wait, I didn't mean it.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I've gone and cooled the damn table.
Shut up, Bernie, shut up.
You haven't gone and cooled anything.
Not by a long shot.
Oh, God.
You know... once they're dead, they don't really grow back... in case that's what you were waiting for.
Oh, my God, you got a cat?
So... you got any music?
Hey... come here.
Sit.
Relax, Bernie, relax.
I assure you... at least one of us has done this before.
This is not the first time
I've ever-
Surprise me.
I like this.
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, let a gentleman see ~
~ How nice a girl you can be ~
~ I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with... ~
- They're snaps.
- I think I can get it.
Ow! Wait. Pull down some.
- Okay.
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.
~ It isn't fair... ~
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit.
~ A lady doesn't wander all over the room ~
~ And blow on some other guy's dice ~
~ So let's keep this party polite ~
~ Never get out of my sight ~
~ Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight... ~
Sorry.
~ Luck, let a gentleman see... ~
It's okay, Bernie.
I've had worse.
Oh, shit. Oh, God.
I know I'm gonna pay for this,
I just-
I don't know who you are or what- I don't...
This was good and I'm glad.
I don't care.
You've got a great cock.
You've-
Thank you.
So... want to go get some breakfast?
They've got these rules about casinos hiring felons, so he got me a gig in telemarketing.
We were scamming pensioners out of their retirement money.
I lasted two weeks.
- Here you go.
- By that time...
I was really getting in deep.
I owed one of the casinos over a hundred grand.
I put Shelly in a really awkward position.
I don't blame him for what he did.
What?
Your leg?
He did that to you?
- He shot you?
- No. Baseball bat.
- I got off easy.
- What do you mean you "got off easy"?
- I was out of control.
- He maimed you, for fuck's sake!
Listen to me.
I'm grateful for what he did.
I am absolutely serious.
Anytime I get an urge to play off the clock or so much as drop a quarter in a slot,
I just reach down and feel what's left of my cartilage.
- It's an excellent reminder.
- Jesus Christ.
I thought shit like that only happened in the movies.
Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a repayment plan.
Six years offi the books at the Shangri-La cooling tables
- and in five days...
- Three.
Oh! Oh, shit.
Oh, my God! Now?
Are you sure?
I'm going into labor.
Yeah, I'm going into labor.
Ow-ww!
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Stay very calm.
Okay, everybody, we're having a baby, we're having a baby.
You fucking cocksucker!
Who puts their bag in the middle of the fucking thing so a pregnant woman can trip over it?
- Mikey?
- Bernie.
I guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie.
Huh. Is this you?
Hey, what the fuck, it runs.
Here, sit down.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Anyway, we've got to get out of here.
- Hey, Mikey.
How's your mom doing?
I'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you she's getting by as long as she's high.
Her name is Charlene, in case you were wondering.
Hey, when's the last time you saw a doctor?
About six months ago, back in Jersey.
I wasn't about to go back there after they treated me like cattle.
Just 'cause I had no insurance, you know?
All those places are crawling with TB from them spics.
Listen, Mikey, if you want to... why don't you drop by the Bettor Life Motel, give us a chance to... to catch up?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe we'll do that.
Play catch up, for the kid's sake.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
$100 minimum table, sir.
No offense, pal, but there's 20 other tables here.
What do you want to come sit on my head for?
I'm just gonna play one hand.
I'm feeling lucky tonight.
I've got this voice in my head that says, "This is the table. "
- Insurance?
- No.
Oh, yes! Yes, yes!
Busto! Mel, what's happening to you?
Oh, yeah, welcome to Mel's house.
Hey, where are you going?
Stick around, pal.
You and me, we make a great team. Hey!
What was that?
I mean, what the fuck gives?
Is it McGann?
The guy's been with me 12 years.
He's as stand-up as my fucking dick.
Maybe he's having money problems.
I'm gonna pull him.
- No, no, no.
- Was he counting them?
- The mook with the streak?
- Is there a problem?
No, there's no problem.
Fella's on a streak, is all.
Let me guess, this is one of your "coolers"?
Why don't you announce it to the whole fucking joint while you're at it?
They told me that you were a sticker for the old ways, but coolers?
What is this guy, really?
A car mechanic? Some kind of shill?
'Cause he doesn't look too effective to me.
- He's the best. Take it from me.
- All right. Sure. Whatever.
There are ways- subtle ways- that we can keep the odds in our favor.
I'm talking about more forward-thinking methods.
I'm sure you've got a whole prospectus on the subject, right?
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah, I do.
For instance,
I can tell you right off the bat the wallpaper's not gonna cut it.
It's too uplifting.
I would suggest going with some more muted tones.
- Wallpaper?
- Yeah. And personally,
I think the cocktail waitresses could pop another button or two.
Myself, I wouldn't hire anything less than a "C" cup.
- You know what that is?
- No.
It's music to be sure.
It's pleasant, not intrusive, but recorded at a subsonic level is a mantra.
"Lose... lose... lose. "
We're just skimming the surface, Shelly.
We really need to talk.
Shelly?
You better come quick.
Contact his daughter and assist with the arrangements.
The Shangri-La will cover all expenses.
- What about the Paradise?
- She's going dark tonight.
Er, that won't be necessary.
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Cool me honey,
I'm on fire ~
~ To steal your love is my desire ~
~ Hug me, squeeze me, till I'm red ~
~ Till my eyes bug out my head ~
~ Coo me, woo me, turtledove ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Please tell me, why are you driving me crazy? ~
~ Why do I dig you like I do? ~
~ If I should steal a little kiss, and you can prove that it was wrong ~
~ Then I'll give it back to you ~
~ Honey, baby with a smile ~
~ I can walk you down the aisle ~
~ I won't even need a shove ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
Young lady, over here.
You want to give it a shot?
- Yeah. Come here.
- Five for $1.
- Thanks, Bernie.
- Good luck.
Are you ready?
Shit.
All right, double fisted.
- Damn!
- Too bad. Better luck next time.
- You want to try again?
- Yes.
- No, no, no. Thank you.
- Thanks.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- You're an easy mark, is all.
- I'm an easy mark?
- You know where that comes from?
No.
Years ago, Shelly and me were working
Coney Island for the summer and when I'd see a guy who had a full wallet and was willing to open it up,
I'd mark him with chalk.
I'd put it on my hand and go something like,
"Hey, man, good work. "
"Hey, buddy, how you doing?"
What the guy didn't realize was that when he walked down the way...
Shelly could spot him a mile off.
An easy mark.
Thanks a lot, Bernie.
I've got to sit.
Hi.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Did you notice, last night, that tattoo on my butt?
- Little Joe?
- Yeah.
Yeah, two 2's.
"Little Joe. "
I had a son.
His name was Joe.
I was his mother for one year.
- You don't have to tell me this.
- No, I want to, Bernie.
I gave my son up for adoption.
I just wanted my life back.
I was 17 going on 18 and I was so fucking selfish.
My family didn't want nothing to do with me after that, so I hitched a ride out here and thought
I'd make it as a showgirl.
10 years later...
I'd like to think that if it happened when I was older, with a guy that I cared about, that it would have been different, you know?
I think about my little Joe sometimes and I do know I did the right thing.
I'm convinced of that.
Natalie...
I think...
I think I could kick your ass at the dime toss.
~ You may not be an angel ~
~ 'Cause angels are so few ~
~ But until the day that one comes along... ~
- Would you do something for me?
- ~ I'll string along with you... ~
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
- Bernie!
- Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Ow! Ow! Jesus, ow.
Oh, yeah!
- Bernie, let's do it up the ass.
- Okay.
- Please, please?
- Okay, okay.
- No, my ass!
- Oh!
~ And until the day that one comes along... ~
Yes!
Shut the fuck up in there!
Did we wake you?
~ For every little fault that you have ~
~ See, I've got three or four ~
~ The human little faults you do have ~
~ Just make me love you more... ~
I have to pee.
I'm always peeing.
Hey.
How did you get in here?
I told the desk clerk
Bernie was my old man.
He let us wait inside.
Is that cool with you?
Bernie is out looking for a parking space.
I must have taken the last one.
- I didn't get your name.
- Natalie, Mikey.
Tell me something, Natalie, is he paying you?
Excuse me?
My old man, is he renting your ass?
Because, otherwise,
I just don't get it.
I mean, a loser like my pops in the company of some primo tits and ass?
It don't compute.
Is this enough to get me a little taste?
Family discount?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, baby.
- Mikey!
- Hey, Bernie.
I told you we was gonna stop by.
I thought you'd call ahead first.
We were at breakfast.
Hey. Hey.
You missed some.
Hey, that's nice.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You see, Bernie, the thing is... we're kind of strapped.
I mean, Charly here is expecting like yesterday.
And we don't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her and all.
So I was wondering if you would like to invest a little... maybe in your grandchild's future, his well-being.
It's almost three grand.
That's all I got.
That's- that's very generous.
Bless you, Bernie.
You want to feel it?
You know, I really-
I don't think...
Oh- I just felt a kick.
Come on, Bernie, give me your hand.
- You feel that?
- I don't know. I think so.
- Hey, we'll catch you later, Bernie.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Take care, Dad.
New Shangri-La Hotel and Casino.
We break ground on her in six months.
She's perfect.
Three floors of gaming,
Imax theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, roller coaster.
You name it, we've got it.
She pays for herself in three years.
After that, it's easy money.
Isn't she great, Shell?
In "Lost Horizon, " these people, their plane crashes in the Himalayas and they get rescued,
Taken to this utopia in the mountains, Shangri-La.
It's beautiful.
Totally isolated, untouched by the outside world.
No war, no greed, no bullshit.
Time has slowed down.
You never age.
It's paradise.
You see, that's what Shangri-La is.
It's paradise.
Yeah, we've seen the movie, Shelly.
What's your point?
My point is, you don't fuck with paradise.
Come on. Jesus, Shelly.
Hey, we're not trying to fuck with it.
- We're trying to make it better.
- How?
How you gonna make it better?
It's perfect just the way it is.
It's the last of its kind.
It's pure.
This- this is a fucking mockery.
How is it a mockery, Shelly?
It's right out of the movie.
Who's talking about a movie?
This is not a movie.
This is my fucking life.
Let me ask you one question, where are you gonna be when they decide to change it back?
When people want the real Vegas again, before all this "Epcot Center" bullshit?
Who's gonna give it to them?
You? I don't think so.
You know who? The same fucks who started this in the first place.
You know what's gonna happen?
It's gonna come around full circle and bite you on the fucking ass, take my words for it.
Shelly, you make some good points, huh?
Maybe we'll swing back the other way someday. Who the hell knows?
But for now, this moment,
I suggest we shoot the dice.
My friend, I think you should take some time just to think things through.
I know this is a lot to digest,
I know that.
Wait up a second.
What do you say?
I thought we were gonna go eat.
Why don't you try this table over here?
It's a little less crowded.
No, let's play here.
It's my lucky table. I always play here.
Come on, it's more private over here.
Shelly, I'm a big guy. I know how to take care of myself.
Go ahead. I know how to find you.
Go ahead. Go eat.
Here we go.
Come on.
Out! Seven, line away.
- What the fuck?
- Come on, "Pops. " What the hell?
I could have paid my mortgage with the money I just lost.
File a grievance, all right?
Shithead.
Come on, give me two hot ones.
Come on, new shooter.
Give me 100 on right, 100 big yellow...
All right, shooter. Come on.
Hey, hurry up, Gramps! Come on, your soup's getting cold, huh?
- Four, hard four.
- Give me $25 yellow.
Hey, "Uncle Palsy"... come on, throw them before you fucking keel over and die, old man.
Be there!
Seven, out. Line away.
Thanks for the bets, folks.
Don't take it so hard, Pops.
Everybody craps out.
Now go fucking change your Depends.
That's good.
Who's laughing now?
Crack wise now, you fucking "Ken doll," no-dick, suburbanite, fucking scum.
Huh? Now how's that for a game?
- Nicky, Nicky. Hey, it's all right.
- Get the fuck out of here!
Disrespectful cocksucker!
How do you like the game so far?
Nicky, Nicky, take it easy.
Come on. Come on, come on!
That ain't right!
The guy fucked up my whole game.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
You're right. Forget about him, he's just a piece of shit.
- Let me see your hand.
- My hand is all right.
I got news for you. I thought this joint had more fucking class, okay?
It used to be we didn't let a bum like that in this fucking place.
Come on.
This town... this town, you know, all- all I want to do... is go some place where I can tell night from day, where they've got clocks on the walls.
I can't breathe here anymore.
Four days and I'm gone. I don't even know if I can hold out that long.
So where does that leave us, Bernie?
A week ago,
I couldn't even remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me.
I still pinch myself.
I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up-
Come with me.
Natalie, I want you to come with me.
- God, Bernie.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to spring it on you.
I- I've been working on this compatibility chart, okay?
And it looks good, really it does.
- So, what's the problem?
- The problem is it's only good here.
But that's just for now, for the immediate future.
You know, when the planets realign... maybe next year...
A year!? Natalie,
I can't wait another year.
I can't-
I can't go, Bernie.
- Hi, Doris.
- Hey.
Oh, shit.
Just a second.
Chang, party of 15, your table is ready.
Chang, party of 15.
- All right.
- Come on, papa-to-be!
Come on, y'all.
I want to send my baby to college.
Six and a three, five and a four. Let's go.
This is for our baby's future.
Don't "blow " it.
This is for you.
This one's on the line for the guys with bowties,
- with shoes.
- Oh, yeah.
Dealer's got shoes.
The point's nine.
Let's get that.
A six and a three, a five and a four,
Let's do it. Can we get it?
Can we get it? Come on.
We got a shooter.
Hi, Bernie.
Fucking rock star!
Give me them dice back.
Okay, pay me, moron, pay me. Come on!
- Give him $9,000.
We're on a streak here.
Move it, move it, move it.
God bless you all.
Point is nine. Point is nine.
Let me get all the hard ways for "Team Moron" here, okay? All right.
- This is great!
- For you guys, all right?
- Here we go.
- Come on.
- Six and three. Five and four.
- This is for the baby.
Come on.
Oh, oh, careful!
Come on, guys, with the cigarettes.
We've got a pregnant woman here.
Put them out. I'm winning you guys money. Come on!
Come on.
All right.
What gives?
He's up 18,000 since I stepped up to the table.
Sorry, Shelly. I'm kind of hit-or-miss these days.
- $9,000, $9,000. Oh, baby.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I can feel a kick.
Fucking amateurs.
Let's get it. Let's get it!
Nope. That's it. Line away.
Guys, I thank you.
My pregnant wife thanks you.
My unborn child thanks you very much, okay?
Color me up, will you?
And keep one of these little blue ones for yourself.
Thank you very much.
That's quite a run you had there, champ.
Oh, yeah, lucky!
- Lucky night, I guess, huh?
- It's so exciting to watch, too.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle this in my office.
I don't like to lay out that kind of cash on the floor.
We'll go up there, relax a bit, have a drink, name your poison, a little apple juice for the mother-to-be here.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
- Should I take this stuff with me?
- No.
Yeah...
Okay, that is not how I propose we handle this.
We turn this matter over to the authorities.
They'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined-
Then, I suppose I should stick a fucking lollipop in their mouths for the ride home, huh?
Let me tell you something, "Harvard," come upstairs with me in my office, watch and learn how to protect your investments the old-school way.
Fuck.
Ow, ow, ow... ow!
All right. Here we go everybody. Let's go.
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, wait a second.
Get offi me! No!
Shelly, wait. Wait!
Don't, don't. Don't do this.
Stay out of this, Bernie.
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's got everything to do with me.
He's my son.
Him? This little prick is your son?
- Pop, you've got to help me out here.
- Shut up!
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait. Are you in on this?
- Huh?
- What!?
I asked you a fucking question.
You come clean with me now.
No! For God's sake, what's the matter with you?
I didn't know nothing about this!
Shithead here is your son?
Let me ask you a question.
How much you think their two lives are worth?
Myself, I don't think they're worth piss, but hey, he ain't my kid.
This shithead was up
150 G's down there.
That's 150 grand that somebody's got to account for.
What do you say you cover them both, 75 apiece, huh?
Come on, Shelly.
They didn't get away with the money.
- You haven't lost nothing.
- Go to work.
- Pop! Pop!
- No, wait! Come on!
- Jesus!
- Wait.
All right, all right.
God damn it. All right.
All right, all right.
I'm good for it. $150 G's.
I'm good for it.
- It's all right, honey.
- Oh, my God, the contractions.
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Come on, Shelly.
Oh, for God's sake, Shelly.
Will you help her out?
That's my grandkid.
Oh, my God, that's right.
That's Bernie's grandchild in there.
You all right, sweetheart?
You need to go to the hospital, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- I'll bet you do.
- Jesus!
- Charlene!
Hey, everybody look,
It's a boy!
Oh, can you believe this?
Bernie, you have a grandson!
Bernie's got a little grandson!
Isn't he cute? Isn't he cute?
I think he looks like you, Bernie.
What do you think?
A nice healthy grandson.
Want to hold your grandson, Bernie? Huh?
Break out the champagne, everybody.
Bernie's a grandfather.
You still want to make good on this?
If you want to change your mind,
I don't blame you.
I'll make it up to you, Pop.
I swear.
I'm good for it.
- All right, up on the table, right now!
- Whoa, whoa whoa-
Wait a second.
Shelly, we had a deal!
$150 G's buys their lives.
This is a little slap on the wrist to remember me by.
- Wait, wait.
- No, no!
Jesus, Shelly, no!
Come on.
Fuck!
I brought this on myself.
I planted the seeds.
When Angela had run off with Mikey, I didn't-
I never made-
I never made an effort to get back in his life.
I figured... the kid don't need a fucking loser for a father.
And now it's come full circle.
I give him the money,
I open the door to all this.
This- I got this coming to me.
This is- this is payback.
Are you done beating yourself up, Bernie?
~ My funny Valentine ~
~ Sweet comic Valentine ~
~ You... ~
~ Make me smile with my heart ~
~ Your looks are laughable ~
~ Unphotographable ~
~ Yet... ~
~ You're my favorite work of art... ~
Bernie... are you awake?
I think that...
I love you.
No.
I don't think.
I'm pretty sure of it.
You blindsided me,
Bernie Lootz.
I never saw it coming.
You shouldn't do that to a girl.
There's so many things you don't know, that you should know.
Oh, fuck,
I don't want to ruin this.
It- it don't matter.
It don't matter what you come clean about, it's not gonna change the way I feel about you.
It's not.
Natalie, I...
- I'd say it, but...
- Say it, just say it.
No, with my rotten luck-
Don't- fuck rotten luck, Bernie.
That's over.
I love you, Natalie.
I really, really love you.
Trixie?
You came back?
~ What a day this has been ~
~ What a rare mood I'm in ~
~ Why, it's almost like being in love ~
~ There's a smile on my face ~
~ For the whole human race ~
~ I would swear
I am falling in love... ~
Tell Bernie to go to table six.
~ All the music of life seems to be ~
~ Like a bell that is ringing for me ~
~ And from the way that I feel ~
~ When the bells start to peal ~
~ I would swear
I am falling ~
~ I can swear that I'm falling ~
~ Well, it's almost like being in love... ~
Lovett, party of six, your table is ready.
Duty calls.
Bye.
Yes!
~ All the music of life seems to be ~
~ Like a bell that is ringing for me ~
~ And from the way that I feel ~
~ When the bells start to peal ~
~ I would swear
I am falling ~
~ I can swear that I'm falling ~

~ Well, it's almost like being in love. ~
Hey, Shelly, check it out.
The new "Mega Million. "
I call her "Marnie. "
You know,
'cause she's one frigid broad.
You want to tell me what's going on out there?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
We're down almost a mil out there.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
I guess I'm having an off day.
No, no, no.
You don't have off days, Lootz.
You're shitty luck incarnate.
What's wrong?
You coming down with something?
You have this look about you.
No, no, I'm fine. As a matter of fact,
I've never been better.
- Give it a shot.
- What's that supposed to mean?
She loves me, Shelly.
She told me last night. Natalie.
Should I get her flowers or candy?
What is happening to you?
I think flowers.
Sweet Jesus!
You popped her cherries!
Shut the fuck up!
- I'll stay.
- Scotch on the rocks.
- Here you go, babe.
- Thanks.
Hi, Tone.
Hi, Shell.
Do you believe those fucking kids yesterday?
Don't worry about them, because you and I have other problems now.
You have really fucked things up big time, let me tell you.
I hired you to be his "cooze" companion, not the true love of his fucking life.
But no, you have to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck.
"I love you, Bernie. "
What the hell were you thinking?
Those four words of endearment have cost this casino one million and counting today.
I don't understand what that means.
Lady Luck.
You've heard of "Lady Luck," haven't you?
- Yeah.
- That's what's going on out there.
Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick.
He should have them throwing ice cubes right now, but instead I've got a meltdown on my hands.
So here's the situation. You are out of his life, before he even gets home.
Don't even tell him to his face.
Leave him a note.
I'm gonna make some calls and you're gonna be situated at another joint.
I don't think
I can do that, Shell.
Excuse me?
I said...
I don't think I can do that, Shell.
It wasn't an act.
I meant it.
- You love him?
- Yeah.
I love the schmuck.
What the fuck is there to love?
He's a loser.
Always has been, always will be.
I thought you were a smart cookie when I picked you out.
You do not want to fuck with me.
Because if you do, your next john is going to be a fucking rattlesnake in the fucking desert.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
Get out of here.
Hey, Natalie.
It doesn't matter.
Look.
A six-card 21?
Please!
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Yeah, let me raid a little love. ~
Thank you, thank you.
You guys are too kind.
This next song I'd like to do for you is dedicated to a friend over there.
Brianna, this one's for you.
I want you to tell me the truth, Shelly.
Did you say something to Natalie?
Did you muscle her?
Jesus, Bernie. Is that what you think?
That I would fuck with your happiness?
That hurts me.
I don't know.
This guy is all flash.
No soul.
I miss Buddy.
It's just not the same around here.
Buddy was tired.
I gave him the easy way out.
Things could have been so much worse.
"Gave him the easy way out"?
What are you talking about? He-
Buddy never would have taken the buyout.
He would have stuck to his guns right to the end.
They would have ended up hurting him.
I could not allow that to happen.
Jesus. You- you sit here and you justify it like you're Dr. Kevorkian or something?
Hey, listen to me.
I loved that son of a bitch, but his time was up.
What was I supposed to do, leave him to those corporate fucking scumbags?
What I did was a humanitarian thing, that I have no doubt about.
And afterwards I held him in my arms and I cried like a fucking baby.
What?
What is this fucking look you're giving me now? What is that, huh?
There are the sins of the flesh.
There are the sins of the gambling halls... be it dice or in some cases,
"the devil's thumbpapers. "
Let's take off tonight.
I can't do that.
I have an obligation to Shelly. He-
Fuck Shelly.
He doesn't give a shit about you, Bernie.
Let's just climb in your car and drive the hell out of here tonight.
I can't do that, Natalie.
He'd come after me, because you're with me.
I can't have that on me.
Okay.
Winner!
Shelly! Shelly!
You have no fucking right!
Shelly, you got no fucking right!
Shelly, I tried.
I couldn't do it.
Shelly- Shelly-
I can't leave, Shell.
Shell, I love him.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
You heartless fuck.
I thought-
Bastard!
I thought he was your friend.
Who do you think you are?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You're nobody!
I could make you disappear like that and not one fucking person would miss you.
- Not one fucking person!
- Bernie would!
He loves me.
He loves me... and that kills you, doesn't it, Shell?
That kills you!
That kills you, doesn't it?
He was your only friend and you crippled him.
You crippled him and he still stood by you, but no more, Shell.
The only friends you've got now are the fucking guys on your payroll.
You don't own me anymore, Shelly, and you don't own Bernie.
We're leaving here tonight.
I am taking him and there is not a fucking thing that you can do about it!
- And you will be all alone!
- Is that right?
I love him.
Natalie?
Don't turn the light on.
I got a headache.
Did you take something?
I've got aspirin, I've got-
Yeah, I already took something.
What-?
Oh, shit.
Natalie, what- what happened to the mirror?
Natalie?
No, Bernie, don't.
Oh, shit- Bernie!
Jesus Christ.
Natalie, who did this to you?
We've got to call the police.
- I thought, "Easy money. "
- What are you talking about?
Shelly.
He paid me to get close to you, to keep you around.
Shelly...?
Yeah. Shelly.
You were right that first night.
I was for sale.
Bought and paid for.
You were the "easy mark,"
Bernie.
At first I thought that you were just another way to make a quick buck, you know?
And then I started to take a closer look.
Andforthefirsttime, you were somebody who wasn't trying to hustle me, somebody who wasn't trying to pretend he was someone he wasn't.
Just a decent guy, trying to get back on track.
And it didn't hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal.
It sure puts the gutter in perspective.
Shelly paid you?
Shelly wants me gone.
He says I bring you luck.
"Lady Luck. "
I stayed to tell you to your face... and I knew you wouldn't want me no more and I could just go.
We've got to get you to the hospital.
We'll talk about this later.
Tell me again, Bernie.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
This is our time. This is you and me and we're going for it.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
You look in the mirror, you don't like what you see, don't believe it.
Look in my eyes.
I am the only mirror you're ever gonna need.
You look into my eyes,
Natalie.
Bernie, Bernie, wait, wait.
Your chart that first night-
I wasn't being straight with you.
It is the worst chart I've ever seen.
There's nothing in the cards for you, I'm telling you.
No, don't you see?
That was before.
That was before you opened up your heart to me.
Everything's different now.
I got Lady Luck on my side.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Wait.
Here. Look,
I got $3,000 he paid me.
Maybe Shelly will take it as a down payment, and we can pay in installments, when we get settled, okay?
- I don't think $3,000-
- Come on, take it, Bernie!
...street vendors in your face. I walk up there, I'd want to shoot myself.
I suppose you'd like that freak show, huh, Harvard?
Yeah, I do.
It brings people downtown into the casino. That is good for business.
- Oof!
- Hey!
You lay another finger on her,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Are you listening to me?
I will fucking kill you.
Why, Shelly?
How could you do that to her?
Because I never let go of a good thing, Bernie, and you are a very, very good thing.
The best cooler there ever was and I need him back.
He ain't never coming back.
That is a dead man talking.
Shelly...
I'm done with this joint,
Natalie and me.
We are out of here.
I'll get a job out in the world.
I'll send you half my paycheck every month.
- I'll make good on my commitment.
- Bernie, if you bail on me, they're gonna throw your fucking ass off the roof of this building snatch the broad, and throw her right the fuck on top of you.
I don't think so,
'cause if you whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't the biggest loser in the world no more.
That honor is gonna rest upon you, Shelly.
- And maybe you had it all along.
- I'm the loser?
What do you got, other than this joint?
- What more do I need?
- You got nothing.
This place- your legacy, it's a mirage.
You turn your back, it don't even exist.
There's no night, there's no day, it's just one big fucking blur and it don't count for nothing.
You believe this fucking guy?
I feel sorry for you,
Shelly.
You're the worst kind of gambler there is, too scared to throw his chips on the table.
Too scared to extend any real kind of friendship.
Always scared he's gonna end up out in the desert.
Well, sweet fucking dreams, pal.
I'm out.
If that's where it ends, that's where it ends.
Jesus Christ, that's such a fucking touching speech, Bernie.
All that Jimmy Stewart bullshit,
I got such a lump in my throat,
I can't tell you.
But it doesn't change a thing.
If you don't make good on my 150 G's,
I'm gonna close the books on you.
You and the broad.
You leave me no choice.
Change only.
Change.
Yo, 11, pay the line.
Winner, seven.
Six easy. Easy way six.
Winner. Front line.
Hey, Shelly, take a look at number four.
Winner.
Okay, folks, we're coming out now.
Hold bets, curb checks,
C&E is 11.
Come on, man, make me some money.
Winner, seven.
What the fuck is going on here?
Where have you been?
- Not now.
- Bullshit. Shut him down right now.
- Shut him down or I will.
- Not here.
Come take a walk with me.
What is your interest in this, Shelly?
Because you know what I see?
I see your guy taking us to the fucking cleaners, and I'll tell you one thing.
He's not leaving here with a fucking dime.
Now listen to me, you little Harvard turd.
Lootz is all right, so he's walking out of here with everything he's got coming to him.
If you so much as touch one fucking hair on his fucking head,
I'm gonna fucking wallpaper this fucking bathroom with your fucking ass, do you understand me?
Muted tones, isn't that what you said?
Huh? I can't hear you.
Wait, wait a minute.
There it is.
Blended in, at a subsonic level, like some kind of mantra,
"Pain, pain, pain. "
Please...
Come on, come on.
Big roll. Big roll, buddy.
Here we go, here we go.
He must be up over 100 grand!
Gray craps, line away.
Here we go.
Okay.
Hit it again. Come on.
Come on now. Come on.
12 craps. Line away. 12 craps.
What the fuck? Not all of it!
On the field?
Is he fucking crazy?
Don't do it.
Thank you, God. Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.
It's all right, right?
You guys worked it out and he took the money? It's okay, right?
You want me to get that, Shelly?
Bernie?
Can you tell me what happened?
Yeah. Yeah.
Why- why are we stopping,
Bernie?
I think- I think-
Oh, God damn.
What the fuck happened in there?
What? What?
- What!
- Look. Look.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Natalie, I won. I won.
- Oh, my God!
- How much!? How much!?
- A lot.
Bahamas, here we come.
Step out of the car, please.
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Step out of the car, both of you.
Officer, my driving, it-
I'm sorry if we were driving a little fast, we're a bit excited.
We won a shitload of money at the Shangri-La.
You didn't win nothing.
Now both of you, turn around.
Get down on your knees.
Now.
Jesus Christ, Bern,
Jesus Christ.
The kid just wants you should know, Shelly, he's just protecting our investment...
...the old-school way.
I'll see you around, my friend.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Who were we kidding?
It's a drunk driver.
This is just- this is just freaky luck.
It was freaky accident.
Gentlemen, I want to thank you for your vote of confidence.
As the new director of casino operations,
I want to make a personal guarantee to each and every one of you that your investment in the Golden
Shangri-La will be well looked after.
The future looks very bright, gentlemen.
Very, very bright.
First time giving blood?
Yes.
They pay cash here.
And there's no limit to how many times you give.
They even buy it in the jar.
Jared Nomak, we're ready for you.
In the past 1 2 months, have you gotten a tattoo, or undergone any ear, skin, or body piercings?
No.
Where did you get that scar on your chin?
Childhood accident.
You say you don't have any immediate next of kin,
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No one.
- No family?
- I told you, no.
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?
It depends.
We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
What?
How unusual?
Let me explain.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one we haven't encountered before.
What? What are you talking about?
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.
What is this?
This is a good news-bad news scenario, Jared.
Good news for us... bad news...
...for you.
Forget what you think you know-- vampires exist.
My name is Blade.
I was born half human, half vampire.
They call me
''The Daywalker.''
I have all their strengths, none of their weaknesses.
Except for the thirst.
20 years ago I met a man that changed that.
Whistler.
He taught me how to hold the thirst at bay.
Taught me the rules.
Gave me the weapons to hunt with.
Silver, garlic, sunlight.
Two years ago he was attacked.
They took him, and turned him into the thing I hate most.
I should have finished him off.
Now I'm hunting him.
I will find him.
And nothing will stand in my way.
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!
Where is he?
Hey!
No, no.
Take me to him, and I'll consider you a loose end.
Catch you later.
Old man... look at what they've done to you.
Let's go home.
Lock up your daughters, boys and girls, the dark knight returns.
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.
Cut the lights.
You found him.
You didn't kill him.
Give me a hand.
I got a bad feeling about this, B.
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.
Why don't you just put him out of his misery right now?
They had him on stasis in a halfway house.
I' m giving hi m an accelerated retr-viral det x.
Like a heroin addict.
Make him go cold turkey in one night.
Shit ain't going to work, man.
I say y u kill the m therfucker right nw.
Get out.
If there's anything left of you in there, Whistler, listen up.
In the morning those blinds are going to open whether you're cured... or not.
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--
Listen to me, Blade.
You're going to have to finish me off.
No.
Give me that damn gun.
Now walk away.
Stubborn son of a bitch.
How do you feel?
Like hammered shit.
How'd you find me?
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?
- Months?
- Too long.
Years.
They tortured me almost to death.
And then let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again.
Sorry sons of bitches could have at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it.
Where's my arc welder?
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
I'm Josh. You can call me ''Scud.''
Everybody does.
Tell me something, Skid--
No, man, it's ''Scud,'' like ''Stud.''
Whatever.
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?
Just a little aftermarket modification.
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.
You gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
The whole package will crank that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.
You'll burn the thing out before your next oil change.
Where did you dig up this shitbird, anyway?
What the fuck is your problem, Poppy?
My problem is I've been sucking blood clots for two years.
I get out to find some jerkoff fucking with my life's work.
We jeopardized our whole operation to save your ass!
- Our operation?
- Yeah.
Our operation? I built this operation, you ass-wipe!
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.
Human?
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.
Fried. They're using magnesium flares.
They've got your security system scoped out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cool outfit.
Guard lights!
We represent the ruling body of the Vampire Nation.
They are offering you a truce.
They want to meet with you.
Scud.
Take off your mask.
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.
You have been our most feared enemy.
But now there's something else loose on the streets.
Something worse than you.
What's so funny?
They tell stories about Blade as the Bogeyman.
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.
He agreed to come along so easily.
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?
Semtex.
Enough explosives to level a city block.
You still disappointed?
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.
You sure about this?
Well, if I'm not...
The true power of the Vampire Nation lies here.
Father?
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.
It has been said,
''Be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success.''
In that regard,
I should thank you.
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.
European Health Consortium.
As you may know,
Vampirism is... a horrible virus, carried in the saliva of predators.
In 7 2 hours, it spreads through the human bloodstream, creating new parasitic organs.
Like cancer.
Cancer with a purpose.
Unfortunately, viruses evolve, too.
We've encountered a new one.
We dubbed it the Reaper Strain.
And like any good pathogen, it appears to have found a carrier.
There...
Jared Nomak.
Born a vampire, but an anomaly like you.
Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.
Their vampire victims don't die... they turn.
They become carriers.
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 7 2 hours.
By our estimates, there are already a dozen Reapers.
There'll be hundreds before the week is out.
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.
Wait. Let me get this right.
You want me to hunt them... for you?
When they are finished with us, who do you think they'll turn on next?
Your precious humans.
Not one of them will be left.
We spent two years training a small tactical unit--
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.
Two years?
We've been training to hunt you.
So, B-man, what do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
So, we ain't gonna do this, right?
We'll play along for now.
They'll take us in deeper than we've ever been.
Get a chance to see how their world really ticks.
I had enough of their world.
They're just shitting bricks because they're no longer top of the food chain.
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.
I know he's your friend and all, but I think you should watch him.
Nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night.
Looking to get hooked up?
Maybe.
What do you have?
No problem.
Horse, Hawaiian Ice, whatever you need.
Whatever I need.
I like that.
What if I need you?
So, so sweet.
They are ready whenever you are, Daywalker.
Blade, meet The Bloodpack.
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,
Priest,
Snowman,
Chupa, and Reinhardt.
Hey, um... me and the gang were wondering...
What was that?
Can you blush?
Here we go.
Oh, I get it.
I see now.
You've been training for two years to take me out.
And now, here I am.
Ooh, so exciting, isn't it?
Okay, here's your chance.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?
Maybe you need a little bit of incentive.
Okay, I can help with that.
What's the matter?
Missed that?
It's okay,
I can do it again.
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!
Now you've got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head.
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it.
I'll have the detonator with me.
And you-- if you so much as look at me wrong--
From now on we work as a unit.
You'll be taking orders from me.
Any questions?
Good.
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.
We'll target all the night places where vampires congregate.
Blood banks, safe houses.
The bigger the better.
So... what's first?
The House of Pain.
Where's the entrance?
I don't see any signs.
No vampire glyphs.
No, because of you, we've had to rethink our habits, tighten our security.
Have a closer look.
Nice. and 9mm caliber.
All with foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate, and garlic extract.
This hyper-velocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6,000 feet per second.
Since you suckers don't like sunlight, we've modified the gun's entry light with a UV filter.
Pop it open-- instant UV light.
Filter's on, no problem.
Yo, B, check this out.
It's got an pneumatic syringe delivery system.
The vials are filled with an anti-coagulant called EDTA.
One punch with this, you'll blow your target up like a balloon.
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.
Nice.
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.
Why don't you post up on the roof over there?
Cover our backs.
So the Bloodpack's calling the shots now, huh?
Great.
Better curb that dog of yours or we'll do it for you.
Keep pushing, asshole.
? I ya, I against I ?
? Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind ?
? Two of a kind, but one won't survive ?
? My images reflect in the enemy's eye ?
? And his images reflect in mine the same time ?
? I ya, I ya, I against I ?
? Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind ?
? Two of a kind, but one won't survive ?
? Survive, survive, survive. ?
We're in.
You're about to enter our world.
You will see things-- feeding.
Just remember why you're here.
I haven't forgotten.
What exactly are we looking for in here?
Anything that looks suspicious.
You got to be kidding me.
Scud, do you read me?
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.
The whole place is a safe house.
The windows are painted black, one access door.
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.
Hey, W, you got me?
W?
Tell me something, how's the weather up there?
Walkin' on sunshine, toad boy.
Look at them.
Half of these bastards, they're not even pure bloods.
I tell you what, why don't we just fucking kill everyone?
Just to make sure.
God, it would be so easy.
He's got you.
Daywalker.
Mother's milk.
I say we got about half an hour till sunrise, Cinderella.
Hurry up.
I spotted one, but lost it.
Be on the lookout.
Fuck.
Whistler, they're on the roof.
I got them on the roof of my bus.
Shhh.
Nomak.
Daywalker.
What am I to you?
Is the enemy of my enemy my friend... or my enemy?
We're under attack!
There's three of them.
Probably more.
Daylight.
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?
Say, ''cheese.''
Come on.
How about some daylight, motherfucker?
Fuck!
Listen to me. If you're under attack, use your UV lights.
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.
Priest?
We're not dying here.
- Come on.
- Priest is down.
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.
You want me so bad, Blade?
Here I am.
Why kill me?
You and I, we have the same enemy.
We want the same thing.
We need the same thing,
Blade.
What happened?
Why didn't you tell me these things
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.
If you did, would you have told me?
I think you know the truth when you hear it.
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?
How long since he's been bitten?
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.
He's already starting to change.
Will someone just shut him the fuck up?
Hold on!
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!
Put him out of his fucking misery!
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!
Move.
Back off!
If that was your Bloodpack Sunday punch,
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?
Ran into a little Reaper action myself.
Oh, yeah?
How little?
We lost a man.
Priest.
You want me to carve his name on your chest?
Let me show you.
Saw him moving in the alley and followed it down.
Found it just like this.
I think they came through here.
It was trying to crawl back in the culvert.
Caught his arm.
Been gnawing at it like a coyote.
Little Boy Blue.
It's already dying.
I need to examine it as quickly as possible.
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
- Any casualties?
- One so far.
It was not...
Nyssa, I trust?
No.
This a dangerous game you're playing, Damaskinos.
Blade is too volatile.
You're not going to be able to keep manipulating him.
You worry too much.
I've been informed by our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
You've already lost one of your own.
How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Everyone.
Even your own daughter?
Yes. Even her.
Recognize this?
The blood bank.
He's one of the guards.
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?
Time.
His metabolism is burning too fast.
They need fresh blood every couple of hours, or they'll start feeding on themselves.
Nomak's different.
He's the carrier.
It all started with him.
It'll end with him.
Open the mouth, Scud.
Open the mouth.
B, come on.
Sissy.
Only the tongue carries the virus.
It is injected through these barbs.
It has bifurcated masseter muscles.
Overdeveloped, allowing for a much stronger bite.
The jaw structure remains the same.
But there's no mandible bone.
Squeeze that tooth.
Neurotoxin.
Probably paralyzes their victim while they feed.
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.
We got to go with the sunlight, right?
That's deadly to us, too.
So let's see what else we can find.
These things are as different from us as we are from you.
Look at that.
The heart is encased in bone.
Only the side is vulnerable.
Good luck getting a stake through that.
Pull a leg off a spider, it keeps moving on its own, essentially trying to walk without a body attached to it.
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?
What the fuck is that?
Brain's dead.
Body's still trying to feed.
We got six hours before sunrise.
Be ready by then.
Hey...
What happens at sunrise?
Blade,
I'm talking to you.
What happens at sunrise?
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?
You got be joking.
You better get you some sunscreen, buttercup.
Listen, shitkicker.
You're about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Sunlight's the only edge we've got.
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.
Let's be real about one thing--
I don't expect everybody to make it back tomorrow.
Remember to protect yourselves... at all times.
What are you looking for?
Phosphor rods.
If I can suss out the light source maybe I can make some sort of
UV flash-bang grenade or something.
It's been tried already.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it then.
- Blade.
- Hmm?
- The way you talk to them-- us.
- What is it?
We are together in this, remember?
Why do you hate us so much?
It's fate.
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.
You know the thirst better than any of us, shooting that serum of yours.
The only difference between us, is that I made peace with what I am a long time ago.
How long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on 20 years.
He doesn't talk about the old days that much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.
You want to hear something funny?
Blade kind of looks at you like a father figure.
Tell me something.
How'd you two hook up?
I was backpacking.
I met these two chicks, decided to take them back to my tent for a little
''Three's Company'' action.
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy start tearing chunks out of my stomach.
Blade shows up, saves my ass.
Everything else just sort of fell into place.
- Let's try it.
- All right.
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.
All right.
Papa's got a brand new bag.
Let me ask one question.
How are we going to find these Reapers?
We won't have to.
They'll come to us.
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.
Harvested from the Reapers' adrenal glands.
They're going to key to it.
They want us to spray on some suckpuppy's nut juice?
First use your firearms to drive them back.
- Then toss your UV grenades.
- Right on.
This is what we got for the grand finale.
I hot-wired a couple of these babies into a nitro-vacuum.
Just be real careful where you pop your load.
And you, you're not coming?
No. I'm a lover, not a fighter.
UV's have a 1 0-second delay.
Nyssa... just remember to take cover.
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.
You and Miss Muffet getting a little cozy?
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
Looks to me like you're getting confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Those are real hollow words coming from a man wh just spent tw years running with the ene my.
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?
You know, Whistler, there's an old saying--
''Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.''
You might want to remember that.
Blade, we should split into three units.
We're trying to attract them, not scare them off.
Yeah, well, some of us can't see in the dark, you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?
Bifocals, grandpa.
And try to keep up.
Let's do this.
- Hey, hillbilly.
- What the fuck you doing?
Ain't nobody here but you... and us, buttercup.
We lose a partner, and Blade loses one!
I'll leave you two lovebirds some time to yourselves.
Ah!
I spotted a group in the east tunnel.
I'm prepping the bomb pack.
Nyssa.
Get out!
Right now!
No!
No!
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.
Move! nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one.
Piece of junk.
What the hell is this?
You trying to stink me to death, old man?
Wait.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We got to move.
We got a lot of company.
All units, regroup.
Regroup!
Eat shit, you ugly motherfuckers!
There's nobody left!
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Down that tunnel.
Give me the rest of the pheromones.
Go down that tunnel!
Go, go, go, go!
You obviously... do not know... whom you are fucking with!
By the way, Blade.
Did I happen to mention the bomb lever is stuck?
Suck this!
Let's go!
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!
Come on, motherfucker!
Whistler.
Wait.
You will survive this only to tell Blade... about this ring.
About the truth.
The truth, old man.
Damaskinos...
Nyssa.
You've done a great job.
Not that great--
I'd say.
What is it, my daughter?
They took them.
All our weapons.
Even your sword.
Somebody's been keeping tabs on us from inside.
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber deep in their lair.
They smashed up everything-- the workshop, all of it.
They've been lying to us from day one.
The reaper strain didn't evolve... it was designed.
What?
Designed.
Nomak told me.
I saw him back in the sewer.
- He let me live.
- Did he?
How generous of him.
I brought you here to see the fruits of our labor.
For years I've struggled to rid our kind of any hereditary weaknesses.
And so, recombining DNA... was simply the next logical step.
Nomak was the first.
A failure.
But in time, there will be a new pure race, begotten from my own flesh, immune to silver, soon even sunlight.
I got a question for you, you lying son of a bitch.
You want to explain how Nomak got ahold of this ring?
I would have thought that was obvious at this point.
I gave it to him, of course.
A gift from father to son.
I thought he'd never leave.
The wolf has lain with the sheep long enough.
Reinhardt, you can kiss your ass goodbye.
I'm sorry, man.
B, you're wasting your time, man.
The bomb's a dud.
It was never supposed to explode.
It was just supposed to make you feel in control.
You thought you had me on a short leash, didn't you, jefe?
Much better.
See this?
I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.
They needed my help to bring you here to control Nomak.
The old fuck, he was always just bait.
I mean, look at him.
He's y ur  nly real weakness, man.
You may be fast, you may be strong, and all that other bullshit, but in the end, B... you're just too human!
Well, you little shit.
You think they scoped out my security system?
I let them in, asshole!
I practically handed them the keys.
You heard cue ball, right?
Pretty soon they're all going to be daywalkers.
When that happens,
I'd rather be a pet than cattle.
You got me, B?
- What do you think about that?
- Two things-- one...
I've been onto you since they turned you.
And two... it's not a dud.
Ah, great.
I was just starting to like him.
Take him down!
We're going to harvest your blood, every drop of it.
Then bone marrow, organs, everything.
We'll find the missing key to creating daywalkers.
Now this might hurt a bit.
Nice.
I wonder... how many vampires he's killed with this thing.
Not nearly enough, Fritz.
Keep talking, honky-tonk.
Just makes my sending you to the next world
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.
Do your worst, chickenshit.
We'll settle up after.
What else should I find out?
I trusted you-- with my men; with my will; with my life.
You sent us out there.
You sent me to die.
Our enemy saved my life twice, and you have used us-- your own children.
Make no mistake, Nyssa, those blood ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of our race.
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?
The spider, or the fly?
Nomak.
What about him?
He wants revenge... on the people... who created him.
You may be right.
But fortunately for us, he doesn't know this location.
Now... he does.
What the fuck?
Come on, kid.
Don't you even think about dying on me.
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.
Come on-- Blade.
Blood...
Yeah.
Blood.
Father!
He'll never enter here.
Father!
Father!
Go on, kid.
Go!
Get him!
Get in there!
Hmm. Well... like my daddy said before he killed my mom,
''You want anything done right, you got to do it yourself.''
He also said--
Can you blush?
Hey, kid.
I reset the security code.
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.
Isn't it sad that you die not by the hand of your enemy, but by that of your own children?
Father.
Nyssa.
Nomak!
Blade, it could end right here.
What do you think, huh?
After all, it looks like I've finished my father's job.
It's strange.
It hurts... it hurts no more.
It won't be long.
I can already feel it burning inside of me.
I want to die while I'm still a vampire.
I want to see the sun.
By booth number three.
Enjoy, man.
Are you sure that the girls are live?
Last time I checked.
Thank you.
A couple of razor blades, just in case...
You didn't think I forgot about you, did you?
Josh!
I'm Kurt Loderwith MTV news.
The Film is The BlairWitch Project.
One ofthe scariestFilms of alltime...
- I was terrified.
- Oh, it scared me to death... armed with a 16mm camera and a video camcorder head into the Black Hills forests of Maryland to make a movie about a legendary witch
..and they're never heard from again
There's no doubt about the box-office success.
What's not clear is whetherthe legend is true.
Fans are not only flocking to the multiplex,
People have started coming to Burkittsville as if itwere Charles Manson's
The Spahn Ranch, or Ed Gein the serial Killer's house, to visit a haunted place.
'Burkittsville isn't a haunted place.
'it's a place that a fictional movie was set in.'
I wasn't able to see the movei when it came out, because I was... in the hospital.
But as soon as they let me out,
I was atthe movie theatre seventeen times in a rom.
The web-site sold me.
The web-site, you know... has allthese police photos, and official police things, all this information, you really believe it.
Our stick men sold so well on the internet that we started selling them in the yard.
Somebody came by to buy them and they wanted rocks.
So we got rocks out of my rock garden, but I didn't want to get rid of them so he offered me $10 after he started booting it up more.
His wife really wanted them, so we sold them to him.
We sold some on the internet but not many.
It costs too much to ship a rock.
Everybody that comes is like this.
I'm so used to being videoed.
I make sure, if I go to my car, or to get the paper, that I at least have full makeup on, and a great night-gown.
I wish that they'd used a fictitious town, and possibly thought ahead toward what type of repercussions could come from using the word documentary in their advertising, and on their web-site.
Get out of these woods, and go home!
There was no goddamn Blair Witch!
You know, there are a lot of naysayers who come and say nay, but then there is supporters who come up to my town, come up to me.
They run up to me, they stop...
Hey, Selena!
They come over to me, they hug me, and say, "Dude, I know it's real," and they squeeze me, and I say,
"I know it's real, too," and we have a bond.
I say, "I know, and they go,
I know, man," and I go, "I know".
You think you're a wise ass?
I didn't do anything wrong!
Enough!
# And I'm a black rainbow and I'm ape of God
# I got a face that's made for violence upon
# I'm a teen distortion, survived abortion
# A rebel from the waist down
# Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
# Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
# I wanna thank you, Mom
I wanna thank you, Dad
# For bringing this fuckin' world to an end
# I never really hated a one true god
# But the god of the people I hated
# You say you wanted evolution
# The ape was a great big hit
# You say you want a revolution, man

They found blood in the van.
# Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! #
Could you turn that down?
I'm just trying to set the mood for the mission.
That's sweet, but I feel like I'm gonna toss.
- She's been feeling queasy.
- No need to explain.
Your comfort is my concern.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Stephen Ryan Parker, who has three names, so he must be from Boston.
Apparently he's here researching a book with his girlfriend.
- The book's title is...
- Blair Witch History Or Hysteria.
Hysteria Or History.
Why is it you guys can't get on the same page about the witch?
We've always been misunderstood.
We embrace nature, not evil.
Thank you, Erica.
Not only a hottie, but a real witch!
Blessed be.
Wiccan... Wicc it good.
Wait, why are we slowing down?
This is where your other tour mate wants to meet. She's a little weird.
She thinks she's psychic or some shit.
- When did you last talk to her?
- E-mail, two days ago.
- Are you sure she'll be here?
- Yeah.
- Kim!
- Kim?
Yo.
Is that her?
Kim?
- Yeah.
- I'm Jeff.
I figured.
- What are you doing there?
- Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
To stand up. I'm exhausted.
I've been on the road two days.
- Want a hand?
- I want amphetamines.
Weed is what I've got, beer I'm gonna get.
Both - now.
That's right, friends.
For two luxurious days and nights, my friends, you will walk the same path the witch herself once walked, sleep on the same soil where her victims' blood was spilled.
Possibly losing your own souls in the process.
I want to thank you all for coming on the inaugural tour of the Blair Witch-Hunt.
- Inaugural?
- You've never done this?
- Never.
- That's not what your web-site said.
"Over 10,000 satisfied customers."
No, that's my web-store.
Stick men, t-shirts, official Blair dirt.
Tours?
We're all virgins on this bus!
# Hang on
# I lost control
# Anyway
# I lost control
# Anyway... #
Here? You drove by a huge Safeway two miles back.
That was in Burkittsville. I don't shop there. I don't even piss there.
Hell of a town you got here.
What century are they living in?
The gene pool's a little shallow here.
Dive in, you'll crack your skull open.
OK.
- Where are we going first?
- The ruins of Rustin Parr's house.
That guy who heard the voices to kill, right?
Yeah, seven little kids.
I hear voices all the time.
Do we need all this shit for a walk in the woods?
The Blair Witch-Hunt provides all amenities while you risk certain death and dismemberment.
- Give it up.
- What's with all this camera stuff?
To record all occult phenomena that may manifest itself in the course of the tour.
Damn, you're really running
Bullshit Central, aren't you?
If you don't believe in the witch, why the hell did you bother to come?
I thought the movie was cool.
How much further?
- Couple more miles.
- Jesus!
- So how far along are you?
- What do you mean?
The baby. How many weeks?
- Six.
- You don't want to keep it, do you?
No.
- But Stephen wants the baby.
- Yes. How do you know?
I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
Welcome to the Parr ruins, ladies and gentlemen.
It's supposed to be where they found Heather's footage.
These markings are incredible.
Ancient witches' alphabet.
Looks like recent graffiti.
They're so realistic.
It's a little scary.
Actually, some of these symbols are positive.
Only those who don't understand witchcraft would be afraid of them.
And remember, fear... is the forerunner of failure.
OK.
What's the story with this tree?
What tree?
Look behind you.
Where the fuck did this come from?
This was never here before.
Nice try, dude.
What does that mean?
Maybe you should drop the tree bit from your next tour.
No, no, I'm not making this up.
- I need a beer.
- Me, too.
Hey, geniuses, explain to me why a house built in 1826 was built around a tree.
This would have been sticking straight through the living room.
Jeff, nobody's scared.
Evil intent in the ground, may a release soon be found.
In peace, release the energy that be from my magic.
Are you casting some kind of evil spell?
Widdershins - Reversing the evil.
The first law of wicca is 'Harm none'.
Cos whatever you do is going to come back threefold.
The karma's a bitch.
- What are you really doing?
- Communing with Elly Kedward.
The Blair Witch? I thought you embraced nature, not evil.
You don't understand.
Elly... was a good witch.
She was an earth child, like me.
She's gonna be my mentor.
- You've spoken with her?
- Not yet... but I will.
That's why I'm here.
To shed my mortal coil... and commune with Elly.
Have you ever seen her picture?
I don't think there are any.
Stephen and I found one.
Check it out.
We think it was drawn before they banished her from Blair.
Banished, my ass.
They dragged her into the woods in the middle of winter, and tied her to a fucking tree to die.
You make her sound helpless. Can't witches summon powerful energy?
We can... but we still have to eat, shit, and die like the rest of you.
We just look good doing it.
Why do you need all these cameras?
I'm personally hoping for an Elly Kedward sighting.
I've got a big beta for a quality master.
I got a night vision, an infrared, a cute little mini dv, handhelds for everyone... and this baby can even do frame-a-second time lapse.
If anything comes in for a visit, we're gonna catch it.
May I have permission to take this leaf?
Thank you.
Evil intent in the ground, may your release soon be found.
And peace release the energy that be from my magic.
So mote it be.
Evil intent in the ground, may your release soon be found.
And peace release the energy that be from my magic.
So mote it be.
OK, wait... How many Heather Donahues does it take to screw in a light bulb?
- How many?
- Just one!
Just one of them!
Do you know what I could never figure out?
- What's that?
- Blair Witch Project, OK?
Two guys and a girl, sleeping in the same tent night after night, and no sex?
- It makes no sense.
- You're so right.
I mean, they were scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever right at their fingertips... and nothing.
I'm a little stressed.
Try some more weed.
OK.
The Bermuda Triangle.
It's a place in the world that's been created by hysteria, by people's own psychology, by their own ideas of the place.
We were already a persecuted minority.
This whole Blair Witch thing set us back 300 years.
We're back in the burning times.
It fucked up our image.
Erica, people fear what they don't understand. You must realise that.
No shit. People think that I drink blood, that I sacrifice children - that I worship the devil just because I'm a wiccan.
Where I come from, people think because I dress in black,
I'm some kind of sick killer or something.
I don't even believe in the devil.
OK?
That's a Christian concept.
I believe in nature.
I hate nature.
Myth, for me... right?
..is just myth.
It's not history, it's not metaphor and it's definitely not the truth...
Stephen, stories like this happen because they exist in a place of truth because there's historical evidence, there's fact.
That's what you don't understand.
I want to make a film.
Wicca... A Way Of Life.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
Wait, wait... Check this out.
Look at everyone.
Everyone is obsessed with the Blair Witch for their own reasons, including us.
Goth... A Way Of Life.
A documentary on you.
All real, all video.
Video never lies, Kim.
Film does, though.
Everyone wants to see something.
I'm telling you, hysteria and delusions, they breed in situations like this.
Why are you applying rational thought to mythology?
Because if people believe something enough, isn't it real?
Perception is reality.
You're not listening to me.
Babe, I know what you're saying,
I just think it's bullshit.
I think you're being a monomaniacal reductionist.
What the hell was that?
I heard that, too.
Burkittsville's funniest home videos!
You scared the shit out of me, man!
It answered every single one of your wet dreams.
What are you guys doing here?
We've got a tour group, the Blair Witch Walk.
- What's your excuse?
- Tour group, the Blair Witch-Hunt.
You're supposed to look out for stuff like this. This is so not happening!
We have jurisdiction.
We have permits.
Yeah? From Cravens? Let me see 'em.
- They're in the car.
- Bullshit!
Let's put it this way, one of us is staying - it's us or you, and it looks like us, bitch!
It's gonna come back at you threefold.
- What?
- In the wiccan...
Shut up!
Your balls will fall off in three days.
Yo, guys, guys,
I think I can settle this.
Just give us till dawn, then we're out of here.
We're cold, we're tired... and we're a little shook up.
We saw something up at Coffin Rock today.
Yeah... Yeah, up at Coffin Rock.
It scared the shit out of us.
Guys, stop talking about it, because I'm gonna freak.
I just want to go home.
Can we see this thing...
- Coffin Rock?
- Blair Witch? Go to Coffin Rock.
It's your money, Greta.
Next time, take the Blair Witch Walk.
Next time, take the Blair Witch-Hunt.
Here's my card. Call. I'm on the web.
They were never seen again.
Their footage was found a year later... underexposed, and useless.
I don't trust that these assholes aren't coming back.
They're going to be pissed that we took the foundation.
I don't think it's anything to worry about.
Besides... we're gonna be up all night, baby!
Giddy-up!
We'll just keep our eyes open.
They're not coming back.
Why do you think that?
I just do.
I'll be back in a minute.
Up all night!
How do your parents feel... about having a witch for a daughter?
My father is an Episcopal minister, in a one-church-town back in Munnsville, Illinois.
Yeah.
That's a bummer.
How many beers is that for you?
I'm serious!
You're drinking like a fish.
I just think you should take care of yourself.
Jesus! We've already gone through this once today already.

What the fuck...?
This is my work.
This is all my research.
Our work.
Every word.
Where the fuck are my cameras?
This is all of our goddamn work!
How the hell are we gonna make the deadline?
- We backed it up on computer.
- No, Tristen, that was just notes.
Half this shit is original documents.
Where the hell was everybody?
We were all supposed to be awake.
Guys, where's Erica?
I'm right here.
We must have fallen asleep.
Asleep? It's like we must have blacked out!
The last thing I remember was that other group.
Yeah... those fucking dickweeds!
Who else could it have been, huh?
They came back from Coffin Rock, and ripped us off!
Ripped? These things look like they were bit off.
I-I-I... What am I gonna do?
At least the tapes are still here.
- What?
- The tapes. They're here.
Where? Do you see them?
In my mind, I see them.
Oh, Jesus.
You fuck.
They're there!
Where they found the Blair Witch tapes?
You've got to be kidding me.
Come on! Why would they be in there?
Newsflash, everybody...
That was just a movie.
I don't know why, Stephen.
They're under the rocks.
There's nothing in there.
Reach inside.
- Well...?
- I don't feel so hot.
Jeff, is there anything in there?
Jesus Christ.
How did those get in there?
Are they yours?
I think we should leave.
How did you know?
- I don't know.
- Are they yours?
Did you put them there? Did you?!
- Jeff, are they your tapes?
- Yeah, they're my tapes!
Then, why are they still here?
Why is the equipment trashed, the cameras are gone, but not the tapes?
She's right. Wouldn't those guys want to fuck up your tour footage?
Stephen, I want to leave.
How did this happen?
Oh, fuck!
Jesus Christ, the baby.
We found blood in the van.
Tristen had a miscarriage.
You know that, Cravens.
'She bled in the van on the way to the hospital.'
This girl's hypothermic.
Get me heating blankets and a lamp.
It's like she's been sitting in ice water.
We were just camping.
'The doctor thinks it's hypothermia.'
Course, the way I see it you brought her out here, you took her into those woods.
She's your responsibility.
Are you charging me with something?
You have been... a pain in this town's ass since you were 10.
You need to learn to stay out of trouble, boy.
It makes you defensive...
Anxious.
Last thing you need is to end up back in the loony bin.
How is she?
She lost the baby.
The doctor will keep you here till your temperature stabilises.
You lost a lot of blood.
More than usual.
It's for the best.
Your body is telling you something was wrong.
Something was wrong.
How are you feeling?
I'm not staying here.
Five hours of our lives are unaccounted for.
I want to see those tapes.
I want to know what happened.
I've got some editing equipment at my house.
We should be able to come up with some answers.
We're still in the Black Hills, aren't we?
Yeah, right up there.
Let's get Tristen inside.
We can take care of the bags later.
I thought we were going to your house.
RFD 431... Jericho Mills, home.
What did it used to be?
It was a factory after the war.
They were going to destroy it, so I got them to sell it to me for a buck.
Cool.
Sorry about the bridge.
It's the only way in or out.
It's pretty safe... don't lean on the railings.
I am not a gambling man.
But...
I would bet my entire... retirement pension... that the blood in the van... is gonna match those tourists.
You've been looking to pin something on me since I was a kid.
Come on, get in, quick. Before they eat you. Quick, quick. Let's go.
Burkitt County's cheapest alarm.
And what's that do? Squirt water?
No, that actually works. Wave.
It's recording you right now.
I got 'em hooked up through the building.
- I'm a little paranoid.
- Hah! a little?
I heard that.
But with good reason.
I got a lot of valuable stuff here.
Oh, my God!
Yeah! You wouldn't want somebody to come in here, and steal stuff that you've already stolen.
Where it comes from is not my business, nor should it be yours.
I just like to pass the savings on to others.
- Really? And how do you do that?
- E-bay.
Buying, selling, trading, swapping.
I'm a major player.
I thought all your cameras got trashed.
Well, you can never have too many.
Jeff, I think we've had enough videotaping for one weekend.
Yeah, dude. Tour's over.
Maybe the tour has just begun, cos you're walking into the official Blair store.
Come in, everybody.
This is where it begins.
This is the epicentre of the Blair Witch-Hunt web-site.
I got my sticks... You can touch these, they're for the stick men.
Don't touch those, those are drying.
Did you collect these in the Black hills?
Yeah, every twig.
Here is a rock...
Oh, my God, who made that?!
Oh, I did, earlier.
We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt, that's a big item. I sell that.
T-shirts and sweat shirts, and hats.
Here you go, Tristen.
That's for you, gratis.
I feel better.
You're as big an asshole as the rest of them.
What are you talking about, Erica?
This stuff is hot.
This is what the wiccan religion needs, more capitalism based on fear and lies.
Do you really think it's fair to exploit our culture, just to sell stick-figure key chains?
- I think this place is cool, Jeff.
- Thanks.
Jeff, we're tired.
I should get her to bed.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Let's see...
The stairs by the kitchen lead to my editing loft.
The bedroom on the right is mine.
It's got the biggest bed and it's own john. You guys take it.
- Thanks, brother.
- Sure.
Sleep well.
The rest of the bedrooms are down the hallway.
Hey...
I really appreciate the hospitality, but take me off your mailing list.
OK.
They should have never let you out.
You're a long way from sane.
I saw something at the hospital.
What?
It was just like the picture in the Blair Witch black bible.
The same clothes, that same face, like... she'd been drowned.
Who?
The little girl.
Eileen Treacle.
Sweetie...
Why don't we talk about this after you get some sleep?
I want to talk about it now.
You need to sleep. You're in shock.
This is so... intense.
Chill out, Erica.
We've watched half of one tape.
We've got four angles, we've got our handhelds, we've got hours of tapes we haven't seen.
Last night, when we were camping,
I dreamt I hurt the baby.
That's just because we've been fighting about it so much.
- You've been through a lot.
- I know how much you wanted a baby.
I'm sorry I didn't want it.
I'm sorry that I lost it.
Guys, something just occurred to me.
- Where's that tree?
- What?
That big tree that was right there.
Now there's just this tiny twig.
See, guys, I told you there was something up with that tree.
Hand me another of those dv cassettes maybe there's another angle.
Whoa, whoa... what is up with that?
I don't know. I think it's chafing from the backpack.
Does it hurt?
Not really. It just kind of itches.
It's nothing. Here.
- What was that?
- What?
Rewind it.
What did you see?
I'm not sure. A flash, or something.
Coffin Rock.
- What?
- Coffin Rock.
How the hell do you see Coffin Rock?
Can you see in other dimensions?
I don't know.
That's what it reminds me of.
Those guys that were murdered there in 1886 - after they were gutted, their heads were arranged in the shape of a pentagram... like that.
A great American pastime - blame it on a witch.
Let me see if I can get that image back.
Stephen!
Is she gonna be OK?
I don't know.
Stephen!
Tristen?
Tristen?
Shut up.
'You brought it back with you.'
What was all that?
That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm.
The crying.
You heard that, too?
In my dreams.
I thought I was having this horrible nightmare.
About what?
Children... looking up my skirt as I twirled round and round.
So I hurt them.
Stephen, what the hell is wrong with me?
Nothing. Nothing. You're just...
Look, there are... rational explanations behind this.
Behind everything that's going on.
I think we need to go home.
- I'll get someone to drive us...
- Not yet!
Why?
Just not yet.
I need to understand what happened.
You can understand it on the plane ride home.
Here.
Take these.
Take them.
They'll help you sleep.
Come on, take them!
You're not making a believer out of me, son.
It was an accident.
I swear to Christ, it was an accident.
- Jesus.
- What the hell was that?
I'm not sure.
See that? Whoa, wait. Look.
Time code goes from 1:32 a.m.... to 3:57 a.m.... back to 1:32 a.m.
In the middle of the footage?
How does that happen?
I don't know. But those were the hours that we fell asleep.
Can you make it bigger, or slow it down?
Let me try slowing it down.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a naked woman.
What is a naked woman doing swinging around a tree?
Are we sure these are our tapes?
I'm not sure of anything in the last 24 hours.
I'll re-digitise this at a higher resolution so I can blow it up.
This will take a few minutes.
I need alcohol.
Caffeine.
Caffeine!
Sure. I live to serve.
Ugh... great.
Stale coffee, no beer, some old take-out chicken... but plenty of batteries.
Hey...
- What's going on?
- We're leaving in the morning.
Really?
It's... It's Tristen.
She's in bad shape.
This whole thing has really fucked her up.
How come you're the one who looks like he's having a breakdown?
Look! I'm a little tense, all right?
Sorry.
No, I am... sorry.
I just feel like my whole life's been turned upside down the past two days.
I know.
It's been really crazy for you, but it's gonna be OK.
I promise.
That feels good.
You ARE tense.
- Like that?
- Yeah.
Lower?
Yeah, lower.
- How does that feel?
- Good.
Lower?
How does that feel?
Do they hurt?
No. They're just a little warm.
Don't worry.
I have them, too.
Guys... want to come up here?
You're out of beer, if that's what you want to know.
Jeff found a better angle on this naked chick.
- What naked chick?
- Cool. How?
I blew up the image.
It's a bit weird to watch...
Like watching a hold-up on a bank security camera.
You get the gist.
Where is this?
The foundation.
- This was last night?
- Yeah. During the big blackout.
Can you let us see her face?
Sure can.
If this is a joke... it ain't funny.
No joke. It's serious, Erica.
While I was gone, you messed with things.
No.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I know.
- We were hoping you could explain.
- I don't have a clue.
- You have no memory of doing this?
- No.
If it's some wicca thing, you can tell us.
Try and help us understand.
We're just trying to put together what happened last night.
- Find out who trashed my equipment.
- That wasn't me. I didn't do that.
Erica, that's you there on the screen.
Leave me the hell alone, all of you!
Believe her?
I don't know.
Jeff, give me your keys to the van.
- Where you going?
- I have to get out. I need a beer.
Hey, see if we need more coffee.
..earth and fire, water and smoke...
I am going to the store.
You want to come...?
Erica?
Erica!
We brought something back with us.
What are you talking about?
I can sense it... like someone's choking me... and squeezing the air out of me.
Look, we're just tired, OK?
We're all really tired. That is it.
I want to show you something.
I have got the same thing.
It's nothing, it's like poison oak.
But, Kim...
They're growing.
Ancient pagan alphabet.
They say it means you've been touched by a witch.
That you're next chosen to die.
There's something here!
There's something here!
Sweet.
Yo, Morticia.
Hey, Elvira, I got something you can suck the blood out of.
Oh, yeah? Whip it out.
Excuse me, sorry.
I'm finished now.
What the...?!
What is your problem?
- You're with the witch people.
- Lady...
I'm just here to buy groceries.
Witch!
Freak.
Am I gonna have a problem with you, too?
No problem.
Good. Let's go.
OK, look...
Either you ring this stuff up... or I call your manager.
I am the manager.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, then, Peggy... could you tell the bitch at the front register to do her goddamn job?!
Get the hell out of here!
Not until I've completed my purchase.
We don't want people like you around here.
You know what? I am gonna make this so easy on you, Peggy.
I told you to get the hell out of here.
You touch me again... and I will rip out your goddamn throat!
Keep your motherfucking change!
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke,
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke
Persephone, I invoke... by earth and fire, and water and smoke,
Persephone, I invoke...
- Stone the witch!
- Stone the bitch!
Fucking rednecks!
Ow!
Kim?
Make me a pot of coffee on your way up.
You're welcome.
Look, I fucked up your front fender.
I had to swerve to avoid hitting these little kids.
They were dressed funny, like from another time. Seven of them.
Jeff!
I know this is crazy, but I know those are the kids
Rustin Parr killed!
Coffee.
Next to your arm.
- Morning.
- Hey. Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah, I slept OK. You?
- Yeah.
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. Are you guys ready?
Yeah.
I... appreciate your driving us.
Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff.
Come on, Tristen, wake up.
- Come on, let's go.
- Not yet...
Tristen, we're going home.
Erica?
Erica!
Erica?
- Erica!
- Not up here.
Not up there? You sure?
She was just here.
Didn't you hear me?
I just said she's not up here.
Why don't you go check out the v...
What the hell happened to the van?
Jesus Christ.
We are never gonna get out of here...
Kim, what the hell did you do?
You said you just busted up the front end!
How the hell did you drive it back?
I swear it was just the front fender.
What the fuck is going on?!
They dip their hands in your blood then press them on your body.
- What are you talking about?
- The children.
Something I dreamt.
Jeff dreamt it, too. Look.
Look!
Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this?
Something from the woods.
We've all got them. Me, her, Erica...
Where is Erica?
Erica?
Erica?
Erica!
What the...?
Erica!
Erica!
ERICA!
We would've heard the dog alarm when she went outside.
It's like she fucking vanished.
- Evaporated is more like it.
- Yeah, right, Kim.
You were the one who found her clothes and those candles.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
A prank. Two little bitches trying to freak us out.
- You paranoid fuck!
- Come on!
We'd never do something like that!
Where is she, Kim? Where is she?
Why are her clothes and shit still here?
How would I know?
Can't you see her, Kimmy, in your mind's eye?
Very funny, asshole!
I think something really bad has happened to her.
Maybe she called somebody.
I'd like to speak to Minister Geerson, please.
'He's in a meeting.
Could he return your call?'
- No. It's urgent.
- 'Could I tell him what it's about?'
Yeah. His daughter, Erica.
We wanna know if he's heard from her.
The minister and Mrs Geerson have no daughter.
No, I know, like, they disowned her or something because she's a witch...
'They've never had any children.'
So she made up a story.
She gave us a fake name.
It doesn't have to mean anything.
She lied to us.
Why are we seeing all this shit?
Why is all this happening?
I don't know. Collective delusion.
Group hysteria.
It's what my book is about. You get a bunch of people scared enough...
Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please.
It's real. Dude
It happens.
They teach it at junior colleges
I bet that even you could get into.
How did you get into yours?
You have to brush your teeth?
Jeff, the screen.
Roll it back, rewind it.
No, more.
Oh, shit.
I knew they'd come back and mess with my stuff.
Fuck off. No one's home.
- It's Cravens.
- 'Sheriff?'
Funny. I just found out who trashed my cameras. I was about to call you.
Turn on your TV.
'I don't give a shit.
I want you to see something.'
Me, too. News at 11:00.
Shit. Will you just turn that on?
Humour him.
- You watching?
- Like a hawk.
Listen, I'm trying to tell you what I found out on Friday night.
'This is a special report.
'A brutal murder in the Black Hills discovered today
'the bodies of five hikers found dead
'atop the landmark known as Coffin Rock.'
Disembowelled, Jeffrey.
'A re-creation of the infamous Coffin Rock massacre
'popularised by the movie
The Blair...'
Bodies were laid out in the shape of a pentagram.
Sound familiar?
'We've received word that the victims include two Chinese tourists
'and one German, as well as two unidentified white males.
'Recently, the Black Hills has been overrun with fans
'wanting to get a glimpse of where the movie was filmed.'
- 'You looking at me?'
- What?
'Over here.'
There.
- Yeah?
- 'I didn't find your cameras.
'Don't guess that's a surprise, is it?'
- What do you want from me?
- I got five corpses here!
I had nothing to do with that.
You might not have been in charge but you were involved, so you and your little friends had best just sit tight.
'And that means... you don't leave this county till I say it's OK.'
I don't know you, Stephen.
I don't know a thing about you.
I don't know how much to believe about any of you people...
But from now on... know this: you are not leaving me here alone to take the fall for this shit.
Nobody is going out of my sight.
We brought something back with us.
For Christ's sake, Kim...
I'll tell you what's going on here.
It's Erica... or whoever the fuck she is.
Erica has got nothing to do with this.
She's a witch, man!
She's one big pissed-off witch!
She's casting fucking spells, making herself appear, making herself fucking disappear.
It's been her since day one!
Smoke it up, cos you're not totally psycho yet!
- Where are you going?
- The fuck away from you!
You're a dick.
Kim!
Jeff, you've got to have friends, somebody with a car...
What did I tell you?!
You're not going anywhere!
Wipe that shit off your face.
You think that your makeup and black clothes give you power, but you're just a scared, cowardly little girl underneath all that.
You don't understand.
Something happened to us in the woods.
Something evil.
Why are you so mad at me?
Calm down. I'm not that pissed.
Just stop badmouthing Erica.
- She's outside.
- Where?
Right there.
There's nothing out there.
Tristen, let's get you back to bed.
- You just got to look, Stephen.
- Let's go to the bedroom.
Look again.
She's out there!
Erica.
What happened to you?
Don't be afraid.
You know who it is.
- What?
- And you know what you have to do.
Erica!
You know who it is.
Erica?
Tristen, help me. Help me!
Tristen!
Aw, Tristen...
Stephen! I got you, grab my hand.
Come on, hold on.
They did it, the little Buster Boys.
They did it! They hanged her!
The little Buster Boys!
Tristen! Shh! Shh!
It's only a dream. It's only a dream!
They're Elly Kedward's dreams!
I don't know why I'm having them.
Why do you think they're Elly Kedward's?
Cos I was seeing them through her eyes - tied to the tree where they banished her to.
And the bad little boys from Blair village sneaking out to the woods to see if she was still alive... and... and they let their big dogs bite her and they poked her with sticks and then when the blood came out of her, they put their palms in it and pressed it on her flesh!
And then, when they found she was still alive, they untied her... and they put the ropes around her neck and they hanged her from the big tree!
Stephen, I think I'm going fucking crazy!
No! No, you are not going crazy.
Do you hear me?
You are not going crazy.
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried about Tristen.
Do you know the name of the doctor she was with?
No, no, I don't.
Then I think you need to call the hospital.
OK. I think there's a phone book in the desk drawer.
What is this?
What the fuck is this?
- What?
- These!
I don't know. Where did you get 'em?
In your desk!
What, are you spying on us?
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I'm not!
I've no idea where this came from!
Where'd you get this? Answer me!
She found 'em.
Maybe she put 'em in there!
- I wanna know where you got these!
- I've no idea!
We've been looking into your background, Stephen.
You've been such a good little boy all your life.
How did you get mixed up in all this?
What?
'It's Cravens, you little shit!'
Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied right now.
'I need to talk to you.
Get your butt down here.'
My van is trashed. And you know mommy doesn't let me out after dark.
'I'm right at your front door, you little twerp! Get down here!'
How can he be out there?
The bridge is gone.
This is too weird.
Here!
Jeffrey!
It's Cravens!
We got a few things to talk about, boy!
You were a punk as a kid, and you're still a punk!
Open up, Jeff!
Open the goddamn door!
If you know what's good for you, you'll open the damn door!
You open up this goddamn door right now!
I told you to stay out of those woods.
They're not gonna just send you back to the loony bin this time.
Open the goddamn door!
Jeff!
What the fuck, dude?
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Erica.
What are you doing?
Erica.
That's gross!
She... she's...! Oh, God!
You were the last one to see her still alive.
The last time I saw her, she was heading up here to see you.
I didn't kill her, Stephen.
- Don't even think it.
- Kim was up here with me!
Well, let me clue you in to something, all right?
She didn't commit fucking suicide!
- One of you...
- Oh, wait!
What about you?
What gets you off the goddamn hook?
- My word!
- Which is worth exactly shit to me!
Where was your little girlfriend this whole time?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
She can barely get out of bed...
It's backwards.
Go back to bed, Tristen.
The little girl backwards.
Erica dancing... backwards.
Everything backwards.
What are you talking about?
Widdershins.
Undo the evil.
What the fuck is a widdershin?
All right, she's lost her fucking mind.
That's it.
Backwards.
- Backwards!
- What?
We need to run the tapes backwards.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I think it'll help us find out what happened to Erica.
This makes no sense!
I know it doesn't. Just please do it!
See? Nothing.
Try the-the-the keystrokes backwards.
You know, the fucking commands.
You see? You guys happy?
There's nothing!
There's your missing hours.
This must be when we blacked out.
Tristen...
What is this?
What did you make us do?
You're leading us, aren't you?
Weren't you watching the fucking screen?
No.
- Get back here!
- Grab her!
Get your hands off me.
What did you do, Tristen?
Stephen, please tell them to stop.
Why aren't you marked like this?
Like the rest of us, like Erica?
What did you do to Erica?
Stephen, why are you letting them do this?
You killed Erica!
- You two are crazy!
- Shh, shh, shh! Listen.
Just admit it to the camera.
We're not gonna take the fall for Erica.
OK? Just admit it. Don't worry, sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you.
Not like you hurt the baby.
What? I didn't have anything to do with the baby.
The witch kills children!
I... haven't killed anybody!
Bullshit!
- Oh, God, Stephen.
- Tristen, just say the words!
Just say the words...
You're all gonna fucking die.
- You wanna kill me?
- No.
No, I just want to understand.
But you can't understand because you're so afraid!
Just like the pathetic children of Blair village, so frightened!
- Aren't you, little girl?
- Who are you?
She's the witch, man!
Is that what you think... crazy boy?
Tristen! Tristen, talk to me!
- Stephen...
- What is it, baby, what is it?
- Tristen's gone.
- Get away from him!
That's not... how you do it.
This is what you want.
Tristen, whatever you're doing... don't!
I'm not doing anything, honey.
It's all up to you!
Witch bitch.
Why did you kill Erica?
I can smell the fear on you.
Stay away from me.
You wanna kill me?
You can't, can you, Kimmy?
I will rip your fucking head off!
- Then fucking do it!
- Stop it!
Stop it.
Aw, isn't that what your book's about, Stephen?
People just want to see something?
You have no balls.
You can't do it, you weak, little pathetic...
Oh, you were the last fucking one with the balls, you little bitch.
No!
'I'm standing in front of an abandoned broom factory
'in Jericho Mills, a few miles from the town of Burkittsville,
'where, just hours ago, police arrested three obsessed movie fans
'who allegedly committed a series of ritualistic murders
'after watching last summer's blockbuster,
'the Blair Witch Project.'
'This vehicle, which you see behind me
'is owned by one of the suspects,
'and there is blood evidence linking the suspects to these murders.
'Sadly, as has happened so many times before in this country,
'violent art has inspired real-life violence.
'In this case, it's the Blair Witch Project.'
I ain't no documentary film-maker, but I had your videotapes slapped together over at Montgomery College.
Sorta tells the whole story.
Great.
You could see how fucking insane
Tristen was.
She practically begged Stephen to push her.
Gutting those tourists...
How'd you have the stomach for that?
Yeah...
I don't remember doing that.
Let's talk about... Peggy.
What?
'Apparently one woman was hanged, and the other victim,
'the cause of death has yet to be determined.
'Ironically, both women were murdered by their friends
'after allegedly participating in a vicious killing spree
'in the Black Hills.'
'The police have not offered a motive,
'but apparently the two slain female killers were involved in witchcraft.'
And, um... what about the redhead?
She was a real pretty girl.
She wouldn't put out or something?
No, we just found her in the closet.
It was Tristen.
The witch got into her... fucked with her mind or something.
And your girlfriend? Killing her because she had a miscarriage.
Whoo-whee! Now, that's harsh.
She wrapped the rope around her neck.
She was taunting me... begging me to push her.
You're not making a believer out of me.
It was an accident!
I swear to Christ it was an accident!
'Local officials are urging calm
'and trying to keep curiosity seekers at bay.
'And as has happened in the past,
'rumours about a...
'supernatural presence causing these murders
'are spreading like wildfire over the internet.'
W-wait... wait.
Wait a... wait a second.
Jeff...
Jeff...
He...
He videotaped the whole thing.
Watch the tapes. You'll see.
Look at the goddamn tapes!
Yes, sir.
Too much trouble to pay for your beer?
I didn't do that.
Oh, yeah?
Then, um... who's this?
I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.
That's not how it happened.
I didn't do that.
That's not how it happened.
Stop it.
'Just... just do it!
Just admit it to the camera.
'We're not gonna take the fall for Erica.
'Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.'
'Not like you hurt the baby.'
'What? I didn't have anything to do with the baby.'
'The witch kills children!'
'I... haven't killed anybody!'
- 'Bullshit!'
- 'No!'
'Tell us the truth.
Tell us the truth.
- 'Confess.'
- 'God!
'Stephen, this is me.
What are you talking about?'
'Stop it!'
- 'Tristen!'
- 'No! No!
'Stop! Oh...'
'She's the witch, man!'
'Jeff, what are you saying?
I'm not the witch.'
- 'Yeah, you are.'
- 'What are you saying?'
You know what I'm saying, god damn it!
'Stephen, please.'
'Did you kill Erica?
Confess, confess.'
- 'Stop it.'
- 'Say the words.'
'Oh, God, Stephen, don't! Please!'
'No!'
'Fucking witch!'
This is wrong.
This is wrong.
Somebody fucked with this tape!
Somebody fucked with that tape!
That tape is wrong!
That's fucking bullshit!
That's fucking shit!

# Pretty please
# Can you tell me where I am?
# You...
# Won't you say something?

Witch, why did you come?
I thought the movie was cool.
'The Blair Witch legend refuses to die,
'as strange and compelling new evidence
'continues to mount,
'at least three sequences intended for the motion picture,
'were left on the cutting room floor.'
How did this happen?
'You are now about to unlock the secret of Esrever,
'where you will discover mysterious and haunting ghost-like images.
'Here is an example:
'Watch this scene carefully.
'It is an outtake being shown for the very first time.
'It all looks normal enough
'until you look again from the beginning of the scene.
'The cast member walks around the bed,
'but look at the lockers against the wall -
'here the locks are arranged in the shape of a pentagram -
'but here, they are not.
'A second scene omitted from the film is even more disturbing.
'Look carefully at the glass window.
'Is it the face of a victim?
'Here is a third outtake. Look at the portrait in the background.
'It is horribly sinister one second, and harmless, the next.'
We brought something back with us.
'Additional ghost images are hidden in the feature itself.
'At the conclusion of the segment, without pressing "stop,"
'press "reverse" on your remote control
'and watch the piece in its entirety, backwards.
'At the lower right hand corner of your screen, you will see letters.
'As you play the tape backwards, these letters will form words
'and these words will lead you back to the scenes
'that contain hidden words or images.'
Roll it back... rewind it.
'Are they a message from the Blair Witch?
'Is it your imagination?
'And, are there more?
'What you find will surprise you.'
Dear Mom it feel's strange to write you first time since I left
I could've phoned but somehow it might be difficult to talk
You still angry I left?

Mario
Must be Latin blood. Hot-tempered
- What?
- I was just thinking of a time.
- You want to hear it?
- Play something else.
No, no, no. It's a good one.
You just turned 15, you were a senior, you took me out in Mom's old station wagon.
Remember? The Dragon Wagon.
You were gonna teach me how to drive.
And there was that one tree and nothing else...
...someone banged into the car while we were inside...
That's right. You actually lied for me.
- I lied for me.
- No, come on. You lied for both of us.
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.
That was a stop sign.
You're kidding, right?
In your car, I'd be kidding?
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.
Come on, Darry.
"Gay Fever!" No, "Gay Forever."
"Gay Forever." That's mine.
That's three for little bro'.
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.
- That's five to two.
- Shit.
"Gay Fever?"
Sexy forever, huh?
You know that is you in 40 years.
There's usually a reason when you like the long way home.
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?
Okay.
Just drive, brat.
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.
"Trisha, why are you driving home for spring break with your brat brother...
"and not heading off somewhere with that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"
I will tell them the same thing I'll tell you:
None of your goddamn business.
What?
You don't think I could understand the complex nature of your relationships?
No, I look at you as a real expert.
Whatever. I don't care.
I'm just saying, if you broke it off with him... you should at least figure out what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.
- They're the ones in love with the guy.
- What would Jesus do...
I am no fanatic.
What I am is a fan of God!
...a serpent-headed demon, shaking you by the...
You wanted the back way home.
That's 10 hours of preachers, farm reports...
Could you possibly just shut up and drive, please?
"You broke my heart in two
"Now I can't find the duct tape
"To put it together for you
Come on, girl, sing along now.
"When I met you, I thought I would die
"I wanted to cry
"Didn't know you were evil
"Or that you would hurt me
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy
"Turns out you're a twit and a real..."
Jesus!
- What the hell is his problem?
- Just get out of his way, Darry!
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?
Go around me!
Get off the road and let him pass you!
- He's nuts!
- I know he's nuts. Pull over!
Go around me!
- Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
- I'm trying!
Jesus!
Shit!
What the hell was his problem?
My first guess? Inbreeding!
Get a load of that nasty old thing.
What is that, the vehicle of choice for assholes and fucking serial killers?
God.
You know what I just thought of, right?
Kenny and Darla?
They died about a 100 miles from here.
- The same highway.
- This highway runs the length of the state.
You believe it?
That they had to go looking for her head?
That they never found them, only the car.
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.
Didn't find him or her head.
Look at me, I'm still shaking!
You don't think every generation has their cautionary tale... of drinking and driving on Prom night?
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.
You wanna know something?
When I first heard that story...
I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.
Quite the cheery thinker today, aren't we, sis?
What's "Poli-Sci Guy" been doing to you, anyway?
"Beating you?"
That was the license plate on the van we just saw.
B-E-A-T-N-G-U.
So "Beating You."
That's mine. That's three to five.
- You can't call it now.
- My ass!
- You have to call it when you see it.
- I was in shock!
- Tough!
- What is this, a brand new rule?
It's always been this way.
- Since when?
- Since always.
Since just now, maybe.
- Your memory's for shit.
- No, it's not.
Nah, infinity.
Uh-huh, infinity squared.
- Okay, name it.
- What?
When we made the rule that you had to call it as soon as you see it.
Would you give it up already?
That's 'cause the rule has always been... the first person who calls it, gets it.
You talk to Mom lately?
To tell her I'd be home for break.
She sound weird?
What?
Did you listen to her voice?
Could you specify, please?
Forget it.
Did you drink the last water?
The last one was mine.
You are a class act, you know that?
You live off-campus.
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?
What they don't steal, they dye pink.
I've got 12 pairs of rosy-pink jockey shorts.
Maybe they know something about you, you don't.
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."
It's for her, not me.
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.
She thinks I don't need her anymore or something.
I'm serious.
- Goof.
- Bitch.
- Mama's boy.
- Daddy's whore.
- Dick licker.
- Ball sniffer.
- Ass kisser.
- Butt picker.
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.
- I think maybe something's wrong.
- You always think something's wrong.
Like you would notice anything past the point of your own selfish little existence.
She's not happy.
- Not like she used to be.
- Who is?
Mom's not...
It's "Beating You."
What's he doing?
What the hell is that?
What the hell was he doing?
He dumped something down that pipe.
Wrapped in a sheet.
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.
Wrapped and roped in a sheet with red stains on it.
Just get us out of here.
- Grab my cell phone.
- Where?
It's in the gym bag.
Oh, Jesus...
You gotta be kidding me.
The point of having a portable phone is that it works when you need it!
I have a power cable for it.
And I have a cigarette lighter that doesn't work.
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!
We should've taken my car!
He's coming up right on our ass.
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.
Darry...
- He's coming up right on our ass.
- What the fuck is in that thing?
You're out of your fucking mind!
What the hell's your problem?
Fuck me! Go!
What the hell's the matter with you!
- Darry, what are you doing?
- Hang on.
Just don't kill us, okay?
Sounds all right.
What?
Like either one of us would know.
I know a little.
Your car makes a strange noise... you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.
I told you?
I learned it from you.
Jesus Christ...
Whoa, wait.
I'm thinking past the point of my own selfish little existence now, okay?
We're both pretty damn sure what we saw him dump down that pipe, right?
What if it's someone still alive?
What if it was?
Someone who needs help.
We can get help as fast by getting to a phone.
You have any idea how far to the nearest phone?
We were just attacked!
And you don't even wanna find out why?
We look in the pipe, that's it.
Is this your idea of a little adventure or something?
'Cause this is why girls are smarter, okay?
We look in the pipe, if there's nothing there, nothing we can do... we just drive on home and call the cops.
You know that's what we should do.
- Bullshit, I do.
- Bullshit, you don't!
Look me in the eye and tell me you can just drive away.
Leave who's ever back there, back there.
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive if you'd just gone back.
Don't make this about the right thing to do.
You just wanna go back there see if there's something nasty at the end of that pipe.
Okay.
And what if it was you back there?
I'm not getting out of this car.
- You don't have to.
- I'm not.
Jesus, it's a church.
What's with all the birds?
I'm just gonna look.
Let's do this and do it fast.
Oh, my God.
- Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
- Doesn't smell like one either.
Come on, you can't see anything in there.
You can see light down there.
Get a flashlight.
Come on, get a flashlight.
Hello!
Anybody down there?
Hey! Anybody down there?
Hello!
Hurry up. Come on.
Hello!
There's someone there, I heard them.
Hello!
You're hearing things, Darry.
Darry, don't even think about it!
- Darry!
- I told you I heard someone.
You know the part in scary movies... where somebody does something really stupid... and everybody hates them for it?
This is it.
- Hello!
- No, Darry!
- Let me slide down.
- God damn it!
- Let me get a little way in.
- You're not going.
I'm not. Just hold my feet.
The feet?
Anybody down there?
When was the last time you washed these socks?
I see something.
- Hello!
- I am counting to 10.
Something's moving.
Then I am letting go and going back to my car.
Quiet!
I just saw it again.
Something is definitely moving down there.
Rats!
- What?
- Rats!
Rats!
Darry!
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!
Darry, say something!
Are you okay?
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?
You suck.
God, I am so sorry.
I bet you are.
I am. I don't know what happened.
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on...
Not as sorry as I am.
There were rats coming at my face.
They were running at me too, Trish.
I feel really bad. Are you okay?
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.
Trisha Jenner, coming through in the clutch.
Thank you.
You were the one who wanted to come and have a little adventure.
Shut up.
How the hell are you gonna get out of there?
Darry?
What?
Darry?
Say it isn't so.
Did I hear you talking?
Darry, who in the holy hell are you talking to down there?
I found our body.
- You what?
- I found our...
What?
Darry?
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!
Darry, tell me what's going on!
What?
We gotta get out of here.
No, let's stay and feed the birds.
Get help.
Get help, Trish.
What are you looking at?
Get out to the road and find somebody who can help.
How are you gonna get out of there?
This is some kind of basement, right, for the church?
You don't think
I'm going in there, do you?
Get out to the road, flag down anyone you see... tell them to get the cops out here right away.
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.
And Trish... if you see that old truck coming... you get back to this pipe, you holler down as loud as you can.
You just had to say that, right?
God damn it, Darry!
You asshole!
Darry?
Would you please just say something?
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!
We have to stop.
Did you hear me?
Darry?
She did lose her head.
Darla lost her head just like they said.
And you know what he did, Trish?
You know what he did for her?
He sewed it back on.
He sewed it right back on.
You gonna make a phone call?
Throw some water on yourself.
You look like you just crawled out of a sewer.
He's going back.
He's going back. Come on!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, we need help.
I need you to please call the police.
The police?
We need help now, please!
Just go tell them what you saw so we can get out of here, okay?
Come on, brat!
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.
Look at me, Darry.
I'm so scared, Trish.
I am so scared.
I'm scared, too, all right?
He's gonna get back to that church... and he's gonna know that we were there.
Are you gonna get that?
- Yeah, hello.
- Have you seen the cats yet?
- You and your brother.
- Me and my brother?
You and Darry.
I saw you with lots of cats.
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?
Who is this?
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?
Who is this?
You have a torn shirt, right?
And a bloody hand.
Shirt's torn just above a small rose tattoo... on your stomach.
Who is this?
How the hell do you know us?
You found its house of pain.
The what?
Those bodies down there... that's what it likes to call it... its house of pain.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil... or just some hungry thing... from some dark place in time.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I just know it's not gonna stop coming after you... or anyone else it wants to.
Once it has the scent of something it likes... it can't stop.
- Is what...
- What is she saying?
I saw that awful truck, too.
With the license plate.
"Beating You?"
The license plate on its truck.
Right, "Beating You"?
No, think about it.
Think about it, for Christ's sake.
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those eyes?"
Okay.
You hear that song, you run.
And I mean run.
'Cause that song means something terrible for you.
Something so terrible you couldn't dream of it... not in your worst, most terrible nightmare.
Fuck you, lady!
Darry.
Darry?
Hello?
Let's talk with the cops and get the hell out of here.
Maybe you should've left out the part about that phone call.
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.
Everything I said I saw, I saw.
What, you think I bumped my head down there or something?
I didn't say that.
You believe me, right?
Right?
Look me in the eye and tell me you believe me.
Look me right in the eye right now, you tell me you believe everything I said!
We're running the plates... and we've got some people on their way out to the old church.
These kids you saw on that wall, who were they again?
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...
Brandon.
Found their car all smashed up about 20 years ago.
- Am I remembering this right?
- Yeah.
Those bodies would be nothing but bones by now.
You said they still had skin on them and he had a ring on his finger.
What are you saying?
I told you,
I grabbed one of them like this.
And it was hard, like petrified wood.
Like he preserved them or something.
He's got them all stitched together like some kind of quilt.
- I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
- And I told you the facts!
This guy drives an old brown truck... and it nearly killed us.
We saw him throw a body down a pipe... that dumps into the cellar of that old church.
This guy must have 500, maybe 600 bodies down there... and I've seen them!
Stuck up on the walls... like some psycho version of the Sistine Chapel!
What, you don't believe me?
Drive out to the old church if you think I'm lying.
No one's saying you're lying.
Good, because I'm not lying!
Look at this from my point of view.
This is a pretty big story you're laying on us here.
That's your car out at the pumps, isn't it?
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.
The man there at your car.
He was standing there at your car... sniffin' that laundry... holding big handfuls of it under his nose.
Looked like he was liking it, too.
Which way he run off, Binky?
Still think I bumped my head?
He had time to get to the church, then back here.
This guy is after us!
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.
And now he even knows my name.
Central, this is 037. Come back.
You interested in a hand print?
037, go ahead, please.
037, this is Central.
Go ahead.
You can dust that, right? Get a print?
Looks like somebody already did.
037, what's going on out there?
037, I need a response, please.
There is definitely some weird shit going on.
This is Central.
037, that is an affirmative.
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.
What is your situation?
037, please respond.
How'd he get to the church and back to the diner so fast?
What the hell was he doing with your clothes?
He drives fast, but not that fast.
Maybe he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.
Please come back, 037, out there on East 9.
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.
You sure that's not a couple of little pyromaniacs... you're escorting out there?
Go ahead.
This old church is on fire.
I'm talking burning out of control.
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue, but I can tell you... no one's going inside this thing for a long time.
Incest capital of the world.
Don't be such a snot.
Don't tell me you actually like him.
Who?
Please.
I thought the waitress had dialed the wrong number.
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.
Like the missing link.
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class for show and tell.
In sports, the national...
"Jeepers..."
- That's the song!
- What's the matter with you?
The words are the same.
"Creepshow, where did you get those eyes..."
What is the matter with you?
That's the same song that lady on the phone was playing!
These kids say the vehicle chased them doing over 100, go ahead.
A preliminary came back on that dust you took off the car handle.
It's dead skin.
Long dead. That's why it was powder.
Say what?
That's it! The words are the same, listen!
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those weepers."
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.
She was playing this song to us, and she said if we heard it...
This is it.
037, come in.
Are you okay in there?
037, this is Central. Come in.
Trish?
I said hello!
Get back in the car.
Central, this is 04...
Get back in the car, Trish!
What is that?
I'm not seeing this.
What is he doing?
Go.
- I'm trying.
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!
Come on, you're gonna kill us!
I mean it, slow down!
Slow down!
No way.
- There's a phone.
- So?
- So you just told me to stop.
- I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."
- How far's the next town?
- You mean the next phone?
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.
I mean it, come on.
- You don't wanna get help?
- Help from who?
We'll just use the phone.
- And call who?
- I don't know.
- And tell them what?
- I don't know.
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...
"who pulls tongues out of severed heads with his teeth.
"Is there a special extension for that?"
Come on.
Christ, do you think they even have a phone?
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.
Who are you?
I said, "Who are you?"
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.
- What do you want?
- A telephone?
I don't have one.
I say we keep driving till we see people.
What do you think she is?
What you need a phone for if I had one?
I need to call the Pertwilla County Police.
Pertwilla?
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.
Don't even think about bringing the cops out here... with their zoning crap.
They try to tell me how many cats people can have.
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.
You can tell them that for me.
Please, someone's been killed.
Killed, you say?
Yeah, a policeman.
Holy Jesus, I thought...
I thought you meant one of my babies.
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Let's get out of here.
You can call the Sheriff's station, just don't give them this address.
And tell them to go out on the interstate where they ought to be.
My babies don't like strangers.
How many babies do you have?
More than a couple.
We've gotta get out of here right now.
Tell me this happens all the time.
Holy shit.
You kids got anyone else with you?
What?
That's not my scarecrow.
You got 10 seconds... to get your ass out of my yard!
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.
- Get the hell away from him.
- What are you doing, Trish?
Get the hell away from him!
Come on. Let's go.
No. Don't you go up there.
- Listen to him!
- We gotta get out of here!
What the hell did you bring into my house?
Get out of here.
Get away from my babies, you sons of bitches!
I'll blow your fucking head off!
Hello?
- Something's wrong.
- Don't say that!
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!
- Unstick them, Trish!
- You're gonna break it!
- It's stuck in reverse!
- Go in reverse!
- What do we do?
- Hit him.
Hit him, Trish.
Hard.
Do it!
What the hell is that thing?
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, you son of a bitch.
That's right, walk that ugly face right over here.
Come on.
Come on!
Do you think he's dead?
They never are.
Enough.
Let's get out of here.
Trish.
I don't know how much further this car is gonna go.
Not far enough.
Roach.
What are we boosting tonight?
Why don't you come over here and find out, Big Daddy?
'76 Chevy Nova?
Anyone tell you, for a car thief, you got taste for shit?
Would you tell Dad to stop shouting, please?
Mom!
I understand that, Mother.
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.
Because we'll be home before you could get here.
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.
Mom, just let us get home, okay?
We don't wanna be out here any more than you do.
Me, too.
I'll talk to you in a few hours.
Dad.
Thought I wrecked the car?
She's trailer trash.
- Pig fucker.
- Booger eater.
Trisha?
Trisha and Darry, right?
Jez, what are you doing here?
Excuse me, Jezelle?
Darry.
Darry Jenner.
- Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
- Come on. They've been through a lot.
- Trisha.
- Goddamn it, Jez.
I really need to talk to you, if you could just spare me a minute.
Jezelle likes to think she's the resident psychic here.
She helped us on a missing persons...
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?
You go home, turn off that police scanner, and go to bed.
You got missing persons and a fire in the next county.
Go do something useful.
I mean it, now, leave them alone.
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.
You don't have to believe a word I say.
But I've come a very long way to see you.
You know...
I'm not sure we should be talking to anybody right now.
Let's go.
You found all those bodies... down in that cellar.
I saw them, too.
How?
Dreamed it.
I dream a lot of things.
You see the cats yet?
I saw you with all those cats, too.
The diner.
That was you. You called us.
Will you excuse me for a second?
- Darry, I need to talk...
- I need you to listen and not talk.
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew that telling you this would do any good.
Any good?
What does that mean?
Every 23rd spring... for 23 days... it gets to eat.
Eat?
You know what it eats, and don't you make me tell you.
You think I like having this in my head?
I don't.
I don't like knowing this and not knowing why I do.
You said it eats?
Only certain things... from certain people.
Just get away from her.
It eats lungs so it can breathe... and eyes so it can see.
It all becomes a part of it.
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.
It dresses like a man... but only to hide that it's not.
You hurt it out there on the road... but only as much as it can be hurt.
'Cause it can keep on eating... till it isn't hurt no more.
You've got something it likes, one of you.
And it's not gonna stop chasing you till it knows which one.
How?
Never mind how.
How does it find out, by running people off the road?
It needs to scare you.
There's something in fear, something it can smell.
Something that tells it if there's anything inside someone... that it might like.
You're telling us this thing is out driving down the highway... trying to freak people out so it can smell them?
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?
Hello?
We got lights and phones out up here!
Would somebody talk to me?
It's gone.
We ran it over till there was nothing left.
What the hell, have we got emergency lights or what?
People, we're going into a lockdown situation.
That means everybody sit tight.
Don't move unless somebody wearing a badge tells you.
We pounded it to dust.
We watched it blow the fuck away.
I think it's eaten too many hearts for its own to ever stop.
Heads up, gentlemen.
Let me see some skin.
Are you in a coma, buddy?
What is wrong with you, man?
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.
That is special. I love you, too.
Heads up. Move it, down there.
Thank you for joining us.
Show me some skin, that's it.
Heads up, gentlemen.
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?
We're putting you in a holding room.
You can't do that! He finds you in here!
He finds you hiding in a room!
You, too.
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those peepers?"
- We heard it in the car hours ago.
- No.
It's playing on an old phonograph.
Escort Jezelle here to the big blue Winnebago... she's no doubt blocking the driveway with.
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those eyes?"
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.
I hear it playing while one of you is screaming.
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.
Screaming the last scream you'll ever scream!
Goddamn it, knock it off!
What exactly are you doing here?
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.
I repeat, an 11-99.
This is Tubbs, go ahead.
We got a situation down here, Sarge.
It's headed towards you, up the rear stairs. You copy?
Coming up the rear stairwell.
Stay here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on, I said!
Somebody down there talk to me.
We have one inmate and one officer down.
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.
The son of a bitch tried to take a bite out of him.
He what?
This guy is wearing something.
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch, but we cannot take him down.
What do you mean, "wearing something"?
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.
This is about the weirdest fucking body armor you've ever seen.
Where is he?
- Talk.
- He's gone.
He's gone, Sarge.
This guy just climbed up the fucking wall.
You are not making one goddamn bit of sense.
You can put me in a straitjacket, but this fucker is gone.
Gone? What the hell you talking about?
This guy's a real mover and a shaker, Sarge.
We just lost him on the stairwell.
I can't see! I can't see!
He's heading right up to you. Copy?
Shit.
This is your way out?
These must lock automatically if the power's out.
You didn't know that?
I don't dream everything!
This isn't everything!
This is our way out!
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.
We have to get out of here now.
There's no other way except the front...
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?
I thought if you knew what I saw, maybe you could change it.
Why the hell do you think I'm here?
You know.
Don't you?
You knew when you walked in.
You know who it wants.
- You know what it wants.
- I've dreamed this.
You know what's gonna happen.
You will run up the stairs and hide, but I don't know what happens to me.
Jeepers Creepers.
Jeepers Creepers, right?
Who?
Who hears Jeepers Creepers while screaming in the dark?
Are they ever wrong?
I don't believe you.
You don't understand.
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?
You go to hell.
I said, "You don't understand."
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?
She doesn't know.
She doesn't know shit.
Get upstairs!
Now!
Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be Thy...
What in the holy name of God?
Take me.
You don't want him.
Whatever you want, you can take it from me.
You don't want Darry.
No, you don't.
Don't you be a hero!
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!
Please, let him go.
Trish, please don't do this.
Just think for a second.
I won't fight you. You can take me.
I'm stronger. You want me.
Drop him.
Let him go and take me.
You let him go!
Darry!
Your folks just pulled up outside.
You never answered him.
Are your dreams ever wrong?
Darry screaming in the dark while that song is playing.
What did that mean?
What did you really see?
I'm just a crazy old woman.
You ask anyone around here, they'll tell you.
That's all I am.
Just a crazy old woman... with crazy dreams.
Turn to your right.
That's it, sir, you're done.
Please follow the orange line.
We processed the film we found in your bag.
They're not very pretty pictures.
Also, you left the camera in the hotel.
We processed that roll as well.
- Can I see them?
- That's not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish, this is evidence.
Do you guys have your own lab, or do you have to send it out?
We have a lab.
Your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so.
You don't have to talk to me until she gets here if you don't want to.
You know that, Sy?
Good.
- Sy, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.
What was it about William Yorkin that upset you so?
I mean, what did he do to provoke all of this?
Family photos depict smiling faces.
Births, weddings, holidays...
Happy birthday!
Children's birthday parties.
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
Someone looking through our photo album
would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence
free of tragedy.
No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.
We're gonna go.
- Sure you don't need my help?
- Yeah.
- Sorry, kiddo, I gotta work.
- Doesn't matter!
- I'll get takeout for dinner, okay?
- Okay.
- See you.
- See you.
- Jake, are you coming, or what?
- I'm coming!
- There's one.
- Okay.
Can I look at toys?
For a minute. I'm just dropping off some film. Make sure you can see me.
Okay.
- Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
- Hey, Yoshi, how are you?
- How have you been?
- We're doing good, thanks.
- Got three rolls today.
- Okay.
- Can I get the address?
- It's...
326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.
I'll take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?
Two rolls, and I think I've got one in here as well.
Can I have two prints of each, please?
Leica Minilux.
That's a very nice camera.
Really? Will's trying to get me to go digital...
Don't do that. I'd be out of a job.
- You have one shot left.
- That's okay.
- It's a shame to waste it.
- It's fine.
No, please, I look horrible.
- How's Jake doing?
- He's great.
He just had a birthday, and...
How old is he, nine?
- That's right, he just turned nine.
- Nine.
There we go. Got a winner.
Thanks.
- When do you need these by?
- Can I have them today?
We close at 7:00 on Sundays.
Well, it's not important.
I can swing by tomorrow.
You're one of our best customers.
I'll have them for you by the time we close.
- Thank you so much.
- No, problem.
- I'll do some shopping.
- See you in 40 minutes.
- Thanks, Sy. Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Jake.
You sliced through an exposure on that last roll.
Yes, Yoshi, I know. I made a mistake.
Mrs. Levitt has a problem, offer her a free roll of film.
All right.
I've been doing P.O.S. mini-lab work for over 20 years now.
I consider it an important job.
When houses are on fire,
what's the first thing people save after their pets and loved ones?
The family photos.
Some people think this is a job for a clerk.
They actually believe that any idiot attending a two-day seminar
can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour.
But of course, like most things,
there's far more to it than meets the eye.
I've seen the prints they fob off on people at the Rexall or Fotek.
Milky, washed-out prints.
Too dark prints.
There's no sense of reverence for the service they're providing people.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I see someone had quite a birthday party.
I did them 5-by-7 for you.
I wanted them 4-by-6.
The larger ones are better.
I didn't charge you extra for them.
It's okay, I guess.
- How much do I owe you?
- $30.06. But let's call it an even 30.
All right, thanks.
- We have a gift for birthday boys.
- Really?
That's right.
Birthday boys get a free camera.
Jake, what do you say?
Thanks.
You're welcome, buddy.
We're taking Jake to Six Flags, so...
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you.
- Come on, Jake.
- Bye.
See you, Jake.
- What a cool camera?
- Yeah.
Good night, A.J.
That's just great.
Look, this is a great shot.
- Nice truck.
- I remember that.
- You guys are so cute.
- This is a funny picture.
That is so sweet.
This one's going into the trash.
Oh, my God.
Look at your face, that's classic.
- I need that back.
- You're not getting it back.
- I'm serious.
- Don't give her it.
- Better give it to her.
- No.
She's serious. She's serious.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Told you.
How'd this one get in here?
- Oh, that's Sy.
- Sy?
- Sy the photo guy.
- Sy took it to finish off the roll.
Great. Now we have a picture of Sy the photo guy.
All right, guys, it's so past your bedtime, come on.
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks, just the check's fine.
- What you got there, family photos?
- Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?
These are beautiful. That's a good shot.
These your relations?
- Yes. That's my little nephew, Jake.
- He's a handsome boy.
Isn't he? Yeah, I got him a camera for his birthday.
- You must be his favorite uncle, then.
- Oh, I don't know.
Sure I can't get you no more coffee, then?
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.
- Have a nice night, now.
You, too.
Mom?
What, pookie?
I feel bad for someone.
Somebody at school?
No.
What do you mean, you feel bad?
When someone seems sad, they don't have any friends and people make fun of them, that makes me feel bad for them.
Who is sad and doesn't have any friends?
- Sy.
- Sy?
- The photo guy at the one-hour place?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.
But, Jake, we don't know that Sy is sad.
We really don't know that much about him, you know.
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.
And he probably has a girlfriend and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
I don't think he does.
That is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that, you know.
Listen, Jake, not everybody is as lucky as we are.
You know?
But maybe if we send them good thoughts,
it'll make them feel better.
So why don't we close our eyes and send Sy some good thoughts?
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
There.
I bet next time we see Sy, he won't seem so sad.
Okay.
- You have to go to sleep, pookie.
- Okay.
I love you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There you go. Come on.
How do you think we pay for all this? I'm just asking you.
You think a money fairy slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
- What are you even talking about?
- All of this stuff.
The new Mercedes, the matching washer and dryer, the fucking Jil Sander blouse you have on now. How?
I love you, Nin, I do.
But if you want our life to look like something out of a magazine,
I'm sorry, I've gotta work to make that happen.
Do you even believe what you're saying?
This is not about things, Will.
And it's not about money.
You're neglectful.
- Do you understand that?
- What?
You're an emotionally neglectful husband.
And you're an emotionally neglectful father.
- Got it now?
- That's fucking great. Neglectful?
You're not here, Will. You're not here.
You're never here.
I'm going to bed.
If in your mind...
Ban', what's wrong with you?
Oh, my God! Someone's trying to kill me!
Oh, wait, it's for Bart.
Who'd wanna hurt me?
I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.
It's probably the person you least suspect.
That's good, Dad.
Monday is our busiest day.
People shoot most of their pictures on weekends.
The store has several regular customers.
There's Mrs. Von Unwerth, who only takes pictures of her cats.
I've never seen a picture of a human being. Just cats.
Two copies, please, Mr. Parrish.
There's Mr. Siskind. Mr. Siskind is an insurance claims adjuster.
He only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.
The usual, Sy. I need these by 3:00.
We get all the new parents, which makes up a big part of our business.
New parents go photo-crazy.
I don't know how many rolls I have here.
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby cosmetic-surgery clinic, is a regular.
We do all the before and after shots.
Thanks, Sy.
Then there's the amateur porn artists.
We have to report kiddie porn and animal cruelty.
But anything else, no questions asked.
- How many prints do you need of these?
- Just one set is fine.
- Sy, are you kidding me?
- What?
I've got three of these fucking machines down today.
I've gotta be in Heber Springs by 3:00.
Larry, all I'm asking you to do is look at these prints.
Plus .3? Sy, are you fucking kidding me?
Point three? Nobody cares until the shift's in double digits.
It's blue, Larry.
Well, I'll bet Brandt cares about a plus .3.
Are you fucking threatening me?
You're breaking my balls over a plus-three blue shift?
Fucking asshole.
Next time you call me out here, that thing better be belching fire.
That's a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work!
What the hell you doing?
Excuse me?
What was the deal with you and the Agfa guy?
I'm preserving a level of quality for my customers.
Your customers.
He thinks that a plus .3 shift to cyan is insignificant. It's massive.
Sy, let me try and explain something to you one more time.
You need to look again at your place on the food chain.
These aren't your customers, they're Sav-Mart's.
If you haven't noticed, this isn't Neiman Marcus.
People come here with their kids for a good time and to save on paper towels and socks.
If they wanted to see yelling, they'd stay at home.
It was wrong to create a scene in front of customers. It won't happen again.
Sy, don't you have some vacation time saved up?
I guess I probably do.
You should take some time off, go down to a Club Med.
You know, relax, lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.
I'll think about that, Bill.
Your lunch break ended a half-hour ago.
What the hell you been doing in here?
I'm trying to figure out if this will work with my Mac.
I'm sorry. This isn't my section.
- You're Will Yorkin.
- Yeah?
Sy Parrish. I'm the photo tech here.
I do all your family's pictures.
Oh, right. Sy the photo guy.
Right.
- Here you are in the flesh.
- Yeah.
It's just I don't see you in here too often.
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
Can you help me with this?
This is computers. I do photo finishing.
It's not my section.
I'm in a rush and I had one question
I needed answered.
- No problem. I'll get someone.
- Thanks.
Customer needs immediate assistance, aisle four.
Customer assistance, aisle four.
- Someone will be here soon.
- Great.
You got it.
So is the rest of the family here?
Jake's around here somewhere.
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.
I'm sorry?
You have a wonderful family.
And if you don't mind my saying so, a very beautiful house, too.
Well, thank you, Sy. I appreciate that.
I really need to get this stuff and get the hell out of here.
I understand.
- Thanks for all your help.
- Oh, it's okay.
- You say hello for me.
- I will do.
I gotta get back.
There'll be someone here in...
There you go.
Great. It doesn't say if this will work for a Mac.
No. This is PC only. We have some Mac-based stuff down here.
- Jake!
- Hi.
I was just talking to your dad.
- What do you have there?
- Evangelion.
Neon Genesis Evangelion.
What does he do?
He's a good guy, he can fly and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys.
- Really?
- Yeah. And he's 60 feet tall.
- You really want this, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...
- Jake.
- No more toys, we're leaving.
- Gotta go.
- I'll put this back for you.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- See you later.
I told you not to talk to strangers.
I'm sure my customers never think about it,
but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time.
The shutter is clicked,
the flash goes off,
and they've stopped time,
if just for the blink of an eye.
And if these pictures have anything to say to future generations,
it's this:
"I was here."
"I existed."
"I was young. I was happy"
"and someone cared enough about me in this world"
"to take my picture."
How much for this one?
Most people don't take snapshots of the little things:
The used Band-Aid,
the guy at the gas station,
the wasp on the Jell-O.
But these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives.
People don't take pictures of these things.
You really have to tidy up your room, pal.
I'll bet your mother's told you a thousand times.
Hey, Chaz.
It's a good game.
- Hi, Sy.
- You said you were going out today.
Uncle Sy.
Can you help me put this together?
SY'. How many prints would you like?
Just one set.
Maya, that's a very beautiful name.
Thank you.
- Have you picked up prints here before?
- Maybe once, a long time ago.
Your face looks very familiar.
You work around here?
Sort of near here.
- I've probably seen you at the mall.
- I'm in here pretty often.
We're backed up today. Is 6:00 okay?
I won't be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day.
- See you then.
- Thanks.
Come on! A little hustle.
Here we go. Right there.
Come on.
Good shot. That's the way to strike the ball.
Get in front of those, son.
Jake, visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
Good one, Jake.
Jake, that's not good enough.
We have to work on that.
Pay attention, fellas. A little focus.
Drill it in there, Matt, come on!
Good shot.
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can't make it, tell Derrick.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hi.
Tobey, you forgot your sweatshirt.
On my way home, I saw you out there.
I thought I'd check it out.
- Jake. You all right?
- Yeah.
Is your mom picking you up?
No, I got my bike.
It's a great shot you made.
Your coach was a little rough.
He should be more supportive.
- Want me to have a word with him?
- That's okay.
- I will.
- No, thanks.
Okay.
When I was your age,
I wasn't very good at sports.
I was kind of a chubby kid.
Let's face it. I was fat.
I was sick all the time.
Kept coming down with mono and hepatitis.
Then I broke my collarbone and had a weird cast that kept my arm up like this all winter.
I wasn't exactly the most popular kid.
How'd you break your collarbone?
I fell out of a tree.
- How's your dad doing?
- Good.
- Does he come to see the games?
- Yeah, sometimes.
Does he come to any games?
He's really busy at work.
I don't know, he's busy all the time.
Sounds like an important guy.
I guess. He owns a company and everything.
Probably wants you and your mom to have nice things like that cool bike and those soccer shoes. Hold on.
Those things cost money.
He'd be here if he could.
I guess.
I got something for you.
Wanna guess what it is?
What's wrong? It's the one you wanted.
Mr. Parrish, I can't take this.
Sure you can, Jake.
My parents wouldn't let me.
I'd better be getting back home now.
- You sure?
- Yeah, thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.
- See you around the store.
- Okay.
- Hey, Jake. The name's Sy.
- Okay, Sy.
Well, there's been, like, some kind of shift.
I don't know.
A couple of weeks?
Maybe five weeks.
Six.
No, I know that, but...
Yeah, but this feels different, you know?
Listen, Jan, I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back this afternoon.
Okay. I know. I love you, too. Bye.
- Hi, Sy.
- Hi, there.
I was at the Dairy Queen.
I saw you and thought I'd say hello.
- I'm just grabbing some shopping fuel.
- I never see you away from the store.
- You'd think we'd run into each other.
- Why, do you live around here?
I live downtown.
- Well, that's quite a drive.
- No, I'm used to it.
- You have a nice boy there.
- Oh, Jake. Yeah.
A little sensitive, maybe. He likes you.
He calls you "Sy the photo guy."
I've known him since he was this big.
That's right. You've been doing our pictures for a long time.
You know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."
Well, I've got some serious shopping to do.
Oh, sure.
Take care.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
It's so weird. I'm reading that exact book right now.
You're kidding.
No, I can't believe that you'd be reading that book.
He writes a lot about noticing coincidence, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.
That thing he says about fear...
"The things we fear the most have already happened to us."
I had no idea you were such a deep thinker, Sy.
I wouldn't say that.
- Do you have any children, Sy?
- Me? No. No, I'm not married.
- No girlfriend?
- No.
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.
- She looks very nice.
- She's passed away.
Oh, well...
I'm sorry, Sy.
Gosh, you know, I have to go.
- It was really nice chatting with you.
- It was nice chatting with you.
I'll probably see you soon. We can't go a day without taking a picture.
Lucky for us.
- Okay. Bye, Sy.
- Bye.
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.
Sy to the manager's office immediately, please.
- What's with the getup?
- It's Wednesday. I was doing the SRS.
There's been some discrepancies in the click count.
That's Yoshi. His math skills are weak.
I told you that when you moved him.
The discrepancies are on logs you initialed.
- They are?
- Yeah.
I guess sometimes at the end of the week, you get a little tired...
We're not talking a few innocent math errors.
The net-clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.
The problem is the shut-down clicks don't correspond.
They don't come close to matching the amount of prints we've sold.
Then it's probably the reorder counter.
- Well, I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?
He looked at the counter and said that it checked out.
Also, in 14 years of servicing, he's never seen a faulty counter on an Agfa.
Really?
The question is, where did all those unaccounted-for prints go?
What's the discrepancy, Bill?
We're talking hundreds of prints, Sy.
That's not possible, Bill.
I've done the math.
The P.O.'s confirm it, too.
I don't know anything about it.
Well, I think you do, Sy.
Well, I don't, Bill.
Look, Sy, I've got a family.
I'm not losing my job over this.
I'm letting you go.
No.
These discrepancies would be enough, but you're spacing out, taking 90-minute breaks, creating scenes,
- giving away free merchandise.
- What?
Free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
Sure as shit isn't company policy.
- You can't do this.
- It's done.
I talked to Sims at district. Finish out the week and clear out your locker.
If you do something like fuck up the prints...
I haven't fucked up a customer's prints in 11 years.
Just get back out there.
Hey, Sy.
Sy?
Jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed.
I'm sorry?
The camera?
Right. The birthday gift.
- Number of sets?
- Just one is fine.
4-by-six, 5-by-7?
The ones we usually get.
Standard.
Jake had a great time with the camera, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What was that address again?
It's 326 Serrano Terrace.
Sy, are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'll have these for you tomorrow.
All right. Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm leaving early today, Yoshi.
Okay, Sy.
I won't be coming back, Yoshi.
Bill let me go.
- You were fired?
- Yep.
- Really?
- Really.
I've really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.
Yeah, me, too, Sy.
Sy?
Sy, I just wanted to...
I guess I just wanted to say thank you.
For what?
For teaching me all this stuff.
You're welcome, Yoshi.
- Don't let the place go downhill, okay?
- I won't, Sy.
- Here they are.
- My pictures. Let me see.
Come on.
Come on.
What the hell's wrong with these people?
The universe grows smaller every day.
There must be security for all, or no one is secure.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence,
this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.
Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection.
But we do have a system, and it works.
Your choice is simple:
Join us and live in peace
or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary,
the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808
by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.
He noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day
was taken by snapshot,
meaning a hurried shot, taken without deliberate aim.
"Snapshot," then, was originally a hunting term.
Can I help you?
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.
- I can still shop here, can't I?
- No, you can't still shop here.
I believe I can.
There's no law that says
I can't shop here because I was fired.
- I checked.
- There's other places to do photos.
There's no reason to come here other than to fuck with me.
There's a good reason.
I calibrated that machine personally.
It's the best mini-lab in the state.
All right, Sy. Just this one time.
But find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.
Thanks, Bill.
What is it? You can't just leave your station unmanned.
- You need to see these, sir.
- Is it the anal sex fiend again?
Motherfucker.
What was Mr. Parrish's demeanor when he came in?
- Demeanor?
- Yeah.
How did he seem? Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
- I don't know, he seemed fine.
- Sy and I had words when he came in.
I was surprised to see him, and asked him what he was doing here.
I suggested in strong language that he bring his pictures somewhere else.
I need Xerox copies of this.
- Can you show me where I get that done?
- Yeah.
Mr. Owens, why don't you grab a seat and try to calm down?
Your wife and child, they're somewhere safe now?
They're at my mother's.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.
No, no, no, no. I understand.
It's understandable.
So how did he take his being fired?
I've fired a lot of people.
People get upset when they get fired.
He got pretty upset.
He knew Mr. Araki would show the photos to you and that you'd call us.
I think it's just a warning.
- You have to take it seriously.
- We take it very seriously.
Your child's life was indirectly threatened. We take no chances.
There's an APB on him.
Officers are en route to his home with a search warrant.
I have officers inside the store and out.
He may come back and pick up his photos. He may not.
It's hard to say. I doubt he will.
Is that a good idea?
This place is wall-to-wall families.
If he's stupid enough to come back, he'll never make it inside the store.
Are you insane?
Mr. Parrish? This is the police.
If you're in the apartment, we need to know right now.
Kill that TV.
Mr. Parrish!
It's clear.
Officer Lyon. Double 6, 321.
Go ahead, 321.
I need to be patched through to Van Der Zee in TMU. Right away.
321, that's a 10-4.
Hey, Dan, take a look at this.
What do you got?
Y-O-R-K-l-N.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't find that name registered.
Could you try a Maya Burson? B-U-R-S-O-N.
Let me check that for you, sir.
- I'll ring that room for you now, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
- Hello. This is room service.
Sorry to bother you, but we have your order ready.
We need to know if you'd like coffee with that.
Will, did you want coffee?
No, just the drinks.
And this is for room 217.
No, we're 511, right? We're 511.
511. Oh, my gosh. I must be looking at the wrong thing here.
I'm sorry. We'll have it up in just a minute.
Okay. Thanks.
Hotel operator.
- Room service, please.
- One moment, please.
Room service, this is Jon.
May I take your order?
Jon, this is Will Yorkin in 511.
We've decided to go out for lunch.
I'd like to cancel our order.
No problem. That was 511?
Right. Thank you very much.
You're welcome, Mr. Yorkin.
- Yes?
- Nina Yorkin?
- Yes.
- I'm Detective Van Der Zee of the Threat Management Unit.
This is Detective Outerbridge.
Threat Management? Is Jake all right?
Everyone's fine. We actually need to speak with your husband.
Will's at work. What's this about?
You mind if we come in for a minute?
No. Sure.
- How can I help you, sir?
- Hi.
I need a room. But not too high a floor.
I'll check, sir.
Yes, we can offer you 313.
Anything on five?
I'll check, sir.
DUANE'. Will Yorkin's office.
It's Nina. I need to talk to Will.
He's not in. I'll have him return when he gets back.
Duane, get him on the phone immediately. This is an emergency.
I'll try him now. I'll put you on hold.
No, Duane...
He's trying him right now.
Where's your son?
He's at his friend Eric's house.
It might be a good idea to have
Eric's mother drive him home.
Oh, my God.
- Mrs. Yorkin?
- Yes, Duane.
There was no answer, but I left him a 911 page. He'll call you...
I know he's fucking Maya Burson.
I don't care about that now.
I just need you to tell me where he is!
I want a glass of water.
Get it yourself.
Room service.
Can you just leave it outside the door, please?
No, ma'am. I'm afraid you have to sign for this.
Just a second.
You. Get on the bed.
Get on the goddamn bed!
- I've got plenty of cash in my pants...
- Shut up!
Close the drapes. Close them!
Good.
- Who said to do that?
- I closed the drapes.
- To wrap a towel around yourself?
- No.
Let me explain what's going on here.
I tell you to do things.
Then you do them exactly like I tell you.
I'm gonna tell you this one time and one time only. You got the picture?
Yeah.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
Good. Now, get on the bed.
No!
Jesus.
Am I talking to a brick wall?
Did I tell you to touch her?
- No.
- I don't want you to touch her.
If you touch her again,
I stab you in the heart.
Proceed to Deerfield, the Edgerton Hotel, Hunter Valley Road.
TMU officers en route to scene.
- Can you ring the room again?
- I'll try one more time.
Now, missy. You have to take the robe off.
No.
I'm not asking, I'm telling.
Off!
She can do it!
The person in this room is not available.
Please leave a message...
What's this? What's this?
Can't you stop your sniveling?
This is supposed to look like fun.
Okay.
No touching!
Smile.
You have to look like you're having fun, like it's a game.
Come on!
Smile!
Wipe your nose. You look disgusting.
Now. Put his thing in your mouth.
Don't do it!
Pretend. This is all pretend!
I'm doing it! Stop yelling at me!
- You're not doing it the right way. Like this!
- No!
No!
- Mr. Belmer?
- Yes.
Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge.
We spoke earlier.
Right. So, what is all this about?
- Any word from Miss Burson yet?
- No.
Have you seen this man?
- He checked in about half an hour ago.
- What room?
I put him in 519.
I need a pass key. Now, please.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door?
The retinal implant is a microelectronic prosthesis that can reverse the effects of retinal degeneration.
We owe a...
James.
Let's find Yorkin.
Check 511.
Bravo? Where is it? Where is it?
It's the rear kitchen access.
It's in the back, rear kitchen access.
Miss Burson?
Police! Freeze!
William Yorkin?
Drop the bag!
Do it!
Put your hands on top of your head.
Miss Burson?
I just took pictures.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you...
Outerbridge? We got him.
The attorney present during questioning.
If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed...
Dad!
Are you married, detective?
You have any children?
- I'll be the one asking the questions.
- I know. Just one question.
Are you a family man?
- That's none of your business.
- You're right. It isn't.
It is none of my business.
But I'm guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are.
And that makes you a very fortunate man.
I can also tell by the way you've treated me and the way you do your job, you're a good man.
A good husband and father, a man who appreciates his good fortune.
You're not the type of father who'd cheat on his wife, hurt his family, betray their trust.
You would never neglect and abuse your children.
Make horrible demands of your children.
You would never ask...
You would never ask your children to do things...
Things that children shouldn't do.
You would never take disgusting, sick, degrading pictures of your children doing these things!
You would never treat your children like animals.
Will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
He is not a good father.
Well, I...
I think I understand now, Sy.
Thank you for answering my questions so candidly.
You're welcome.
Can I see my pictures now?
Sure, Sy.
Thank you.
There are an estimated 8 million people in the five boroughs of New York.
12 million in the greater metropolitan area.
There are almost 10 million telephone exchange lines.
Over 50 phone services.
3 million New Yorkers are cell phone users.
It used to be a mark of insanity to see people talk to themselves.
Now it's a mark of status. And speed dial is quickly replacing the drop of a coin.
Despite increased usage of cellular devices...
... an estimated 4.5 million residents and 2 million visitors...
... still utilize pay phones on a regular basis.
This is the telephone booth at 53rd and 8th...
... perhaps the last vestige of privacy on Manhattan 's West Side.
It is the last booth of its type, still in regular operation.
Up to 300 calls daily originate here.
This location has been burglarized
41 times in the last six months.
Verizon has scheduled this structure to be torn down...
... and replaced with a kiosk as of 8 a.m. Tomorrow.
Hardly two blocks away...
... meet the man who is to be the final occupant of that booth.
Donny. Donny. Donny, listen to me.
I said I'd get you magazine coverage, and I'm getting you in a magazine.
Look, you gotta trust me.
No means yes to these people.
Get "What's Up?" magazine on the line.
Yeah, I heard you.
Donny, I got "What's Up?" magazine on the line.
They wanna know about you, so I'm hanging up.
This is Erica or Lars.
I can't tell the difference.
- You got Stu.
- We said no.
I didn't hear you, so I'm giving you a second chance.
- We don't do magicians.
- Magicians?
Donny G is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel.
"- The New Guys" is offering him the cover.
"- New Guys" wants him?
And I haven't told my client, my favorite client...
...that I am making this call, all right?
He wants "New Guys."
I want you and I can make him come around...
...but you'll lose us if I don't hear from you by end of business.
Get "New Guys". Tell him "What's Up?"
Is offering a cover.
Okay. Big Q.
Adam, I know three people looking for dog walkers. That could be you.
"Sit. Stay. Don't worry, Fluffy,
I'll clean your shit and wipe your ass."
- You got Stu.
- What's up with my party, Stu?
I was just telling my assistant to get my favorite client...
...on the phone, and here you are. Nice.
Listen. Seriously, we gotta look at a new night for your release party.
There are two premieres, a fundraiser.
All the happening places are booked.
If we move the date...
Voodoo on you-do, motherfucker, from Big Q to Big Stu!
- Big Q, be reasonable.
- Motherfucker, I'm a gangster!
- I don't gotta be reasonable!
- You're cutting out.
Next time I'm gonna kill your cracker-ass if you keep talking about me like that!
Right?
N.Y.P.D. Blue, 11 o'clock.
Stuey, the hardest working
PR guy. How's business?
How many times I have to tell you, Wyatt? I'm a publicist.
- Tickets.
- Tickets.
Four for Britney Spears, right?
You put the "Ho" in show business, Stuey.
It's Stu. What do you got for me?
They just checked Mrs. Sharp into Bellevue again.
- Page Six. Tell Britney I send my love.
- All right.
Enjoy the show.
Hold on a sec. Page Six, this is Lana.
Bless you. Lana, it's Stu Shepard.
Bless you.
- Is it you or your boss calling?
- It's me.
I'm looking for some mutual back-scratching.
You get my privileged N.Y.P.D. Blue info and I get you to save my ass.
Not now, Stu. I'm a sick woman.
This is going to make you feel better.
Tony-winning producer Jeffrey Sharp tossed his wife back into drug rehab.
Nice. What do you want for that little tidbit?
You better be nice to me while I'm on the way up and taking your calls.
The higher the monkey climbs, the more you see of his ass.
Have a heart, Lana.
Listen, today my half-wit assistant faxed you regarding my favorite client.
Great singer, about to turn great actress.
- Another little Miss Tits and Ass?
- Look, I'm on cell, no names.
That was strictly in-office information.
You didn't print it, did you?
- I got it.
- All right, tell me Richard didn't see it.
He didn't put it in the column?
Stu's on the phone, scared he's gonna lose his job.
His office sent you something by mistake. He wants it.
You tell him T.F.B.
Put that at the top of the column.
- Stu, it ran, sorry.
- Yeah?
- Oh, God. Oh, no.
- I'm really sorry.
Yes!
"What's Up?" magazine offered Donny G a photo in "What's Hot and Happening."
- Fuck them. Make them sweat.
- He's on a conference call.
He could take a while. Yeah, can he call you back? Okay. All right, bye.
- Pretty smooth.
- Thank you.
If you can absorb everything I teach you...
...focus and get a new wardrobe, you can make it big in public relations.
- I got a sense.
- Cool. Cool. Cool.
- Up, T?
- How you doing, man?
Mario's!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Not so fast, Stu!
How come you run every time you go past my place, huh?
- Because I'm busy, Mario.
- Yeah?
Well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
One lousy mention in the "Post", you expect to eat for six months? No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.
- Stu.
- No, I couldn't. My clients would kill me.
- What hip party?
- It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
- There'll be local TV coverage...
- Nine and 11.
MTV, BET, VH1.
But I promised other clients, people who actually pay me.
- No, you owe me.
- It's gotta be the night of the 18th.
Toss in a buffet for 80 people, record company will pick up the booze...
...and I will deliver you celebrities.
Anything you want, okay?
Expand the menu, wallpaper those bathrooms, for God's sake.
You only get one shot with celebrities.
Thank you. Thank you, Stu!
- That was fucking brilliant.
- Listen.
Call Big Q. Tell him we got him the hippest place in town on his date.
- Call "What's Up?"
- Yeah.
We'll take their offer.
Messenger a bottle of Jameson's to Lana at Page Six...
...with a note saying... Write this down.
- Got it.
- Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu.
- "Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu."
- All right, no harm being gracious.
- Yeah.
Okay. Actually, better off, deliver it over yourself.
- Get to know the players.
- I'll do that.
Thank you for teaching me.
- And, Adam, don't you have a suit?
- Actually, no.
Here. Get yourself one.
- I'm gonna start paying you soon.
- Yeah, I hope so.
- You got a bunch of messages.
- I'm late for a meeting. Hold them.
- All right.
- All right.
- See you, Stu!
- See you, Adam!
- Excuse me.
- I'm trying to make a call here.
This is for you. Half-pepperoni, half-mushroom, extra crisp.
You ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don't think so.
Gentleman occupying phone booth,
53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
It's a mistake.
What am I supposed to do with the pie? It's all paid for.
There's a homeless guy around the block.
Give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can't make it go away."
He'll think I'm trying to poison him.
They always get that idea.
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?
That language is uncalled for.
Holy shit!
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.
Fuck off.
Here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself.
You look like you could use a good meal.
Hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
Why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
- Well, it's quitting time, right?
- Thank God, we were mobbed today.
So how's your day?
It's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
Who's the most famous person you publicized today?
- You.
- Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
And I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...
...and my favorite client, you.
You didn't really do that.
First step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
There are a couple of people and a few martinis I'd like to introduce you to.
- Stu, I...
- Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.
It's about time we talked about your career. Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
We're doing a scene from "Jerry Maguire."
I'm playing Renée Zellweger's part.
That's great. Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...
...but I guess I can reschedule it back.
- Are you mad?
- Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
- Look, Stu...
- What?
Big kiss.
You too.
- Yeah.
- Isn't it funny?
You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...
... but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
What?
I hope you realize how you've hurt my feelings.
- Who the fuck is this?
- Don't think about leaving that phone.
- Wrong number, pal.
- It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
You're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.
Naturally, this is part of the gag.
The pizza bit. That was funny shit.
Well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.
- What's coming next is I'm hanging up.
- Oh, no, you won't.
- You're going to learn to obey me.
- Obey you?
- Who is this?
- Someone who enjoys watching you.
Watching me?
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today.
Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.
Where...? Where are you?
There are hundreds of windows out there.
Why don't you check them out?
- So, what am I doing now?
- You're scratching your head.
Now you're brushing your hair back.
That's not very nice, Stu.
Did you call me Stu?
- Who's Stu? I don't know any Stu.
- Why, do you prefer Stuart?
A lot of people in this neighborhood know me.
Stuart Shepard, 1326 West
51st Street, Third Floor, front.
- Go mind-fuck some other guy, pal.
- I know Pamela McFadden too.
It's not in your best interest to disconnect me.
Someone could get hurt.
What's the matter, Stu?
If you're some fucked-up, failed actor I wouldn't handle...
...or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
You will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...
...and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren't one already.
Do you hear me?
Am I upsetting you? Hello.
Oh, you think I'm gonna, what?
Pay you off or something?
- Tell me what you want.
- Now you want to talk to me.
Did Adam at my office put you up to this?
No, I thought this up all by myself.
Keep thinking. I'm hanging up.
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you.
Talk to you later.
What the...?
The callback feature cannot be activated...
Motherfucker.
- Tell me what you want.
- I want your complete attention.
- Are you an actor?
- Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.
- It's tough when you're not known.
- Tell me about it.
You don't have to hunt me and crush me.
I can't get work in this town as it is.
I've done some off-Broadway, some off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
Now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.
I'm a walking cliché.
I can help you.
I can get you auditions.
Auditions? You're not an agent.
You're a publicist.
Yeah, but I have contacts.
I know agents. I can get you an audition.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, there is someone
I'd like you to call.
Name it.
Try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?
Lucky you then, because I wrote it down.
I can see every number you pressed.
Let's see if Pam is still at work.
- No.
- Then I guess I'll have to do it.
- Look, don't!
- Too late. It's already ringing.
- I'll put her on speaker so you can hear.
- You're fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
- Hello.
- Well, hello, Pam.
- Hi, who's this?
- It's a good friend of Stu's.
- And he hasn't got many.
- You know Stu?
I know he lies.
- Who is this?
- Don't worry about that.
Stu's listening in. He can hear what we're saying about him.
- Stu, is that true? Are you there?
- Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
She can't hear you, Stu.
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you.
- What do you mean?
- Don't do this.
- Stu has been lying to you.
- Pam, hang up.
Now, why would a man who has a cell phone...
... call you every day from a phone booth?
- Because he said it's quiet.
- Pam, that's just stupid.
It's because his wife checks his cell phone bills.
- No record of his calls to you.
- Jesus Christ.
- He said he wasn't married.
- Oh, he's married.
Her name is Kelly. I've never seen her but she sounds lovely.
Why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?
- Cheap rooms for cheap girls.
- Asshole.
He's telling you all this so you'll sleep with him.
- He's lying, Pam. Don't listen.
- I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn't planning on sleeping with him.
I just don't know a lot of people here right now.
And he's cute and he said that he would help me.
- You never asked me if I was married.
- He's never made anyone a star. Bye.
Hello?
Back to you, Stu.
Gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
- Go away.
- Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.
This motherfucker, you don't eyeball me. Bitch.
Why are you doing this?
Did I ever harm you? Did I...?
- Now, let's call Kelly.
- She's not home.
Oh, but I'm sure she's at the shop on Columbus.
How the fuck do you know all this shit?
Speed dial her. Press "auto one."
That's her button.
- What am I supposed to say?
- Why don't you try the truth?
- You're cheating.
- I'm not cheating on Kelly. I never have.
- Then what do you call it?
- Look, you're a guy...
...sometimes you want to know it's a possibility.
It's like having a beautiful home...
...but you still dream of that quick vacation.
You know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
It's just a fantasy.
You never leave home.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
- I'm sure they'll both appreciate that.
- Fuck you.
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.
You can't take up the whole booth.
This here's my business.
This is not the only phone in New York.
It's the only one on 8th Avenue that's working.
- Bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost.
- Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get...
Goddamn it, man! You done made me hurt my dick hand.
I'm sure you're just as good with the other hand. Yeah, go away.
I'll be back, motherfucker.
I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!
I was worried for you. I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.
Whoever you are, you're obviously a very intelligent man.
I know what stress does.
It's all I can do from going crazy myself.
- You're calling me crazy?
- No, you're going through a difficult time.
Look, please don't call my wife.
Let me give you my office number. We'll talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
Stu, do you really think that I'm an actor?
I'm not an actor.
I have no use for you, Stu. None.
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.
So are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?
- Or do I have to?
- No!
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.
Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
- Hello.
- Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
- Stu?
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- I'm in a phone booth.
Baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you'd be calling me...
...from a booth to tell me something important.
There's a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
- Tell her you invite women...
- Shut up.
... to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I'm not talking to you, baby.
Someone's got company.
- Who's that woman?
- Bitch got a cell phone!
- Some hooker is trying to use the phone.
- He just called me a hooker.
- Are you sure there's nothing wrong?
- We are escorts. Escorts.
Tell her you want to sleep with other women.
There is this person and he's saying things about me.
Things that might not be true.
And if he calls you... Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
Honey, I want to sleep with other women.
Look, Kelly, whatever he says, don't believe him.
- I haven't done anything.
- Only because Pam had to rehearse.
Shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're scaring me.
I'm sorry, baby.
Can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
- I feel kind of weird.
- Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.
- Come on!
- Yeah, bitch!
- I love you too.
- "I love you."
Get out of here before
I have you deported to Jersey.
- You're a fucking ass!
- And you're a dirty skank.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Your mama is a skank, bitch!
You didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?
And you can tell she really loves you.
Must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.
Why screw up her life?
She never did you harm.
Everybody does harm.
That's it. This mind-fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
What are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
I never said I had binoculars.
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.
Now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
What? You mean like a rifle?
A.30-caliber bolt-action 700 with a carbon-one modification...
... and a state-of-the-art
Hensholdt tactical scope.
- And it's staring straight at you.
- Yeah, how's my fucking hair?
At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
Nice try, pal. Go to hell.
Now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
I love that.
You know, like in the movies just as the good guy...
... is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
Now why didn't he have it cocked?
Because that sound is scary.
It's cool, isn't it?
Look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.
Do you hear me?
There will be cops all over this block.
Do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.
That won't help you.
Three.
Stu, look at everybody.
Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
Here come the cops.
Sniper on the roof.
Gunfire, hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
Stand up and be a man.
So do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
No, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.
- Shall I take care of him?
- No! No. Shit, no.
It would be so easy.
Here.
Here.
Stu, you just gave that gentleman
$ 10 to walk away.
You saved his life.
You do have a sensitive side.
- How much to let me go?
- Let's see how sensitive you really are.
I'm aiming at you right now.
Can you feel it, the heat of it?
Come now, Stu, you can feel it.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Take a look at where I'm going.
You're doing so much better than the others.
You read about the German porn king shot 10 days ago...
... at 38th and 8th?
He thought he was an artist and wouldn't admit he was just a pedophile.
Believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.
You must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 10th.
What you didn't read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...
... just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.
Now if he had been willing to make amends...
... share the money, things might have been different.
Please, tell me, where am I aiming now?
- Below the shoulder.
- Which one?
The right shoulder.
- Love to love you too, baby!
- That's phenomenal, Stu.
You're doing so much better than the others.
What do you remember about those killings, Stu?
I don't know.
Well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu. Try.
- They got shot. I don't know, all right?
- Okay, I'll give you a hint.
Wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.
Because they weren't robberies.
They were executions.
They didn't have to be.
What did I do to deserve this? Why me?
If you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.
- Right here. Shit. Come on.
- Jesus. You, in the booth.
- Come on.
- Now what?
You got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
- Hey, look at me.
- Look, I hear you!
Look me in the eye.
Hang up the phone and walk away.
- Don't do it.
- I got my own problems.
I'm your problem.
You know why?
My girls keep yapping at me,
"Leon, he won't share the phone."
"Leon, he told us to fuck off."
"We're gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone."
- I'm trying to run a fucking business.
- I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.
No, you don't understand me.
I got the G-string union here.
They're breaking my balls.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
So I'm saying this once, nice, all right?
Hang up the phone. Walk away.
- He did say it nicely.
- He got a cell phone up in there too.
- It ain't even like he need a phone!
- I can't get off the call!
Shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit?
It's like nails on a chalkboard.
They ain't gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
- I'm getting a fucking headache, pal.
- All right. I'll pay you to go away.
I don't want your money. I want you to hang up the phone and get out.
- $ 120. It's all yours.
- Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
You're gonna give me $ 120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
- Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
- Something ain't right with him.
Look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
- This one sick mother we started with.
- It's probably catching too.
- Yo.
- He's got AIDS.
- How long you want to rent the booth?
- Indefinitely.
- Indefinitely?
- Yes.
Do I look like a asshole?
Let me tell you something.
- $500 gets you indefinitely.
- Wait up! Hold the fuck up!
How come he's defying you, huh?
What, you got bitch in you now?
- Did I say shut the fuck up?
- Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?
- Do you need help?
- Look, I'm handling it.
- Come on!
- I can help you, Stu.
I wasn't gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
I would take off if I was you.
He gonna kick your ass.
- He gonna kick your ass.
- Get the fuck out!
Can you get out of here?
Will you go away?
- He looks very angry.
- Come on. I, look...
- Hang up.
- Get rid of him.
- Hang up the phone!
- We can work this out!
- Get rid of him!
- Hang up the phone.
I got a watch.
It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.
Yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
You got five seconds to get off the fucking phone. Five.
- Batter up.
- Four.
I can stop him.
Three.
- Just say the word, Stu.
- Two. One.
No, no. Don't. Don't.
Fuck.
This will count as a hang up.
I can make him stop.
Just say the word. Can you hear me?
- Yes.
- What?
Yes!
- Whose street is this?
- That's right, baby.
Oh, my God.
Baby, you bleeding?
You must've cut yourself...
- What's wrong?
- You cut yourself.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Baby? Leon? Leon!
- He was fucking shot!
- Oh, my God!
- Motherfucker!
- He's shot!
Leon!
Somebody call an ambulance!
- Call 411!
- 911, dumb bitch!
He ain't breathing.
Call the meat wagon!
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shot him.
- Why'd you fucking shoot him?
- You said, "Yes."
"Yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him!"
You ought to be more careful with what you say.
Oh, my God.
- Motherfucker, why?!
- It wasn't me!
- Where's the gun? Do you see a gun?
- Fuck you!
You pumped one into him, bitch!
I saw it! He's got a Glock!
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Daddy got a Glock!
What Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock!
It's a telephone!
You shot my man, daddy!
They gonna skin and fry your ass!
You shot my baby, daddy!
Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!
Please, come on! Come in here, bitch!
Better run, motherfucker!
The cops is coming and I hope they fry your ass down!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
If you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.
Look, I offered him money.
I offered him my watch.
But not your respect, which is what he really wanted.
You were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.
You are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.
I'm not guilty of a goddamn thing.
Take responsibility for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.
I love this fucking spin. You shoot the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?
Well, looked that way from up here.
I don't know what I did to you but whatever it was, I'm glad.
I wish it had been worse.
I wish you died!
- Yes, finally some honesty.
- Just tell me who you are.
No one you'd ever notice.
I don't run in your circles.
- And what is it you do?
- I watch.
- You watch?
- Yes, well, what else is there to do...
... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
You look out your window.
You see people come in and out of this phone booth. The same ones every day.
You make up names for them.
You imagine their stories.
But eventually, you get tired of imagining and follow one of them.
And you hear all of his lies.
And you decide that his sins should be punished.
Some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self-importance isn't gonna notice me.
But I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.
And I noticed you, Stu.
- I'm flattered.
- Operator 553. What is your emergency?
Will you please respond?
What was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
The Stu Show. "Better than TV."
Look, how'd I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
You had it made.
Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once. I followed her to her restaurant. Lovely.
Life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.
But it appears you don't appreciate it.
Look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.
I may look confident, but I'm really, actually just crying out for help!
Help! You know?
I'm trying to help you, Stu, but you won't help yourself.
- Fuck.
- What's the matter, Stu?
- You shot me!
- It's time you learn, Stu.
- Deception can't go unrewarded.
- Deception! What fucking deception?
"Are you in need of immediate police or medical response?"
Shit. You bugged the fucking booth.
That's how you knew.
That's how you knew about Pam.
- You picked the wrong person to lie to.
- Look, I didn't pick you.
It must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
I get fucked on account of my clothes?
That why you killed Leon?
I didn't kill Leon because of the way he dressed.
And those other two guys as well?
Did they dress too nice?
You must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.
All right, here come the cops.
What are you gonna do? Run?
No, I'm not a coward like some people I know.
- You can get away if you run now.
- You'll blame me for Leon.
No, no, I'll confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
Well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
Take a look at your chest. You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.
Kill me now, and you give yourself away.
Not with a silencer.
It would take these guys...
... the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.
You can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.
Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, what if they open fire?
They won't. Look around you, Stu.
Do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
The ones hoping the cops will blow you away...
... so they can sell the tape
"to" The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
Don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.
So long as you don't take hostile action, you should be safe.
Safe? You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.
With both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
If we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
You won't because there isn't any!
Put down the phone and raise your hands!
Look, I can't.
I'm on an important call.
Verify this information for me.
The guy in the booth shot that guy over there...
...and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that's what the hookers are saying.
All right, give me the horn.
- Sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply.
- I'm busy, all right. Come back later.
- Very good, Stu.
- Step out of the booth...
...and raise your hands.
I am giving you an order.
I give the orders here, Stu, don't I?
This guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
Suicide by a cop?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Get that body out of here fast.
Somebody get the body.
Tell the ambulance to get the body.
Thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body...
... in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.
Look at these guys.
You can smell the fear.
- Ten cops.
- This reminds me of Nam.
- Vietnam?
- Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but I've seen pictures.
Well, pictures can't do it, Stu.
You can't imagine the fear, the stench.
Napalm-charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.
- Then you got blamed for the war.
- I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
Look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...
...inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...
...and, you know, one that everyone understands.
And I think cops are on the side of vets.
You are pathetic, Stu.
Why don't you wake up?
Napalm-charred bodies?
I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!
Stop fucking with my head, please!
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Shouldn't we wait on the ESU negotiator?
They could take 20 minutes. I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.
I'm gonna handle this.
Sir! I'm taking out my weapon.
Putting my weapon down on the car.
- The captain's going in.
- I'm not armed.
- Yeah, neither am I.
- My name is Ramey.
- Captain Ed Ramey.
- All right.
- What's yours?
- I don't want to be friends.
I don't know. It looks like you could use a friend right now.
- Tell him you've already got a friend.
- I already got a friend.
Is that who you're talking to on the phone?
Look, I just want to hear your side of it. That's all.
I ain't got no side of it, and I didn't shoot anybody.
You see a fucking gun anywhere? Look.
It's in your back pocket!
I see it! He been...
Sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
No. I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.
Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
- You want to see it? Here.
- Hey!
Don't reach for that! Hold your fire!
I don't need to see it.
I know what's there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
They didn't see it because it didn't happen!
- Shut them up!
- He's dead, but it didn't happen?
- Then who did it?
- Mustn't tell him, Stu.
- I don't know.
- You were the closest one to him.
- You must've saw it happen. Help me.
- No.
- This guy is getting on my nerves.
- Look, stay the fuck out of this.
Who do you keep talking to on the phone?
- Nobody.
- Your friend, your parent, your lover?
- Who?
- Careful, Stuart. Careful.
My psychiatrist.
- Excellent. I should've thought of that.
- I see. What's this doctor's name?
It would be really helpful to us if we knew.
He says not to tell you, all right?
It's privileged information.
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.
- Yeah, whatever you fucking say.
- I respect your right to privacy.
I've been through therapy myself.
The department provided it for me.
I know it's not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...
...you know, circumstances, stress...
I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.
Tell him not to come any closer.
Don't come any closer. Stop there.
Go back a few steps.
- Go back to where you were!
- Okay. No problem.
- That's right.
- So you got some intimacy issues.
I got those too. All I want to know is, what happened, man?
- Tell him to read you your rights.
- I want you to read me my rights.
Stop asking questions.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
All right? So now, can you at least give me your first name?
- Just your first name.
- Don't tell him.
It's my right not to have any first name.
- No gun, no name.
- That's right.
- You're highly underprivileged.
- Demand your lawyer.
And go get my lawyer too. All right?
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
- Just brilliant, Stu.
- I understand that, but...
...it's gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.
- Once you hand over the gun...
- How can I?
You won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
We'll take it out for you.
All you have to do...
...is step out with your hands raised.
Nothing will happen to you.
- It's not gonna work.
- Stu, Stu.
- What?
- Ask him a question.
Ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him.
- I... Fuck. I can't do that.
- Oh, sure you can, Stu.
Ask him if he couldn't get it up, if he couldn't satisfy her.
- Are you gonna step out of the booth?
- I can't. No.
- You're not stepping out of the booth?
- Ask him.
- Is that a no?
- Ask him!
- Both your lives depend on it.
- Sir?
Captain, you couldn't satisfy your wife sexually?
- Excuse me?
- Ask him if he abuses himself now?
- Does he masturbate on lonely nights?
- Fuck. For God's sake!
Say it!
Say it or I will blow him away!
- So do you whack off now?
- Hey!
I'm gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
- Yes.
- Just relax.
- Stu, I think you hurt his feelings.
- I wanna know who's on that phone.
I want a techie here. I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
Do you think we went too far, Stuart?
Should we give ourselves up?
Maybe I'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.
- I'm sure we can work that out.
- I won't just spill my guts to anyone.
Could you get me national news?
I mean, you've got connections, right?
- Sure.
- Could you get Larry King down here?
Why the fuck would Larry King come here?
Because you're friends.
Who else could you get, huh?
Could you get Tom Brokaw?
How about Dan Rather? Diane Sawyer?
- Look, I, I, I don't know. They're busy.
- I, I, I busy.
How about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel?
Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?
Al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.
Face it, Stu, you're smalltime.
And you've got a credibility problem.
Don't fucking worry about my credibility! All right?
What about yours?
Look, it's our friends from channels two and five. Your local news, Stuart.
You couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
But me, I've made you famous.
Stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
- They're here to cover me dying.
- How ungrateful.
Those cameras will make the police very careful.
- So come on, smile a little for them.
- Can you tap into that phone call?
- Should be no problem.
- Except...
...we'll need a warrant if he's on the line with his shrink.
Fuck that. I'm not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
Look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
- As long as we don't listen in.
- Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.
All right? We get that?
I want somebody to find out what's going on.
Look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
You're the man, Stuart.
You're the center of attention.
Wait till this goes national:
ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
You're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I'll be forgotten about in a week.
No one ever remembers the names of the victims.
It's the killers that get the cover of "Time" magazine. Right?
Think about it. You'd be famous.
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
Name a victim. You can't.
Anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.
- It ought to be you they're covering.
"- That attention would embarrass me".
- I know exactly the spin to put on this.
- How terror inspires your creativity?
Listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...
...I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
That approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
Listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
You know, movie of the week.
Get America on your side.
All right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
You killed Leon to protect me.
All right?
In a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I'm your best witness.
So you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me.
Trust me.
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.
- Oh, shit. Here comes Braman.
- I'll take care of him.
Hey. Should've waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport.
Let you know if I need help.
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
Or do you want to leave this to a professional?
Until a professional gets here,
I'll handle it.
You're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.
Got it?
This is what I want to do, okay?
This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here.
And five sharpshooters up here.
See if you can get me two in the subway.
What the fuck?
- Not going to answer it?
- I can't. I can't reach for the phone.
- The cops will think it's a gun.
- I'll bet it's Kelly.
She's probably heard what you did.
She's sick with worry.
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am I?
Well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
You could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
You're in this position because you're not telling the truth.
I'm in this position because you got a gun!
No. Stuart, that is the sin of spin.
Avoidance and deception.
You're being given a chance here to make things right. Now, talk to her.
- Look, I can't. Please.
- I am telling you to answer that phone!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- You can't cross in front of here!
Answer it!
- Look, I can't. Please.
- Don't make me hurt you!
- Talk to your wife!
- It's not her calling.
- How can you be so sure?
- It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!
Damn, you got me!
You continue to impress.
You could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
- Yes, well, that's an option.
- Yeah.
- Captain.
- Yeah?
This lady says the perp's her husband.
Here's her ID.
- I couldn't believe when I saw this.
- Who do you think he's talking to?
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...
...that there was a man who called me.
- A man?
Did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no... It's not like that.
- I didn't even know who this guy was.
- Who's his psychiatrist?
- He doesn't have one.
- That you know of.
I've been with him three years, married for one. I'd know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been.
I saw somebody after my divorce.
It kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
- Look, Stu didn't kill anyone.
- Ma'am, under the circumstances...
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
'Cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...
...he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.
Captain?
If you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.
We're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
We've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
- Let me know when you're in position.
- Absolutely.
What about that wire tap?
We're working on it.
You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
- Yeah, no problem. No problem.
- Okay.
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.
- Does he like being called Stuart or Stu?
- Stu. Call him Stu.
Stu. Okay.
Come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
That's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.
- Stu!
- She's not my wife.
Are you okay?
- Can you just talk to me?
- Yes, talk to her, Stu.
Look, she's not my wife!
She's some fucked-up, failed actress
I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!
You aren't making this up?
You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph of us together.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Stu. Listen to your wife.
- She only wants what's best for you.
- She's not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
- We just want to know what happened.
- Yeah, very good.
Go home, you fucking lunatic!
You hear me? Go home!
Please don't make things worse.
Just come out.
Just do what they tell you to do.
Your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don't know her.
- That's an interesting match.
- Get her out of here!
- Enough. I don't want to agitate this.
- You out of your fucking mind?
- Come on, get the woman out of here!
- No. I don't know what's going on.
He's bleeding... We... We're fine.
This morning everything was fine.
You just stay here.
Just stay here, okay?
- Okay.
- I think she did some good.
- You got a number of that lawyer?
- No, we don't have a lawyer.
He asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
- Well, we never needed one.
- Well, you need a good one now.
Look, you'll do me best by staying near here. Okay?
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.
- I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
- Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
You know, get her some coffee or something.
You're gonna lose this guy.
You need some kind of redemption.
- What are you seeing a shrink for?
- Get the fuck out of my face!
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm not stepping down!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You'd think she didn't know she was being watched.
- What?
- But beautiful women always know.
- You talking about Kelly?
- That false indifference, superior air...
... it's just a tease.
They want eyes on them.
Why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
Not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
No, it's for somebody else to notice.
I notice.
What are you doing?
Stay away from her. Leave her alone.
I'm giving her what she wants.
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.
- Don't you dare fucking hurt her.
- Don't I dare?
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
What they can't know is what we do to them in our minds. Right?
- You sick fuck!
- The perfect violation.
- Leave her out of this.
- How many times...
... have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
Would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
That's it. Not another word.
I'm not talking to you.
Your choices put other people in jeopardy.
When are you gonna learn that?
This is funny. Stuart, look uptown.
These geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
Only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
There's no chance of a trap trace...
... so now they've gotta try some fancy
LoJack instrument. It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning your hopes on those morons.
Truth is, I'm on a wireless A.D.S.
With a cloned number.
It'll take a half an hour to find out
I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
And let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
We can't get a trace or break into the line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.
Still gonna give me the silent treatment?
Hello. Stuart, don't do this, please.
Come on.
My sainted mother used to do this.
She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me!
I can't take it! Stu, please...
I'm kidding.
I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there's our girl again.
I wasn't planning on killing her...
... but plans change.
Just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
Hello. There you are.
I thought I was talking to myself again.
Anything you want. I'll do it.
Just tell me.
Tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
- And then you'll let us go?
- Why not?
- Kelly!
- That's a start.
- Baby!
- Hold her back!
- Hey!
- Talk to me!
- Grab her! Keep her back!
- Yes?
I'm listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
- Every day.
- Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman.
And I called her and...
- I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to sleep with her.
No. I wanted to fuck her.
- Say it. Say it!
- And I wanted to fuck her.
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever you did, I don't care.
Please, just come out of the booth.
Okay?
That's all I did. That's all I did.
I'm sorry.
All right, I've done what you asked.
That's it. I've had enough of this.
I haven't.
- You said you'd let us go.
- I changed my mind.
You miserable fuck. You can't do this.
You can't do this to me.
Look, I took all your shit.
I did everything you fucking asked.
You lied to me.
I'm done with this.
I've fucking had enough.
You can go fuck yourself! Later.
- He hung up.
- Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
- I'm giving myself up!
- He's coming out!
- Heads up!
- I want to see you toss away your weapon!
Throw the weapon outside the booth!
Stay where you are!
- First, the weapon!
- Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!
- There's no fucking gun!
- Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?
- Please give them the gun!
- Kelly, no!
Get back! Kelly!
- Freeze!
- Get back! Get back!
- Get back!
- Okay! Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze! Don't move.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.
- Hold. Hold.
- Please.
- Go ahead. Answer it.
- What the fuck are you doing?
He's coming out!
Answer the phone.
- You fucking coward.
- Hi, Stu.
Now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...
... that I am willing to forget.
Get her back in the car!
I want her in the car.
If he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
Captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
- So can we start over?
- You lied.
You can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.
Sniper in one of these buildings.
I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
Start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and
I want you to do it quietly. All right?
Where's the ESU sergeant?
You said we could go.
- You said you'd let us go.
- Relax, Stuart.
Nobody gets it right the first time.
You've done better than others.
You will get a chance to end this.
- I'm just not finished yet.
- Yeah, well, I am.
- There's nothing keeping me.
- Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you've got one shot.
I'm gonna be dancing.
- You think you can get me?
- I could go for some target practice.
One shot, they look for you.
Second shot, you give yourself away.
Go on, Stuart, hang up!
Trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
- Cops can't prove I killed anyone.
- You had motive.
- No weapon.
- Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
No gun and I walk.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
Yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
Why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
What's up next to the florescent bulb?
Check it out, Stu.
Cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.
There's only one way to find out.
Look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
They're not gonna match a handgun.
I've seen enough cop shows.
Hollow points fragment on impact,
Stuart. There's nothing to match.
- Only there's no gun up there.
- Don't take my word for it.
See for yourself.
There are rounds left in it.
- I totally couldn't give a shit.
- Come on. Don't disappoint me.
Use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
With a big fucking smile on my face.
There's the spirit.
Now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
See the pink curtains?
There you go, Stuart. Yes.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Why would you do that?
Because it's fun.
The odds are even now, Stuart.
Isn't that what you wanted?
You know where I am, and you have a gun.
If you have it in you, you can take me down.
Fuck!
- They'd kill me before I got a shot.
- Oh, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
You would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.
Looks like someone watches the news.
- Who?
- The motel.
- Oh, God.
- I think she could use a new headshot.
- Don't!
- Then take down the gun.
- Look, this has nothing to do with her!
- She has everything to do with this.
You're here and she's here because you called her.
Now, take it down!
Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
- Take down the gun!
- Hey, everybody, get ready.
Hold on, hold on.
Let's just see what he does, all right?
Let's see what he's doing.
There's nothing there.
Nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
- Come on, Stu. Let's see it.
- Fuck, no! It's staying there.
Fine, then someone will have to take your place.
Come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.
- How do you figure?
- You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose?
One of them can take your place.
Don't do this!
You've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!
- It's true!
- But you lie to her.
It's complicated.
Then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault.
This is all my fault!
She's innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock.
Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.
- You decide.
- No, please!
Come on, Stu.
Don't you get the game yet?
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.
Blond or brunette? Time's running out.
You or them? Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?
Come on, Stu!
Stop this.
- I can't take this anymore.
- What are you doing? Get up!
- I was looking for my ring. Look...
- Get up, Stuart!
Stand up and be a man.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Captain! I got it. Listen.
The rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
All right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
You gonna let me take this over?
Tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
Everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.
- Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me.
- You can't do this.
Stu.
No more spinning, no more excuses.
What're you doing? Look, listen.
Listen, please listen to me.
No more delays, Stuart.
Look... I'm on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
Excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.
From up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
- Yes, I know that, Stuart.
- All right, and...
You could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
Shut up and stand up!
Look, why threaten Kelly?
You liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
Please don't hurt her.
Don't fucking hurt my wife.
This doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.
- Now, get up!
- All right.
Okay, how does this end?
Tell me how this ends.
The stage is almost set.
People are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
We got a sniper situation here.
What about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon.
I think it was a prank call.
He told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
How long will it take to get a record of her calls?
If he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.
Say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number.
I've been waiting for that number.
It was a guy.
He sounded like mid-30's.
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
- Please get back in the car.
- Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
- Want me to clear the streets?
- Yeah.
No, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
He's already got position on us.
Let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
- Hey, Jonah.
- Yeah.
Don't look up.
Get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
- You got it, captain.
- I'm gonna buy us some time here.
All right.
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
- I don't know.
- This guy is so lonely.
- All he wants to do is talk.
- You're walking through a bad dream...
... and you can't wake up.
- Now he's really testing my patience.
You wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues
I can't talk about.
- That your psychiatrist on the phone?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.
That was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
- It was liberating, right?
- Should've been.
Maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...
...I don't know, something would've turned out different.
Oh, please.
- Trust is the key. You trust me, Stu?
"- Get this man a seat on" Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues
I can't talk about.
Yes, lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.
Look, don't come any closer.
Hey, I don't wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.
I told you it's a private conversation.
What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.
- It's not.
- It's always, "Get out of the booth!"
I like it in the fucking booth!
All right? It's my world.
This is my booth, and
I'm not coming out. All right?
- Never.
- We're not gonna force you out...
...because there could be some miscalculation...
...and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be standing by...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...
...and we see what he was threatening people with...
We realize that it was just a little black Bible.
- Or a cell phone.
- Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call.
One lousy call...
That's enough, Stu.
- You got some bad news on that call?
- The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
- I've been falling ever since.
- I'm gonna push him over the edge.
Just say the word.
It's time to land.
- When you hit bottom, you die.
- I'm your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
If I tell you what you wanna know, you'll die too.
Exactly.
- I'm going.
- Good.
But, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
Your wife, she gave us the number.
And I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?
That's it. The captain gets a bullet.
Get out of here!
Hear what I said, asshole?
- Get out of here, go on, now! Go!
- Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
- Your sins have caught up to you.
- So this is all some religious thing?
That explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.
- Tell me what you want, then.
- What everyone wants...
... for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
Go for the gun.
- Kill myself?
- Yes.
It would be a rare, unselfish act.
- We got hostile action.
- Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
- Look, I can't find it.
- Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!
All right! Look, I found it. I got it.
- Then let's see it. Let everyone see it.
- The cops'll kill me.
Yes.
You're talking prime-time material now.
- All this shit just to watch me die?
- No.
To get you to do what's right.
If you wanna save yourself, confess.
- I already told Kelly everything.
- Everything?
No. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.
You look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
You should be fine.
- How're those techs doing? Anything?
- No, not yet. Not yet.
We haven't found your lawyer yet,
Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
Come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...
... and millions of strangers and me.
It's do-or-die time.
What, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
Not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...
...who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
Who spends money on Italian suits and dry cleaning...
...so people think he's important.
Who doesn't waste time being nice...
...to people who are of no use to him.
These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.
I've never done anything for anybody...
...who couldn't do something for me.
I string along...
...a kid with promises that I'll pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
I lie in person and on the phone.
I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies.
I should be fucking president.
I wear all this Italian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
My $2000 watch is a fake, and so am I.
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam.
Kelly, that's Pam.
- Somebody got a 20 on this Pam?
- Don't blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...
...she would've told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now,
I'm ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I've been dressing up as something
I'm not for so long...
...I'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.
But here I am.
I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
And, I don't wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
You deserve better.
- You're not gonna let me go.
- No.
You never were.
I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
Then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
- Right there.
- Yeah, got that.
Captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 17...
...at a hard line from the old
Barkley Hotel.
- You got a room?
Second window from the corner.
ESU units holding.
Bring them in from 52nd Street.
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
- ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd...
- Stu!
- Your lawyer's coming down now!
- Doors, fire escapes...
Now!
At least you'll die with a clean conscience.
No, you're the one that's gonna die!
Listen, you can hear them now.
They're coming to get you. Know why?
- Because I sent them!
- You can't stop lying, can you?
I can't stop lying?
They're coming up the stairs.
They're coming to get you.
Look around.
That room's getting smaller every second.
Inch by inch! You know what?
It's not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
- They're in position, in position.
- Get them to move!
- There's nobody there.
- There's nobody there?
They're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
You got a couple seconds left.
What're you gonna do?
If this is true, I have to take someone with me, don't I?
Since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I'll take her.
Then take me! Take me.
This is about me!
I'm the fucking one you want!
Take me!
This is about me! Come on!
Take me! It's me you want!
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.
We're too late.
The psycho heard us coming...
... and slashed his throat with a knife.
- What's his condition?
- Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.
Get him down here.
I don't want nobody dying on me.
All right.
- Kelly, where's Kelly?
- Your wife's fine, all right?
All right, try not to sit up.
- What hit me?
- Rubber bullet.
Figured if somebody's gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
- Did you get him?
- You did.
- I didn't do anything.
- Give yourself some credit.
Got yourself out alive.
Doesn't always happen that way.
- Are you okay?
- It's okay. I'm okay.
God. I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever gonna see you again.
Me too.
We've got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything.
Everything.
Get that gurney over here.
Get over here.
We lost him.
- I want to stand up.
- I got him.
- Sure you can hold on?
- I gotta see him.
- You don't want to see this.
- Yes, I do.
- Take it easy.
- Yes, I do.
- Allow me. Allow me.
- Go ahead.
You recognize him?
Yeah. He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...
...10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
That's enough these days.
Just give it a minute.
We'll be driving, and you'll be flying.
Whatever you say.
What a piece of shit.
Nice shoes.
Italian.
You hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
But I couldn't miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
You don't have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
Because it if doesn't, you'll be hearing from me.
Isn't it funny?
You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.
But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Hello?
You've sold us a bill of goods,
Gordon.
Promised new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer.
- We'll deliver everything we promised.
- I'm sorry, but the adventure is over.
We're exercising our option to liquidate...
...Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.
Jack, show these people how filthy rich we're gonna make them, please.
I don't think you understand what I just said.
Oh, I think I understand.
Jack.
Perrinia immortalis.
The Blood Orchid.
First described in 1892 by Houghton...
...the last person to see it until our team brought a sample from Borneo.
It lies dormant for seven years, then blooms for just six months.
Which means we just got lucky as hell, gentlemen.
Anyone here familiar with the Hayflick limit?
He proposed a cell could only replicate 56 times...
...before it died from a buildup of toxins.
According to him, it's the reason we die.
But what if we could transcend that limit?
That would be impossible.
Not according to our data.
Our research indicates the presence of a chemical in Perrinia immortalis...
...that can significantly prolong cellular life.
I can't support this.
Does that mean what I think it means?
Are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent...
...to the fountain of youth?
Exactly.
That'd be bigger than Viagra.
- Have you put this into human trials?
- We can't yet.
Our sample was degraded in the initial study.
We need more of the orchid.
See, and that's our only problem, gentlemen.
That orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks.
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get your asses down to Borneo.
Yes.
- Welcome to Borneo.
- Thanks.
- What's wrong with this picture?
- I don't know. Let me see, you're in it?
We don't have a boat, okay?
Your company had one responsibility:
Get a boat.
- And you've already screwed it up.
- Wait. Your girl chartered the boat.
Sam confirmed with the company.
They're waiting for your payment.
Hey. Hey, I've got something.
Payment cleared.
Really?
- Where's the boat?
- It's not coming.
All of the charter companies have shut down.
No one'll risk going upriver till after the rainy season.
- And when's that?
- Two, three weeks.
The orchid's only in bloom for one more week, tops.
There's a local captain named Jin-Soon.
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver, for the right price.
Are you sure this is the place?
They said the one with the red door.
I bet you somebody's playing
Russian roulette in there.
Maybe we'll get lucky and you'll get a turn.
Hey, why don't you two just get a room.
Come on, Sam.
Wait here.
Yeah, if you insist.
Hey! Hey!
Jin-Soon.
Jin-Soon?
Your Indonesian sucks.
- Stick to English.
- We heard you could take us upriver.
In rainy season?
Won't be cheap.
We can pay you 25,000.
- I'll have a talk with the captain.
- You're not the captain?
Jin-Soon!
These tourists need a boat.
I told them not in the rainy season.
- You're Jin-Soon?
- Local nickname.
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.
It's a pronunciation thing.
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.
Now, you want me to drive it, well...
...that'll cost you 50.
Fifty grand? Are you high?
You know what?
Don't answer that.
I'm not trusting him with the expedition.
Listen. Lady.
Let's cut the bullshit, please.
If one of the other charter companies could take you...
...you'd be on the river by now.
You only came to me because you're desperate.
Fifty grand's my price.
Take it...
...or leave it.
I've seen subway cars in better shape than this.
Yeah, she may be ugly...
...but she puts out.
- Shit!
- What took you so long?
Hey, you try getting a GPS locator, a Sat-Nav EchoStar...
...and a UV spectrometer past Indonesian customs.
- Complaining already.
- Yeah.
- You rather be back in the office?
- Hell, yeah.
I had courtside seats at the Garden on Saturday.
I was gonna sit right between
Spike and Woody.
Oh, man, is that our ride?!
Look at the bright side, Cole.
At least the weather's nice.
Ben Douglas, team doctor.
You must be Sam.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
Glad to have you aboard.
I'm gonna get you for this.
Oh, yeah. This could be fun.
You can forget about that, dog.
That's one car you ain't never gonna catch.
There's always a way.
- Your team's a little green, huh?
- My former grad students.
Best in their field.
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall:
You want the best young talent...
...recruit early.
Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.
I think I resent that.
You and the other gal can stay in here.
You live here.
The way you say that,
I can tell you're impressed.
All right.
If you need anything...
Well...
...if you need anything, you're shit out of luck.
Okay.
Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.
In the Selatan Basin.
- It took them three days to get upriver.
- Yeah.
That was before the rainy season.
These waterways could be dangerous now.
- You said you'd get us there safely.
- And I will.
But safe isn't always quick.
We'll work our way up one bend at a time.
If I don't like what I see, we change course.
Can't chart the fastest route before you begin.
Already have.
Check it. All right.
Now, we're uplinked in real time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.
Now, under ideal conditions...
...this is the fastest route.
But once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 10 years...
...and then extrapolate...
Bingo! It's Padrang to the Selatan Basin.
I'm a bad man.
We got less than a week to get to that orchid.
If you can't get the job done, give our money back...
...and we'll get somebody who can.
- I'll get you there.
God help me.
Something attacked me!
- Oh, my God!
- She said something attacked her.
No, no, no!
It's okay. It's okay.
What the hell'd you do?
You scared him.
I scared him?!
This is Kong.
Kong lives here.
You're guests.
Be nice.
Disgusting animal.
You okay now?
I'm fine. Just keep your hands off of me.
Oh, yeah. Well, it's gonna be tough, but I'll try.
No, no, the S-1 has to be on file before the week is out.
- That's the whole point.
- Hello?
- The S-1 needs to be on file before...
- Yes, we were able to get on the river.
That's the purpose. We need the comments from the SEC.
- Excuse me.
- It's the only place I can get reception.
- No, just get it done. Be ready to go...
- No, that's impossible...
- Hello? Hello? Damn!
- Hello? Bob? Damn it!
Try my phone.
Works just as good, but it's free.
Okay. Maybe you can use my special antenna to boost your reception.
We're dealing with a lithophytic vine, so we want to search any rock face.
Now, this ridge here seems a good bet.
Sam.
Come on, Sam. What do you say?
We're young. We're single.
We're in Borneo.
What do you got to lose?
Not satisfied, walk away.
No commitments.
"No commitments."
That's your pitch?
Did I say "No commitments"?
I meant marry me.
Am I gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
Yep.
So you were one of Jack's students?
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology.
Soon as I finished my dissertation, he hired me.
Well, that's one way to get a leg-up.
What's that supposed to mean?
I had a professor who wanted to hire me.
Of course, he wanted me to be his secretary.
Look, if I've done something to offend you...
No. No, dear, not at all.
Actually, I admire you.
Took me 10 years to get where I am.
Clearly, your generation has it figured out.
Man, this is good.
Where'd you learn to cook like this?
- Little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka.
- What were you doing there?
Doctors Without Borders.
It's my day job.
You guys expect to need a doctor?
Can't get the expedition bonded without one.
Well, you just think of me as a charming insurance policy.
Hey!
You've had your dinner.
Get out of here.
What'd I say?
There's not that much...
I'm not sleeping up there.
I ain't sleeping on the floor.
I ain't sleeping on no damn...
- Oh, shit. What was that?
- What the hell was that?
- Something's getting eaten.
- By what?
Everything gets eaten out here.
It's the jungle.
Kong.
Hey. You guys seen Kong?
No. Not since last night.
Where are you?
Kong?
We need those results by next month if we want the FDA off our backs.
Hello? Shit!
I can't hear you!
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
Can you hear me now?
- Can you hear me now?
- We can!
Can you hear me now?
- Gail! Oh, my God.
- Shit.
Stop the boat!
- I'll go.
- All right.
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?!
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!
Stroke, Gail, stroke. Come on.
- Watch your back.
- Hey, Gail! How's the water?
Drop the phone.
It's probably holding you back.
- All right.
- Stay calm.
- Stay calm.
- Use your phone for flotation.
All right, come on, Gail.
- You're almost there.
- It's just like a phone.
I got it.
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!
Come on! Come on!
- Get out!
- Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Come on! Come on!
- Gail, grab it.
- Look out!
- Watch out!
Oh, my God.
Get him, Bill! Get him, Bill!
Get him in the eye, man!
Bill?
Where'd he go?
- Where'd he go?!
- Bill!
I don't see him.
- Where's he gone?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, shit, you won.
- You're okay?
- I lost my phone.
Sorry to hear it.
That was either the bravest or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
It's a fine line.
- Good as new.
- Thanks.
To Gail...
...who knows it's better to eat than be eaten.
- To Gail.
- Yeah, yeah, baby.
Almost eaten just to find a flower.
- Hardly seems worth it.
- Oh, it's worth it.
I mean, think about it.
A pill that you take every day for the rest of your life.
Now, even if we charge, say, a dollar a pop...
...we're billionaires.
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- At $100 a bottle...
...I'll dive in that river and fight that croc myself.
So how many flowers does it take to save the world?
Figure 50 orchids will yield about an ounce of chemical.
You could have a football field full of those orchids...
...still doesn't mean you can get it through human trials.
She doesn't even believe in you.
Comes with the territory.
In research, you've got to go out on a limb.
And there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
Where the hell have you been?
- Damn that thing!
- Where you been, boy?
Calm down. Calm down.
- Poor guy.
- It's okay. It's all right.
Looks like he's seen a ghost.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
What if Gail's right?
I mean, cells in a petri dish are one thing.
- Human trials are another.
- She's wrong.
And when it goes to product...
...and you and I can cash in our stock options...
...we'll rub her face in it.
- Stock options.
I spoke to Mitchell.
We're each giving you half a point.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
You deserve it.
All this...
...wouldn't be possible without your work.
Jack.
Thought we decided against that.
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.
It would be fun, though.
I mean, here we are, traveling upriver...
...to the greatest discovery of our careers.
Now, if this orchid thing works out, then...
...who knows?
Is that why I'm here?
So you can give us one more try?
You're here because you're the best researcher I've got.
Am I interrupting something?
No. No, I was...
- I was just going to bed.
- Yeah.
Well, before you do that, we need to talk.
We got a problem.
See the water level?
In high water, the Mendranang gets rough.
We could turn around, try to find another course.
- But that would take at least two days.
- We don't have the time.
If the river becomes impassable, it'll take a lot longer.
And if we turn back, then we're definitely screwed.
We're gonna have to risk it.
What if I don't wanna risk it?
Do you have any idea what this flower means?
We're talking about the biggest medical discovery in history.
That does sound great, Jack.
But I was never any good at history.
You want me to risk the Mendranang...
...it'll cost you an extra 50 thousand.
Done.
Done?
You gotta ask the boss lady or something?
I'll pay it myself.
All right.
You got yourself a deal.
But if we hit trouble...
...your people do what I say, you got that?
You're the captain.
Research proposals?
Yeah. Research proposals.
You're not the only company we're in bed with.
We're the prettiest and most popular.
Like sleeping with the head cheerleader.
Not quite.
Come on, you know you love us.
I love your cash.
Then let me get a look at that file.
After this orchid thing goes bust, you'll be finished at Wexell-Hall.
Unless you got something else lined up.
You really wanna see us fail, don't you?
No.
I just think that you will.
I am a scientist, you know.
Scientist.
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?
I like science.
I just like money better.
I'll drink to that.
River's flooded.
We can't see the banks.
Miss our turnoff?
It's just ahead.
What the hell was that?
- Rudder's jammed.
- What?
Watch out.
Shit!
Get up! Everybody up!
Hey.
What's going on?
Goddamn it.
Shit! We've blown the head gasket.
Are we all right?
Hey, what's going on?
- What is it?
- We got problems.
- What's wrong, man?
- Bill, wait.
What are you talking about?
What problems?
Son of a bitch.
The current's too strong.
- We missed our turnoff.
- I know. Come on, baby.
Come on, man.
- What is it?
- What is it?
What do you see?
Come on.
You got this. Come on, girl.
- Everybody! Hang on!
- Hang on to what?!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Holy shit.
It's sinking, it's sinking!
- Where's Cole?
- Swim to the rocks, this way.
Keep going.
- Come on, get to the rocks.
- Get to the rocks.
- Where's Cole? Cole!
- Over there.
Over there! Over there!
Come on, man. Give me your hand!
Come on.
You got it, Sam. Come on.
Give me your hand.
I've got you, I've got you.
Give me your hand, give me your hand.
Okay, I got her.
You almost got us killed!
You almost got us killed!
You think I wanted this?
I just lost my damn boat!
You'll lose your pay if you don't get us out.
You said you'd get us there safely.
You should've turned around.
That's enough!
There's nothing we can do about that now.
It's a waste of energy.
What have we got?
Some specimen jars, a map, a little water, no food.
Hard drive's ruined.
Well, pretty much all the equipment's shot.
Except one of the SAT phones still works. It's on-line.
Thank God, we can call the police.
Police. The nearest river patrol is back in Padrang.
The only way to get to us is over that.
Are you saying we're stuck here?
Maybe not.
We're here.
The valley's completely flooded.
But I got a friend who operates a boat on the Tokut River.
I can give him a call, and he can meet us here at Naga Rock.
How far is that?
I don't know.
A two-day hike down the river.
But if we bushwhack, we cut at least a day off the trek.
Oh, my God.
You wanna go through that?
It's the shortest way.
We could be safely in the Tokut by nightfall.
So we can continue with the expedition.
- Yeah. I'll get you to the flower.
- I don't care about that flower...
...just get us to safety.
- It's the same thing.
We can either be on my buddy's boat in 10 hours, or we can sit here...
...and wait for the river patrol for days.
Your friend. Is he reliable?
Absolutely.
You better not screw me on this.
Sounds like you're already screwed, mate.
Pay you two grand.
I need you on this one, John.
Yes, yes, so it seems.
Look, Billy, I'd love to help you out, but I'm flat out, mate, you know.
Probably squeeze you in for, say, 5 grand?
You're killing me.
That's mates rates.
Or you could always...
...hike back to Padrang if you wanna save bucks.
- Up to you, pal.
- Fine. Five.
- Yes!
- But you better be there.
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife about that little trip to Bangkok.
Wife's long gone, Billy.
Long gone, mate.
All right, people, we're on.
Saddle up.
Stay together. This jungle is all green all the time, and you will get lost.
It's like doing a StairMaster in a sauna.
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke, but I'll have a nice tight ass.
That's the spirit, Cole.
- You want me to grab that?
- Is that a trick question?
Here, man.
Right between Spike and Woody.
Right between Spike and Woody.
You okay, Sam?
I'm fine.
See, a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders.
Yeah. Can see that.
What, that?
That's nothing.
I tricked him into taking my bag.
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your boat.
Yeah, well...
...it was a piece of shit anyway.
Can we go around?
Yeah, we could.
But we'd lose another day.
Let's go.
Shit.
Hey. Knock it off.
- Shit! What was that?
- What was what?
- Something just moved.
- Please don't say that.
I'm serious. Something moved.
"Something just moved" as in something's alive?
Shit! There it is again.
There's something in here!
There's probably a million things in here.
He's right. Just keep moving.
Stop it.
I swear to God, if you don't stop it...
Very funny.
Ben?
- Where'd he go?
- Shit!
Help me!
Run!
- What the hell was that thing?!
- Anaconda.
- Oh, great!
- There's snakes out here that big?
- Yes, but...
- But what? It swallowed him whole!
Calm down and listen for a second.
I can explain...
No, you calm down and listen!
Ben was eaten by a freaking snake.
- Okay? A freaking snake!
- Cole.
- Oh, God. Oh, my God. I mean...
- Cole.
Oh, my God, did you see that thing?
We don't got a chance against that!
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell.
Listen to me, man.
I watch the Discovery Channel.
I'm telling you, we got no chance!
We're like mice in an aquarium.
You understand?
I mean, we're gonna die, girl.
We're gonna die!
Cole, calm down. Okay?
- Okay?
- All right, Jack, I'm okay.
Okay. I'll just...
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna sit right here.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.
There won't be another one for miles.
We gotta get to the boat.
It's not that far.
So if we keep moving and stick together...
...we should be fine.
- We should be?!
How big do they get?
That was the biggest one I've ever seen by far. A freak of nature.
The odds of running into another that size are astronomical.
Yeah, but how do we know the one that got Ben...
...is not gonna come after us?
It takes them weeks to digest.
Meal like that, he'll be sleeping it off for a while.
Let's just get to that boat and get home.
What about the orchid?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It won't bloom for another seven years.
- This expedition is over, Jack.
- Now, hold on a second, Gail.
- There's a lot of money at stake here.
- I don't care. Ben is dead!
We have lost someone.
As Wexell-Hall's representative,
I am calling this expedition off.
- You don't have the authority.
- Check your contract.
We're in the middle of the jungle.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Jack, I'm with her.
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.
Look. Ben was my friend, okay?
I got him into this, and no one feels worse about it than I do.
I don't wanna do anything stupid.
I just wanna accomplish what we came here for.
If we turn back now,
Ben's death would be for nothing.
Let's just get back to the boat.
We can regroup and make our decision then.
Fine.
Jack.
- Maybe Gail's right.
- She's just scared.
Once we get back to the boat, she'll be okay.
When we get back to the boat, this expedition is over.
I'm taking these people to safety.
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.
Keep your money, doc.
Someone is dead.
We're officially in over our heads.
You said we wouldn't run into another one of them.
And we probably won't, but I can't guarantee it.
So I'll get you to the boat...
...and after that we're done.
Well, that answers it.
That answers nothing. I'll just throw more money at him at the boat.
If he doesn't take it,
I'll offer his friend the same deal.
- Jack. Maybe we should listen...
- lf we don't get to that orchid now...
...all of our work will have been for nothing.
I need your support, okay? You have as much riding on this as I do.
Don't let me down.
I saw this special on Animal Planet.
Anacondas are vicious.
They hunt for sport.
Don't even need to see you.
Just use their tongues to sense body heat...
Shut the hell up.
I knew this guy who knew this guy who shot documentaries.
He went to the Amazon with this crew, and they were all eaten by snakes.
Come on, you knew a guy who knew a guy, that's an urban myth.
I'm sorry about Ben.
I never should've stayed on the Mendranang.
What do you mean?
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others, but I thought you knew.
Knew what?
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river.
I told him it might get rough, but he wanted to risk it.
Hey. Don't blame him.
It was my call.
I took the money.
I thought I could get us through.
You wanna blame anyone?
You blame me.
These boots are killing me.
- Cole.
- What?
You got some...
Oh, God, what is that?!
Get it off! Get it off!
- Oh, my God! Take it off!
- Relax.
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on.
- Get it off me!
- Hey! Calm down!
- Get this off me!
- Calm down!
Cole! Cole! Calm down.
What is it? What is it?
- Get it off me. Get it off.
- All right. Look.
- Just a lighter. Just a lighter.
- Oh, hell no! You ain't burning me!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You burn me, I'll kill you.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- What?
- Hold on. Put your arms up.
What are you doing?
Why are you going under my shirt?
- What are you doing?
- Jesus.
What, what? What is it?
What is it? What is it?
Anybody got a blowtorch?
Stop!
Careful.
- What's it...?
- Lf that thing bit you...
...you would be lumpuh.
Paralyzed, like stone, for two days.
- What do you call this fella?
- Laba laba batu. Stone spider.
I may have discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.
Oh, no, no, no. Forget Wexell, we can get this to the highest bidder.
All right. Show and tell's over.
We gotta get to that boat.
Put your boots on and let's go.
Bugger it.
What the hell was that?
Holy bloody hell.
Whoa! What was that?
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
No, no, no! Oh, come on, man!
What the hell happened?!
Livingston!
Here we go.
He got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!
Your friend! Your friend!
Now what we gonna do now?!
Shit!
Search the wreckage.
Find anything we can use.
And hope to God there's a phone.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
- Come on, come on!
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?!
Hello? Shit.
Hello?
Come on, man. Hello?
All right, keep looking!
No phone?
- Nothing.
- Couldn't get a signal on the radio.
Now what?
What's going on?
Where'd these come from?
- Lopaks.
- Who?
Local tribe.
- Descended from headhunters.
- What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
- Headhunters?
- There's still some villages here.
- Must be one of their fishing spots.
- Hold on, excuse me.
Did you say headhunters?
There haven't been practicing headhunters in Borneo for a century.
Just because they ain't practicing don't mean they don't remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village, maybe they can lend us a boat.
So wait a minute. We just gonna walk towards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.
You mention food one more time...
...I'm voting you off this island.
Oh, God.
- Is that...?
- Livingston.
Oh, my God, man.
What the hell happened to him?
Anaconda.
If he was eaten by the snake...
...why is his body...?
- Listen, listen!
All right. These things are at their weakest when they digest.
But if threatened, they will spit up their food and attack again.
What? There's a snake out there with an empty stomach?
- Yeah.
- The same one that got Ben?
No. No. There's no way that snake could've gotten to Livingston.
- It had to be another one.
- You said there wouldn't be...
...another one for miles.
- There wouldn't.
- Unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless it's mating season.
- Oh, my God.
- Mating season?
- Yeah.
You see, the males are territorial, but when they smell a female in heat...
...they come running from everywhere.
Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit, and they all go after her at once...
...in one big mating ball.
So there's some snake orgy out in the jungle?!
Yeah. Something like that.
Look, we're losing the light.
All we gotta do is get to that village.
So please, pay attention.
Do not stray from the group.
Let's go.
Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.
Jesus.
I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen.
It was.
- Well, this one's...
- Bigger.
The males must've come through here looking for the female.
Some bullshit.
- They took their boats.
- Good for them.
Bad for us.
Which one's the Mendranang?
On the right.
The Tokut keeps going to the left.
- Fastest way to Kotabaru.
- How long?
You'll be soaking in a tub at the Four Seasons in two days.
How, man?
We don't even have a boat.
We're gonna build one.
Man, do that in my neighborhood, and that's your ass.
Shit.
Sam.
What does this look like to you?
My God.
Perrinia immortalis.
Now we know why these snakes are so big.
What?
Anacondas keep growing till they die, right?
And these are the biggest
Bill's ever seen.
- Because they're living longer.
- Exactly.
Because Perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain.
These snakes have transcended the Hayflick limit.
The chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted.
And not in theory, in the real world.
This is proof, Sam, of your research, carved in stone.
This is proof?
It's anecdotal evidence at best.
- Let's get to the orchid and find out.
- You are out of your mind.
Do you have any idea how close we are?
The orchid was found here...
...on the Mendranang, just around the next bend.
- We'll be going right past it.
- No, we won't.
We are going down the Tokut.
If we go down the Mendranang, it's gonna be a week...
...before we reach another village.
I'm not waiting that long for my bath.
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.
Jack.
Maybe you can just come back.
Come back?
In seven years?
What if it's not here?
What if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin?
Instead of the fountain of youth, we'll have a giant rice paddy.
This is our only chance.
You know it is.
Do you wanna give in when we're this close?
Look. You know
I got your back, right?
We've been in the trenches a hundred times together.
- But I'm not going in that jungle.
- Damn straight, man.
Thank you.
This is my expedition, and we're going to the orchid.
No.
We're not.
Don't be an idiot, Sam.
This is bigger than penicillin, for God's sake.
Lives will be saved by this drug.
People will live longer.
They'll stay young longer.
If we don't put this to human trials, it'll be a crime against humanity.
Two people have died already.
Scientists have always risked their lives to change the world.
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.
- We all knew the risks.
- We thought we did.
Until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs.
- What are you talking about?
- He offered Bill an extra 50 grand...
...to keep going, even though he knew it wasn't safe.
Oh, my God.
Is that true, Jack?
- I was thinking of the expedition.
- You were thinking of your career.
Look. You're my assistant.
I don't need to consult you!
I'm the one with the authority here.
We're in the middle of the jungle, Jack.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.
Thank you.
Okay. Keep it high.
Careful.
Center it right here.
All right.
What are you doing?
Never seen a man shave before?
Probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator.
Crocodile.
What's that mean?
That means "a new beginning."
It's Korean.
I got it when I was in the military.
What brought you here?
- Long story.
- Where am I gonna go?
All right.
Here's the deal.
I was in the Special Forces...
...and I saw and did things...
...that I wanted to forget.
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?
It's not very long, as stories go.
Yeah.
Well, I got out of the military...
...came here and bought the Bloody Mary.
Just wanted to start a new life.
Thank you, Jack.
On three.
Ready? One, two, three.
It works.
All right.
Let me explain.
Why in the hell didn't you tell me about this?
The minute someone makes a call...
...this expedition's over.
Exactly.
All I'm asking for is a few more hours.
We continue on the Mendranang...
...take our orchid samples, then we call for help.
Forget about it, Jack.
I'm getting us out of here.
Think about this, Gordon.
You're about to become a billionaire.
Do you really want to give all that up?
I don't care about the money, all right?
I wanna live.
It bit me.
Jack, what are you...?
What are you...?
Help.
Help.
Help me.
Where's Mitchell?
Resting his feet.
- Should I go get him?
- No, no.
- Let him rest till we get loaded.
- Okay.
Those blisters are pretty nasty.
Mitchell...
...you okay?
Mitchell?
What is it?
Tell me.
What did you do to him, Jack?
- What is it?
- Something's wrong with Mitchell.
- What are you talking about?
- You were alone with him.
What did you do?
He was resting his feet.
I didn't do anything.
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Gail, no! Let's go!
Get out! Get out! Go!
Come on! Come on!
Move! Move! Move! Go!
The raft!
No! You son of a bitch!
We can build another one.
With what?!
With what, Sam?!
We gotta get to the raft.
- It's our only way out of here.
- FYI, Bill, the raft is gone!
- We can get it back.
- How?!
How? We gonna swim after it now?
Look...
...the village is here.
Jack is following the Mendranang.
We cut across the jungle.
- We can catch him on the other side.
- Right.
- Catch him where?
- He's going to that orchid.
We find that flower...
...we find that raft.
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.
Listen, something terrible has happened.
We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We went over a waterfall.
I haven't seen anyone since.
I am...
I think I'm the only one left.
Wait, wait. Listen.
Oh, shit. Come on!
It's in front of us.
Son of a bitch.
It's trying to separate us.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, Christ, it's everywhere.
- Turn that goddamn thing off.
- They can see it.
- Doesn't matter.
- They can sense our body heat.
- He's right.
Let's just get the hell out of here.
- Which way?
- Hold on.
Any way.
- Let's go, Cole!
- Okay, okay!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
Hold on, wait for me!
Oh, my God.
If there's a way in, there's a way out.
Oh, shit!
- Guys?!
- Cole!
Which way?!
Over here!
- All right, say it again! Say it again!
- Cole! Over here!
Over here, Cole!
- Hello!
- This way, Cole!
- Guys!
- Cole!
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
God, come on!
Cole!
Oh, no, no!
Stay together.
Okay. I promise.
Now can we please go?
- Let's go.
- No problem. Okay, okay.
Which way?
- I don't know.
- What?
What do you mean, you don't know?
I found you, didn't I?
Tran?
Tran!
Tran!
Say something!
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!
I can see light.
- Is there a way out?
- I don't know.
Cole!
Tran!
Can you hear me?
Cole!
Where are you?
I think I found a way out.
Take this. Go. Now.
- Where are they?
- Go.
Oh, my God.
Go.
- Help!
- Cole?
- Cole?
- Hey, right here!
Almost there.
Holy shit!
Move! It's coming up my ass!
Help me! What did I do?!
Where's Cole?
- Cole, come on!
- Cole! Come on!
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, God! I'm stuck!
- Give me your...
- I'm stuck! Pull me!
- Give me your arm!
- Hurry up! Come on!
Oh, my God! It's coming!
Let's go! Pull!
Pull!
That's what I'm talking about, Sam!
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam!
You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!
How you like her now, bitch?!
She sliced you, diced you, cut you up!
Sam with the samurai action!
Hell, no.
Cole!
Get up, Cole. Get up, man.
Wake up, man.
Come on, man. Wake up.
No, no, no.
Cole. He's not breathing!
- He's got a pulse.
- Give him air!
Okay.
Again, again!
Come on, wake up!
Don't you die!
Don't die. Come on, no.
What the fuck?! Get it off me!
- No, no. It's okay! It's okay!
- Hey, it's okay.
It's me. Stay down.
- You're okay.
- I'm okay?
- Yeah.
- You're okay.
Perrinia immortalis.
- Son of a bitch finally got his orchid.
- Yeah. He can have them.
All I care about is that raft.
Let's go.
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I think I know what happened to Mitchell.
I can't let you take that.
You guys look like hell.
- You don't know what hell is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But you gave me no choice.
- Did you give Mitchell one...
...before you killed him?
- I didn't kill Mitchell.
No...
...you just let him die.
I saw the spider bite on his arm.
What was I supposed to do, Sam?
- The right thing?
- It's always a good place to start.
Let's not be stupid about this.
Let's get to the flower, we can all go home.
The mating ball.
Give me the flare.
Tie him up.
Now!
- Fill it up.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
Do I look like I'm kidding?!
Fill it up!
Get up!
- Now get the flowers.
- Okay.
Throw me the pack.
Drop the gun!
Throw me the pack.
Get up, Bill! Get up!
Come on, man!
Get up!
Get up!
- Sam, come on!
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on, girl! Hurry up!
- Come on!
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up, Sam!
- Come on, baby!
- You got it, honey, come on!
Shit!
- Come on, baby.
- You got it!
- You got it, honey!
- Almost there! Come on!
- Spider...
- Reach for me!
Come on, Sam, please!
Just reach! Reach!
Give me your hand.
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!
No! No! No!
No!
Oh, God!
Come on, Sam! Come on!
- Keep coming!
- Come on!
Climb up that wall, Sam!
Keep coming.
Come on, girl!
- Come on!
- Come on. I got you!
Come on, Sam, get back!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Hey!
Over here, bitch!
Holy shit.
Nice shot.
What can I say?
I'm a bad man.
You two look like you made up.
He's not so bad.
How's that?
Much better.
I think I'll live.
Good.
It's kind of nice having you around.
- So how much further to my bath?
- Kotabaru?
I'd say...
...another day downriver.
- Another day?
- I'm not rowing another day, homeboy.
- All right.
Let's see, we got this shortcut right up...
No!
Carl's Jr. has this $6 burger, which really only costs $3.95... so you think you're getting some deal... but the truth is, it may be the best franchise burger out there.
I went there yesterday and ordered three.
By golly, those suckers almost filled me up.
When I got home, I still had to have a box of Eggos... but that doesn't take away from Carl's achievement.
I mean, here's a guy who's got to go...
- ...through life as Carl Junior, right?
- Barry?
Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.
Do you think this compulsive eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother?
That you're eating yourself to death as punishment?
- You do think you killed her, right?
- I never said that.
She called out to you from that big, fancy oak bed.
- She said she was having chest pain.
- I never told you any of that!
- How could you know this?
- She begged you to dial 911.
But she was always calling out for you, wasn't she, Barry?
You weren't there. How could you know what happened? How?
- Doesn't matter. Stop blaming yourself.
- Doesn't matter.
If you don't, you'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason.
You're looking in my head! Stop it!
- Don't look in there.
- You don't have to do it, Barry.
Leave me alone!
It wasn't your fault.
Jonesy?
Ah!
Hey, how are you doing, Henry?
What's that you say?
Are you going deaf?
How are you doing?
You know. SSDD.
Well, yeah, of course.
Hey, I was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see Duddits.
Yeah, absolutely. He's been on my mind a lot too.
It's been a long time.
Yeah. It's open!
I gotta go. I got a thing here.
I'll see you Saturday.
Yeah, right.
See you Saturday.
So, Mr. Defuniak... do you know we're both escapees from Maine?
You're from Pittsfield.
Know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams?
You had the flu that day, didn't you,
David? You didn't take the exam?
You missed the test. And since you were ill, why not write me an essay instead?
3000 words on the short-term results of the Norman Conquest.
- Go get started.
- Yes, sir.
Better to be from Pittsfield than go back to it.
Thank you, sir.
How did you know?
You weren't even there that day.
Sometimes I just know.
Hello.
This probably won't work.
Never start like that with a car salesman.
We love challenges. Pete Moore.
In one hour I'm showing a house in
Fryeburg. It's a big commission.
And I just lost my damn car keys.
Could you possibly make me duplicates?
- That takes at least a day.
- Oh, boy, I just knew it!
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help.
I'm always good at finding things.
- Did I say my name? I don't remember...
- I guessed.
Now, let's find those keys.
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey, Pete.
- I looked again. I couldn't find them.
- Okay. I need your help.
You had the coffee in your hand, bought aspirin... went to your car, realized the keys were gone.
- That everything?
- Yes.
Look. This is gonna seem weird, but it's just a thing I do to help me think.
You bought a candy bar before the aspirin.
Mars bar.
Yours, right?
One more question. If I find your keys, will you let me buy you dinner?
West Wharf? 6:30?
Best fried clams in the state?
It's right on your way back.
Sure. Okay.
- That'd be nice.
- All right.
So you got here.
You opened your purse.
Coffee, candy and aspirin, you're juggling it all around.
And that's when... you dropped your keys.
It's just luck, is all.
Thank you.
- West Wharf, right? Half past six?
- You got it.
Another fuckarow.
- Jones.
- How are you doing?
- Hey, Beaver. Same shit, different day.
- Same shit, different day.
- Wanna talk?
- No, you're trying to get home.
- What's up?
- Really, I got nothing. Go home.
- Wait, Jonesy?
- Yeah, Beav?
- You be careful.
- Be careful of what?
Wish I knew.
Oh, my gosh. He's right there. Yeah.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Right. Sorry.
Hey!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, look!
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- It won't do any good.
I looked away for one second. Then
I heard a thump. What happened?
- Careful, careful.
- Back up, back up.
- Seriously....
- My God! Professor Jones!
I just saw him. He can't die!
Is he dead?
I didn't see it. Why did he run out?
Clear!
No good. Flatline. Hit it again!
Clear!
- What do you think?
- I think it's no good. I think he's gone.
Watch out for Ister Gay.
Out of my way.
Jonesy, don't try to lift that stuff.
- Just go up to the cabin.
- Here, here, look. Big jacket.
- Beaver, I'm going in!
- I'll see you in a second!
Watch the beer.
- Got blown last night.
- Good for you.
- First time?
- Bite my bag.
Met some lady at bingo, went back to her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.
- As opposed to a fuckarow.
- Obviously.
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash.
- Try Viagra.
- Viagra?
I'm practically at full salute all day.
I'm.... What do you call it? Privatic?
Prag... Prasmatic? Henry will know.
- You're thinking of fourth grade.
- You're having wood problems?
- You haven't tried it, have you?
- Hell, no!
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.
Twelve hours?
I'm talking Yastrzemski. You don't have to need it to love it.
Bingo? Did you say bingo, like the game in church basements?
- There's trim there.
- Beaver!
I thought my deal was pathetic.
- Ah!
- You just watch. That's your job.
- I'm fine.
- Uh-huh.
H, you been thinking about
Duddits more than usual?
Uh-huh.
Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend?
- I remember.
- Then I got hit.
I gotta tell you something weird.
The night I got hit, I was standing there and across the street, I saw Duddits.
Just like he was that day we first saw him back in Derry.
He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him.
Then he looked over at me.
He looked directly at me.
And he motioned for me to come to him.
You believe I saw him, don't you?
Yes, sir, I do.
Duddits loves me, I know that.
He loves us all.
He would die before he'd ever hurt us.
So why was he calling me into the street to get hit?
Maybe there's more to the story we don't get yet.
- You don't know shit.
- Name it!
I'll name it after we come up with a small wager.
- 50 bucks.
- What's the subject?
In the movies, when people wake up together... they immediately start kissing and going at it.
But they never get up first, take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth.
Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up.
What's it called when you got a constant woody?
- You mean priapism.
- See? I'm practically priasmic.
Priapismic.
- Whatever! It's hard.
- That's what you're betting on?
I can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.
- I'll give you a quarter.
- A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.
- Promised Land.
- Promised Land? Never heard of it.
Meg Ryan and what's his name?
Reefer Sutherland.
- Kiefer.
- From, I don't know, 1988 or something?
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning and says, "Where's the cat?"
And he says, "What cat?" And she says,
"The cat that shit in my mouth."
That will be 50 small.
- Bullshit! You made it up.
- Could Beaver make that up?
You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free.
I'm filing that in the "Who-gives-a-shit" section of my memory warehouse.
- What's the memory warehouse?
- You don't remember?
- I must've forgot.
- You forgot the memory warehouse?
- Just remind me. Don't give me shit.
- It's in his head. We've all got one.
- Hasn't that place been condemned?
- Not yet.
It's so crowded I throw something out every time I learn something new.
When I got my new laptop I had to throw out my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.
My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago.
I didn't know they had enough beer.
Hey. Hey, hey.
Jonesy, if that really is your name...
- ...what do you do with the old files?
- I burn them.
- You threw out the "Blue Bayou" lyrics?
- No.
No, if I really can't let go of something...
I sneak it back to an office where I keep my secret stuff.
Where do you keep the stuff on Duddits?
He's got a special section all his own on the third level.
I can't stop thinking about the
Duds lately. How about you guys?
It's this place. He's all around here, even though he's never been here.
This is our 20th year coming out here to Hole in the Wall.
And fuck me, Freddy, here's to 20 more.
Yeah.
Twenty more.
Here's to Duddits... our dreamcatcher.
Wish he was here.
To the Duds.
- To Douglas Cavell.
- To Duddits.
Why is Tina Schlossinger's pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers?
Because I said so. It's a picture.
- Have you seen it?
- No... but the kid who sits behind me in shop, he saw it.
Tracker Brothers is deserted for years.
You don't want to see the homecoming queen's pussy?
Don't come.
Fuck me, Freddy! Some kid's shirt.
- So?
- It's new!
Scooby-Doo.
"I belong to Douglas Cavell."
"If the boy I belong to is lost, please bring him to 19 Maple Lane, Derry."
Must belong to one of those kids from the Retard Academy.
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it and you can go.
Hey, you guys! Quit it!
Just fucking quit it!
What are you doing?
You're trying to make him eat that?
What's wrong with you?
Got it. I'll make him eat this dog turd, then he can go.
You go now. Unless you want half.
Take a hike, girls, while you have the chance.
Piss off. That's your final warning.
- You better watch it!
- Why is that?
- I know who you are.
- I'm trembling with fear.
- You're Rich Grenadeau, the quarterback!
- So?
What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing?
You won't tell anybody anything because you'll be dead.
- Get ready, Pete.
- Give the word, Henry.
Pete can fly. When you come for us, all we have to do is get in your way.
I can't catch that little dick?
You know who that is?
That's Pete Moore.
That's right, fat-ass. Pete Moore.
No one can catch him.
He's going straight to his house to tell his mother.
She'll call the cops and then we'll see.
- You know him, is that it?
- Never saw him.
Then why ask for trouble?
I mean, look at this moron!
- He likes this attention.
- How do you know what he likes?
Come on, you dickweeds!
- You want to fight us?
- Yes! Yes!
I'm gone, Henry. Just say the word.
- Why? You'll lose! Why?
- Because you can't do that! It's wrong!
And I'm gonna tell the world!
Tell everybody!
- You want us to leave, is that it?
- No! Let's kick their asses!
Let's go. We'll get him later.
You know that.
Get you all later.
It's okay. You can stop now.
Do something. Somebody!
If I do... and you tell anybody, I'll never hang with you guys again.
I never knew Beav could sing.
- Beaver, that's beautiful.
- I mean it. Not one word.
Beaver!
You've got a fan.
This yours?
Douglas Cavell. That's your name, right?
I Duddits.
- What?
- I Duddits!
- Duddits?
- Duddits.
Duddits, we got to get you home.
Hey, guys! Come here!
Leave the kid there.
Stand right here, Duddits.
Right here with Scooby, okay?
Jesus Christ bananas!
No way is that Tina
Jean Schlossinger.
Maybe her grandmother.
Good going, Beav.
Holy God. We came all the way here just for that?
No. We came for him.
Hey, Pete. You forgot the dogs.
Uh-oh. Weather moving in.
Double storm.
Alberta Clipper first, maybe 8 inches... with a nor'easter on its tail.
- Get on back to the cabin, Henry.
- Heading straight there, Mr. G.
- Don't mess around.
- No, sir.
Easy, fella.
Easy. You're okay. You're all right.
Thank God. Thank God.
Gee, thank God!
I'm lost. I've been lost in the woods since yesterday.
Let's get you inside. Get you warm.
- How would that be?
- Sure.
Here, let me get that.
- Rick McCarthy.
- Gary Jones. It's Jonesy to everybody.
Our damn cell phones are on the blink now, so I can't call for help... but our car will be back soon.
I didn't think I'd make it.
I lost the folks I was with.
You saved me, that's for sure.
What's that?
It's a dreamcatcher.
Indian charm. Catches nightmares... keeps them away.
Keeps you safe down here.
I've had enough nightmares.
Been doing that all night.
I ate some berries in the dark.
I think they must have upset me.
I know what you're thinking.
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs to take the cure, but I only do it here.
In the real world, I never drink till after 5:00... and if it ever does,
I'm on the wagon for life.
Glad to hear it.
What's the matter with you?
About six months ago, the day Jonesy got hit...
I did something terrible with a patient.
I humiliated him. Drove him out.
Barry Neiman.
Couple days ago, I saw his picture in the paper. He ate himself to death.
Mind if I don't use that story next time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?
You were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity.
Thanks. You're a real comfort.
You got a real delicate touch to you.
Here you go, Rick, buddy.
That will fix you up.
Jesus Christ bananas! Some fuckarow this is turning into!
- Thanks a lot, Beav.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.
What happened to you?
Hi. Joe Clarendon. Call me Beaver.
Rick here had a bad night in the woods.
Welcome.
- Is that frostbite?
- No, I get the same thing from peanuts.
It's allergy.
Grilled cheese, anyone?
- No, the soup's fine for me.
- I'll bite. Sail it over here.
My mother used to feed me pea soup when I was feeling...
Bitch in a buzz saw!
I've heard some mighty burps in my time, but that's the blue ribbon.
I am so embarrassed.
- Rick ate some berries in the woods.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, that's awful!
I'm so sorry!
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it.
There's more room out than in, anyway.
What have you been eating, woodchuck turds?
Know what I think?
I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap.
You know, I bet you're right.
I'm just tired, that's all.
- Come on.
- My hat.
Beaver?
Come on. In here.
Thank you for taking me in.
Thank you both.
- Shit, anybody would have.
- Maybe. Maybe not.
All right, this is in case you have to urk... if you can't get to the bathroom, which is the third door to your left.
If you go in the first, you'll take a shit in the closet.
If you need anything, we're outside.
Fuck me, give me some air!
We got any gas masks handy?
We need a biohazard team in here.
- Wanna hear what'll freak you out more?
- Not really.
You know his huge stomach?
When he got here, his stomach was normal, but his chest was out to here!
I wish Henry was here.
He's a shrink, not an internist.
He went to med school. Did you?
I thought about it.
You better get a run at it.
- Shit!
- Watch it!
What the hell?
- Pete, are you okay?
- I broke my leg! My damn leg!
- Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.
- Help me!
- I'm caught! I can't...
- God!
- God.
- Henry! A little help here!
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.
- Okay. Here comes the seat belt.
- I just opened that beer.
I got you.
How's your leg?
Well, it ain't broken.
It's just locked up, is all.
You don't suppose he got exposed to radiation?
I saw that once in a movie. Guy ended up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that red mark got bigger while I watched it.
- What are you doing?
- Peanut butter calms me down.
- Somebody else might want to use that.
- I'll leave some.
Beav.
Beaver.
Criminettlies!
I think it's a woman.
I ought to warn you.
I'm gonna strangle this broad.
- I'd guess she's already dead.
- I'll strangle her anyway.
She almost got us both killed.
Hello! Here we come, ma'am.
Don't be startled.
Hello?
Forget it, H. She's gone.
Hello!
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
I wonder if maybe that's how they say hello around here.
Listen, Miss Road Kill, you almost got us dead.
Say something.
I have to find Rick.
- Okay.
- Rick.
Yeah.
Fuck me, Freddy.
- What's all that red stuff on their fur?
- Just like McCarthy's cheek.
- I never saw anything like this before.
- Even the bears look scared.
- Of what? Where are they going?
- It's not where that worries me... it's what are they running away from?
What the hell?
This could be perfect. They can get Stinky to a hospital.
Hey, you guys!
We need help! Got a sick guy inside!
This area is under temporary quarantine.
- Stay where you are.
- What quarantine?
- We got a sick guy down here!
- We need your help here!
- We got a real sick guy!
- Take him with you now!
Glad you're okay. This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.
Kiss my bender!
I gotta ask you, old buddy.
Because I'm confused.
- Is this SSDD or not?
- Definitely not.
Different shit today, Pete.
And a pretty weird day so far, if you want to know.
Over here.
Okay. There you go.
Easy.
Nine miles to Hole in the Wall.
I think I can manage it.
I'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both.
Now, Pete, you listen to me.
Don't go back to the car for beer.
- Stay with her. Keep her warm.
- Right hand to God, Dr. D.
Henry!
If we die before you get back... promise you'll tell everybody she wasn't my date.
- I don't like this.
- Me neither.
Not at all.
This is turning into a double fuckarow. A real jobba-nobba.
- Rick, you okay?
- I'm a little sick, fellas.
- I just need to make a little room.
- McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.
- Go away!
- Open the door or we break it down.
- Can't a man have privacy?
- Rick, where are you bleeding from?
Bleeding? I'm not bleeding.
- Let's do it.
- I'm not positive I wanna go in there.
What if he's dying? Scooby-Dooby-Doo, we got some work to do now.
On three. Ready?
One.... Two....
Hold it! What if we just bounce off?
- No bounce, no play.
- Right. No bounce, no play.
One....
And a two.... Three!
Oh, fuck! Oh, man! Fuck!
I don't want to see this!
I can't see this.
- Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy? Rick?
- Is he still alive?
I don't know. Rick?
Rick, are you...?
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still do that, he must be alive.
Can you hear me? I think he's dead.
Bullshit! He dropped a clinker! I heard it.
- I don't think that was a clinker.
- That's enough, snap out of it!
- Oh, my God!
- My God!
- No!
- No?
No.
Good move! It's trapped. Got nowhere to go but the septic tank.
Okay.
Oh, shit!
- Listen, we're gonna change places.
- What?
- One of us is gonna go to the shed.
- No way!
Shut up and listen!
There's friction tape there.
You go get it, come back.
We'll tape the lid down.
Then we're gonna get the hell out of here!
- You get the tape, Jonesy.
- Don't be brave, Beav.
You're faster than me.
I'll sit on Thumper.
No, if it does get out, you can't fight it. Not with your hip.
Oh, my God! Goddamn it! Go!
- And Beav?
- Yeah?
Sit tight, buddy.
Okay. Okay.
All right. Okay.
Shit! Earth to Jonesy!
Come in, Jonesy!
Jonesy. Jonesy.
Okay. Calm down now. Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here it is. Okay.
Find the damn tape!
Where is it?
Coming, Beav!
Beaver! Beav!
I got the... What the...?
Jonesy, get out of here!
Beaver.
- Get out! Shut the door!
- No.
Run, Jonesy.
You killed him.
You killed Beaver.
You killed him, you fuck!
Ah!
What do you want?
They call the red stuff Ripley, after the broad in the Alien movies.
We eradicate the animals as they flee the Blue Zone.
The populace?
We bring civilians to Gosselin's. We'll detain them till we figure this out.
And, Owen? This time the ETs belong to you. That's right, bucko.
- You'll be Blue Boy leader.
- Finally.
- How many left?
- About a hundred.
Yeah. Not nearly enough for a serious incursion.
My guess is, it's a crash-landing.
They've never picked terrain like this before or cold weather.
What's your call?
The biggest threat is them getting out of our net.
Crash-landing or not... they'll try to get out and spread the infection.
I always say they never visited a world they wouldn't rather own.
They're up to their old tricks.
Using a standard grayboy look... with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin.
They project what they think we want to see.
But I've had a look at the real thing. You wouldn't want it marrying your sister.
- Difference of opinion about the Ripley.
- Really? Who has an opinion?
- Who do you think?
- General Matheson.
- Three-star General Matheson.
- Three?
- When did you see him?
- They called me in yesterday.
What's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers... who've never been near an ET?
They say the fungus doesn't take hold in all victims. Some of them get over it.
Really? And what about the shit weasels?
The ones blasting out the basement door?
Does Matheson think folks get over one of those puppies?
Their theory is, they only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population.
Do you like that theory, bucko?
I think it's crap.
So if you thought someone had been exposed...
- ...and you had them in your grasp...
- I wouldn't want them walking out...
- ...to wander as they wish.
- Bucko, I think we're on the same page.
Pissing in the same latrine.
If the Ripley gets out of this pine-tree paradise....
Well, it just can't be allowed to do that.
I've quarantined the entire area.
- Nothing leaves alive.
- Roger that, boss.
Come!
Got Maples here, boss.
- Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss.
- I know who you are, Maples.
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy.
Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss.
- Do you know the catechism?
- Yes, the B.U.C. for all buckos.
- Is Blue Unit part of regular Army?
- No, boss. Better.
- How does Blue Unit operate?
Under the radar. We don't salute, display rank, say "sir." A force unto ourselves.
- Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?
- Pussies.
- What rules does it operate by?
- Rules of combat.
That's right, laddie.
When a soldier disobeys a superior's orders, he puts everyone at risk.
And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel.
That's me. Capisce? Good.
Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here.
But you have to answer honestly.
You were on containment detail at 0600 this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.
Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-old daughter... to exit the zone in their own vehicle on Hickam Valley Road?
Colonel Curtis, she hadn't been in the zone.
She made a wrong turn a few miles back.
She couldn't have been contaminated.
You know this for a fact?
Or because she told you so?
- For a fact, boss.
- Scout's honor?
Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact?
Then do it, Maples.
Swear on it. Scout's honor.
Scout's honor.
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!
You just avoided a court-martial, boy.
You lie to me again, you'll be facing a firing squad.
- Get him out before I change my mind.
- Let's get him out of here.
Sentry!
- Jesus, Abe.
- I warned him.
Could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.
- Instead of taking his whole hand?
- He crossed the Curtis line!
He came into my house, told me lies.
- You think I'm crazy, Owen?
- A little.
I lost my temper there. But that little worm did something worse.
The pretty mom he let pass this morning?
She's down at the barn right now crawling with the Ripley.
Twenty-five years, Owen.
Twenty-five years I've been going out to fight these alien bastards... show them they picked the wrong place, knocked on the wrong door.
And frankly, laddie, the tank is running a little low.
Luckily for me, there's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit.
I have you. To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow.
- What are you talking about, Abe?
- It's my last dance, Owen.
From now on, you will lead the band.
- You know where I got that?
- John Wayne.
That's right. He gave it to me.
And now I'm giving it to you.
- Abe, I don't know how to....
- Let's not get all girlie with each other.
- Just tell me how we do it.
- We go in fast and hard.
- How do we come out?
- Clean... and smiling.
Ah.
Honey, I'm home.
That's a good idea.
Catch a little shuteye.
Save your energy for those horrendous farts!
Well, it's very nice of you to say so.
I find you very attractive also.
You're one of those rare women who can handle the full-size Ford Expedition.
The truck that handles like a luxury car.
A really big luxury car.
But seriously, folks, there is one issue I'd like to bring up... just in case I should, you know, kick the bucket out here... turn into a goddamn Petesicle.
Not that I think that's inevitable.
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver will be coming to get us soon.
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.
Now, ma'am, I'll be very candid with you about this... so please, don't get freaked out or think that I'm some kind of weirdo... who you shouldn't meet for the best fried clams in Maine.
Just some innocent fried clams at the West Wharf!
You see, the four of us, best friends... we all have this other friend by the name of Duddits.
And our friend Duddits, well, he's not your average old buddy.
One day, a long time ago, he gave us all this kind of gift.
It's this.... How shall I put it?
This ability. This ability to know things... to talk to each other without talking at all, just mind-to-mind.
Do you see what I'm getting at?
I knew you would.
Lately, I've been having this dream... and in the dream, I understand how
Duddits could give us a gift like that.
I think maybe our friend Duds is not from this planet.
I think Duddits is from somewhere else... and he came here to prepare us for something.
It's crazy.
Talking shit about the only perfect person I ever knew.
He's so goddamned good.
I can't believe he's a human.
I should be singing his praises, not questioning what galaxy he's...
I gotta pee.
That's what I should do.
Here's to you, Duds.
The highest civilian decoration.
Lord, I will never drink again.
Let me get this straight.
Yesterday you want to call it quits, throw in the towel, pull the plug.
Today, you're begging, praying.
Couple more hours. Couple more miles.
Make up your mind.
Jonesy! Way to go, motherfucker!
Here you come to save the day!
What the hell?
Who's Mr. Gray?
What are you trying to tell me, Jonesy?
You're not Jonesy.
What was that, Mr. Jones?
What did we just pass?
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?
That's what your friends call you, isn't it? Let's be friends.
- Why are you letting me live?
- I'm borrowing you.
- We're going to take a little journey.
- Beaver never hurt a soul. You killed him.
He had nothing in his head.
I've found something useful in yours.
- Fuck you!
- I know what that expression means.
I've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse.
Rather distasteful, I must say.
How about this, Mr. Gray?
Eat shit and die.
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?
Watch out for Ister Gay.
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?
If you want to know, why don't you read my mind?
Surprisingly, you're able to keep things from me...
I don't understand it. But I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.
Oh, Pete, Jesus!
Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off, Jonesy.
I always thought it would be my ex-wife did that.
Let's get you to some help.
Can you still see the line, buddy?
- I don't need it to get to Gosselin's.
- No, I know that, but... if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's, how would you get us out to 95?
95? Who gives a shit?
I'm hurting here, Jonesy.
What's wrong with you?
- Wait a minute, you're not...
- Shut up, Pete.
You're too messed up to know what you're saying.
Too late for that. Pete, I need you to get onto the snowmobile right now.
Who the fuck are you? You sound like one of those James Bonds!
This has to do with the fucking eel, doesn't it? You're not...
Stop it! I'll get him to help. Pete, tell him what he wants to know.
Now, Pete, which way to I-95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.
My, my. That is a gift.
Who taught you that?
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.
Climb aboard.
- Show's over. Let me in.
- Let me in.
What have you got in that part of your mind, professor?
Your memories are out here in the warehouse, aren't they?
I want to know who warned you about me. And who taught Pete that trick?
I'm sure the answers are here.
It'll just take me a while to find them.
- To find them.
- Think about letting me in.
- It's the polite thing to do.
- Polite thing to do.
Beav!
What is this?
Oh, Beav.
Shit!
Fuck me, Freddy.
Oh, shit.
Asshole!
So long, Beav. Love you, man.
We all made them in art.
I finished first.
I made one for Duds.
Mine's deformed. I couldn't figure out the string.
- Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet!
- That's right, my man.
I Duddits.
- Yes. I Duddits.
- I Duddits!
I Duddits!
- Duds will find her.
- How?
- He can do anything.
- She's from the Academy.
- She always waves.
- We've gotta save this girl.
- Save this world?
- Not the world, Duds. A girl.
- We'll save the world some other time.
- Ister Gay?
- Yeah, it's a mystery.
- We need you to solve it.
- Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds.
- Not this.
Shut up. We gotta think of Josie.
Josie, Josie, Josie.
"Josie Rinkenhauer."
- Josie?
- That's right. Can you find Josie?
- This is completely crazy.
- You can say that again.
- I didn't say anything.
- You did. I heard you.
- You said, "This is completely crazy."
- I didn't say that.
I thought it.
Kiss my bender. Duds can hear people's thoughts. We can't.
Are you sure of that, Beav?
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!
Josie, you down there?
Josie! Josie!
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.
I know it. I can see her in my head.
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Help! Please!
- Help me.
- Hold on, Josie, we're coming!
Josie, hang in there!
Don't sing. She's scared enough.
- Shut up. There's, like, rat shit.
- Hold on to my feet!
Pete, do you see anything?
- Duds! We got her!
- Here's Josie.
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?
- Right here, boss. Fast and hard.
- Wouldn't have it any other way.
Sir?
I see it.
- Don't hurt us.
- We're dying.
- There is no infection here.
- Whose radio is that?
It's not the radio. They're putting it into our heads.
- We are helpless.
- There it is, gentlemen.
- There's no infection here.
- Directly into our heads.
This gives you an idea what we're up against.
If anybody's thinking,
"Those poor, helpless little folk... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic Winnebago... what kind of a dog, what kind of a monster... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?"
- Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster.
- We are helpless. We are dying.
These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse.
And I'm here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?
- Yes, boss!
- Roger that, boss.
Right on, boss.
Don't hurt us.
I have a visual.
Holy shit!
Damn, look at the size of that.
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Target imminent. Go to level 4 readiness.
Gentlemen, lock and load.
Hellfires are hot.
Sing it out, Owen!
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Clean up the forest, get rid of this trash!
- Don't hurt us.
- Please, don't hurt us.
- There is no infection here.
- We are helpless.
- Fire at will!
- Fire!
Owen, get them out of there!
It's gonna blow!
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!
- We can get them!
- It's self-destructing.
- Blue Boy group, get out of there!
- We're on top of it!
Owen, pull out now!
- Pull out! Get out of there!
- Pull out!
Jonesy, I've been thinking about our friend. Our Scooby-Doo buddy.
For a long time I thought he was sent to us to warn us about something.
- I could never figure what it was.
- Don't talk about him.
Not till today.
It was this, right now.
- He wanted to warn us.
- Tell me about your friend.
- Did he show you that nifty trick?
- No. Jonesy's right.
- Come on, Pete. Let's talk.
- Bite my bag, motherfucker!
All right, Pete, I'll bite.
Your bag and everything else.
No, no! You bastard! No!
Pete.
Don't talk to him! Get out of there!
Ah.
- What's up?
- Thank God you came by, governor.
I'm broke down here and fearing for my life.
That's a good-looking dog.
- Where you headed?
- Gosselin's.
Any chance you're going near there?
That's where I'm going.
Well, I believe your tailgate has come open.
Let's take a look.
I see you have some cargo you're taking to Blue Base.
Got a treat for you, Ike.
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.
Good doggy. Yes. Good boy.
Have your fill. Tasty, tasty.
Eat all you want...
Jonesy. What are you up to?
Jonesy!
Oh, God!
Halt or we'll fire! You cannot leave the quarantine zone!
- Halt!
- I think I just about halted here.
Come with me, Owen.
I'll show you things you'll wish you'd never seen.
- How long we gotta be here?
- It'll be all right.
- I demand to see my lawyer!
- There must be something they can do.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- When do we get out?
- Within hours.
- You can't do this to people in America!
- I told you to stay over there!
- My wife...
- Government's doing what... they can to get you out of here.
Don't worry. It's all right.
We're doing everything to make sure you're safe.
We'll get you back to your homes within hours.
All clear.
Can I help you, sir?
What's your name?
- Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin.
- A doctor? Good.
We need doctors in there.
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.
- You, sir, where you from?
- Boston.
Beantown? Great city. We'll have you back there in no time.
Maybe by morning.
Hurry up, bucko.
You see that crud on the faces of children... you know why I relish a turn in the country like we had today.
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to...
Abe? Abe, you okay?
Abe?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I must be getting too old for this shit.
I don't know what the hell that was about.
It's the only way, Owen.
We've got to cauterize the site.
They've all got to die.
It's the only way.
But we don't know that.
Studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects.
The studies show squat, that's what they show.
If Matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter-century... you'd have never made it to your first jerk-off.
Those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.
Some get better. At least half will be over it in a few days...
Which ones, Mother Teresa?
Can you guarantee they won't take it home like a present for the family?
I'll tell you what you should be worried about. What should be on your mind.
Not these few unfortunates.
What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker.
- What?
- A hitchhiker.
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride... with somebody and would carry them out of here, without being consumed.
To scatter the infection, like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.
- Are you sure there isn't such a person?
- No.
But I am sure that if there is one he won't get out.
Not with the net my boys put up around the Blue Zone.
And if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got.
If we don't get gooey about the little picture... when our job is taking care of the big one.
Capisce?
Owen, if you think this is easy for me, you're crazier than my mother was.
Those poor schmucks.
They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart... never miss an episode of Friends.
These are Americans.
The idea of slaughtering
Americans... it just turns my stomach.
But I'll do it. I'll do it because it needs to be done.
So if we start at 2, we can be done by 2:30. And it's all behind us.
Except for the dreams.
Yeah, except for them.
What are you gonna tell Rita about what you did here?
What are you gonna tell Katrina when she's old enough to ask?
You know me, don't you?
I don't remember when we met... but you know me.
We don't have time to screw around.
You've got two problems.
- One you know about, one you don't.
- Go ahead.
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.
Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people.
- Who are you?
- Me?
Talk about that later, once we get out of here.
- Hey.
- You're predictable.
You won't let me burn on this fence... any more than you'll help
Curtis kill those people.
What you're thinking now is whether that digital sat-scan transmitter... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody.
- Somebody named General Matheson.
- Hmm.
"Sometimes we have to kill, but our real job is to save lives."
Your father was a great soldier.
Those were his last words.
You carry his picture with you always.
Tell me everything.
You'll save these people.
When we're done talking, get on the transmitter, contact Matheson.
Cavalry rides in.
That takes care of problem number one. Now comes the hard part.
You think the infection's been contained, that there's no hitchhiker.
You're wrong. He's riding with my best friend on earth.
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he's out there.
You and I don't get after him right away, he'll get out of my range... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan.
Our nightmare hitchhiker.
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend.
- Very convenient.
- I'm saying you ought to hear his story.
Okay. Where is he?
Had him taken to the tractor shed.
Okay. I'll check him out and we can compare notes.
Whatever you say, boss.
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.
All right, lad, open up.
Dr. Boston?
Are you in here?
I'm here.
Where I've been put.
A prisoner on my own damn property.
Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Get in!
You almost ran me down.
Figured you'd read my mind and get out of the way.
Blue Unit, stand down. You are under regular Army command.
- Put down your weapons at once.
- Get down!
Your mission is rescinded.
This is no longer a
Blue Unit operation.
Put down your arms.
Repeat, put down your arms.
General Matheson has assumed command.
Okay, Owen.
Okay.
You just drove over the Curtis line.
- Where we going?
- South.
All I know right now. Just get me in range of Jonesy... we'll know everything we need to know.
That's some gun. Can I have a look?
- Kind of flashy for a guy like you.
- It's a gift.
I know.
Where are you, Jonesy?
Pick up the phone. Call 1-800-HENRY.
Hello? Jonesy!
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where's he taking you?
Massachusetts? He is?
Duddits? Okay, I will.
You hang in there, Jonesy.
Jonesy?
He hung up.
Give me back my gun.
- We gotta go to Derry.
- That where they're going?
No, they're going towards
Massachusetts. We need Duddits.
Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits.
Your buddy, he's still alive after all this time with Mr. Gray?
Yeah, he's immune.
I think it's because he died.
He got hit by a car and his heart stopped. Twice.
I don't think he even knows it.
He came back from the dead.
Must have changed him somehow.
It's almost like Duddits saw this whole thing coming. Is that it?
Jonesy told me it was Duddits who drew him into the accident.
If we catch him, we're gonna have to kill him.
You know we have to do it. It's the only way to stop Mr. Gray... assuming we can catch him.
When was the last time you saw Duddits?
Long time ago.
Years.
What makes you so sure he can help?
Duddits can do anything.
I didn't understand that then, but I think it's always been true.
He's the one who made us like this.
- Like what?
- You know, weird.
He's been waiting for you.
Blizzard slowed us up.
Henny, Henny.
Henny.
I miss you, Henny.
I miss you.
Henny.
Long time, Henny. Henny.
- My God, Roberta, what is it?
- Lymphocytic leukemia.
I'm gonna let you take him, but I have to tell you why.
Just now, when he was getting ready...
Henry, he was so excited.
Like he hasn't been in such a long time.
I think... that if he's with you, he might die happy... instead of in this awful room.
Be sure the parka stays on tight. Cold devastates him.
The medication and instructions are in here.
Bye, Mom.
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.
Now, go save the world.
All right, laddie.
They haven't got enough courage to take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.
What've we got?
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.
Massachusetts?
Stay with it, bucko.
General Matheson. Come in, please.
This is very nice, Abe.
Been home through some rough times.
Was there something we hadn't covered?
I don't think I got to say before how much I respect the work you've done.
It was with sincere regret...
Herman... May I call you Herman?
We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives, but we do agree on this:
I'm past it. Burned out.
Just needed a push, that's all.
Should have quit after that mess in Montana.
Even I don't trust my judgment anymore.
Oh, yeah....
My techies tell me we're getting some electronics reading hot from in here.
Yes, I've been talking to the wife on my sat phone.
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara.
She's been after me for years to retire.
She's very happy, I can tell you that. I'll have everything shut down in an hour.
If that's soon enough.
That will be fine.
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?
Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper.
You're making yourself at home.
You have no idea, Jonesy.
Tell me how you like this:
"Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.
He's in a police car now.
Can you see where they are, Duds?
Ownzy. He's in Ister Gay.
Mr. Gray.
That's right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.
We gotta save this girl.
Save the world?
Not the world, Duds, a girl. We'll save the world some other time.
Ister Gay?
You already knew.
Where's he going, Duds?
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy? Duds?
Ister Gay, he want war.
- War?
- Not war, water.
Mr. Gray wants water.
I know where he's going.
- He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
- What's Quabbin?
It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.
- Hmm.
- What?
One worm kills the world.
One worm kills the world?
Oh, my God. One worm.
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms that come out of these weasels.
Mr. Gray must want to get one into the Boston drinking supply.
Just one worm infects the whole world?
- Are we going right?
- Yes.
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike.
It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.
Are you ready to try something hard?
I want to ask you something hard.
Yes, Henny.
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?
Can you make him hear you?
Ownzy... and Ister Gay.
Duddits.
I knew it. I knew it.
He's been here all along.
Waiting.
Jonesy? It appears we didn't meet by accident.
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.
- I don't know what you mean.
- No? Maybe not.
Maybe your clever friend didn't want you to know what he was up to.
That's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me.
Duddits didn't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you.
It doesn't matter.
His little scheme didn't work.
Did it, Ike? No, no.
We're almost there.
What was it your poetry file had to say?
I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep
Stop that chopper!
Punch it, dude. Don't be a pussy.
Thank you, Gary Jones.
Go up around the reservoir.
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.
Patience, bambino.
Just up ahead.
Shh....
Stay here and take care of your friend.
No matter what you hear.
So long, doctor.
Good doggy.
Good girl.
Shit!
You son of a bitch!
Wait.
Wait.
Go back to car, Duddie.
You'll be safer there.
Look out, Jonesy.
I knew you'd come, Henry.
I knew you wouldn't let me die.
Who the fuck are you?
- Don't you know me, H?
- I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.
Just to be sure.
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.
I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.
He could be hiding in here somewhere... waiting for his chance.
Tell me something Mr. Gray couldn't possibly know.
Tell me something only we would know.
SSDD.
Not good enough.
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.
At Tracker Brothers, day we met Duddits... what was painted on the wall by the window?
No... bounce....
No play.
Hello...
Ister Gay.
You.
Ooby-Ooby-Doo... we got some work to do now.
Ister Gay... go away.
No!
I Duddits.
H?
Jonesy.
Jonesy, if that really is your name....
- That'll be 50 small.
- Bullshit.
- I Duddits.
- I Duddits.
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.
Here's to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.

Last orders, please.
- Shaun.
- Yeah?
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.
I know he's your best friend but you do live with him.
I know...
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.
...spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.
With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out and that only exacerbates things.
- What do you mean?
- You guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
It means to make things worse.
Right, right.
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- It's all right.
And I do want to spend time with you.
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
Anybody?
No, thank you.
I know... friends are important to Shaun but you must set some quality time aside for yourselves.
Daffs is always taking me to see these listed buildings and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.
- I'm not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?
- It's your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.
Shaun. Hog lumps.
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more, more than spending every night in the Winchester.
I want to do more interesting stuff.
I want you to want to want to do it.
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.
- Not that I'd know.
- You haven't met his mum?
- Not yet.
- Don't you get along with your mum?
- It's not her...
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum.
- # She's like butter #
- Ed!
- Shaun!
- Liz.
I understand what you're trying to say and I agree.
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.
Just the two of us.
Things will change. I promise.
Really, Shaun?
Time, gentlemen.
- # This town is coming like a ghost town #
- Shaun?
'Player two has entered the game.'
Haven't you got work?
'Player two has left the game.'
The front door was open again last night.
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.
I can't live like this.
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.
- Pete...
- He brings no money into the house.
- He brings a bit.
- What? Dealing drugs?
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.
Yeah, once. At college. To you.
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.
Because he can impersonate an orang-utan?
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Leave him alone.
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.
- When was that?
- Five years ago.
When's he going home?
Hey, man, listen... Top left.
- Uh-huh.
- I was gonna say... Reload.
- I'm on it.
- Erm, since... Nice shot!
Thanks.
Two seconds.
- All right, Noodle?
- 'Got anything? '
- No, man.
- 'Eball says you was holding.'
- I ain't got nothing.
- 'Nothing at all? '
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.
- Listen...
- Ed... since you're not working at the moment could you please clean up a bit?
And if you play the answer machine, can you take down everyone's messages?
- Yep.
- It's not that taxing, is it?
Writing something on a scrap of paper?
- Nope.
- Right.
Dom, hi...
Come on, it was pretty funny.
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.
Do it for me, then.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
- It's all right.
- No, no.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
Oh!
Oh, my God, that's rotten.
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.
- Get that.
- You get it.
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today
'so can you book the table for eight rather than seven?
'I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.'
Hey! You're dead.
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.
Watch out. Are you blind?
'The American deep space probe Omega 6
'unexpectedly re-entered
Earth's atmosphere over England
'and broke apart over... '
Nelson?
Nelson?
Hello, my friend. No beer today?
No, it's a bit early for me.
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.
Gather round.
As well as Mr Sloman being off today
I'm afraid Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather, so I will be taking charge as the...
- Oldest.
- Senior staff member.
So if we can all pull together...
- Hello? Hello, mate.
- Noel?
I was totally munted last night.
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.
All right, mate. Laters.
- Continue.
- Thank you.
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says, there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.
In... There's an I in meat pie.
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.
- How old are you? 20? 21?
Hey, well...
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.
When?
You got red on you.
Hello, mate.
This one comes with a basic digital package.
You've got your lifestyle channels there, a bit of Trisha.
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.
News. All the basic, er... news...
- channels.
- 'Bizarre events... '
'Coming after me... '
- Shaun.
- I'm with customers.
It's your dad.
He's not my dad, he's my stepdad.
Philip.
Shaun.
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
- No.
- Your bimonthly visit.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You could bring the flowers you forgot on Mother's Day.
I was gonna.
And not a cheap posy from a garage forecourt.
I wasn't gonna.
Well, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
OK.
You've got red on you.
- I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
- What?
How comes you're allowed to speak to your dad?
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.
And B, it was an emergency.
What, like buying your mum some flowers?
Noel, I do not find it difficult to keep my work and my social life separate.
Shaun, it's Liz for you.
- Hello.
- 'Hello, it's me.'
- Hello.
- 'Did you get my message? '
- Yep.
- 'So it's all OK, then? '
- Yep.
- 'Eight at the place with all the fish?
'Cool, that's great. Just ring me later.'
- Goodbye, Liz.
- 'Bye. Bye, bye, bye.'
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.
Sir? Sir?
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum" or "Supermum"?
- Er... the first one.
- Right.
'... London seems to have gone completely bonkers... '
- Oh, my God! Shaun!
- Yvonne.
Oooh! How are you doing?
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown-up, eh?
- Are you still with...?
- Liz.
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?
- Er, it's three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?
- We're going out for a meal tonight.
- Anywhere nice?
Yeah...
Come on!
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?
Tidying up.
- It doesn't look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.
'Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please? '
- Do you want your messages?
- What?
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.
Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight.
Then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
- 'Hello, Fulci's.'
- Hi, I know it's short notice but could you possibly do me a table for two for tonight at about eight?
'Sorry, we just gave away the last table.'
Wasn't true about your mum.
Where are we gonna go?
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.
- There's a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!
Hello.
- 'Hello, it's me.'
- Hello.
'What's the plan, then? '
Erm, there's been a bit of a... a mix-up with the table, babe.
- 'What do you mean? '
- They're full up.
'But... I thought you said it was all OK? '
Yeah.
'You didn't book it, did you, Shaun? '
- No.
- 'So... what is the plan, then? '
The Winchester?
- 'Hello? '
- Dianne, can you let me in?
- 'I'm not sure, Shaun.'
- Oh, come on.
'Lizzie doesn't want to see you.'
- Just open the door!
- 'She doesn't want to see you.'
Do you want me to climb up the wall, come through the window? Because I will.
'You're not coming in.'
- OK, see you in a minute.
- 'Don't... '
'Hi, it's me again.'
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?
- No, I don't fucking want to!
- OK.
It's not the only place in the world.
We'll go to the Shepherd's, they do Thai in there.
- I'm going out with David and Di.
- Let's go together.
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.
You promised you'd stop smoking.
You promised you'd try drinking red wine instead of beer!
- You promised we'd go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.
- You promised us free cable.
- I'm working on that.
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.
W- What was the next one?
It's not enough, Shaun.
'We appear to have a breakdown in communication there.
'If you or someone you know may... '
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.
Get fucked, four-eyes!
You go out with her, you love her so much.
What do you mean by that?
'... the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.'
I don't know what he meant by that.
Got you these.
- "To a wonderful mum"?
- Oooh!
Yeah, that's because...
I thought it would be funny because of what you said last night about you don't want to be my mum and that.
It's just a little joke, just sort of spur of the moment.
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.
Smooth.
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub for the rest of my life like those other sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
What do you mean do something?
Fuck her. You got your pint.
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?
Shall I do Clyde?
See, I knew you'd get over her.
# If you leave me now... #
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.
A Bloody Mary first thing, a bite at the King's Head, couple at The Little Princess, stagger back here and bang... back at the bar for shots.
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
- No.
- Come on, man.
Talk to me.
She said if she stayed with me she'd end up in here for the rest of her life like these sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
That is harsh.
- These are rich, interesting characters.
- Like who?
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.
Strangled his first wife with a draught excluder.
And invented the mobile disco.
What about her, then?
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.
She's an ex-porn star.
They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop.
Cafe Au Lait...
Pour Vous.
Yeah. What about John, then?
He's North London Mafia.
It's true, Big Al says so.
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.
Bernie, the trophy wife.
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?
- The pub's called the Winchester.
- Exactly.
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.
- Don't, man.
- No.
Oi, look at me.
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna say there's plenty more fish in the sea,
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés but what I will say is this... it's not the end of the world.
Sorry, we're closed.
Pisshead.
# Ooh, white lines
# Visions, dreams of passion
# Going through my mind
# And all the while I think of you...
Oh?
What's the matter, love, haven't you had your tea?
# Something of a phenomenon telling my body to come along
# Cos white lines
# Blow away...
- Shh!
Blow!
# Ah, get higher, baby
# Ah, get higher, baby, ah, get higher, girl
# Ah... #
What? He should say base.
Or freeze.
What a tit.
# You wanna dance? #
Don't scratch it! Wait...
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It's four in the fucking morning!
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not.
It's fucking Sunday and I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours because every other fucker is fucking ill!
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey! Pete, look,
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks, we split up with Liz tonight.
Just keep it down, yeah?
Prick.
What was that?
Nothing.
- Stop it, we're friends!
- He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means why don't you fuck off!
You wanna live like an animal, live in the shed, you thick fuck!
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.
All he ever does is hold you back.
Or is it easier having someone around who's more of a loser than you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?
Sort your fucking life out, mate.
What's up with your hand, man?
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?
- Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
- Why did they bite you?
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!
I've got a splitting headache and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.
And the front door is open. Again!
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.
Next time I see him, he's dead.
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today
'so can you book the table for eight rather than seven?
'I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.'
'Hello, pickle. It's me, Mum.
'Dad mentioned you might be visiting tomorrow which would be lovely.
'Will you be bringing
Elizabeth with you this time?
'Only we can't wait to meet her finally
'and also I was wondering if she wanted anything special for lunch?
'Cos these days a lot of people don't eat meat.'
Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Nelson, have you got any papers?
Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about 15p.
Oh dear.
Sorry, I haven't got any change.
I didn't even have enough at the fucking shop. Oh dear.
'... no official comment but religious groups are calling it Judgement Day. There's... '
#... panic on the streets of London... #
- '... number of reports of... '
- '... serious attacks on... '
- '... people who are being... '
- '... eaten alive.'
'Witness reports are sketchy.
One unifying detail seems to be
'that the attackers appear to be... '
'... the sensational chart-topping... '
'... or ideological connection between those committing the atrocities... '
There's a girl in the garden.
- '... emergency services... '
- What?
In the garden, there is a girl.
'... the armed forces will be called in to provide backup and assistance.
'Scientists are still trying to establish the nature of the phenomenon
'and are unsure as to the... '
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Oi!
Oh, my God.
She's so drunk.
How much have you had, love?
- Oh! I think she likes you.
- Shut up.
- She wants a cuddle!
- I've just come out of a relationship.
- Ed, do something!
- Wait there.
- Ed!
- Two seconds.
I'm really flattered and everything but...
And, hold it there.
Ed! Just get her off me.
Jesus!
- What's up with her eyes?
- Now, seriously...
Mary, I'm warning you,
I'll have to get physical, I mean it!
This is it... Look, just fuck off!
- I think we should go back inside.
- OK.
- Shaun, what's going on?
- Shit, it's engaged.
- How about an ambulance?
- It's engaged, Ed.
- Fire engine?
- It's one number and it's busy!
- And what do you want a fire engine for?
- Anything with flashing lights.
Are they still out there?
Yeah. What do you think we should do?
Have a sit-down?
'There are reports of chaos on the motorways
'as thousands of people attempt to flee the cities.
'The M1, the M3, M4, M6... '
- Do you think this is the same thing?
- '... are all at a standstill.
'The Home Office is urging people to stay in their homes and await further instruction.'
'Ensure all residences are secure
'with all doors and windows firmly locked and barricaded. Police... '
- For God's sake! He's got an arm off!
- Get him!
'More reports just in confirm that in all cases the attackers seem slow and shambolic... '
I'm gonna shut the front door.
'... regarding the best way to neutralise the attackers.
'In the meantime, contact with these assailants is highly inadvisable.'
- Did you see his head go?
- 'If you're confronted... '
- We should get out there.
- No, we should stay inside.
- We can take 'em.
- The man said to stay indoors.
- Fuck the man.
- In here, we're safe.
'... the attackers can be stopped by removing the head or destroying the brain.
'I'll repeat that, by removing the head or destroying the brain.'
Hey!
Aim for the head.
- Now what?
- Get more stuff.
- What's in the shed?
- Dunno, it's locked.
- Why is it locked?
- It's always been locked.
No! That's the second album I ever bought!
Some of these are limited...
Ah! What was that?
- Blue Monday.
- That was an original pressing.
For fuck's sake.
- Erm... Purple Rain?
- No.
- Sign O' The Times?
- Definitely not.
- The Batman soundtrack?
- Throw it.
- Dire Straits?
- Throw it.
- Er... Ooh, Stone Roses?
- No.
- Second Coming?
- I like it.
Ah! Sade?
- That's Liz's.
- She dumped you.
- I'm going to the shed.
- You said it was locked.
- Which one do you want? Girl or bloke?
- Er... the first one.
'People receiving bites have experienced headaches and nausea
'and developed symptoms... '
You've got red on you.
'If you know someone who has been bitten
'it is absolutely essential that you isolate them immediately.
'The public are being strongly advised not to approach anyone... '
Pete?
Pete?
- Why don't we just go up?
- Don't go up there!
- Why not?
- Because A, he might be one of them and B, he might still be annoyed.
Pete?
Maybe he went into work.
How come he didn't drive?
His keys are still here.
Maybe he got a lift.
He said he wasn't feeling well. Pete?
Oi, prick!
He's not in.
- You got a fag?
- No, I've given up.
- Since when?
- Since...
Come on, babe. Oh, she's engaged.
- That was quick.
- Ed, this is serious.
Liz!
- 'Shaun.'
- Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?
- 'Yes.'
- Are you sure?
'Some men tried to get into the house.'
- Are they still there?
- 'I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.'
- Did you try the police?
- 'Well, I thought about it.'
- Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
- 'No, I'm fine.'
- Mum?
- 'Well... they were a bit bitey.'
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- 'No, but Philip has.'
- Oh, OK.
- Has she been bitten?
- No, Philip has.
- Oh, OK.
- Mum, what state is he in?
- 'He's fine. Bit under the weather.'
- I see.
- What's the deal?
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.
- 'I don't want to cause a fuss.'
- We're coming to get you, Barbara!
So, what's the plan?
Right.
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,
'we go in, we take care of Philip.'
I'm so sorry, Philip.
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place,
'hole up, have a cup of tea
'and wait for all this to blow over.'
- Why have we got to go to Liz's?
- Because we do.
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she's all right.
- Why?
- Because I love her.
All right, gay.
- I'm not staying there, though.
- Why not?
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,
I wanna know where the exits are and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
OK...
'Take Pete's car, go round Mum's,
'go in, deal with Philip.'
Sorry, Philip.
'Grab mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here,
'have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over.'
Perfik.
No, wait, we can't bring them back here.
- Why not?
- It's not exactly safe, is it?
Yeah. Look at the state of it.
Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Where can I smoke?
'Take car, go to Mum's, kill Phil.'
- Sorry.
- 'Grab Liz, go to the Winchester,
'have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over.'
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Yeah, boy!
'To recap, it is vital that you stay in your homes.
'Make no attempt to reach loved ones
'and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.'
Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.
Any zombies out there?
- Don't say that.
- What?
- That.
- What?
That. The Z word. Don't say it.
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.
All right. Are there any out there, though?
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Oh! No, there they are.
- OK, let's do this, yeah?
- Yeah?
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.
Ooh... can I drive?
What?
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.
OK.
Ahh! Oh, God.
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna borrow your car, OK?
Erm, we'll bring it back.
And if you're feeling better later, we're... we're going to the pub.
You're more than welcome to, er... join us.
Pete'd be so pissed off if he knew I was driving his car.
I don't think so.
Shaun, which button's central locking?
Oh, cock it!
Get lost!
Drive.
'The Church of England has joined other extremist religious groups
'in proclaiming this
"a sign of a coming apocalypse".
'Downing Street is refusing to be drawn into a religious debate.
'The bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and attacking the living.'
Let's put something else on.
What are you doing? Ed, look out!
I think we hit something.
Or someone.
Ow!
Are you all right?
Come on, let's just go.
Hello?
- He's gonna be dead either way.
- That's not the point.
Oh, thank God for that.
Ah, hello.
Who's a pretty boy then?
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.
I put a Mars Bar in it once and he chased me with a bit of wood.
- Fuck, it's gorgeous.
- It seems pretty clear, we should go.
Why don't I stay here?
What, what, what, what, what?
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...
I'll honk three times.
OK.
Don't forget to kill Philip!
- Hello, pickle.
- Hi, Mum.
You've got red on you.
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.
Really!
Ed's outside, we'll take you somewhere safe.
- What about the doctor?
- I don't think he's gonna come.
- Philip won't want to leave the house.
- Philip isn't...
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.
- OK.
- OK, then.
- You hungry?
- Not really.
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- OK.
No fighting, you two.
'... you may ask where is our God?
'But throughout the land, men and women of integrity
'rise up to confront the unseen enemy.
'They will not be cowards,
'they will be courageous in the face of danger.'
- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.
What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.
No, it's... cricket bat.
- Is that for the jumble, Shaun?
- No. Yes.
Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.
- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
- Don't be silly.
Maybe you should stay here and wait for the doctor.
- You said he wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor?
- Just to be on the safe side.
- I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.
We had ourjabs when we went to the Isle of Wight.
- But, Philip...
- It's overblown nonsense.
- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.
- I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
- Mum, look!
How about that tea?
Mum, how much do you love Philip?
- Two sugars, is it?
- I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?
Do we have to go through all that again?
What would you say if I told you that Philip's been quite unkind to me?
You weren't easy to live with.
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you-know-what.
- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
- Shaun!
Sorry, Mother... Mum!
Did you know that on several occasions... he touched me?
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.
Philip is my husband and has been for 17 years and I would at least expect you to respect my feelings.
You must be more adult about these things.
Yeah.
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when... you just... gotta be a man.
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.
Hello, Edward.
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?
Hmm... I pranged it.
You were parked.
Yeah.
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.
- Philip?
- What?
Look out!
Christ!
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.
I'm on it.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.
Just be careful!
Can you please turn that noise down?
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.
You do realise this is a 20 mile an hour zone?
Oh, yeah.
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.
You can't...
Hey, man, watch the leather.
Keep moving. If there's any problems...
I'll do the honks.
'Hello? '
Hello?
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?
I've come to get you.
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?
- Lots.
- Lots!
It only takes one of them to know you're in here.
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.
This is about survival.
We need to be somewhere more secure, somewhere we can stay alive.
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces and if you think about it, neither do you.
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?
- Lizzie?
- Liz?
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?
- Yes!
- Great. Where?
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.
David?
I don't see the point of owning a car in London.
Look, just get any blunt objects together.
If you get cornered, bash them in the head.
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
So, what's the plan, then?
We're going to the Winchester.
OK? Let's go.
- Come on.
- Where's the car?
What's up, niggaz?
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.
Hello.
Ed, be careful.
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.
Thought you wanted to get there fast?
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?
Chill out, it's a short cut.
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
And there's a rifle above the bar.
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
- They can't.
- Can't they?
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?
What?
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?
You were 12 when I met you, you'd already grown up so much.
I just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad.
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.
And I always thought you had it in you to do well.
You just need... m-motivation.
Somebody to look up to and...
I thought it could be me.
Would you just... take care of your mum?
There's a good boy.
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?
- Just pull over!
- All right.
Whoa, momma!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Stop telling me to chill out!
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.
No, he isn't.
Get out!
Jesus!
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!
Quick!
- The child lock!
- Ed!
- Now what?
- We keep moving.
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?
It looks like him but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car.
Let's go, shall we?
You're not suggesting we walk?
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.
Maybe we should all hold hands, make a crocodile?
Do you know where we're going?
- David, come on.
- Sorry.
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.
Are we close?
We're pretty close.
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.
Shaun.
Yvonne.
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.
Hey, Yvonne.
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.
Erm... my friends Mark, Maggie,
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
All right.
See? The Winchester's just over there.
- Over where?
- Over there.
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?
What's the matter, David?
Never taken a short cut before?
Shaun.
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.
Now, the Winchester is just over that fence, all right?
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
- There's six of us.
Mum!
I'm coming!
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.
Shaun?
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Shaun!
Yes!
No, that's rubbish.
- Ooh!
- Yes!
Feel free to step in any time.
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.
I'm so sorry about that.
Right.
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.
- Is it clear?
- No.
- How many?
- Lots.
Oh, well, that is just great.
There are a fair few of them, yes.
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
This is hardly constructive, David!
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.
Or not.
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face, it's vacant with a hint of sadness.
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.
- Come on!
- Urgh.
It's mournful, sorrowful, you're dead and you hate it. Go.
Uuurgh.
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.
This is the night!
- What is that?
- What about yours?
Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
Don't...
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.
Go, go, go, go.
Shit! Get round me, get round me!
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.
- They know.
- Stay in character!
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?
Yeah, there's...
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.
- 'All right? '
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.
- 'You get anything yet? '
- I got nothing.
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...
Look at me. I've spent my entire life sticking up for you and all you ever do is fuck things up and make me look stupid.
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!
Shaun.
Oh.
You were saying about another way in?
Yeah, there's a...
What are you doing?
- No!
- Get inside.
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?
I won't be long, I promise. Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.
Come on, this way, that's it!
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.
All you can eat!
Shall we go in, then?
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
Either way, we need to think about blocking up this window. We're totally exposed.
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then perhaps... I should.
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He'll be back soon.
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man you binned for being unreliable?
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress.
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?
I could get a round in.
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade the window when he gets back.
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.
Must be why Shaun took us here before he left.
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?
If he does, do you think his master plan will be anything more than eating peanuts?
Is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything's OK?
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.
But what I do know is that we're here now and we have to make the best of it.
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.
We'll have a party and get completely smashed.
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.
Pickle!
Hello, Mum. You all right?
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?
How did you lose them?
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.
I tried to tell you before you smashed the window.
But it wasn't me blowing our cover by arguing with my boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Thanks, babe.
So, what's the plan, then?
Would anyone like a peanut?
Why don't you do your Clyde?
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?
Ed does the most amazing impression of the orang-utan.
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.
I'm not a performing monkey.
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.
It's quite simple, David.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?
Erm...
Yeah.
Never anything on, is there?
What?
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.
Yeah.
Well, we'll just have to be extra quiet then, won't we?
What?
Ed, no!
Turn it off!
Shit!
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.
- What?!
- The jukebox!
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?
How about pool?
# Don't stop me now
# Don't stop me
- # Cos I'm having... #
- John, it's time at the bar.
# I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
# Defying the laws of gravity
# I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
# I'm gonna go, go, go
# There's no stopping me
# I'm burning through the sky...
- I can't find the switches!
- Then get the fuses!
# That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
# I'm travelling at the speed of light
# I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
# Don't stop me now
# I'm having such a good time
# I'm having a ball
# Don't stop me now
# If you wanna have a good time
# Just give me a call
# Don't stop me now cos I'm having a good time
# Don't stop me now
# Yes I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all
- # I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars...
- Why is Queen still on?
- We have a situation!
- I know!
- Fuck this. Two seconds.
- Ed!
Oi!
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode
# I'm burning through the sky, yeah...
Shaun!
#... call me Mister Fahrenheit...
No!
Yes! Yes! In the head!
Ooow!
Shauny!
# Don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
# Don't stop me, don't stop me good time, good time
# Don't stop me... #
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time, it's...
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.
OK.
But dogs can look up.
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?
- No one has any experience. We've got...
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.
29 shells. I need someone to help me reload, everyone else to look out. I will fire.
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation.
I think we can all appreciate that now.
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Ah!
- Barbara?
Are you all right?
I've got something for you.
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...
It seems only right.
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.
Liz!
Here they come!
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!
Sorry, we're closed!
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.
Cock it!
- There!
- Where?
Three o'clock!
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
- What?
- Keep it simple!
Top left!
- Reload.
- I'm on it!
Come on, come on.
Nice shot.
OK, David, Dianne, let's block up this window!
Ed, take over a sec.
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Shaun, I'm so sorry.
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.
No, you should've said.
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.
Jesus.
I know first aid.
Just hang on. Mum!
- Mum.
- Is she...?
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.
- I never thanked you.
- For what?
For these. "To a wonderful mum."
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Mum. Please don't go.
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.
One... two... three!
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.
Don't point that gun at Barbara!
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- It's OK.
Please, can we just stop and think about this?
Tell him to put the gun down!
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!
He's always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum.
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me to get close to Liz and when she knocked you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.
I've come to terms with that, Daffs, why can't you?
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings for you...
David! There are slightly more pressing matters at hand here.
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.
You've gone from a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.
I'm not a chartered accountant.
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.
Please can we just calm the fuck down!
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.
Yep.
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.
I can't begin to imagine how hard this must be for you but we can't afford to fall apart.
Shaun, babe...
I know you don't wanna hear this...
You do it.
I'm sorry, Mum.
Do it!
Well... I think we're all agreed, you did the right thing there.
David, no!
David!
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?
Opening that door now would be a very silly thing to do.
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...
David!
I'm so sorry, Dianne.
Maybe I'm not the one you should be apologising to.
Shaun...
David! No!
No! No! No!
David!
- No! No!
- David!
David!
Dianne, no!
I'm coming, David!
David!
Oh dear.
- Cocktails?
- Do it.
Stay back!
Shaun, hold them!
Heads!
- Ed!
- Hurry up!
Shauny, look who it is.
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Ed!
- Shaun!
- Ed!
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!
I can't hold them!
No!
- Shaun!
- Pete!
I said leave him alone!
Ed. Ed!
Shaun, bar!
Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
What?
Chuck us a cloth, will you?
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.
Oh, fuck.
Ow!
Fuck it!
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!
- There's a hatch out on to the street.
- You mean go back outside?
Oh, give us a fucking break!
Go!
I can see the street.
Come on.
Come on!
Why won't it open?
That's it then, we're trapped.
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"
Whose fucking idea was that?
Man, I've really ballsed this up.
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.
Yeah, I suppose.
Do you think they'll get through?
Yeah.
How many shells have we got left?
Erm... two.
I suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line.
I wasn't thinking about them.
I know.
- What about Ed? There's only two shells.
- I don't mind being eaten.
How are we gonna do this?
I don't know. Erm...
One of us has to go first.
One should do the other and then do themselves.
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening.
What makes you think I've taken you back?
Well... you don't want to die single, do you?
Actually... I would like to be shot.
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise.
He hasn't.
Maybe we should have one now.
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.
- Sorry.
- I won't say anything.
Come on, we're getting out of here.
- I might just stay here.
- But we can get out.
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...
Maybe you should have this.
- Don't you want it?
- No.
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It's all right.
I'm sorry too.
It's OK.
No...
I'm sorry, Shaun.
Oh, God! That's not funny.
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I'm not laughing.
You'd better be off.
Bye, Ed. Love you.
Cheers.
I love you too, man.
Gay.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Section One. Ready.
Zombies to your front. Fire!
Fire!
Oh, my God! Shaun!
Yvonne?
- How are you doing?
- Surviving.
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might want to tag along.
Is it just the two of you?
Well, glad somebody made it.
Come on.
'Next, the story of ten-year-old Enrique Ramírez
'who fought off the reanimated corpses of his entire family.
'It's all coming right up on
Zombies From Hell.'
'Six months on and, to many, the events of Z-Day must seem like a bad dream.
'As we now know, the phenomenon resulted from the use of... '
'... not something I ever expected as a newscaster to have to say on air.
"'Removing the head or destroying the brain." Incredible.'
'... to have a top band with us, talking about their work for the charity Zombaid... '
'The fact that the mobile deceased retained their primal instincts
'make them ideal recruitment for the service industry,
'as well as other roles such as... '
'He can't quite get it.
Ooh! He's fallen, he's down! '
'I don't see nothing wrong with it but I know that some people would.
'But he's my husband, you know.
I still love him and I got the ring.
- 'You go to bed with it? '
- 'Course I do.'
'People can't understand why she's with him? '
'Initial claims that the virus was caused by infected monkeys have been dismissed... '
Hello.
What's the plan, then?
Right, a cup of tea... then we get the Sundays.
Head down the Phoenix for a roast, veg out in the pub for a bit then wander home, watch a bit of telly, go to bed.
- Perfik.
- I'll get the kettle on.
- Can I have two sugars, please?
- Ooh! Adventurous.
- I might pop into the garden for a bit.
- Go on, then.
Two seconds.
'Player two has entered the game.'
Ed!
Yes!
Roll camera.
And... begin.
Nice pussy.
Nice pussy.
Miaow.
You're very content right now, aren't you Ellen?
You live in a nice house...
You wear pretty clothes.
And you're married to a kind man who's promised to love you forever.
You have no inkling of what lives at the bottom of the flower box.
No sense of longing.
No notion even of death itself.
And...
...end. And print it.
Wolf, have we established pathos?
Perfectly, Herr Doctor.
And in one take.
Very well let's get the film to the lab immediately.
I'll need to see rushes tomorrow before the train in the morning.
Albin?
Yeah, Friedrich?
Hurry and strike your set, as you never hesitate to remind me, it's costing our investors a fortune daily.
Shooting outside the studios will cost them much more, Friedrich.
But such is the price of genius.
Thank God, an end to this artifice.
Nicely done, Greta.
You are developing in a number of lovely ways.
For a moment I even thought I saw a premonition of evil cross your face.
It wouldn't surprise me with all the spooky shit you've been saying to me.
I told you, it's important for the realistic effect.
But why do we have to leave Berlin just now, at the start of the theatre season?
- Albin, has your man arranged the cars?
- Yes, two.
Do you have any idea the parts I've been offered at long last? The salaries?
Will that be enough?
It has to be... they're the only cars in the region.
Herr Doctor, you're ignoring me.
There was a time when you didn't ignore me.
Why would you possibly want to act in a play when you can act in a film?
Atheatrical audience gives me life, while this thing merely takes it from me.
Greta...
Ellen is a woman who discovers... the ultimate expression of love... in the most exquisite pain imaginable.
Does that sound familiar?
It's a very demanding role.
It is the role that will make you great as an actress.
Consider it a sacrifice for your art.
Work quickly, ladies and gentlemen, we have a train to catch!
Hans...
Albin, what did you give the cat?
Laudanum.
Laudanum.
It's hard to keep the damn thing docile under the lights. Why, did it show?
It looked a little pickled.
Not as much as Greta.
Things seem to be well in hand here.
Friedrich.
Friedrich.
Friedrich, we have to talk about the vampire.
Not now, Albin, it's nearly dark.
Wrap things up for me here, will you?
Make sure the imbecile Gustav does not miss the train.
And I'll see you all in the morning.
But what kind of clothes should I pack for him?
What kind of make-up?
How tall is he?
Please tell me, Friedrich?
Does anybody know where he's running off to?
Perhaps he has a woman.
Or a man.
We cross the border into Czechoslovakia a few hours into our journey.
Apparently Herr Doctor's already filmed some of the exteriors there.
He has?
You didn't know?
No.
Strange. Well, you can assume we'll be filming all of Hutter's scenes there.
The scenes between him and the vampire.
I thought Dracula lived in Transylvania.
Strictly speaking, this is not Dracula.
The author's widow wouldn't sell us the rights to the novel.
So who's playing Count Dracula?
I mean, Orlock?
His name is Schreck.
Max Schreck.
Apparently he was in the Reinhardt
Company when Murnau was directing.
Schreck? Are you sure you have the name right?
He's a character actor.
Who told you he was playing the vampire?
Herr Doctor told me.
I never heard of any Max Schreck in the Reinhardt Company.
Herr Doctor told me he was with Stanislavsky in Moscow.
Oh dear, one of the
Russian school then.
As part of his preparation, he submerges his own personality into that of the character he's playing.
That is why he's not travelling with us.
Herr Doctor told me he went to Czechoslovakia weeks ago.
To absorb the flavour of the place,
I suppose.
Herr Doctor also told me... that when we get there and start filming...
Max Schreck will only appear to us in full make-up and costume... as the vampire.
And furthermore... we will only film him at night.
And why wasn't I told about it?
I'm the producer.
Well, he told me.
Tell me you're not too pretty to work for me?
Yes, sir.
I love the cinema.
Friedrich, I just realised this morning, our financiers, they don't know what picture you're making.
The crew don't know what picture you're making.
The cast don't know what picture you're making.
And now I don't know what picture you're making. Are you happy?
Albin...
I know, tell them nothing.
- Ah, yeah, there he is.
- There he is, getting on the train.
Gentlemen, I amn Albin Grau, producer and art director of this picture.
Is it true Murnau is filming
Stoker's Dracula?
Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau is Germany's greatest film maker.
In a class with such masters as Griffith and Eisenstein.
At present he is supervising every detail of this unique on location expedition.
- The major part, who's going to play?
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Will you be filming in Germany?
Paul, Paul.
Our battle, our struggle,
is to create art.
Our weapon is the moving picture.
Because we have the moving picture...
our paintings
will grow and recede.
Our poetry will be shadows
that lengthen and conceal.
Our light will play
across living faces
that laugh and agonise.
And our music will linger
and finally overwhelm
because it will have a context.
As certain as the grave.
We are scientists engaged
in the creation of memory.
But our memory
will neither blur... nor fade.
What is this?
It looks like... blood.
Good evening.
Herr Doctor... we've been expecting you.
- The wagon train has arrived.
- And here's the lead mule.
Well, what a terrible journey that was.
How long have you been here?
Not long.
Don't tell me, we have a busy schedule tomorrow?
No. Exterior shots of the inn.
Some shots in here.
Arrival of Hutter's carriage.
Welcome.
Welcome.
I'd like to plan for these night scenes.
When are they to be filmed?
They will be filmed soon...
They won't require... much planning.
But I need extra help to set up the lights.
Surely you can give me some notice so I can prepare?
Herr Doctor, where are the extras?
You're looking at them.
Herr Doctor, hese people cannot act.
They don't need to act.
They need to be.
Wolf?
Herr Muller?
I was... Sorry, Wolf.
All right, Hutter, it's been a fitful night but you wake refreshed... eager to continue your journey to the castle of the nobleman who may very well make your fortune.
Wait, Gustav.
What is that beside you?
Yes, pick it up.
It's a book... about vampires.
Ah... yes... now you remember.
It was put there last night by the superstitious peasants, the ones who warned you not to enter Orlock's castle.
The ones who warned you not even to dare to speak his name...
Nosferatu.
The unclean, the undead... least you evoke the creature itself.
Very good, Gustav
Herr Doctor...
Albin...
- I am sorry, Herr Doctor, but...
- Albin!
End.
Albin, a native has wandered into my frame!
Wolf.
Wolf!
What is the matter with everyone?
She will not let us go on filming, unless we replace the crosses.
Am I really being bothered with this?
Herr Doctor, I warned you.
You should be more concerned about these things.
The crosses are not for decoration.
We will put them back.
They just overwhelm our composition.
Albin, the camera.
- The head light should be sufficient.
- Henrik, what's this scene number?
Twenty-three.
Quickly.
Yes... Albin, that's fine, he'll take care of it.
Go in, Henrik.
On either side, you open the door when I give you the cue.
Ready? Are we ready?
Yeah, yeah.
And roll camera.
Iris in.
And...
...begin.
Gustav, you walk in very slowly.
Very slowly... yes.
Feel your bag, make sure you have your contracts.
You're afraid.
Who was the person who brought you?
You must go into the castle.
The castle calls you...
The gates suddenly open.
You must go in.
That's excellent, Gustav.
Go forward.
Go forward.
And, end.
Wolf?
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm in charge of set construction. Who built all this? We have an agreement!
Albin, I sent some local workers ahead this morning.
I'm sorry I didn't explain to you.
Please, there's a generator in the courtyard, just past the tree on the right, in the background. Get it working.
Henrik, take this camera.
- We have an agreement!
- Yes, stay here for a moment.
Wolf, your camera is here.
Set it up quickly as possible. Yes?
Roll camera.
Gustav... you move forward very slowly, heading always for the tunnel.
This is perfect.
Just a dark hole...
...that has been unexplored, untouched...
...for a long, long time.
And then... one night... something crawls out.
Hutter... meet Count Orlock.
Gustav, you must follow him into the tunnel.
Yes, going in.
Make your way down.
And...
...end.
Wolf?
My God.
Wolf!
Yeah, got it.
Remarkable.
The overture to our symphony of horrors.
Genius, Hutter. Genius.
He's not from the
Reinhardt Company.
Congratulations, Gustav.
Yes...
I was good, wasn't I?
I saw his face... his face.
Where did you find him, really?
In that hole.
Gustav... this was your finest moment.
Good, Gustav.
Gentlemen, let's pack up.
Shooting is completed for the night.
That's it? We came all the way for one scene?
I would have driven anywhere at any time for that look of Gustav's.
I would like to congratulate Schreck on his extraordinary appearance.
For the remainder of the shoot, he will be Count Orlock.
To himself and to all of us.
Just leave the man alone.
He will be completely authentic.
He is not interested in our questions, or our praise, or our conversations.
He's chasing an altogether different ghost.
Friedrich. Come quick, it's Wolf!
Muller, I can help you.
Help me.
Albin, you have the cameras safe?
Go, quickly.
- Is my room ready?
- Yes.
Nosferatu.
Ah, this is too much.
Answer me, Herr Doctor. Is this some stunt to evoke fear in us?
Henrik, stop being so theatrical.
You'll wake the whole house.
Go on up, Wolf, and have a brandy.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What's happened?
He's ill, obviously.
Take him upstairs and then go outside and help Herr
Grau with the camera equipment.
All right? Come on.
Bring the cameras straight to my room... prepare for tomorrow.
Albin, we need to clear the table.
We'll need the ink-well, the quill, and the contracts.
Yes, I...
I'd like it darker and smokier. Dustier.
Which case, Paul? Move that lamp to the far side and... and you, spread some dust on the corner. On the...
Ah, there you are.
It's incredible, no?
I wish you could all see your faces.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Max Schreck who will be portraying our vampire, Count Orlock.
As you no doubt have heard,
Max's methods are somewhat... unconventional.
But, I am sure you will come to respect his artistry in this matter.
Yes, places everybody.
May I have the chair, please?
Quickly.
Count Orlock, you will sit here at the head of the table.
Please.
Very good.
In this scene, the Count is reading the papers you've brought him... and you are about to make a considerable amount of money.
No, no make-up!
Forgive me, Herr Doctor.
Albin clear the set!
Elke...
Count, you're reading your documents.
That's it.
It isn't right.
Well, try acting it, for God's sake.
What should it say?
It's meant to be a contract... a real estate contract.
I'd like some make-up.
Well, you don't get any.
All right, are we ready to begin?
Elke, the phonograph.
Iris in.
And... concentrate... begin.
All right, Orlock, very good.
You are reading your papers.
Read your papers very intensely.
After all, how often is it that you get correspondence from the living?
No, don't look up.
Concentrate on your papers.
Not that you actually care about the details of the contract.
All you're interested in are all those juicy throats waiting for you the moment you get to Germany.
Ah now, Hutter, even though it may repel you... creep in... creep in.
Let us see the expectation on your face.
You're about to make the biggest sale of your life.
Point out a few details of the contract. Yes...
Tell him that, that's particularly beneficial to you.
Reach into your bag.
This will seal the deal and something falls out.
Count, what is it?
On your left, on the table.
It's a locket.
This is Greta Schroder.
No, no, you don't know her.
He's supposed to ask who it is.
No... End.
Jesus, Max...
Henrik, can you explain to him... his motivation?
All right, Count... think about this...
What is it that inspires... the most longing in you?
That is most desirable... and yet most unattainable?
The light... of the sun.
That is the emotion. Use it.
Nosferatu, you read your papers.
Roll, bitte.
Who is this woman?
It's Ellen, my wife.
She has a beautiful bosom.
Oh Jesus...
Gustav, just snatch it back from him.
Yes. Go on.
And, vampire, you sign the papers.
Take your quill, sign the papers.
Yes, go on.
I understand we are going to be neighbours.
Very nice addition, Count. Yes.
And, Hutter, how does that make you feel?
Yes. Snatch back your papers.
You're happy to be his neighbour?
And, iris out.
End!
Excellent.
Excellent.
Give the lip-readers a thrill.
Wolf, do you have it?
Yes, I got it.
Wolf, have you got it?
Yes, I said I got it!
Excellent. Thank you.
Do you think Schreck is all right?
We have left him up at that castle.
He's not in danger.
He's a fine actor, but, all this preparation, it's very strange.
You think it is strange enough for him to go so deep inside his character that he forgets he's
Max Schreck altogether?
God knows I forgot.
Schreck's peculiarities are like love-making games.
You believe them when they happen but they always stop short of anybody being seriously hurt.
The woods decay... the woods decay and fall... the vapours weep their burthen to the ground.
Dinner?
You set a very mean table.
No rats?
There was a time... when I fed... from golden chalices.
But now...
Don't look at me that way!
In my old age I feed... the way old men pee.
Sometimes all at once... sometimes drop by drop.
I told you...
I feed erratically... often enormously.
Yes, Max, you may give the locket to Elke.
Gustav, this is a scene from the previous night. You have met your host he has brought you home to his castle, he's giving you a dinner.
You can start eating.
Very well. Excellent. And, Orlock, you're merely reading your papers and totally ignoring your guest.
Good.
Wolf, roll camera... and... begin.
Yes.
A thought occurs to you.
Iook at your host.
Very good, Gustav.
Do you think... he might have been the stranger who drove you to the castle?
You watch... is he even human?
How does it feel to be eating next to him?
Knowing that you're spending the night with him... in the castle, alone.
You watch him.
Orlock, drop your paper.
You look at Gustav.
Gustav, keep watching him.
Take your right hand and reach for the bread knife.
Watch him... breathing.
What will happen?
Reach out, take the loaf of bread... and cut yourself a slice.
Yes, slicing, slicing...
You are slicing.
Ttoward you, toward you... watching him...
...slicing, slicing, watch out... slicing...
Watch your finger!
Damn it!
Look, Nosferatu!
Blood, blood!
Damn it, Murnau.
I really did cut myself!
- Paul, go and check the generator.
- You did that intentionally!
- Calm down!
- I'll see to the light.
- That knife was sharpened like a razor!
- Gustav, remain in character!
Jesus Christus get this off me!
Schreck!
What is the matter with you?
He's a Stanislavsky lunatic, that is what is the matter with him!
I contracted you in secrecy and at great expense.
Herr Muller, when will you have your equipment functioning properly?
I am tired of your lack of enthusiasm!
I saw you.
Gustav... bring the girls to the car.
- I am not happy!
- Gustav, move.
Herr Doctor, the man is barely breathing.
I told you to fix the generator!
No, leave the equipment and take the camera.
We are done here for today,
Herr Doctor.
Albin!
Help me.
Everybody to the automobile.
Herr Doctor, we're leaving.
No...
He stays.
Albin...
Yes, Friedrich?
Do you think Wolf's assistant can finish this film?
Paul? No. He has not enough experience.
What about you?
You are the closest we have to a photographer.
What are you talking about?
The film ends here.
No, Henrik... this film will go on.
Henrik, this film cannot survive even the briefest interruption.
The financiers would take control.
They hate your script.
Actually, it may be advantageous because it makes the crew very edgy and I like that.
Do you hear what you are saying?
You're out of your fucking mind, you're a fanatic!
Please, don't behave like children.
I'll get a new photographer and fly him back here within the week.
Henrik, when you wrote this scenario, you had demons of your own to work out, did you not?
Now I have mine.
Albin... you're the producer... keep this company together.
How dare you destroy my photographer!
You idiot!
Did I kill some of your people, Murnau?
I can't remember.
We have an arrangement!
Don't pretend you mourn,
Herr Doctor. I know you.
Why him, you monster?
Why not the script girl?
The script girl...
I'll eat her later.
No, you will not!
Our bargain, you agreed not to hurt my people!
Listen to me, do you understand?
This requires that
I go back to Berlin to find another photographer and then to fly him back here.
And you will control yourself while I am away.
I don't think we need the writer any longer.
I don't expect you to understand this and I am loathed to admit it myself... but, the writer is necessary.
All my crew is necessary.
Do you understand?
I don't think the ship is necessary.
What?
The ship...
The ship?
My God, what are you talking about?
I have a dozen scenes on the ship.
But I won't sail.
Then I will replace you with a double!
I will do every scene of yours with a double.
You, you will have no close-ups.
None whatsoever.
How dare you speak to me that way.
I have shots!
I am the director!
Why didn't you mention this before?
You want to eat the writer?
Be my guest.
That will leave you to explain how else your character is supposed to get to Bremen?
Yes...
I will... shoot the scenes at sea around you.
But you will still have to sail to Heligoland for your death scene.
Or else what?
Or else?
Or else...
...no Greta.
We shoot her scenes there.
I'll go to Heligoland... but I won't sail.
Heligoland is an island.
So?
So it can only be reached by sea.
Or air.
And if I agree to fly you in... you will leave my people alone.
Or else what?
Don't think I can't harm you.
Tell me how you would harm me... when even I don't know how I could harm myself.
But thy strong hours indignant work'd their wills... and beat me down... and marr'd and wasted me... and though they could not end me... left me maim'd to dwell in presence of immortal youth.
Immortal age... beside immortal youth.
And all I was in ashes.
Albin, what is the most wondrous thing you have ever seen?
Er...
I saw ectoplasm once.
Ectoplasm?
What is ectoplasm?
It's the mystical substance of ghosts.
I saw a spiritualist pull it out of his mouth in Italy.
What did it look like?
Seaweed.
Is that what we look like when we die?
I hope not.
What was for you the most, wondrous thing you ever saw?
I once saw Greta Schroeder naked.
No?
Yes.
That beats ectoplasm.
Jesus, Max, you scared me to death.
How long have you been listening?
We've been looking all over the place for your coffin.
Maybe it isn't his resting place.
Didn't we have something to say to him?
Max, the great Friedrich Wilhelm
Murnau went to Berlin
- to find a new photographer.
- Wolf is probably dead.
So you can take your funny ears off.
Albin, please, the man is an artist.
Ask him some vampire questions.
When did you become a vampire?
I can't recall.
Where were you born?
Were you born?
I can't remember.
It's not funny any more.
Count Dracula wouldn't say,
"couldn't remember".
I read that book.
Murnau gave it to me.
Now, this is a golden opportunity.
Speaking as a vampire, what do you make of the book's technical merits?
It made me sad.
Why sad?
Because Dracula had no servants.
I think you missed the point of the book, Count Orlock.
Dracula... hasn't had servants in four hundred years.
And then a man comes to his ancestral home and he must convince him that he, that he's like the man.
He has to feed him... when he himself hasn't eaten food in centuries.
Can he even remember how to buy bread?
How to select cheese and wine?
And then he remembers the rest of it... how to prepare a meal, how to make a bed.
He remembers... his past glory his armies, his retainers, and what he is reduced to.
The loneliest part of the book... comes when the man... accidentally sees Dracula... setting his table.
But if you're so lonely why don't you make more vampires?
I can't, I'm too old.
Although...
I seem to remember
I was never able to.
Then how did you become a vampire?
It was woman.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Schreck, the German theatre needs you.
We were together in the night and then she left me.
At first I had a painting of her in wood.
Then I had a relief of her in marble.
And then...
I had a picture of her, in my mind.
But now I no longer even have that.
What was I saying?
This schnapps they make in these parts.
I haven't tasted it in...
Take it easy there, old boy.
Henrik... what an actor.
Yeah.
Dedication.
Herr Schreck.
Herr Doctor.
Herr Doctor.
You wanted reality,
Herr Doctor, here it is.
Ah, I'm not a doctor, but I have dabbled in pharmaceuticals.
- You're the new cameraman, right?
- Yeah.
- We tried shoot it now.
- Ah, good.
- Art can never move as fast as life.
- Sure it can.
So, what's the lens?
It's thirty-five millimetre, sir.
Not my ideal weapon of choice, but I suppose it'll do...
Are you loaded?
- Yes, sir.
- Good, so am I.
Move the camera ten centimetres to the right and I'll contrive a possible two shot, but, wait for my signal.
- Did you get the shot?
- Yes, sir.
And the gate is clean?
The gate's clean, sir.
I hadn't time to properly prepare the shot...
What I should have done was filmed the thing in slow motion.
It would have been incredibly moving.
What's that, sir, slow motion?
Well I run the film through the camera too fast...
When it's projected at normal speed, things appear to be unnaturally slow.
Gives everything a kind of resonance.
It's a shame you won't have the chance to demonstrate your more esoteric skills on my production.
I'm Albin Grau, he producer.
And at dawn, Hutter tried to fathom the horrors of his nights.
Excellent.
Fritz, roll camera.
Iris in.
Begin.
And end.
Excellent, Gustav.
Extraordinary discipline in the face of ridicule.
Fritz?
Yes, well, that's his performance style.
Yes, I'd like to move in for another angle on the crypt.
Mark the shot with some chalk.
I am exhausted now, and I'm hungry as well.
You will get a hot meal in Wismar right after we're done with the ship.
And, end.
Have you ever considered acting?
No, really, you have a very interesting face.
Are you a producer?
Why can't Herr Doctor film in a studio like everybody else?
Henrik, would you take my dog for me?
- And thank you. Lovely.
- Yes.
Wismar, is there anything here that even vaguely resembles a cabaret?
I mean, I'm suffering for my art, Albin, believe me.
What's going on here, anyway?
You know, Friedrich tells me to lock my door at night.
And Gustav says everybody's vanishing.
And you can imagine what they're saying in Berlin.
Hello, Greta.
Hello.
You look vaguely familiar.
Where did we meet?
Morocco.
- Yes, you brought me treats.
- Ja, ja.
What was your name again?
It's...
Fritzie.
- Fritzie.
- Yes, Fritzie.
Fritzie?
- Would you care tojoin us for a drink?
- No, no.
We have to pre-light the set, yeah?
What? What set? What the hell are you talking about?
We need you to see the sets with us tonight.
Well, give me back my dogs then.
Here.
- Thank you, yes.
- You're welcome.
Left all alone as usual.
Come here, Fru-Fru.
She's here, isn't she?
The glorious child.
No.
I want to see her now.
No!
I won't act for you again until you bring her to me.
You are destroying everything.
My people have to trust me for you to get what you want!
You and I are not so different.
Greta is in your last scene, that is when you can have her.
After my death scene?
Yes.
Don't expect realism there,
Murnau.
What do you mean?
Don't cheat me, mortal.
You will stay away from her.
You will stay away from my crew!
I will finish my picture!
This is hardly your picture any longer.
You are ready?
Yes, Henrik.
Right...
He was amazing because he has...
What a horrible smell.
Mind your head.
This is it.
He's in here?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
That answers that question.
How did you find this place?
I followed Murnau here.
I think you're in the wrong part of the building.
There's probably a sadistic brothel upstairs.
What's wrong?
It's all right.
Everyone back to bed.
Greta...
Greta, what is it?
Greta, what is it?
Greta, Greta...
What's happened, Greta?
Please.
It's morphine.
Morphine?
Photography and pharmaceuticals by
Fritzie. That's just what I need.
Friedrich knows all about it.
What do you mean, he knows about it?
He knows all about it.
She's fine.
Don't worry, get some sleep.
Are you all right there?
This set is not ready.
Can we get any natural light in here?
The set is not ready, and you're talking about natural light.
What's the matter with you, Albin?
You seem a little anxious lately.
You don't understand, I'm ruined.
I'll never make another picture again.
My reputation gone and you talk about natural light.
Please, Fritz...
Don't worry...
- It's the same on every picture.
- Not on my picture!
Friedrich open up.
It's me, Albin.
Friedrich, let us in.
Ah, Jesus!
What is it?
It's laudanum, that's what it is.
There is no Max Schreck.
If he's not Max Schreck, who is he?
I don't know.
Where did you find him?
In a book... when I was a student.
A series of paintings portraying a long line of despotic kings, rumoured to be vampire living in Slovakia for hundreds for years.
I had forgotten all about it until she gave me that other book.
What other book, Friedrich?
Dracula.
Then I went to scout locations and there he was living in an old monastery.
What kind of bond did you make with him?
That he would play the part of an actor playing the part of a vampire.
Why?
What did you offer him in return?
Everlasting life... and Greta.
Greta?
How could you do this, Friedrich?
I did it for science.
To preserve it for posterity.
Friedrich! Friedrich!
He's he's gone.
Come on.
What are we going to do?
The call is for two o'clock.
Albin, listen to me.
There's no way off this island.
What about the aeroplane...?
No, I already checked it.
The fuel tanks are empty.
God!
No.
We're going to have to film
Schreck's scene tonight.
You know I don't like these late shoots, Friedrich.
Where is everybody?
Why don't I have an assistant?
Greta...
Did you put on this make-up with a broom?
Stop fussing, Albin.
You look beautiful.
Can I have a cigarette?
Sure.
Where's my script, Henrik?
He's indisposed.
What's the matter with him?
Greta, don't ask so many questions, we're busy.
Thank you, darling.
Why does everybody look so depressing?
Hey, who died?
Jesus! Look at you.
Friedrich.
Herr Doctor!
Yes, Greta, what is it?
What's the shot?
What are we doing here?
Can you stand for me?
Look at you.
Yes, very well.
Now, let us take her robe,
Albin, please.
And she'll need her wooden stake.
Also, Greta, you will be here, lying on the bed.
Yes.
Now, Greta...
Good.
Now... in this scene... you make the ultimate sacrifice for love. Yes?
Yes.
You will seduce the Count... and... with your wooden stake, just before, you die, you will despatch him. Yes?
Thank you. Very good.
Now...
In other words, all you have to do... is, as they say, relax and the vampire will do all the work.
You had me leave rehearsals in Berlin just to do that?
Hey, watch it, handsome!
Fifty-two, one.
And for your lean in, please, Herr Schreck.
Thank you.
And, Albin, her shoes, please.
Yes.
We must go.
Friedrich.
Yes?
I don't wish to question your authority, but, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Yes, exactly. Roll camera...
And, Fritz, ready?
Higher.
Albin.
And... iris in.
End.
What happened?
- I saw he, he casts no...
- I'm tired of waiting.
- Calm down.
- No, he casts no reflection.
I see him. No, look at him.
Look at him!
Look! Please help me.
Help me please, Friedrich.
- I'll give you something to calm you.
- No, don't do that.
- Just to calm you. Yes?
- Albin, look at him, please.
Please, please, please.
No.
But still, I don't understand what... No!
It is the role that will make you great as an actress.
Consider it a sacrifice for your art.
That's better, now we can work in peace.
I want her now.
No, I need a shot f you clutching your heart first.
My death scene?
Yes, you must do that for me.
Very well.
Roll camera... and begin.
Yes, Count. You kneel down. You'll have your head on her shoulder, but you're not feeding, Count.
No, you're not drinking her blood now, because you have been drinking her blood all night.
In fact, you can barely move.
You are intoxicated with, with blood and desire.
Greta, can you hear me?
Yes?
Flutter your eyelids.
Yes, now, Greta, you start... to awaken...
Find your stake.
Yes, where is it?
Find your stake.
Now, Count, as she raises her stake, what do you see?
Yes, a wooden stake, exactly.
You look at her... betrayed.
Yes, you turn...
You rise...
You look around.
The sun is coming.
You grab your heart in anguish.
Yes, and you start to die.
Yes, you start to die alone.
In anguish.
Die, you you fucking rat bastard.
Vampire pig, schweine-hund shit!
Yes, die alone! Yes, the weight of the centuries burns you!
And...
End!
Fritz?
Ja, got it.
That's enough, Murnau.
Hey!
Okay, ja.
I want her now!
Go to hell, Murnau!
Begin!
Very good, yes.
And slowly we need to move the camera.
Friedrich...
Friedrich he cut the chain we're trapped.
So, you would break our bargain?
You think you know so much... but I can still kill you.
I can break your necks... drink your blood...
And I could you tried to trick me!
It's daybreak, is it?
So what? All I need... is to sleep in darkness.
I will stay here until dusk... and then... only I will walk out alive.
Idiot.
Frankly, Count, I find this composition unworkable.
Could you return to your original mark, please?
If it's not in frame, it doesn't exist.
Then finally you must turn to meet the sun.
The death of centuries... moon chaser, blasphemer... monkey, vase of prehistory.
Finally to earth and finally born.
Yes...
Yes.
You take the sun.
Albin, could you quickly collect the wooden stake and return it to it's rightful place?
It is necessary for the final frame.
To remind us of the inadequacy our plans... our contingencies... every missed train, the failed picnics... every lie to a child.
Softly, please.
Our work is nearly complete.
Our very own painting on our very own cave wall.
Time will no longer be a dark spot on our lungs.
They will no longer be able to say:
"You would have to have been there".
Because, the fact is, Albin... we were.
Is there one among you who might wear the mantle of camera assistant?
Could I possibly impose on you to collect the slate at my feet and provide me with an end board?
Turn it.
Thank you.
I think we have it.
Shouldn't be much farther to the cabin, Betty.
Gee, I like this mountain road.
Yes. The scenery certainly is lovely to look at.
If you like scenery.
Pull up here, why don't you, and I'll check the map.
- Make sure we're not lost.
- Yeah.
Seriously, Paul, I do wish this was a vacation.
You could use a break from all this scientist work.
It's almost as if you've been doing too much science.
Too much science?
Is that possible?
Betty, you know what this meteor could mean to science.
If we find it, and it's real, it could mean a lot.
It could mean actual advances in the field of science.
No, I know. I'm used to it, I guess.
You might say I'm a scientist's wife.
There's a lot in what you say, Betty.
In many ways, it's hard to be a scientist's wife, the wife of a scientist.
And yet, in other ways, it's good.
Really good.
You always know the right thing to say, Dr. Paul Armstrong.
There's a farmer up ahead there.
Why don't we ask him directions.
Excuse me. Can you tell us the way to the old Taylor place?
Sure thing, mister.
Stay on this road here.
Past Dead Man's Curve, you'll come to a fence...
...called the Devil's Fence.
From there, go on foot...
...till you come to a valley known as the Cathedral of Lost Soap.
Smack in the center is what they call Forgetful Milkman's Quadrangle.
Stay right on the
Path of Staring Skulls...
...and you come to a place called Death Clearing.
Cabin's right there. Can't miss it.
Boy, that doesn't sound too inviting.
Well, lot of folks superstitious in these parts...
...what with the legend of Cadavra Cave and all.
Next you'll be telling us there's monsters.
Quiet day.
I certainly hope someone needs a forest ranger here sometime.
Hello. I'm Dr. Roger Fleming, and I seem to have lost my way.
I'm Ranger Brad, and that's what I'm here for.
You can call me Ranger Brad.
Most folks do.
Yes. Ranger Brad.
Of course. I like that.
Do you think you could tell me the way to Cadavra Cave?
Cadavra Cave?
Why do you wanna go there?
Ranger Brad, do I tell you all your ranger business?
No, I guess not. Keep going on this trail about a mile.
You can't miss it.
Thank you, Ranger Brad.
You've been very helpful.
Anytime.
Oh, say.
You don't believe those legends about the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, do you?
Ranger Brad, I'm a scientist.
I don't believe in anything.
Nice fellow.
Paul, is it much farther?
My legs are already starting to feel like two heavy, slow things.
Soon I won't feel like I have legs anymore, they're already so tired.
Shouldn't be too much farther, Betty.
And then you can rest and I can do science.
What was that about being a scientist's wife?
Look. They've got the right idea.
This looks like the cabin, all right.
Looks okay from the outside.
But what's the inside like, I wonder.
I think the front's around here.
Oh, Paul, it's everything
I dreamed it'd be.
Is it? Gee, that's wonderful, honey.
What is it, darling?
Oh, I don't know.
As a scientist, I just wish I could appreciate more things, like...
...cabins, bicycles.
I know. You're too wrapped up in your work.
That's why you need to get away from this silly old meteor.
Get away from it? I feel like
I haven't even got near it yet.
This silly old meteor, as you call it, could be made of atmosphereum.
Do you know what that could mean for mankind?
Oh, tell you what, Betty, once my meteor studying is done...
...what say you and I take some time off...
...take the boat out on the lake, just the two of us?
- Oh, Paul, do you really mean it?
- Scientist's honor.
Wait a minute.
We don't have a boat.
- Oh, you.
- I want you to know...
...if we did have a boat, you'd be the first person I'd take out on it, kitten.
Dinner was delicious, honey.
Keep cooking like that and I won't be able to move, let alone do science.
That'd suit me fine, Mr. Meteor.
Ouch, that hurt. Tomorrow, what say you and I go searching...
...for our rocky, glowing, radioactive friend from space together?
Paul Armstrong, I do believe there's hope for you yet.
Shake on it?
Why shake when we can touch other things? Like lips.
Oh, Paul, could that be your meteor?
My meteor's already landed, honey.
That'd be scientifically impossible.
Right. Who ever heard of a meteor going back to space?
There must be another meteor altogether.
I wonder.
I also wonder.
Now, see here. What's got my cows all-fired riled?
It's okay, Bossy, I'm here now.
There, there, Bossy. There, there.
No. No. You're not Bossy.
You're not Bossy.
Well, time to find a meteor.
Looks like a perfect day for hunting space rocks, wouldn't you say, Betty?
Oh, Paul, I'm frightened.
What is it, darling?
What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't know.
Nothing I can put my finger on.
Not something I can see or touch or feel...
...but something I can't quite see or touch or feel...
...or put my finger on.
- Oh, well. Shall we find that meteor?
- Yes, of course.
According to my map, Cadavra Cave should be around here somewhere.
Any readings, as you call them?
Nothing yet.
According to my calculations...
...the meteor must have crashed right around here.
And that machine, or whatever it is, will tell you where?
Yes, it's tuned to detect atmosphereum...
...which is what I'm convinced the meteor was made of.
Incredible.
Either that's a reading or my teeth chattering.
We've picked up something that's not teeth. That's strange.
I hope it doesn't mean one of us ate atmosphereum.
This is serious. The readings are getting stronger, but we're not moving.
But something else is moving, and it's moving right for us.
Whatever it is, it's gone now.
You all right?
I think so.
Whatever was watching us seemed pretty big.
Worse than that, Betty.
Whatever it was, it's lousy with atmosphereum.
This is it. This has to be it.
Cadavra Cave.
It's you, isn't it? It's really you.
At last, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
And this little find, this pile of old bones, as some would call it...
...will make me, Dr. Roger Fleming...
...the most powerful man in the world.
It is safe, she who is my wife.
You may come out now.
Are you certain, Kro-bar, my husband?
This world is strange to us, even different.
Yes, it is different, this Earth, as it is called.
But then, are we of the planet Marva, as we call our planet...
...not also strange and different to this planet and its people also?
You think the Earth people think we are strange, you think?
It is strange how the ways of people on different planets differ, is it not?
Marva. Earth. Marva. Earth.
I see what you mean.
Oh, well. Come.
Let us ready the preparations.
I'll get the things we need to repair our ship...
...which is broken, in the crash on this alien planet that we had.
You know, it's funny...
...but in a strange way,
I could feel almost at home here.
- Oh, well.
- Kro-bar. Kro-bar!
The Mutant. It's gone.
But how can this be?
Was not the Mutant cage sealed?
Oh, yes, I swear it was, my husband.
And the Mutant lock was secured.
Maybe the special bars on the
Mutant cage got bent in the crash.
Oh, this is fine. Fine. Now we must not only repair our ship...
...we must find our Mutant, which we were to return to our planet, Marva.
Or who knows how many untold millions will die by its hand.
If only it did have hands, my woman.
If only it did have hands.
Oh, why isn't it working?
Why are you not coming to life, my Skeleton? Why?
Have I wronged you in some way?
You're against me, aren't you?
Of course you are.
All skeletons are against me.
They always have been.
Even when I was a child,
I was hated by skeletons.
Stop your blubbering, mortal fool.
Who is it? Who are you?
Show yourself.
Who do you think it is, idiot?
It is I, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
- Then you are alive!
- That is how stupid you are.
Only my skeleton brain lives. The rest of me is still just lifeless bone.
But there is a way to bring me completely back to life.
What is it? You have but to say it,
O Skeleton, and I will do it.
There is a radioactive element known as atmosphereum.
- You must find this and bring it to me.
- I will.
I'll find atmosphereum and bring it to you.
That's what I just suggested.
When I am brought to life...
...together, you and I will rule the world together.
But how? How will I find it?
That is for you to know.
That's not my problem. I sleep now.
No. No, tell me where it is.
Skeleton? Skeleton?
Where? Where can
I find this atmosphereum?
That's it, Paul. You've found it.
Yes. This meteor will be the world's greatest source of atmosphereum.
Look at it glow.
It's almost lulling, in a way.
Careful, don't fall in love with that stuff.
That atmosphereum can do some mighty powerful things.
Can I believe the luck?
Atmosphereum under my very nose.
If it were a woman, it could kiss me.
Hold on, my Skeleton.
For soon you shall have life.
Sweet life.
Is it so hopeless, my Kro-bar?
Lattis, I fear our power source...
...the power that runs this ship, is gone.
Without it, I fear we have no hope of ever seeing Marva, our planet, again.
Then we must find the power source.
Yes. We must hope that this planet, this Earth...
...contains that rarest of all radioactive elements: Atmosphereum.
Oh, well. Meantime,
I will hunt for the Mutant...
...with this transmutatron.
I only hope it didn't kill already while it roamed last night.
Leave me now.
Our Mutant must be around here somewhere.
When I find it, our transmutatron will change it to a more harmless creature.
That might be the Mutant now.
With this atmosphereum, Betty, mankind can benefit in many ways...
...many of them good.
- I know.
Kro-bar! Kro-bar!
What is it? You need not yell, because of my proximity.
I yell not from the volume required by great distance, but from excitement.
- Two Earth people...
- There are many Earth people.
Speak specifically. What's special about these two that warrants interest?
- Surely nothing.
- These two, as you call them...
...have atmosphereum.
I hope the owners don't mind their dishes holding a radioactive meteor.
Don't eat the meteor by mistake, whatever you do.
Seriously, we'll clean the dishes before we go.
- Oh, Paul, it's so exciting.
- I know.
I've got to get that meteor.
But how? How?
There must be a way inside that cabin.
Think. Think.
Cabin. Cabin. Cabin.
What's that?
Good work, Lattis.
The human whereabouter has led us right to where the humans are.
Evidently, these beings like primitive, almost rustic structures.
How foolish they are.
Aliens, from outer space.
Careful, my love, for we must seem to like such things now...
...like this foolish structure and all things human.
I catch on, my Kro-bar.
Almost as if we were pretending.
Pretending. I like the way you put things, my queen.
Mysterious, and yet still perfectly understandable.
Oh, well, we waste time on amusement. On with the pretending.
Thanks to the transmutatron, we will look exactly like the human beings.
How strange these beings be.
This neck restrainer is most uncomfortable...
...and what function must it serve?
- I don't know, my husband.
I am strangely drawn to this inverted cloth funnel...
...and its wonderful softness.
Careful, Lattis. You may grow to like being human.
My husband would joke with me.
Come. Go.
The atmosphereum awaits.
We cannot take the transmutatron in with us. It would be difficult to explain.
We'll leave it here in case the Mutant comes, so we can render it harmless.
What are they, Kro-bar?
A series of small buildings leading up to the main one.
And what are we to do?
Step on them until we are high enough to enter.
Well, darling, have you made science history yet?
If you keep distracting me, I'll never change the course of mankind.
Well, maybe we can do that without atmosphereum.
- Who can that be?
- Someone who's an interrupter.
This appears to be an entrance of some sort.
Then why isn't it opening, my love?
- Oh, I'm scared.
- This is insane.
This makes no sense, I tell you.
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?
Calm, Lattis. There must be some explanation. There has to be.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Why doesn't this entrance open?
They'll know.
They'll know everything now.
What can we do? What can we do to make this entrance open?
- Hello.
- Hello.
There is a way in. I knew it.
Can we help you?
- You would help us?
- I don't understand.
Oh, you must be the Taylors.
Of course.
These are the people that rented us the cabin.
- They said they might stop up.
- How are you? I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
This is my wife, Betty.
We didn't catch your first names.
Our first names are the names that were given us first, obviously.
Well, what shall we call you?
Oh, our Earth names.
I am Tergasso...
...and this is...
- I am Bammon.
Tergasso, Bammon, won't you come in?
- Yes, we have been desiring that.
- Finally we go in.
Won't you make yourselves comfortable?
I'm not sure. How would one go about finding that out?
- Please, please, be seated.
- Fold yourself in the middle.
Can we get you anything?
A drink, perhaps?
Yes, liquid, please.
A man who gets right to the point.
I like that.
How about four Scotch and sodas?
My, that's a lovely dress, Tergasso.
Yes. Yes, I, too, thought this.
I almost felt it somehow.
That is what I told Kro-bar.
Who's Kro-bar?
- Is he the designer?
- Yes. Yes, Kro-bar is the designer.
Well, you're going to have to tell me where their store is.
My wife does not like to talk about a store.
We are just like you, really,
I assure you.
Yes, I also appreciate your soft cloth funnel, Betty.
Four drinks, coming up.
Here's to one heck of a beautiful cabin.
- Tergasso certainly was thirsty.
- Who?
I'll seem suspicious if I come alone.
I know.
Those forest animals standing right there have given me an idea.
I watched the aliens work this thing.
Maybe if I make myself a date,
I won't seem so alone.
I never thought I'd have a date with an animal.
Relax, my pet. I am your friend.
More than a friend, I suppose, since I created you.
But I must give you a name.
To us, you and I, you shall be Animala.
I find that name appropriate somehow.
But to the others, to those inferior to you and I, you shall be...
...Pammy.
So, Bammon, what do you do?
Do? I can do anything.
I have no restrictions.
That's the spirit.
I'm the same way with science.
I like my dress so very much.
That's what I can do.
This drink is very refreshing.
Thank you, Paul and Betty.
Oh, not at all.
I have an overwhelming desire to participate...
...in the purchasing of many cloth funnels...
...some I can't even spare the expense for.
Is that so very wrong?
Oh, shopping. Yes. No. No, not at all.
Shopping isn't wrong at all...
...especially for a woman.
Sometimes I wish it were.
Right, Bammon?
I wouldn't know about that, Paul.
Shopping can be loads of fun.
With a little restraint, of course.
Gee, thanks, honey.
Obviously there is much humor in what you say.
In Paul's line of work, he can use a good laugh.
It can be so deadly boring sometimes.
Even I admit that.
Well, as long as everything is perfectly normal.
I certainly am a normal Earth woman.
Isn't that right, my little space comet?
Stop that! My love.
My wife sometimes forgets she is not a space alien.
Won't you please be seated, my dear?
Won't you please be seated, my dear?
May I say you look lovely this evening?
In English, my dear.
Thank you so very much.
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Yes, please.
No, no, no.
Drink like I showed you.
Tip, tip, tip.
And again. Tip, tip, tip.
There.
- Very well-done, my dear.
- Very well-done, my dear.
Yes, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss my work...
...Bam... Bannon... Bam... Bammon.
Oh, that is unfortunate, Paul.
I like work very much.
I'm very interested in it.
That's a very healthy attitude, Bam.
If more Americans thought like that...
...a lot more work would sure get done.
- Do you like to cook, Tergasso?
- I...
I don't really know.
- I'll get it. This is a day for visitors.
- I wouldn't know, Paul.
Good evening.
My name is Rudolph Yaber, and this is my wife, Pammy Yaber.
Our car broke down, and I fear, I'm afraid, we're dreadfully lost, I'm afraid.
- Isn't that right, my dear?
- Always agree.
Come in. We've plenty of room.
You're welcome to stay the night.
I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong and this is Bammon Taylor.
Hello.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm Betty Armstrong and this is Tergasso Taylor.
- Hello.
- Won't you join us for dinner?
My charming wife and I would be delighted.
Thank you.
After the eating is done,
I must look for the atmosphereum.
How do we know their eating customs?
Do exactly as they do, Lattis, and we cannot fail to convince them.
Tip, tip, tip.
Tip, tip, tip.
This meal looks quite delightful, Betty.
Oh, it's just something
I threw together, that's all.
Well, shall we dig in?
Everyone's so hungry.
I think somebody ate too fast.
No. No, my Pammy is very attuned to the ways of nature.
She must have pretty good hearing.
Let's go see what it is. Just the men go. You ladies stay here.
Bammon, will you join us?
Unless there's something we should know about.
No. You know everything.
I will go also.
I hope it's nothing too dangerous.
Careful. It could be a mutant.
Sorry, folks, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Ranger Brad.
Thank goodness it's only a forest ranger, honey.
Hi, I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
The meteor specialist?
Say, this is an honor.
Oh, hello, Dr. Fleming.
I see we meet again.
- Dr. Fleming?
- Oh, just an old nickname of mine.
I'm really Rudolph Yaber.
And this is my wife, Pammy.
She's lost her purse again.
We'll find it later, sweetheart.
All right?
Crumbs.
- Please, won't you have a seat?
- I don't mind sitting sometimes.
Now.
Say, I didn't know anyone was staying at the old Taylor place.
Yes, we are.
Oh, and here's the Taylors, right here.
The Taylors? I recall they were older folks.
We are a younger version.
Say, I didn't know the Taylors had any kids. That's swell.
I don't wanna frighten you folks...
...but a farmer nearby was horribly mutilated.
I thought I should tell other folks, like yourselves...
...so that maybe, just maybe, you wouldn't be horribly mutilated too.
Well, I've certainly never been horribly mutilated, but I don't wanna start now.
This certainly throws a damper on the evening.
I didn't mean to throw a damper.
Believe me, that's the last thing I'd like to throw.
I don't wanna throw anything at all, but when folks are mutilated...
...I feel it's my job to tell others.
We take our horrible mutilations seriously up in these parts.
I'm sure you do.
Honey, the ranger's just doing his job.
Of course he is.
I'm sorry, Ranger Brad.
I guess all this talk of horrible mutilation has me on edge.
That's all right, Dr. Armstrong.
This horrible mutilation has a whole lot of people on a whole lot of edges.
Well, if there's no more talk for us now, I guess I'll be on my way.
I'll see you to the door.
Tell me, ranger, any idea what might've caused...
...this horrible mutilation, as you call it?
Oh, probably nothing to worry about.
Could be a bear, I suppose.
Can a bear do that?
I mean, horribly mutilate?
Dr. Armstrong...
...in my time,
I guess I've seen bears...
...do some things that even a bear wouldn't do.
Well, good night.
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Yaber.
Mutilate. Mutant.
I wonder.
Oh, well.
Oh, well. Better get home.
Say, I must be crazy, walking out in these woods alone at night...
...with a horrible mutilation practically around the corner.
Oh, well.
What a night.
Glad I don't believe in things.
What's that?
This is crazy.
Things like this just don't happen.
Noises?
Noises in the woods?
Stay away.
Stay away!
What's that?
What's that?
No. No!
Goodness.
- What in heaven's name was that?
- Sounded like an Earth scream.
It's too late. There's nothing you can do for him now.
I might be just a test-tube-tipping lab jockey...
...who's looked at too many shiny rocks for far too long...
...but something tells me you know more about this than you're letting on.
No, Paul Armstrong. I know only what my ears tell me.
- And what my eyes see me.
- Now, wait a second.
Surely you don't believe those legends about the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
Surely those are old wives' tales.
And believe me,
I've known plenty of old wives.
Seriously, Bammon, is that what you're suggesting? A living skeleton?
Did I say that? Did I say anything about a skeleton?
No one mentioned a skeleton.
Why, we don't even know about skeletons.
My husband spoke not of skeletons but of another, more different thing...
...which he was speaking of.
Which he and I know and you do not.
Animala.
Animala.
Skeleton. Skeleton.
Animala.
You must find the atmosphereum.
Stop it. Stop it!
What are you doing?
She can't help you.
You must find the atmosphereum.
Amish terrarium.
Must find Amish terrarium.
I don't understand. Why does she need an Amish terrarium?
Don't the Amish live in open air, like us?
Of course, Betty. It's absurd.
Putting the Amish in glass cases would be inhumane.
Surely Pammy doesn't realize what she's saying.
Obey me! Obey me or I'll...
You fool. You skinny, bony jackass!
Stop it or you'll spoil everything!
I will get the...
Amish terrarium myself.
I cannot wait so long.
She. She will help me,
the housewifely one.
Hi, Betty.
It's I, the Skeleton.
Fetch the meteor, Betty.
Fetch the meteor.
The Betty one looks drowsy.
Now is the time...
...to exert Marvan mind-power on her.
- Very well.
I must go to bed and make some coffee now.
Darling, what are you saying?
I don't think I understand.
How can you make coffee if you're in bed?
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
I must make the Skeleton meatier using a crowbar covered in lettuce.
Darling, please, you're not making any sense.
Betty.
Betty, what are you doing?
What I should've done a long time ago, Paul.
- What are you saying?
- Leave her, Paul.
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.
Sleepwalker? She hasn't even gone to bed yet, Rudolph. Betty.
Betty, you little fool, where are you bringing that to?
Betty.
Betty!
Where...?
Where am I?
What happened?
It's all right, Betty. You were just doing some very stupid things.
It's all over now. Don't move or try to do anything.
All right if I breathe?
- Seriously, Paul. What came over me?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
It was...
...so strange.
All I know is I had an overwhelming desire to take the meteor.
Anything else?
Just vague things.
Strange.
A skull was smiling at me.
And something alien.
Like another brain...
...in my own head.
That doesn't make any sense.
Brains, head...
First of all, skulls don't smile, they're dead.
And it's more of a grin, really.
Believe me, I know. As a scientist,
I've looked plenty of skulls...
...in the socket in my time.
Not a pretty sight.
- Oh, Paul, what can it mean?
- I don't know.
But as a precaution,
I'm putting that meteor...
...in a drawer where even you can't find it.
- Oh, Paul...
- I'm sorry, Betty.
But until you can explain to me what you mean by "brains" and "head"...
...even you can't be trusted.
Not until you're yourself again, kitten.
The only one I want in that pretty little head of yours is me.
- Oh, Paul.
- Now, never mind "Oh, Paul."
It's gonna be all right. You'll see.
Oh, Paul.
Don't think I don't know who you are.
Pray, do not seek to tell us what we do and do not think.
You are different from the other humans.
More disgusting, I think.
If "disgusting" means smart and ambitious on your planet...
...I would agree wholeheartedly.
I would hardly expect aliens such as yourselves...
...to have a full grasp of the English language.
Aliens? Us?
Is this one of your Earth jokes?
See? See?
You should not have said
"Earth jokes."
Don't you see how that gave us away?
Very well, clever brain, you have found us out.
- What do you intend to do?
- Do?
Do?
Absolutely nothing.
Nothing?
It seems we are working to a similar purpose, you and I.
And that purpose is...
...atmosphereum.
So you know.
Yes. For, you see,
I also need this atmosphereum...
...for my very own reasons.
Then surely there is enough for both of us.
That's what I'm thinking.
We shall share the atmosphereum.
If you help us and we help you...
Why, of course.
We'll be helping each other.
Almost like an alliance.
You could say that.
As if we were actually working together.
Atmosphereum for me...
...atmosphereum for you.
Some for you and some for us.
Each of us would have it.
We will "split it," I suppose your Earth slang would say.
Very good, Tergasso.
You learn our ways quickly.
This way, neither of us will lack for atmosphereum.
- Of course.
- You two catch on quickly.
I can see I've chosen my partners wisely.
Yes. Yes, we would be partners, wouldn't we?
Partners who share.
"Partners who share." I like that.
I like the way aliens think.
You Earth fools are not so lacking...
...in the "thinking and then being triumphant" area also.
Not at all. In fact, I would say you rather excel in it.
How do we get the meteor?
Well, I see the brainy types are up bright and early this morning.
They say that's the best time to look at little, glowing rocks.
What the...?
Sorry, I must've been really involved in my scientific work for a minute.
I guess that's what they mean...
...when they say scientists have rocks in their heads.
Thanks to science, we're finally starting to understand atmosphereum.
Did you know there's enough atmosphereum in one teaspoon...
...to go to the moon and back six times?
Moon, teaspoons. That's all gibberish to me, I'm afraid.
As long as I don't have to go to the kitchen six times...
...to tell you breakfast is ready.
- Okay.
Speaking of early risers, where have our unexpected guests gotten off to?
- They certainly are odd ducks.
- You know, I don't know.
Something about hiking or exploring or something.
Oh, well.
Well, just as long as they don't hike too far and fall off a cliff.
- That would be a hike.
- You said it.
Now, let's see what happens when I add water to it.
Good, old-fashioned H2O, I call it.
Oh, hello, Pammy.
I didn't see you come in.
How come you're not out hiking with the others?
I don't have answers, Paul.
Paul.
You've probably seen plenty of woods.
- You seem like the outdoor type.
- Always agree.
You can watch me experiment, if you promise to be quiet.
Be quiet.
Well, I don't mean stop breathing...
...but don't exactly do a big dance number, either.
Now, that's almost exactly the kind of thing I was saying you shouldn't do.
Seriously, Pammy, I don't know if I can do science with you dancing like that.
Please stop.
Quit it, Pammy, quit it.
Don't make me bring my wife in here. She can be a real...
Animala. Dance with Animala.
Rock dance.
Do the rock dance.
All right, Mr. Shiny Rocks, breakfast.
Paul?
That's funny.
Paul.
Paul.
Now, where could he have gone?
Not another meteor.
Paul.
Rock dance, Pauly, do the rock dance. Oh, yeah.
Paul?
Paul.
Paul.
Where are you, for goodness' sakes?
Come, Animala. That's my pet.
Is she not special, this one?
She is truly special, this Earth woman.
Or should I say animal?
It's hard to decide.
Yes, it is. Since she's made from forest animals.
She must teach me this dance, but later. Now there is much to be done.
That's good, Animala, my pet.
Stop him right there.
Now take the box and give it to me.
Excellent. Let the sharing begin.
- The Mutant! It must have Betty.
- No matter.
There are more important things to settle.
Now, Skeleton!
Freeze where you are,
Lattis and Kro-bar.
Not moving very fast now, are you, my interplanetary friends?
- So this is your idea of sharing.
- It's not like Marvan sharing at all.
This must be Earth sharing.
You'll find much of Earth sharing works this way.
It's really more like
I'm sharing with myself.
If I could only reach you, we'd share pain.
Sorry, I'd love to stay, but I have a skeleton to bring to life.
That would be me.
And I cannot spare the atmosphereum.
Animala?
Animala, come. Come, Animala.
What are you doing?
Anyone get the number of the rocket that clobbered me?
Speaking of rockets!
Holy moly!
There's no time to explain now, Paul.
The Mutant has Betty.
Please, get these ropes off me.
Take them off now!
- There are no ropes.
- My wife panics.
These ropes are mental.
I think it's a skeleton or something.
That's crazy. Skeletons can't mentally hold anyone.
I sleep now.
Gee, I guess they can.
Would someone mind telling me what the heck's going on around here?
The Mutant's got Betty.
We're aliens.
Slow down. I'm a scientist, and that was still fast.
We had a mutant. It got loose.
It has Betty.
Hey, one at a time.
I'm gonna get whiplash here.
Now, suppose you start at the beginning...
...and tell me what happened before I get a headache.
We are from the planet Marva.
We crashed here.
Planet? Marva? You're gonna have to do a lot better than that...
...if you want my help.
Just suppose you take a deep breath, relax and tell me all about it.
The universe is a very large place.
Soon, very soon, we'll be...
...at Cadavra Cave, my love.
Then you'll see.
Your eyes will behold the wonder of the Skeleton.
Skeleton.
And so you can well understand the need for urgency.
I certainly can.
No wonder you were excited.
But there's one thing
I don't understand...
...and that's why you tried to take the meteor.
I'm certain there's enough atmosphereum...
...to power your ship and still have enough left for me to do science with.
You mean you would share the atmosphereum with us?
Kro-bar. This water on my cheeks.
I have never felt it before.
Oh, what a strange and wondrous thing it is, surely.
I, too, am feeling this new sensation of Earth weeping.
- Something very alien to Marva.
- Oh, yes.
We gave up weeping eons ago.
Kro-bar, maybe this is one advance even science couldn't make for you.
The advance of emotional expression.
Though it isn't considered very manly.
There'll be time enough for weeping later.
Right now your mate is...
Betty!
Skeleton? Hello, my Skeleton.
I brought you back a present.
It's a rock. It glows.
Hello, Skeleton.
Who wakes the
Lost Skeleton of Cadavra?
Oh, it's you. The stupid one.
Oh, you'll like me better now.
A whole lot better.
Shut up. Stop that giggling.
It makes me uncomfortable.
We have much work to be done.
Hello, Animala.
What happened to me?
Betty. Betty, it's all right now.
It's... It's me, Paul.
Dr. Paul Armstrong, your husband.
Oh, Paul.
There, there. It's all right now.
You're among friends now.
Alien friends.
Aliens?
- My God! Where am I?
- It's all right, Betty.
- You're just in a spaceship now.
- Yes, Betty, it's just like your house.
Only, it travels through space.
Please, Betty, try and remember what happened. I know it's painful.
Oh, it was horrible.
Horrible.
Betty. Betty, it's all right now.
Calm yourself.
Please, Mrs. Armstrong, there are delicate instruments aboard.
L... I remember...
...it came out of nowhere.
It was huge. It had...
It was so ugly.
I must've fainted, and the next thing I know...
...it was carrying me.
Like I was a child.
A small child.
And it looked at me...
...with those eyes, those ugly eyes...
...and they looked deep into me.
Deeper than any human ever has...
...with a kind of understanding that frightened me to my very soul.
Gosh, Betty. Almost sounds like you like the Mutant.
Like a mutant?
Can anyone like a mutant?
- I wonder.
- The Mutant is strange.
We keep it merely as a pet to us.
I have never looked in its eyes.
- Have you?
- No.
Paul, what happened to you?
I went looking.
I don't know.
All I remember was...
...Pammy... No.
She was really Animala.
Part woman...
...part four different forest animals.
And she can dance.
Oh, how she can dance.
Like I've never seen a woman dance before.
Well, we've certainly had quite a morning, haven't we?
We certainly have.
Do it. Do it.
Interesting, Paul.
So you would be a meteorologist?
No, Kro-bar, believe it or not...
...a meteorologist is actually another name for a weatherman.
I study meteors, so I'm actually a meteographer.
A lot of people don't know that.
Are you enjoying the cranberroids, Betty?
You know, I am.
And I can't get over how similar they are to something we have.
Only, we call them cranberries.
Cranberries.
Yes. It is interesting, the differences and similarities we have, is it not?
Why, on our home planet, Marva...
...we have a custom of actually eating outside...
...if weather is pleasant and acceptable.
Why, we have that.
We call it a picnic.
"Picnic." How delightful.
We call it cooty-lana.
Cooty-lana. That's fun to say.
Many things on Marva are fun to say, Paul.
This space wine is delicious.
Heavenly bouquet.
Is it like our Earth wine?
Made out of grapes, Lattis?
Grapes? Oh, surely no, Betty.
Grapes on Marva are far too sacred to step on, on Marva.
We make our wine from cherries, which we call linbooba.
Cherry wine, what a delight.
And do your people love to get intoxicated, as our people love to do?
No, Betty, we gave up getting drunk eons of your years ago.
You know, this talking that we're doing...
...is very helpful in getting to know your people and mine.
Why, as we observed you from afar, we thought of you...
...as little more than pleasant, entertaining monkeys.
So dirty and foul.
You have taught us a lot...
...Paul and Betty Armstrong.
And you us.
There is one more thing we would be taught now...
...and that's how to get the atmosphereum back...
...so that my planet might benefit...
...and your ship might return you home.
You have a device, do you not?
A detector of atmosphereum?
The atmosphereum detector, of course.
And unless I miss my guess...
...Kro-bar, alien being of the planet Marva...
...is about to suggest that we use that very device...
...to track the meteor that Rudolph Yaber stole.
Well, I didn't know...
...you were all mind readers on the planet Earth.
Remember, we may come across the Mutant.
As I told you, it is also rich in atmosphereum.
I know. I'm hoping the radiation we find...
...is on something not moving.
Like a rock.
Yes, indeed.
- Lattis, I just have to ask you.
- Yes, Betty?
After meals on Marva, who cleans up?
- The men or the women?
- Cleans up?
Why, Betty, on Marva, there is no cleaning up...
...because there's never a mess.
We gave up messes eons ago.
Think of it.
A world without messes.
No ground-in dirt.
No ugly grease stains.
No burned pans or hard-to-reach corners.
Lattis, Marva sounds like such a wonderful place.
Excellent.
You have done well, my pigeons.
Already, I feel the life returning to my tired and aching bones.
I can feel it. I'm sitting.
I'm sitting up.
Do you know how long it's been since I sat up?
- Pigeons.
- I am yours to command...
...O Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
I have risen!
Something...
Something's coming.
- The Mutant!
- Fire. Fire, Kro-bar.
- Make it harmless.
- Something's wrong.
It's jammed.
I think dirt got into it.
No, Paul! No! Paul!
No! No!
Paul! Paul!
I wonder why it changed its mind.
Oh, well. Paul! Paul, you crazy, stupid, wonderful man...
...why did you do it?
- L...
I don't know, Betty.
I should stick to science...
...and leave battling alien mutants to the experts.
I'm sorry about the transmutatron, my Earth friend.
I'll take a look at it and see if I can fix it in the shop...
...so that another of us doesn't almost die.
You two better go back to the cabin so Paul can rest.
I have a bottle of transmutatron cleaner in the ship.
Come, Lattis.
Kro-bar...
...be careful.
I'm an alien, Paul, remember?
Look at it go.
What a skeleton.
Paul, please try and rest...
...that scientific mind and body for once.
Rest? How can I rest...
...when the two best alien friends a guy ever had may be in danger?
Paul, those two came over 1000 miles.
They can take care of a little problem like a mutant.
Nothing's going to happen to Lattis.
She promised to show me some space recipes.
Oh, that reminds me. My tapioca.
What orders do you have, my bony wonder?
Shut up.
Very well.
Follow me.
Climb down these rocks like I do.
Paul, you're not well enough.
You hardly touched your pudding.
If I'm wrong, I'll buy you enough pudding to go to the moon.
I sense Lattis and Kro-bar are in great danger.
Say hello to your new master...
...the Skeleton.
It may be dangerous.
Don't tag along.
I'm tagging, Paul.
- I can't stop a woman from tagging.
- No one ever has.
Listen.
It isn't possible.
Dance. Dance!
You can't make aliens dance.
This is just wrong.
You don't know what you're tampering with.
And you don't know the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
But you will. You will.
Enough.
Yes, my skull.
Bring the female to me.
It's horrible. Horrible.
I can't watch this... This dancing.
And I cannot not watch it.
May God have mercy on us all.
You! You shall become...
...the bride of the Lost Skeleton!
No!
Fiend!
What was that?
Let the dancing resume.
You swine!
So anyway.
After Kro-bar is dead,
Lattis will be free to marry...
...the king of cartilage himself.
Betty, I've got an...
I've got an idea.
It means finding the Mutant with the transmutatron.
But it also means danger.
Real danger, kitten.
Are you game?
I can't force you.
Well...
...if I wanted to have a safe life...
...I wouldn't have married a man who studies rocks.
And you know, the way I figure...
...if it will stop my new alien best friend...
...from being a widow and married to a skeleton...
...well, just count me in,
Mr. Scientist.
That's my little meteorite.
Come on.
I guess we both have rocks in our heads.
I think he's sleeping.
How can you tell that, Roger?
I don't know.
Hey.
Hey, Skeleton?
Skeleton?
Stop it.
Stop it, I say!
If he wakes, it'll be your fault.
But it'll be you he yells at.
It's always you.
He hates you, Roger.
All right, Animala, just go see to the wedding plans.
Prepare the alien to be the Skeleton's bride.
- How do I do that?
- Just do it!
Once this starts ticking, we're in business.
- That's where I come in.
- It's your show then.
- Hopefully I'll get a curtain call.
- I hope you're around to enjoy it.
Let the Skeleton wedding begin.
Behold, the skeletal bride herself.
The alien himself will present the bride.
- Such irony.
- No, you can't make me.
I won't present the bride.
I won't present the bride.
You will, and you'll like it.
I won't like it. I won't like it.
I won't like it.
Mind if I crash?
Sorry if I'm not on the guest list.
Seize her.
Hold her!
It's a day for wedding crashers.
I never got an invitation!
You two shall pay dearly for ruining my special day...
...with your lives!
Master, my bony master, what shall we do?
Skeleton?
Lost Skeleton, no!
- Why me?
- I always hated you.
Stupid Skeleton.
Stupid Skeleton!
You cannot strangle me.
How can you strangle that which does not breathe?
I hate you. I hate you!
Bony idiot.
Foolish Mutant, you have spoiled my plans.
Now you must pay.
No. No. I cannot lose.
I cannot.
Obey me, Mutant.
- Obey the Lost Skeleton.
- He cannot, Skeleton.
Mutants are basically dumb brutes.
They don't have the mental capacity.
I will... I will return.
No. No.
No!
It's strange, Paul...
...so very strange. L...
I don't think it ever meant to kill.
It just didn't know not to.
Look, Kro-bar's changing Animala back into four animals.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, forest animals.
- Bye, animals.
- Bye.
Bye, animals.
A part of me is gonna miss Animala.
Not the part that's coming home with me, I hope.
Kro-bar, will you come with me and remove our meteor...
...from the Skeleton?
- Gladly, Paul.
You know, it's funny, but when the kind of understanding...
...that you and I have over a little piece of rock...
...spreads throughout the universe, then and only then...
...will there be understanding amongst all peoples, alien and alike...
...in all kinds of places at the same time.
...this inditement is only one of a series to be handed down... as result of the respectful rangery investigation.
Ray Robbin, in Texas, is this hour top news story... and informant led officers at
Marto County sheriff... department, to a cemetery, just outside the small rude Texas... community of Newt, early this morning. Officers there... discovered what appeared to be a grizzly work of art...
The remains of a badly decomposed body, wired to a... large monument. A second body was found in the ditch near... the perimeter of the cemetery, subsequent investigation has... revealed at least a dozen empty crypts, and it's clear more... will turn up as the probe continues deputies report... that in some instances, only parts of the corpses have been... removed. The head, or in some cases... the extremities removed, and... the remainder of the corpse left intact. Evidence indicates the... robberies have occurred over a period of time.
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado refuses to give details... in this case and said only... that he did have a strong evidence linking the crime to... elements outside the state. Area residents have reportedly... converged on the cemetery claiming the remains of relatives have been removed.
No suspects are in custody, as investigation at the scene... continues.
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing at least 29 persons.
The engineering firm responsible could offer no explanation for... the collapse although the construction firm say there's... no logical reason for the collapse is suspected sabotage.
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify the... bodies of a young man... and four children who had... their features carved away, the man's dimples had been... removed. Police first identified the victims as 2 women... continuing the program of the government to overwhelm reaches... beyond the Amazon today are ruptured into violence... forces of at least three South
America governments already... have been involved.
...this territory it tells it's sketchy and yet none of... the governments is involved as its knowledge to a war.
...Police in Dallas arrested a young couple today... complaints by neighbors led them to discover a 18-month-old daughter the couple... chained in the attic of a dilapidated house...
Franklin!
Are you ok?
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation... is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual... movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
Hint: When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic... their maleficies are increased.
Have you been doing that Reader's
Digest worth our...
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence. It's just particularly... bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
My granddaddy is buried here. Can we find out if anything happened?
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella... standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there. He'll let you in.
Ok. Thank you.
Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
- Hey, folks. Let us go see where... her granddaddy's buried.
Things happen here about they don't tell about.
I see things.
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
You laugh at an old man... this thing that laughs knows better.
Yes, they're sure. The man said the
Tallman's grave had been dug up.
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!
It didn't look dug up to me.
What's that? What smell?
What is that stench?
Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used... to sell his cattle! We got an uncle that works in one of those places... outside of Fortworth. See those buildings there? That's where... they kill him. They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.
It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to... come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
That's horrible! People shouldn't kill animals for food.
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun... that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
That smell's still going on.
Oh, man! It's hot in here.
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break. He can...
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?
- He's weird looking, no.
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?
- You work at that place?
- Don't.
- How did you get stuck out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.
My grandfather, too.
My family's always been in beef.
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that... slaughter room or whatever they call it?
Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.
With the sledge!
That was better.
- They died better that way.
- How come? I thought the gun...
- was better.
- Oh no. With the new way...
- people were put out of jobs.
- You do that?
- Look!
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah!
- Franklin.
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...
They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape... all the flesh away from the bone.
They use everything, they throw nothing away.
They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
- and everything!
- Look at this.
- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
I don't know it was in that stuff.
It's really good. Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it. It's good!
- It sounds horrible. Can't we...
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you... didn't know what was in it.
I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
Take it before everybody's sick.
What are you doing?
Look. I think that might hurt.
Oh, come on!
What are you doing to yourself?
Oh, what are you doing?
Nice, man!
I have this knife.
Put that away, too.
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.
You took my picture!
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.
- How close is it?
- It's real close.
Couldn't you just walk? I mean...
If it's so close.
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese. My brother...
- makes it real good. You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?
- 2 dollars. It's a good picture.
- No, man. Franklin... give him back that picture.
I'm about to freak. Call a cop.
That's the last damn hitchhiker
I ever take.
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.
Travel in the countryside.
Long range plans, upsetting persons... around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's
Capricorn.
Oh, no.
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we... cannot believe that what's happening is really true... pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
Hurry up.
Here comes somebody.
How are you?
Would you fill her up, please?
I got no gas.
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty. Transport won't... be here until this afternoon.
Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know where "The Old
Franklin Place" is?
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and... it's sitting up on the hill. I think you have to turn on the road... back there, but I'm not real sure.
Maybe I've seen something like that up there. But look, you boys... don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around... other folk's property. Some folks don't like it.
They don't mind showing you.
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look...
I got barbecue here. Why don't you stay a while?
The transport will be by in a little while...
I can go and get some barbecue.
Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
Best you stick around here.
We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.
What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
Go, damn it.
There.
You think this place has room service?
Franklin, you're cutting the van!
Yeah, I just started doing that.
I bet this is some of that guy's blood. Look at that.
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.
That's blood, alright. And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
You think you could do that to yourself?
Crazy?
It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
You think I said something that made him mad?
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.
Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
What? What did you do?
You're in someone's van?
Let me see your knife.
Thank you.
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service... station, you're towing us back in that chair.
Hey...
You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out... my picture like that?
Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
Put it over there.
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.
Oh, Kirk, come on!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I want to see the smear the guy made.
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.
- Jerry!
- Ok!
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Get it. You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?
Where's my knife?
Kirk?
Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
This was my room. I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...
These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
Look at the zebra. I had this fascination for the zebras...
Kate?
Sally!
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'll take it!
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?
Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
Come on.
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.
Yeah. See them down in about an hour or so.
Sally!
Sally...
Seed growing in the world...
I don't want to miss it.
Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
Crap!
This must be it!
Are you ok?
What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
I bet he must have when he was little.
Franklin never was little.
Gasoline.
I can leave my guitar, you know,
I'd give him a couple of bucks...
We gotta come back by here anyway,
I can pick up my guitar and... give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas... let's just go back now.
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.
- A generator!
- What?
A generator! For electricity!
Hey, hello! Is there anybody in the house?
Hello! Is anybody home?
I got something for you.
Let's go!
Hello?
Hello?
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Pam!
Hello!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk!
Kirk?
Kirk?
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!
You don't think it means anything?
We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.
Jerry...
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?
When did you have it last?
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?
I don't know. Didn't I give it back to you?
No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right. I'll look for it.
Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
How do I get there, Frank?
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.
All right.
I can't find it.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
You really are mad, huh?
I don't blame you.
Kirk!
You really didn't want me to come, did you?
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.
Did you believe all that stuff
Pam was telling about?
Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
I don't know. Everything means something, I guess.
You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
He'd probably find
Kirk and kill him.
- Sally...
- What now?
Nothing.
Nevermind.
Kirk!
Hello?
Is anybody home?
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends. Hello?
Is anybody here?
Damn.
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?
Hey, guys! Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.
Pam, is that you?
Okay, you guys!
Come on out.
Come on!
Kirk?
They must be lost. They don't have a flashlight or anything.
If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
What if we get lost, too?
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Hey!
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
Sally...
I think we ought to go.
Are the keys in the van?
Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
What for?
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.
You don't have to go.
Sally, no, I don't think that's a good idea, Sally.
I don't think you ought to go.
Look, I'm gonna honk the horn one more time.
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn... and we will wait a minute, and they will come and we will go.
All right?
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!
They took the keys!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally! You can't go!
What if they came back and we weren't here?
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right! All right!
I'll go with you. I'll go with you, all right?
I'll go with you, but I'll keep the flashlight.
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.
I can't push you down the hill!
Sally...
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.
All right. Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.
Sally! Hold on a minute now.
All right, let's go.
Let's go, I'll go with you.
Sally, I can't keep up with you!
Sally!
Sally, wait a minute!
Hold on!
Jerry!
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
- Jerry!
I thought I heard something.
There's a light!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!
Get back and push, damn!
Impossible!
I heard something over there!
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!
Sally, I hear something.
Stop! Stop!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me, please!
- Help! Help!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Help me! Help me!
- Come over here!
You're all right, girl.
Okay?
Hold on, take it easy, all right?
He killed...
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...
Call the police!
Jerry!
I don't know what happened to the others...
There's nobody out there now!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
What happened?
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.
We have to drive to the sheriff's.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'll get the truck.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go! Don't go!
The weather is expected to continue warm and clear... and partially cloudy tomorrow... with no chance of precipitation.
Expected high of 90 °F.
Our current temperature is 96°.
Winds blow southeast at 3 ml/h.
Community 98, kilometer 29.9.
Acting on a typical day with some news... the word is that the sheriff's office began an investigation... early this morning in the
County Cemetery.
Opening crypts and muslins where there was evidence of... tampering, The Sheriff found a reported dozen coffins were... robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...
Maldonado, there are ones from which only the head and... extremities are removed, and others and others from which only a hand or foot removed, with the... remainder of the cadaver left intact. Maldonado linked...
What are you doing?
- You will come with me...
- No!
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I had to lock up and get the lights off.
Because electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.
We're gonna get there soon.
No, no, no.
There's no need to do that.
We always do our best.
Hang on.
No.
Half witch.
You little shit!
You knock-head idiot!
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.
No! They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!
I told you to stay away from that graveyard.
I told you...
I told you never to leave your brother alone!
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!
I hope your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.
Look at what your brother did to that door!
You let her go!
You goddamn idiot!
I thought you were in a hurry.
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?
Did they get away?
Are you sure?
You...
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!
Hey, come here! Look!
See how nice she looks!
Get upstairs and get your grandpa!
Take it easy there, huh?
You'll stay here for a few minutes.
Get back in there!
To the chamber!
You just take it easy.
We'll have something to eat right away.
Hey, you two!
Give me a hand with grandpa!
Look, grandpa! Look!
Knock it off!
Quiet! You act like a pack of hounds.
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?
Please!
You can make them stop!
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!
Can't be helped, young lady.
Please! You can't let them kill me!
He likes this face.
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!
Please...
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!
He always does all the work.
He don't like it. Is that right?
You're just a cook!
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand nothing.
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!
I just can take no pleasure in killing.
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.
Please...
Please...
I'll do anything you want.
You don't need to torture the girl.
Please, shut up. Remember you're just a cook.
Let me and him handle this.
I won't have this.
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.
I'll take her to grandpa.
Grandpa'll have some fun.
You always said he was the best.
He's the best all right.
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you... have this one!
Have this one!
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.
Our grandpa was the best killer there ever was.
I never took all the guts to see.
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.
I could've done more if the hook pulled again could've gotten the... beaves out of the way faster.
Now don't you cry. Grandpa is the best. It won't hurt a bit.
No!
No!
Please! Don't!
Hit her!
Hit the bitch!
Go ahead!
Give me the hammer!
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!
Go! Go!
Romania.
For years, the Ottoman Turks have occupied my country, enslaving the Romanian people.
Collaborating with the Turks are traitorous Romanian nobles, a privileged class of men who seek profit at the expense of their fellow countrymen.
Hungary, fearing further
Turk aggression, has raised an army of Romanian patriots to drive the Sultan's forces out.
Our commander
Prince Vlad Dracula, feared by his enemies, who know him as "Vlad Tsepesh,"-
Vlad the Impaler- yet beloved by his own people.
And he has returned to battle the Turks and crush those nobles who support them.
Hurry up!
Vlad Tsepesh is coming!
Hurry up!
Vlad Tsepesh is coming!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
God damn it!
You are a traitor to your people.
And a thief.
I...
I didn't.
These are now yours.
Noooo!
Nooo!
Nooo!
Noooo!
I've sent you messages.
You've disregarded them.
Father Stefan,
I am fighting a war.
You cannot ignore the Church.
We shall see.
If the Church denounces you, when you die they will drive a steel spike into your heart as one of the godless.
And neither your son, nor his sons nor his sons, will ever be accepted as
Prince of Romania by the people.
Thus, I recommend a morsel of humility with the Church.
You've never met these men before.
They only know you by reputation, as Vlad Tsepesh or The Impaler.
You must tell your story honestly and completely, if you expect absolution from the Orthodox Church.
But I don't expect it.
They know the Pope helped finance this campaign.
I am fighting to free their country from Turk tyranny!
These men ought to thank me, not question my methods or allegiances!
Prince Vlad Dracula, having performed many cruel and unspeakable deeds, is charged with conspiring and colluding with the Papacy in Rome and of abandoning the eternal world of Orthodoxy.
In converting his own faith- to join into matrimony with a Roman Catholic woman, he has forsaken the truth and the light and accepted darkness.
My views on the Roman Catholic Church are no secret.
The Pope and the Sultan stink alike.
Vlad Dracula, in the event of your death, would you want your son to succeed you?
Of course.
Then he will need our protection, not the Pope's.
For without our blessing, he'll never become
Prince of Romania.
And your dynasty will end.
We have questions that you will answer.
Where were you born?
My father's house...
Castle Dracul, in the region of Transylvania.
We are particularly interested in the circumstances of your birth.
Vlad: I know what you are implying.
You needn't waste your time.
I've heard the folk tales.
Who first told you these stories?
Your mother?
Hardly. My mother died offever when I was two.
And your father?
My father was in charge of my education.
If I was destined to be the Anti-Christ
I'm sure he would have mentioned it.
I could do no wrong in my father's eyes.
Good, Vlad.
It was not the same with my brother Radu, however.
Come on, Radu!
Come on!
Fight! Be a man!
Come on, Radu!
You are not a baby anymore!
Finish him, Vlad.
Finish him!
One day, my father gave me his ring that commemorated his induction into the Order of the Dragon.
Wear this always.
It will keep you from harm.
If anything ever happens to me, see King Janos in Hungary.
He is a friend.
Why did your father assume something might happen to him?
The Turkish Sultan was demanding his yearly tribute.
10,000 ducats and 500 young boys.
As Prince of Romania, my father was refusing.
He was leaving for Tirgoviste to meet with our country's nobles, and convince them to unite against the Sultan.
I remember asking...
Is that possible?
To unite the nobles?
Many have made separate arrangements with the Sultan.
They profit.
But their people are no better off than slaves.
Greed is a force more powerful than any army.
As long as we are forced to pay tribute, we will never truly be free.
Vlad, while I'm away, you must look after Radu.
He is weak, but he is your brother.
Guard and protect him with your life.
I promise, Father.
No!
After what seemed like days of travel, we finally arrived at the Turkish camp.
For the first time in my life,
I saw the world... naked and unbridled.
It terrified me.
Do you know who I am?
The Sultan Mehmed.
And do you know why you are here?
Because our father refused to pay tribute.
Precisely.
When he relents, you may be returned to Romania.
Meanwhile, you have no reason to fear me.
You will be allowed to keep your Jesus.
You will be also taught Islam, and many other useful things.
The Sultan's immediate interest in Radu was quite obvious.
This one.
You are a very lucky boy.
When history will be written,
I will be placed alongside Alexander,
Caesar, and Hannibal.
No!
Mmmph!
I saw less and less of my brother after that.
One night, he came to me in tears.
Father's dead.
Who told you that?
The Sultan.
- He's lying.
- No.
Vlad, it's hideous.
What? Radu?
He was murdered.
Buried alive.
I told Radu that if Father was dead, they would have no reason not to kill us.
Stefan: But your father had been murdered, supposedly by Romanian nobles, because your father
Vlad Dracul refused to accept the nobles' compliance with the Sultan.
Yes.
And yet the Sultan
Iet you live.
I made myself live.
They starved me, they beat me, they tortured me.
They threatened to blind me unless I surrendered to the Sultan.
And then one day, as if by miracle, your suffering ended.
I was given a horse and supplies, and ordered back to Romania.
But instead, as my father had instructed me years ago,
I decided to seek help from King Janos of Hungary.
As I left,
I made three vows: to avenge my father's murder; to unite my country; and to liberate Radu from the Sultan.
Tell King Janos that Vlad, son of Dracul, is here to see him.
Give him this.
Your father was a politician to the marrow.
Unfortunately, he ended up being all things to no people.
Do you know who killed him?
Such is the nature of politics in the Balkans.
One never really knows who one's enemy is-
- aside from the Turk, that is.
- Your Majesty.
Aside from the Turk, your real enemies are the Romanian nobles who aid the Turkish Sultan.
These are the same men who murdered my father.
And how can you be so sure- so sure it was the nobles?
Because had my father fulfilled his mission, it was them who had everything to lose.
And your mission?
Is it one of a patriot or of a vengeful son?
Both.
You see, he wasn't just murdered,
Your Majesty.
They say he was buried alive.
King Janos. Help me.
With your support,
I can make Romania strong.
Come.
We should not discuss such matters on an empty stomach.
Oh, young man, where did you learn your table manners?
If you're asking about my origins,
I was born in Transylvania.
- Romania.
- I know where it is.
I am Romanian.
You are Romanian?
Yes.
Of noble class?
Aron, like your father, wishes the Turk driven from his country.
I've offered him sanctuary, and he has accepted.
- Where is the boy's father?
- My father is dead.
Murdered.
Your father was Prince Vlad Dracul?
Yes.
He was a great man, but his vision was utopian- unpractical in these cursed times.
What Romania needs is a saviour.
Aron, what news of the Messiah?
The Messiah?
You haven't heard the Romanian tales?
This man who's going to save us from the Turk.
No, Your Majesty.
In religious matters, I rely on my daughter for information.
And you, Lidia?
No, Your Majesty.
But when I get to Braila,
I will inquire.
Why are you going to Braila?
I'm entering the nunnery.
Why?
Are you allowing this?
It's what she wishes.
Perhaps you would let him... dance with your daughter.
Oh, well... it's been so long since my daughter danced,
I'm afraid she's forgotten how.
Then she's met her match.
I doubt if Vlad Dracula ever learned.
Unless of course, he had lessons in the Sultan's prison.
Indulge me, Vlad.
Before she renounces the world forever.
You had never known another woman, and yet you were sure at that moment you were meant to spend your life with this one?
Not just my life.
All eternity.
Don't go to the nunnery.
Your place is with me.
You're mad, aren't you?
I knew the moment I saw you... as if God himself ordained it.
Or the devil.
Surely he was the one who loosened your tongue.
To win your heart...
I will accept help from any source.
Will you walk with me?
I will walk with you.
You've given me back my life.
Vlad Dracula, after considering your request,
I have decided to grant it, and bestow upon you money and arms.
I order you to raise an army of your fellow countrymen, and to wage battle against the Turk and all who support him.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I will not fail you.
I must remind you, young man, your own father tried and failed.
He once told me greed was a stronger force than any army.
But I've learned there is another even greater force.
And what's that?
Fear.
Stop! Stop!
You! Let him go!
Thank you.
Not that I needed it.
You needed it.
Are you hungry?
Bread.
We've got fresh bread!
Mercy! Mercy!
I've done no wrong.
I've done no wrong!
Mercy!
Thank you.
Tell me, who is that man?
Prince Karl.
Whatever happened to the old Prince,
Vlad Dracul?
What happens to every
Prince of Romania: killed... by those who would benefit.
Come.
Those people, what was their crime?
They committed no crime.
Then why?
Because that is the way things are done here.
Take him away.
- Not any more.
- Friend, talk like that will get you killed.
What is your name?
Bruno.
Bruno.
Come with me.
We have much to discuss.
What do you want?
Guards!
Tell me.
Whatever you wish, it's yours.
I'm the Prince, and can make it so.
Guards!
Who are you?
Guards!
No.
Please, no.
I lived here once.
I am Vlad Dracula, son of the great
Prince Vlad.
And in the name of my father,
I hereby reclaim the throne of Romania.
My only allegiance is to you, the people.
My will is to end
Turkish oppression and the betrayal of those who benefit.
What I do will bring justice and freedom to all Romanians now!
You priests, you're privy to the thoughts of your flock.
What do the people say of me?
Not the common man, people of wealth and influence.
What do they say?
They respect you.
In spite of my friendship with the King of Hungary?
A Papist?
No man of property speaks ill of me?
Not in our experience.
You.
What did you hear?
I have heard that you are a man who is vindictive.
And you believe that?
I believe what I see.
A skeptical priest- how refreshing.
Then you must have seen God with your own eyes.
I have known God.
And did He speak to you?
Tell me, what did God say?
God speaks through the prophets, and the prophets have said that a man will come again... who will deliver peace.
A Messiah.
Or... an Anti-Christ.
One who is only cloaked in peace, but who will deliver terror.
What is your name,
Priest?
Stefan.
You're the one from Snagov, yes?
I shall come by the monastery tomorrow for a visit.
I wish to continue this conversation.
As for you others, my sacred mission is to bring order to Romania.
There must be security for all in my land.
If you do not support me in my endeavors, you do so at your risk.
You say what you think.
I respect that in a man.
Is that why you came here today, to tell me that?
No.
My father is buried here at Snagov.
Do you know who murdered him?
There's an old
Latin saying...
"The more allegiances, the more enemies."
May I give you some advice?
You are Romanian.
You are Orthodox.
If you wish our support, end your allegiance with the King of Hungary and the Pope.
My father's grave, if you would.
It's one thing to kill a man, but why bury him alive?
They weren't just killing a man.
- They wanted to crush an idea.
- "They"?
The nobles, then.
My friends.
Aron,
I want you to organize a celebration, to be held here at my home.
Invite your friends.
Every man of title.
And what are we celebrating,
Your Highness?
The birth of justice.
Prince Dracula's first state occasion.
Won't it seem odd if the princess isn't there?
The surgeon won't allow it.
And wives are not attending.
Besides... the talk will be of treaties and taxations.
I cannot bear for you to be bored.
Then you should never leave my side.
No.
What?
What is it?
Oh...
I can feel him.
I have been thinking about the fate of my land.
And I wanted to ask you all something.
How many princes have you lived under in your lifetimes?
How many?
A simple question.
You, Andrei.
How many princes of Romania have you known?
Uh... five?
And you, Bordeaux?
Many.
Too many.
And how do you explain that?
It's the way of the world.
Instability.
And whose fault is that?
The people?
Human nature?
The princes themselves?
I will tell you what I think.
You- you are the reason.
Your greed, your disloyalty, your corruption.
You might as well be agents of the Turks.
- And now, that is all going to end.
- What?
You betrayed us!
You've answered my next question.
I was about the ask the murderers of my father to rise.
What are those noises-
- Princess?
- Call the surgeon.
I'm having my baby.
You have a son.
- Hello, my son.
Your name is Vlad.
He was eager to see you.
- Vlad?
- Yes, my love?
Last night,
I heard terrible cries.
- Terrible cries?
- Yes.
The sounds of men in pain.
You were dreaming.
It was so real.
Lidia, it was a dream.
All that happened here last night was a state dinner.
You believe me, don't you?
Of course, I do.
As I gazed into my son's eyes,
I knew
I had acted justly, that he had been born into a better world, purged of the villainy that had destroyed his grandfather.
What proof did you have these nobles murdered your father?
These were evil, corrupt men.
Do you deny that you returned to this place of execution?
No.
Do you deny you dipped your bread into the blood of the nobles?
What's the matter?
Vlad Dracula, what's the matter?
I have heard these stories so often,
I'm starting to believe them myself.
Shhh...
Tell me these rumors are not true.
Rumors?
What rumors?
What have you heard?
That you bury condemned men to the waist and behead them.
Who told you that?
Your father?
No.
Did he tell you
I cut the breasts off adulterous women and force their infants suck their blood?
- He didn't tell me that.
- Of course he didn't.
I just invented it.
Do you not trust me?
Lidia,
I do nothing unjust.
Grave news, My Prince.
The Turkish force is invading Romania.
Aron's estate is under attack.
Where is Aron?
He's gone.
Gone?
Gone.
He didn't stand and fight?
He didn't defend his people and his land?
Are you really surprised?
I found them,
My Prince.
This is no place for a fight.
This is a place for a fight.
Take prisoners.
Take prisoners!
Hello, my brother.
What shall I do with this one,
My Prince?
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?
You've been a traitor to your own people,
- and to the memory of your father.
- I never betrayed our father.
Besides, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be in that prison, rotting.
You have that much influence?
Even as a boy?
Especially as a boy.
What if I told you you could live... if you came back home.
If you renounced your allegiance to the Sultan?
You don't understand.
I'm happy where I am.
We will defend our borders against all raids.
There will be no more tribute.
Tell your Sultan that.
You know you cannot win.
The next time we meet in battle, I will kill you.
It doesn't have to be this way, my brother.
This is exactly the way it has to be.
He had the Sultan's trust.
- He could have escaped easily.
- Maybe he didn't want to.
He betrayed me and his people because he was weak.
Do you really believe-
They're all weak.
What?
They are all weak.
My father, Vlad.
What is to become of him?
When he is found, justice will be done.
It was his duty to defend his land and his people.
My love,
I've never asked you for anything.
But this
I beg of you.
Swear to me no harm will come to my father.
Please?
If you love me, you'll swear to that.
On the life of our child,
I swear, no evil will befall your father.
What is it?
Where is he?
Where did you see him?
What is it, my dear?
You look like you need a drink of water.
This goblet is made of gold.
Yes.
Why does that astonish you?
And no one has tried to steal it?
No.
It belongs to all of us.
He brought peace... and the sword.
They say he's the Messiah.
- The Messiah?
- Oh yes.
His coming was foretold by the priests.
At the moment of his birth, the Virgin wept bloody tears.
Then perhaps he's the devil.
No.
He's neither god nor devil.
But he's certainly more than a man.
His wine cellar is stocked with the blood of his enemies.
Have you never heard of Vlad the Impaler?
You must be a stranger to Romania.
Yes, I am.
Father!
Why are you still here?
Why haven't you left the country?
One needs money to bribe customs agents.
- I had nowhere else to turn.
- Here.
It's not enough?
No...
I don't want to expose you to his vengeance.
Did you really run,
Father?
Yes.
No!
Oh God, no!
- I know that man.
- Lidia, stop!
I must stop this.
Vlad, no!
No!
Vlad, you swore!
You swore!
Let him go.
Goodbye, my child.
I love you.
I swore to make a better and just world,
- fit for our son to live in.
- Why did you lie to me?
- I never lied to you.
- Only a monster would allow what I saw in that square today.
Would a monster... have let your father go free?
- You didn't have to kill that sentry.
- That man was asleep on duty.
So you had him killed?!
Believe me, the next sentry will not fall asleep on duty.
This is madness.
Have you considered the cost of this justice?
The cost on your immortal soul?
My soul, my life, whatever the cost may be,
- I am willing to pay.
- And what about our son?
Will your methods die with you?
I will not let you corrupt him!
- You are a monster!
- No.
I truly don't know you at all.
Don't touch me!
- Lidia!
- Please!
- You're a monster!
- You're not in your right mind.
Lidia, stop!
- Lidia!
- You!
- Call the surgeon now!
The Princess is not well.
Vlad, come.
Yes, Father.
You're cold.
Lidia...
You cannot go on like this.
Get the Princess a blanket, please.
Welcome to Romania, gentlemen.
What can I do for you?
The fact is,
Vlad Dracula, you've ignored all previous diplomatic overtures.
So, we-
Radu.
Have your men take off their hats.
It is our custom never to remove them at court.
Oh, I see.
Vlad? What do you think of this custom?
I would like to speak to my brother alone, if you don't mind.
Vlad, this is your uncle, Radu.
Radu is a good friend of the Turkish Sultan.
They call him
Radu the Handsome.
Radu, this is my son.
My successor.
I have no design on your throne, Vlad.
Why have you come back?
I told you eight years ago, no more tributes ever.
Romania is now free and will remain so.
The Sultan grows weary of your impertinence.
If it continues, he will attack.
Unlike you, I didn't submit to the Sultan's whims when I was a child.
Why should I now?
So we understand one another?
No more warnings.
Understood.
Let's hope this will have strengthened your customs, and keep them in your land where they belong.
- Mother?
- We're leaving this place.
Do you hear them?
Quickly.
Vlad, come.
- No!
- Take the boy.
What do you hear?
- Cries.
- Cries?
Of the dead.
Begging you for mercy.
I am sending you to the nunnery in Braila.
It is best for you, and best for our son.
No! I cannot leave you alone with him.
When your mind is calm you will be permitted to return.
No!
It was not a banishment.
It was done out of love.
No one here denies that you are a devoted husband or a loving father.
Perhaps even more loving,
I suspect, than your own father was to you.
Who could say?
- Ready?
- I am.
Shoot.
For some time life went on quietly, until one day
I was called to the Danube.
There.
Look at that.
What I could do with such an army.
There must be
100,000 men out there.
- Which means...
- ...we are outnumbered 10 to 1.
"My darling, Lidia, you are my first thought in the morning, and my last at night.
Know that you are in my heart.
Always and forever.
We've engaged the Turk, and have begun our great and noble fight.
Our men fight with bravery and honor.
But they are many.
And we are few.
In the year 431 Before Christ,
Pericles eulogizing over Athenian soldiers slain in combat with the Spartans wrote,
'It is for our country that these men die nobly in battle, thinking it right not to be deprived of her, just as each of her survivors should be willing to toil for her sake.
And so, we will persevere to the very end."'
You need me to look after Vlad now?
No. I sent for you because
I want your forgiveness.
You are so pure and so good.
But you must understand that everything I've done in my life
I know I was meant to do.
Without you, I am so lost.
I never stopped loving you.
He's not dead.
My Prince.
Rise now.
Wake up!
We need you.
Take a message to the princess.
Bruno.
Have I not told you
I was indestructible?
Your men actually believed that you had returned from the dead.
Some of the weaker minded, yes.
You were dreaming.
Lidia, listen to me now.
We must go away tonight.
The Turkish army will be here.
I have come back for you and Vlad.
We must leave the castle before daybreak.
You're dead.
What?
You've risen from the dead.
No, they thought.
- They thought I was.
- Your soul... unable to enter heaven.
Or hell.
Do you hear them?
Hear what?
The voices.
The voices?
They're calling to us.
I love you.
Lidia!
Lidia!
Lidia, wait!
Lidia!
No!
No.
Please.
Lidia.
Come walk with me.
I will always walk with you.
No!
Lidia.
No!
My Prince, what are you doing?
She killed herself,
Bruno.
That means her soul is in danger, therefore a mirror... can steal it.
Is that not what they say?
I did not know you were a believer.
She was.
She was.
The Turks are rolling out the cannon.
We must go.
People say
I'm a saviour.
I couldn't even save my own wife.
I'm going to trust you with my son's life.
It is my honor, my Prince.
Come now.
She has gone.
Could the river have taken her?
It's not strong enough.
I need you to be strong for me.
Can you do that, Vlad?
Yes, Father.
I'm going to get help.
But I will come back.
I will come back.
- You understand?
- Yes, Father.
Yes?
I begged to see you.
I know where the Impaler is going.
And I know how to stop him once he gets there.
Who are you?
My name is Aron.
I once owned property in this country.
A man of privilege.
Is that why you wish to hurt Vlad Dracula?
That, and he destroyed my daughter.
Arrange to have this intercepted.
So, once again,
Romania is under the Sultan's thumb.
Your Majesty,
I beg of you,
- give me your support.
- My support?
You come here asking for my support?
These are in your hand,
I believe?
No.
I never signed these documents.
What are they?
Promises to your brother, Radu to wage war against my kingdom.
- These are forgeries.
- Was this also foretold at your birth?
That you would stab your one and only ally in the back?
I never wrote these letters.
Blood is thicker than water, Vlad Dracula.
- No.
- Remove him!
I never signed these letters.
I never saw these papers.
These are forgeries.
And how many years passed in the dungeons of King Janos of Hungary?
I'm afraid
I lost count.
The light, it bothers your eyes?
Too much time in the dark.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that it's a sickness of the blood.
Your father suffered from it.
And I'm sad to say it worsens with age.
So, are you ready to become
Prince of Romania again?
What?
When you were arrested, you said those papers were forgeries.
Well, I have recently discovered that your allegations were correct.
A mutual acquaintance of the guilty party.
Your father-in-law.
However, there is... one... small condition for my support.
You must marry my daughter.
She's a Roman Catholic, as am I.
If you convert, the Pope has pledged to send money to help you regain your princedom, in the name of the Holy Roman Church.
Of course, the Orthodox priests will curse you for it.
You have a moment to make up your mind and consider the situation as it presents itself.
Stefan:
And how did the situation finally present itself,
Prince Vlad?
I accepted the Pope's money,
- but never his religion.
- You swear that to be the truth?
Yes.
I need an answer.
Whose banner
I fight under is of no concern to me.
I will take that as a "yes."
My Prince.
- Bruno.
- At last. You have returned.
How could you raise so many men so quickly?
You are their hope.
You've always been there.
This is nothing.
Many more are coming.
How's my son?
You will be very proud of him.
Tell me.
Tell me everything.
Radu has been Prince ever since your arrest in Hungary.
The first thing that he did was give the nobles back their estates and privileges.
He made Aron his chief advisor.
It was as though everything for which we had fought disappeared in a moment.
How strong is the Turk force?
After Radu took control, the main army returned to Constantinople.
The garrison remains.
Good.
We attack tonight.
Or did you have other plans?
And so you've come back to Romania with the Pope's blessing and support?
The people do not care about these things.
They all rallied to my side at once.
The Messiah returned.
I am no Messiah.
What news of your brother?
For all I know, he's fled to the Sultan.
Why would your brother give up so easily?
Perhaps he fears me, as all of you seem to.
- We all have reason to fear you.
- Why?
Because of the sheer magnitude of your atrocities.
Skinning people alive, forcing mothers to devour their own children.
According to your own census, you killed over 100,000 people.
Forgeries and lies.
Do you deny that you murdered your own people?
Those who broke the law were punished.
They were Romanian.
They were Orthodox.
You are now a Papist.
We all live under the same God.
All but the godless.
I will leave theology to the theologians.
I have far more pressing business.
I have yet to see my son.
I await your decision.
Father.
My son.
I'm sorry.
Do you regret it,
Father?
Do I regret what?
Mother always said you should have left vengeance to God.
That was never for me to judge.
Time will tell.
Vlad.
This is now yours.
Sit, Father.
- The priests have deliberated?
- Yes.
Their decision?
The Orthodox Church has denounced you.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you for all that you've done on my behalf.
Do you understand the consequences of excommunication?
My immortal soul unredeemed, doomed to remain
"incorrupt and entire."
Neither in heaven, nor in hell.
Your only salvation is to renounce
Catholicism.
What good would that really do... if I should abandon the Roman Church and repent?
Then the Pope and Hungary will withdraw their support.
And I will be driven out of my own land.
It's almost ironic, isn't it?
Two days ago,
I win the great battle, and just now, with the utterance of one single word- excommunication-
I lose the war.
What if I were to lead you to your brother?
Why, Father?
Because if he joined you, instead of serving the Sultan, together you would no longer need Hungary, nor Rome.
I have tried.
After you humiliated him?
After you defeated him, how could he capitulate?
But time has a remarkable way of softening the pride of youth.
And not only did you spare him, but he spared you twice.
He's your blood.
He will listen to what you have to say, if you say it in peace.
I have no idea where he is.
He's been given sanctuary in my monastery in Snagov.
By whom?
By the very same priests who condemned you.
They plan to turn him over to the nobles at daybreak who will then smuggle him out of Romania.
What would you do,
Father?
What choice would I have?
How many men are with him?
He's alone.
Why aren't you afraid?
Why aren't you begging for your life like any other man?
Because he isn't like any other man.
And I knew that from the moment he was delivered into this world.
God save me, had I had one moment alone with you,
I would have strangled you in your crib.
You.
You murdered my father.
Because if your father was unable to pay the Sultan's ransom-
I'd be put to death.
For God has said to the prophets, there will come an Anti-Christ that will promise peace but deliver only apocalypse.
My fight was never with God.
It was with you.
All of you.
That is why you are doomed, Vlad.
Because you fight all of us.
You fight your own blood, your own people, and your own church.
Because you are the Anti- Christ.
And you are doomed.
Vlad.
Lidia!
Your father went to the monastery at Snagov.
Alone.
I would imagine for your sake.
Prepare the bath with honey and spice, as my soldiers will return for the body.
And then?
Then it will be delivered to the Sultan, who wishes to behead it himself.
Beheaded.
Yes. As you wish.
I want him buried inside this chapel.
Your father was denounced by this Church.
He cannot be buried in this monastery.
Or you die with him.
Goodbye, Father.
I wanted to thank you, Father.
You have doomed me to wander the earth, incorrupt and entire.
You've given me eternal life.
Will you walk with me?

Dark Water
And tomorrow we can practice singing, ok?
-Yeah! -OK, see you tomorrow!
-Bye! -See ya!
See ya!
B'bye.
Yoshimi... no one's come for you?
Yoshimi Matsubara
Well, your husband has no objections on the division of property.
So it's... our daughter?
Yes.
He's absolutely insistent on being the legal guardian.
Why is he saying this now?
He has completely neglected her from the beginning.
Perhaps it's just that you've never noticed. He may...
No, that's not it at all.
He forgets her birthday every year.
Where are you living?
Presently l'm looking for aplace for my daughter and me.
But l'll be deciding this week.
-Just a small question.
-Sure. ls it true you had once received psychiatric treatment?
Did he tell you that?
Yes.
That was before we were married.
Over 10 years ago now. l was working proofreading novels at the time, and...
You mean correcting spelling mistakes, that sort of thing?
Right.
And some of the novels lwas working on then... were extremely graphic and sadistic.
So it was a distraction to your work.
No you see, the content was just so horrible... and l had to read them over and over again.
So that's when you started going for treatment?
Yes. l see. ls that going to... ?
No, that shouldn't present a problem.
You know l... haven't been at all since then.
Don't worry about it.
And unless something major occurs, the mother usually has the advantage when the child is under seven.
Right.
My being seen before... that doesn't matter anymore.
Hey, a fact is a fact.
What's wrong with speaking the truth? l don't think it will get you very far now.
Go straight along the river.
Right here? Thank you very much.
Tired?
This will be the last one, ok?
Alright, l'm going on ahead... lkuko
What do you think this room's for?
That's where you eat.
How about this one?
Where you sleep?
How about this little room here?
That's my room!
Ok, l'm off to see lkuko's room! Bye!
Hey!
How many floors?
Gee, l don't know...
Can you count them?
So what do you think?
Areal bargain, l'd say.
We'll think about it.
Thank you.
Ms. Matsubara? -Yes.
Come right in.
Please, come in.
The apartment manager lives here too.
So you can feel safe coming home at night.
Disappointed? lt is alittle old.
But it's built solid, you know.
Please.
Mr. Kamiya, l told you to wipe this up.
Sorry, a bucket of water spilled earlier.
After you.
Which way?
Here we are.
Go right in.
How old are you, lkuko?
Tell him how old you are.
Almost six.
Oh, you're in kindergarten.
Yup!
Where's my room?
How about this one here?
Yey!
The kindergarten is really close.
And next week we're havingthe wallpaper replaced.
Then it will look as good as new.
The humidity in here is unreal.
Well, with all the rain we've had...
Most people use this room as a bedroom.
Oh, right... l haven't shown you the kitchen.
Please.
We're having the kitchen done over too.
You'll find it very easy to use.
You knowthe other family also liked the room.
''The early bird catches the worm.'' l see. lt's just the two of you, right?
Yes.
Oh, then there's plenty of room!
A real steal. lkuko? lkuko?
Maybe she went outside? l'm going to go check. lkuko?
Excuse me, has my little girl been here?
We haven't seen her.
Really...
Baron, have you seen her?
He says he hasn't either. lkuko!
That's... my daughter!
What floor was that?
Can't tell. They all look the same. lkuko? lkuko!
Mommy!
What were you doing? lwas looking all over for you.
Where did you get this? lt was lying on the ground.
Where?
Over there.
There aren't any kids living here now.
Well maybe some kids came over to play.
Your lucky day.
No.
She can't have these.
We don't know who they belong to.
Careful now, hon.
No problem!
''Lost and Found''
Mine!
Hey!
Come back here!
You silly!
The sound really carries, huh.
Yeah, it really carries.
Gottabe careful, huh.
Yeah, careful!
What the...
Count 10 times each tooth now.
Yup, l am!
Chee-ze! Chee-ze!
Everyone, l'd like to introduce... our newfriend, lkuko Matsubara.
Hi, l'm lkuko Matsubara. l think we can do better than that!
Alright! Pleased to meet you!
Nice job!
What floor, ma'am?
First floor, please.
Certainly.
What's...
Hello?
Excuse me.
There's water leaking from our ceiling. l'm Yoshimi Matsubara, just moved into Rm. 305.
There's a wet spot on my ceiling, and water dripping down from it.
Wellthe building is very old, you see.
So it gets a little rickety.
Ok, and so...? l'll make a note of it in the log.
Ok, everyone!
Quiet and listen up now. lwant to introduce our newest friend on her first day!
Can youte ll us your name?
Hi, l'm lkuko Matsubara!
Now let's all be good friends with lkuko, ok?
Ok!
Please. -Thank you.
We believe in giving children the freedom to do what they desire.
This is our basic educational philosophy.
All our kids are really outgoing. lkuko will make friends in no time.
Thank you.
Not at all.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. -Please.
Sir, Kobajashi's here. l hear you called
Ms. Tsushima''stupid''?
Come on, you're almost in first grade now.
You said it to Kusano and Uesugi, right?
That Ms. Tsushima was stupid.
Why is she ''stupid''?
What was it you said...
''Ms. Tsushimais stupid because she's fat.''
Right?
What's that all about?
Everyone overweight is ''stupid''?
Well?
What are you crying for?!
Kobajashi!
Yes, why?
You think it's our fault?
Well, it's nobody's but your own!
Hello?
Hello?
The place may be old, but l really doubt that's the cause. l think it's a plumbing leak from somewhere above us.
Maybe the room right above you...
That's what l thought, so l went up and checked.
But no one answered...
All done.
Ok, l'll tell the apartment manager myself tomorrow.
No, you see... he won't lift a finger, that's why l called you.
But l'm not involved with management, you see.
But water is... dripping down from my ceiling.
Ok, see you tomorrow!
Sorry to keep you waiting, l was a little tied up.
Where were we...
Oh yes, Yoshimi Matsubara.
You have previous experience, correct? l worked up until six years ago.
Right, right...
At Sanyu Publishing... quite a large company.
As you can tell, we're quite small.
Why did you leave Sanyu? l got married and then had a child.
Oh-right, right.
Are you sure you'd be happy here?
The pay wouldn't be as high, you know.
Well, l'm in a situation right now where... l really want to start working soon.
Of course, l don't mean taking ajob just anywhere...
That's alright. l understand.
Mr. Kono!
Coming!
Excuse me again.
Sorry about this.
What is it?
Bye, now. Thank you.
There's mommy.
Hello?
Who's picking up Yoshimi?
She's been waiting all alone for...
What? You can't just...!
So who's coming to pick her up today? l see.
Yoshimi
Today, daddy's coming to get you.
So just a little bit longer, ok?
What about mommy?
Mommy? Well, she...
Sir, what can l say?
Tomorrow is just too early for us to...
Ms. Matsubara?
Oh yes, l worked at...
Sanyu until l had my daughter six years ago.
My job was proofreading, and l look forward... to working with you.
Right...
Hey, wait a second...
Ms. Matsubara! lkuko lkuko...
Have you seen this child?
Mitsuko Kawai (5), born 11/3/93,
4'5'', 45lbs., long black hair.
Last seen 7/14/99, wearing a hooded yellow raincoat. lkuko!
Mommy!
What are you doing! l had no choice!
You didn't pick her up!
Stay out of this.
Waiting there all alone...
Do you know how that feels?!
Come on.
Let's go.
-lt's so pretty. -lt is, isn't it!
Want to try?
Let's get some on the way home.
Where should we do them?
We'd get in trouble on the balcony, huh.
Mommy? l don't need anyone but you.
Did daddy say something to you? l'm sorry, hon.
You know what? l can handle anything, just as long as you're with me.
You have one new message.
This is Mr. Kono from Mitsuba Publishing. l'm really sorry for all the commotion today at your interview.
Anyway l was thinking, if you'd like, we could have you start tomorrow proofreading.
No!
What? l just got ajob!
Really? Alright!
You did it!
Top floor, ma'am?
Please!
Fourth floor -toys.
Going up!
Ok!
Come on!
No! lkuko, don't
Ow! That hurts!
There! lwin!
But that's not yours, Mitsuko.
No fair.
What? l like this one, so l'll give you this one here.
You like it? lkuko, turn off the water and come on out.
But she loves the bath...
We've been in here so long.
Come on now, time to come out.
Ok, let's play hide and seek!
Yey!
Once, twice, three...
Rock, paper, scissors!
Ok, Mao's ''it''!
One...two...three... four...
Hey, can l...
This is our spot. Hide over there. l'm ready!
What happened?
Well...
She ''threw up and collapsed''?
That's never happened before.
You probably forced her to do something.
Not at all...
Youtwo...
Just what have you done to my child!
We haven't done anything.
But...
Try and calm down.
Come on, let's talk. lt seems that lately, lkuko has been behaving oddly.
Apparently she talks to herself alot. l also hear you're divorced.
That must be affecting her.
We see this alot with children of divorced parents.
''Come home soon, Mitsuko''
As amatter of fact, she used to behave oddly to.
However in Mitsuko's case, her mother had abandoned her.
Just got up and left one day.
You never heard of her?
The girl who disappeared two years ago.
Mitsuko Kawai.
She was one of our kids here. ls she... still missing?
Yes. l think she was kidnapped by some perverted individual.
Excuse me?
Apparently you're late picking up lkuko almost every day.
''Almost every day''?
That's an exaggeration...
Oh?
Well, sometimes... l get there late because of work, but really...
''Every day'' ...who told you that?
And is it true you yanked her arm and dislocated her shoulder?
Dislocated it?
Why no... of course not!
And how about wandering around aimlessly at night?
Do you deny this? l was a child then.
My parents had divorced.
Apparently l did such things without realizing it.
But it was only for a short period.
And l can assure you that would never happen now. lf the mother can't show she can raise the child...
Stop exaggerating everything!
What are you talking about?!
Don't deny it!
-Please, let's remain calm.
-Who is he! l'm Mr. Hamada's private lawyer
Masato Nishioka...
Using a guy like this... as your personal spy!
Hey, l'm just worried about lkuko.
Since when? l don't care how you rationalize it... stop playing dirty!!
Please, both of you.
We need to set the next date.
Right. Sorry.
So it was you...
And the bag... you put it there.
What?
The red bag, on the roof!
-Why did you do that?!
-What are you talking about!
-Why?! -Ms. Matsubara!
Take it easy!
Let's go inside, Mr. Hamdada.
Are you alright? ltake it... you're still in the middle of mediations. lf you let them see you like this, they'll think you're unstable, which can only hurt you.
My secretary's off today, so this may be a little strong.
Woops! Forgot the cream and sugar. lf they take her away from me... l...
Your husband seems pretty serious.
He could move against you anywhere, anytime.
They say with children under seven, the mother has the advantage.
But if you continue along this path, growing weaker by the day, it will be nearly impossible for you to gain custody. ln any case, nowis the most criticaltime. lf you want to continue living with your daughter, the first thing you needto do is pull yourself together.
Right...
Come on, we can't get very far like that now. lt'll be alright.
Let's fight this together.
Thank you.
Did she eat her lunch?
Sure did.
Girls are just the cutest things.
Auntie, leaving already?
Yup, have to stop off at the store.
You knowhowhe leaves it all to me.
Sorry, l know it's far...
You're the only one l can ask.
That's ok.
You've done well with lkuko.
A far cry from the mother you had.
She just couldn't think of anyone but herself...
Ok, see ya.
Thanks.
Bye.
Thanks. lkuko... lkuko lkuko! lkuko...
Mommy! lkuko... lkuko lkuko?
Are you there? lt's me... ls lkuko with you?
No.
Don't lie. l wouldn't lie about that!
Why, what happened?
Yoshimi! What's going on?! lkuko! lku... lkuko!
Hello! Open up!
Hello! lkuko, are you in there? lkuko? lkuko... lkuko?
Are you here? lkuko? lkuko!
Shoji and Mitsuko Kawai
Mitsuko Kawai...
May l come in?
Sure.
What are you doing?
We're moving out.
So lkuko will... have to change kindergarten again?
That's right.
Why not wait a while? l can't.
Ms. Matsubara,
... you know we're at a disadvantage as it stands. lf you move again now, think of how the committee will view this. l don't want to hear that now!
Mitsuko has returned to the apartment upstairs, and she's trying to take lkuko away!
So the room upstairs was open... l realize you're busy,
...but l'd like you to see this.
What the... ?
Mr. Kamiya!
But l locked it...
Wow, you were right...
What in the name of...
The family of that girl who disappeared... when did they move out?
Well, let's see... the end of last year, wasn't it?
The father lived here for a while by himself.
Said his little girl would have no place to come home to.
Which means, the water in here may have been running for the past six months.
Mr. Kamiya
Ms. Matsubara complained to you about this, didn't she?
Did you look into it?
Mr. Kamiya
There are alot of people in line for your job.
Alot of people to replace you.
Mr. Ohta l believe she also called you.
We'll... l'm uh...
Well... what about the footsteps l heard?
Well, we know lkuko was in here.
So someone else could have gotten in too.
The bag was lying right here.
Did youthrow it away again?
Well, l threwit away once.
But that's all l know.
So it's disappeared...
Maybe part of some superstition.
Either way, it must be the local kids.
Look how dirty this thing is...
Do you have it cleaned?
That's the cleaning company's job. l can go now, right?
Woops...
Think he's upset?
And then right over there, l saw someone.
Did you get a clear look? lt was just for an instant, but l saw something.
But l'll bet no one was there when you checked.
Well, yes...
See the highway over there?
And the neon sign on that building.
This water tank is exposedto light from all around.
So if something passed in front of the light, it would cast a shadow on the tank.
Then it would be natural for your eyes to play tricks on you.
Although, coming up here all alone at night and seeing what you saw... that would scare anyone.
Your husband's lawyer has also looked this over, and has agreed to the terms. l don't think this will compromise your position at all.
Thank you.
Just remember, this is simply a set of legal points worked out by lawyers.
So just continue with your daily routine, and try to remain focused. lwill.
Hey, you're just about there. lkuko.
Ready to go back to school?
Sure!
Well, you sure seem better! l would... really like to thank you for all you've done.
By myself, l was so confused...
Not at all. l can see lkuko needs you.
And that you need her. That's all. l can see now that l need to be stronger.
But it's not over yet.
The final decision will probably be made at the next session. ln any case, even if something happens before then, don't act alone.
Contact me immediately. lwill.
One, two, three!
All auntie makes is okayu rice.
Hey come on, youwere sick. lt's good though, isn't it? l like this better.
She brought her own water to make dinner.
She did?
Yeah, she said the water here is no good.
Yeah... the water here is definitely not the cleanest.
Are you sure about school tomorrow? l'm sure!
Alright! Let's get your things ready.
Ok, l'll go look for your bag. lkuko... how did this get in here? l don't know.
Did you go back to the roof?. l swear, l don't know. l won't be mad, so just tell me the truth.
Did you go up there?
No!
Ok. l'm sorry.
Connecting to personal voicemail...
Hello, this is Kishida...
Hello, Kishida Law Offices.
Hi, my name is Yoshimi Matsubara. ls Mr. Kishida there?
He's out at the moment, and we don't expect him back today. ls that so?
Well, thank you very much.
No! lkuko, stay right here.
Mommy
Stay here!

Hello? We're here.
Ok, we'll be waiting here... bye. ls she coming?
Yeah, said she'd be right down.
-Let's get some ice cream.
-Alright!
Come on. lkuko, what about you?
What?... No, l'm all set. l don't remember much from when l was in kindergarten.
Just that for a very brief period... lwas living together with my mother.
-Mommy! -l'm sorry, honey.
See? There she is!
-l'm so sorry. -Not at all.
Ok, see you tomorrow.
Bye!
B'bye.
Yoshimi and lkuko Matsubara
Mom?
Welcome home.
You've gotten so big.
Why... ?
Nobody told me.
Have you been living here all this time?
My friend's house is right near here. l'm going over there today. lt's next to my old kindergarten.
The Shimizus, do you know them?
That's my kindergarten, isn't it... over at the bus stop.
This used to be... my glass.
So you're already in high school...
How time flies! lf only l had known, l would've come to see you long before this.
That's ok.
You came to see me today.
Mom?
Remember when you said, that you could handle anything just as long as l was with you?
Of course.
Do you... still feel that way?
Yes, l do.
Good.
Mom...
Could l live here together with you? l'll tell dad myself, alright? l'm sure he'd be ok with it.
He has a new wife now, and more children. l... lkuko... l'm sorry, honey... that we can't be together.
Mom?
Mom!
My mother was here all that time,
...protecting me.

The End
 ^ xSilver ^
Baltimore, Md 1980
"Think to yourself that every day is your last...
"the hour to which you do not look forward...
"will come as a welcome surprise.
"As for me...
"when you want a good laugh...
"you will find me, in a fine state...
"fat and sleek...
"a true hog of Epicurus' herd."
And we find you cribbing lines from Horace, as well.
Well done, John.
I must say, Hannibal... speaking for the rest of the herd...
I'm sorry, for the Symphony Board... that these little soirees of yours... are always the highlight of our year.
- Just so.
- You're too kind.
I do feel guilty enjoying tonight when a musician is... still listed as a missing person.
Yes, poor fellow.
Shall I confess something wicked?
I can't help feeling the tiniest bit... relieved.
It sounds awful, I know.
But, let's face it, so does the man's playing.
Hannibal, confess.
What is this divine-looking amuse-bouche?
If I tell you...
I'm afraid you won't even try it.
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.
I'm sorry to bother you again,
Dr. Lecter. I know it's late.
It's no bother.
We're both night owls, I think.
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.
Let me take your coat.
What's on your mind?
We've been on the wrong track this whole time. You and I.
Our whole profile's wrong.
We've been looking for someone with a crazy grudge... and some kind of anatomical knowledge.
Decertified doctors, med school dropouts... laid-off mortuary workers...
From the precision of the cuts, and his choice of souvenirs.
That's where we're off-target.
He's not collecting body parts.
- Then why keep them?
- He's not. He's eating them.
No, listen. We were at
Molly's parents' for New Year's... and her dad was showing my son, Josh... how to carve a roasted chicken.
He said, "The tenderest part of the chicken is the oysters...
"on either side of the back."
I had never heard that expression before, "oysters."
Then suddenly I had a flash of the third victim...
Darcy Taylor.
She was missing flesh from her back. And then it hit me.
Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.
Every single victim lost some body part used in cooking.
Have you shared this with the Bureau?
No, I needed to see you first.
But I'm right. I know I'm right.
I'm starting to be able to think like this one.
Yeah, it's fascinating.
You know, I'd always suspected as much. You are an eidetiker.
I'm not psychic, Doctor.
No, this is different.
More akin to artistic imagination.
You can assume the emotional point of view of others... even those that might scare or sicken you.
It's a troubling gift,
I should think.
How I'd love to get you on my couch.
Something still doesn't make sense to me.
You're the best forensic psychiatrist I know... and somehow, in all our time together... this possibility never occurred to you.
I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I made a mistake.
You don't strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes.
Now I'm sorry to think
I might... no longer enjoy your full confidence.
No, I didn't say that.
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm very, very tired.
I almost had it.
It'll come to you.
Why don't you come back in the morning?
I'll clear some time on my schedule and... then we can get started in revising our profile.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Rest here, and I'll get your coat.
Won't be a tick.
Don't move.
You're in shock now. I don't want you to feel any pain.
In a moment you'll begin to be light-headed. Then drowsy.
Don't resist. It's so gentle.
Like slipping into a warm bath.
I regret it came to this, Will.
But every game must have its ending.
Remarkable boy.
I do admire your courage.
I think I'll eat your heart.
Marathon, FI Several Years Later
Hey, Dad. Someone's here.
Hey.
You've got a beautiful set-up here, Will.
Yeah, it's good.
- You know why I'm here?
- Yeah, I can guess.
How much do you know?
Just what was in the Miami Herald and the Times.
Two families killed a month apart in their homes.
Birmingham and Atlanta.
The circumstances were similar.
Not similar. The same.
What have you kept out of the papers?
He smashes mirrors and uses the pieces.
Wears latex gloves, so we've got no prints. Size 11 shoe.
He's not too comfortable with locks.
Pried open a patio door in Birmingham... used a glass cutter in Atlanta.
And his blood's AB positive.
- Somebody hurt him?
- Nope.
We typed him from semen and saliva. He's a secretor.
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.
Did you ever consider picking up the phone and giving me a call?
You've got all the people you need.
You've got Don'tmund at Harvard.
You got Bloom in Chicago.
I've got you down here fixing boat motors?
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.
I wouldn't be very useful to you.
I don't think about it anymore.
Really?
The last two we had, you caught.
By doing what you and the other guys are doing.
That's not entirely true.
It's the way you think.
Come on. There's been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.
I've got technicians to examine evidence... but you've got that other thing.
Imagination. Projection.
Whatever.
- I know you don't like it.
- You wouldn't like it, either.
This freak killed the Jacobis in Birmingham... on Saturday night, February 25.
Full moon.
He killed the Leeds family in Atlanta...
a few nights ago, March 28.
One day short of a lunar month.
If we're lucky, we may have a little over three weeks... before he does it again.
Will, do you respect my judgment?
Of course.
I think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help.
Go to Atlanta and look.
Just look.
Then help me brief the locals.
That's it.
Crawford has the whole damn government.
Why does he need you?
He just wants me to look at some evidence, Molly.
Give him another point of view.
It's a few days, a week maybe, and I'll be right back.
- And you believed that?
- Yes.
These kinds of cases come up very rarely... and I've had experience.
Yes, you have.
You're paid up, Will.
All of us. Even Josh.
There's a chance I could help them save some lives.
How do I say no to that?
This one will never see me or know my name.
I'll just help them find him.
The cops will take him down, not me.
I'll be in the back of the pack,
Molly, I promise.
Never in your life.
- I know you.
- Come on. Come here.
I love you.
See you in a few days.
Okay.
I'll call you tonight.
'Bye, Dad!
Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga
Where's the dog?
No one heard barking.
There's nothing about it in the case file.
The intruder enters in the dark and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.
He shoots Valerie Leeds in the stomach as she's rising... disabling her but not killing her.
He leaves her to watch her husband die... then turns and goes down the hall.
The children were...
The children were still in bed when they were shot... which might indicate that he used a silencer.
He dragged the bodies into the master bedroom, but why?
They were already dead and none of them got the same... extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.
Small pieces of mirror were inserted... in the orbital sockets of the victims.
This occurred post-mortem.
Why did you put mirrors in their eyes?
The pieces of mirror are to make their eyes look alive!
He wanted an audience.
He wanted them all lined up... watching him when he touched her.
When he touched her.
Touched. Talcum powder.
There was talcum powder.
"Mrs. Leeds had traces of talcum on her right inner thigh.
"A complete search of the home...
"led to no such matching talcum in the house."
You took your gloves off, didn't you? You son of a bitch!
You took your gloves off, touched her... with your bare hand and wiped her down.
But when the gloves were off, did you open her eyes?
Crawford.
Are the Leeds' bodies still at the morgue?
Who's good with latent prints here?
Atlanta P.D.
They've already printed the bodies.
Not the bodies.
Tell them to check the eyes.
Mrs. Leeds' eyes.
Even her corneas.
I think he took his gloves off.
I think he had to touch her.
Jesus, Will.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
This is what the subject's teeth look like.
The impressions came from bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.
This degree of crookedness... plus the groove in this central incisor... makes his bite signature unique.
Fuckin' shark.
Knock it off!
We're grateful to have the FBI.
They have a lot of expertise in this area.
In particular,
Investigator Graham does.
That right, Jack?
Yes, sir.
Anything you want to add,
Mr. Graham?
Why don't you come on up to the front, please?
That's the guy.
Was he?
Yeah, that's the guy who arrested Lecter.
I thought he retired.
The son of a bitch just about gutted him.
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi were the primary targets.
The others were killed just to complete his fantasy.
I know that might be hard to accept given what you saw... but this was not random.
This wasn't some killing frenzy.
He was never out of control.
These attacks were organised, the women carefully chosen.
We don't know how he's choosing them, or why.
They lived in different states and never met.
But there is some connection.
There's some common factor, and that's the key.
Find out what that is, and we'll save lives.
'Cause this one is gonna go on and on... until we get smart or we get lucky.
He won't stop.
- Why not?
- Because it makes him God.
Would you give that up?
You asked about the dog.
Last night a vet called us.
Leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in... the afternoon before they were killed.
Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.
The vet had to put it down.
Was it wearing a collar with the address on it?
No.
- Did the Jacobis have a dog?
- No dog.
They found a litter box in the basement... cat droppings in it, no cat.
If the cat was attacked, the Jacobis may have buried it.
Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.
And tell them to use a methane probe, it's faster.
Yeah. It's for you.
Crawford.
Carl, you're the light of my life.
Would it hold up in court?
Okay. Great work.
They found a print on
Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.
Besides that, there's nothing else to tell you.
Thank you for your time.
I can't answer more questions.
Will Graham! Remember me?
Freddy Lounds. I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler.
- Did the paperback.
- Yeah, I remember.
When did they bring you in?
What've you got?
You think the Tooth Fairy will be bigger than Lecter?
I mean, he's already beaten
Lecter's score...
You write lying shit, and the Tattler is an asswipe!
You stay away from me.
Get away, Lounds.
How about an exclusive?
Sorry about that.
That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.
Remember? With the tubes hanging out of me?
Forget that prick.
Give yourself some credit.
When we catch the Tooth Fairy... that print plus his teeth will burn him.
You did that, Will.
That evidence was there, Jack.
- It was there for anyone to see.
- But nobody else did.
All I'm sayin' is, that was very good work.
No, good work would be seeing it all the way through... and catching the guy.
And I can't do that.
I did what you asked me to do.
I'm going home.
I don't even have any idea who this guy is.
What I just gave them was broad strokes. He's got no face to me.
That's what you said about
Garrett Hobbs, remember?
- And you figured him out.
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?
- No, I was stuck on Hobbs.
I had help.
From Lecter.
Yeah.
Jack, don't play games with me.
Don't do it.
Just tell me what's on your mind.
I'm saying maybe we've got a resource we should look into.
Is that what this was about?
Did you just want to ask me that all along?
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just doing my job.
If you know a better shortcut, let me know it.
If you think there's any chance he'll talk to me...
I'll go myself.
If you can't handle it,
God knows I'd understand that.
As a research subject, Lecter has proven most disappointing.
He's simply impenetrable to psychological testing.
Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception.
He folds them into origami.
As you see.
So you can imagine the stir your little visit... is causing among my staff,
Mr. Graham.
If you'd care to share some insights...
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, I've got a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.
Of course.
Tell me, when you saw Lecter's murders... their style, so to speak... were you able, perhaps, to reconstruct his fantasies?
And, if so, did you jot down any impressions?
No.
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.
The first analysis of Lecter will be a publisher's wet dream.
I'd give you full credit, of course.
Damn it, man. You must have some advice. You caught him.
What was your trick?
I let him kill me.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?
I got it, thank you.
So nice of the Bureau's crime lab to forward that.
They wouldn't give me your home address.
Dr. Bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction...
in the
Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You say you're a layman.
But it was you who caught me.
Wasn't it, Will?
Do you know how you did it?
I got lucky.
I don't think you believe that.
It's in the transcript.
What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.
Birmingham and Atlanta.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you'd have ideas.
I want you to tell me them.
Why should I?
There are things you don't have.
Research materials.
Maybe even computer access.
I'd speak to the Chief of Staff.
Yes, Dr. Chilton.
Gruesome, isn't he?
He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at panties.
If you recall, Will... our last collaboration ended rather messily.
You'd get to see the file on this case.
- And there's another reason.
- I'm all ears.
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.
Find out if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then, by implication, you think you're smarter than I am... since it was you who caught me.
I know I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
And your hands are so rough.
Not like a cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
Has a little ship on the bottle, does it not?
And how is young Josh and the lovely Molly?
They're always in my thoughts, you know.
You will not persuade me with appeals... to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Is that the case file?
Yes.
With photos?
Let me keep them, and I might consider it.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet!
Give me the file, then!
And I'll tell you what I think.
I'll need one hour. And privacy.
Just like old times, Will?
This is a very shy boy, Will.
I'd love to meet him.
Have you considered that he is disfigured... or that he may believe he is disfigured?
Yeah, the mirrors.
Notice he smashes all the mirrors... not just enough to get the pieces he wants.
And, of course, those shards in their eyes... so he can see himself there.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I had considered it.
- What about the women?
- Dead?
Mere puppets.
You need to see them living, the way they caught his eye.
That's impossible.
Almost. Not quite.
What were the yards like?
Big backyards, fenced, some hedges. Why?
Because if this pilgrim... feels a special relationship with the moon... he might like to go outside and look at it.
You ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, say, it'd be better to have... outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.
You think the yards are a factor when he selects victims?
Yes.
And there will be more of them, of course. Victims.
You'll be wanting lots of these little chinwags...
- I take it.
- I might not have time.
I do.
I have oodles.
I need your opinion now.
Then here's one:
You stink of fear under that cheap lotion.
You stink of fear, Will, but you're not a coward!
You fear me, but still you came here.
You fear this shy boy, yet still you seek him out.
Don't you understand, Will?
You caught me because we're very much alike.
Without our imaginations... we'd be like all those other poor dullards.
Fear is the price of our instrument.
But I can help you bear it.
- You getting his face?
- Yeah.
Okay, you got it?
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
Sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
What do you think he meant by "see them living"?
I don't know, maybe nothing.
It's hard to separate his bullshit.
But I'm gonna make another pass at the Leeds' house.
All right, Duchess, doll.
That's it.
Show me what you can do.
Who's that? Get them, Duchess.
Get them, Duch! Go get them!
Go get them, girl!
Okay.
And action!
Charles! What are you doing?
Hey, gang.
You crazy man.
How is everybody doing?
Just home from the store.
Hi, Daddy.
That's my girl.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey. Billy?
Hi, Dad.
And sweetie?
I am not ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille.
What do you think?
Get closer. Get closer.
Little closer.
I think we'd better put these kids to bed early tonight.
They seem tired. Don't you think?
Here we are at the pool party.
What are you doing? Stop it!
You stop it! I'm telling my mother on you.
Now I get my kiss?
- All right, you want a kiss?
- I want one. The romantic kind.
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al
Won't nobody get in through here again. I'll guaran-damn-tee it.
Why didn't he break in down there? It's more hidden.
Hell, that door's got deadbolts.
Reckon he was in too big a hurry.
No, this one doesn't hurry.
You sat right here, didn't you?
You watched the children bury the cat.
And then you waited for dark.
You're proud.
You had to sign your work.
Grandma? Grandma?
I'm sorry.
I've never seen a child as dirty and disgusting as you.
Look at you! You're soaking wet.
Get out of my bed.
No.
Go back to your room.
You're hurting me!
Shut up, you filthy little beast!
I should have put you in an orphanage, grandson or not.
Grandma, don't hurt me.
You're hurting me!
Into the bathroom!
Take off your nightshirt, and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!
Now give me my scissors from the medicine chest.
Please, no!
Take that filthy thing in your hand. Stretch it out.
No, Grandma.
Now!
Please!
Look down. Do you want me to cut it off? Do you?
No, Grandma!
I pledge you my word, Francis...
if you ever make your bed dirty again...
I'll cut it off.
Do you understand?
I'll be a good boy.
I promise.
Good morning, Will.
So nice of you to visit again.
He carved this on a tree near the Jacobi house.
With a Buck knife.
The same one later used on Charles Leeds.
Yes.
Take a walk with me.
He had a second tool, too.
A bolt cutter.
He used that to clear his view.
But?
I don't think that's what he brought it for.
It's too heavy. Too awkward.
And he had to carry it a long way.
And what do we make of that symbol?
Asian Studies at Langley... identified it as a Chinese character.
It appears on a mah-jong piece.
- It marks the Red Dragon.
- Red Dragon. Correct.
This boy begins to interest me.
We don't know what greater meaning the symbol might have...
Do you like my little exercise cage, Will?
My so-called lawyer is always nagging Dr. Chilton...
for better accommodations.
I don't know which is the greater fool.
Perhaps if you could offer some insight into...
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.
I'm allowed 30 minutes in here, once a week.
Get to the point.
He meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house... but he didn't.
Instead he broke in through the patio doors.
The noise woke Jacobi, and he had to shoot him on the stairs.
That wasn't planned.
It was sloppy.
And that's not like him.
We mustn't judge too harshly, Will.
It was his first time.
Have you never felt a sudden rush of panic?
Yeah, that's the fear we talked about.
It takes experience to master it.
You sensed who I was... back when I was committing what you call my "crimes."
Yes.
So you were hurt not by a fault in your perception... or your instincts... but because you failed to act on them until it was too late.
- You could say that.
- But you're wiser now.
Imagine what you would do, Will, if you could go back in time.
Put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto.
Very good, Will.
You know,
I believe we're making progress.
And that's what our pilgrim is doing.
He is refining his methods.
He is evolving.
The case file mentioned videos of the Leeds family.
- I'd like to see those.
- No.
- Why not?
- It would be obscene.
You don't make it easy, do you?
Still, one aims to please.
I'll call you if I think of anything else.
Would you perhaps like to leave me your home number?
- That's the end of our session.
- For now.
It was only his first time.
Already in Atlanta he did much better.
Rest assured, my dear Will... this one will give you plenty of exercise.
My love to Molly and Josh, goodbye.
Go to the back of the cell,
Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.
If you turn around before the lock snaps... you'll get a dart.
Understood?
Yes.
You got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer.
Starting now.
Thanks so much, Barney.
Hello, Dr. Lecter?
I have those documents you requested me...
"Robes, Robespierre, Robin.
"Robin, call for...
Robin, fainting...
"Redbreast in a cage." 406.9.
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"
Yes, that's it.
William Blake.
Auguries of Innocence.
Think you got it?
Yeah, we should have.
We have some books of Blake's paintings, too.
- Want to see them?
- Yeah. Thanks.
Psychology Department...
University of Chicago.
Dr. Bloom's office.
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine and Edwards Publishing.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
The Psychiatrist and the Law... to Will Graham.
His assistant was supposed to give me... the address and phone number, but, darn it, she never did.
I'm just a temp.
Linda will be in on Monday.
I have to catch FedEx in about five minutes.
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom about it... because he told Linda to send it... and I don't want to get her into trouble.
It's right there in the Rolodex, or whatever.
I'll dance at your wedding if you read it to me.
I don't know.
I'm really not supposed to.
Be a darling and flip that old rascal...
I won't take up any more of your time.
Graham, Will.
All right. Just a minute.
"Gibson, Gordon, Graham."
It doesn't give a home address.
What does it have, dear?
"FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue
Northwest, Washington, D.C. "
Yeah?
And let's see.
Here it is.
"P.O. Box 3680,
Marathon, Florida. "
Marathon.
Yes.
That's fine. You're an ángel.
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.
I've come for the package of infrared.
Right. Put your back against the door and come... forward three steps till you feel tile under your feet.
And there's a stool just on the left.
Same Mr. D who's head of Tech Services, am I right?
I'm Reba McClane.
Just a second more and I will get you some light.
Okay, here we go.
So, what do you need the IR for?
It's for the zoo.
They want to photograph the nocturnal animals.
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.
This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
No, Ralph.
It's starting to spritz outside.
I'll give you a lift home?
You ride a motorcycle.
How's that gonna help me with the rain?
I thought maybe we'd stop off someplace... have ourselves a little sundowner.
- I've already got a ride.
- It's cool.
That's cool. No problemo.
If there's anything I hate worse than pity, it's fake pity.
Especially from a walking hard-on like Ralph Mandy.
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.
Ride with me!
Thanks, but I take the bus all the time.
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me... for my pleasure.
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.
When is the zoo project?
- Maybe next week. They'll call.
- I love zoos.
In fact one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar... when I was about five.
I didn't lose my sight till I was seven. Diphtheria.
Could you hand me that knife?
I've always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like.
But by now, to tell the truth, what I see in my head... is probably not in the least bit like a cougar.
It's more like a donkey or a goat.
You know, sometimes I'm not so sure I really saw him.
Maybe he's just something I dreamed up.
You okay?
You don't say much, do you?
No, I guess not.
Let's talk about something and get it out of the way, okay?
I can hear that you've had... some kind of soft palate repair.
But I understand you fine because you speak very well.
If you don't want to talk to me, that's cool.
But I hope that you will, because...
I know what it's like to have people... always thinking that you're different.
That's good.
May I touch your face?
I want to know if you're smiling or frowning.
I want to know whether I should just shut up or not.
Take my word that I'm smiling.
I have to go.
If I offended you,
I didn't mean to.
No.
F.B.I. Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.
I don't know what they were like.
It'd help if I could see some of their personal effects.
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?
I sure do. I mean, other than... one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.
That would be Mr. Jacobi's surviving son by his first wife?
Yes. As their executor, I keep all that stuff in the office... along with some of the smaller valuables, till after probate.
But the Birmingham P.D.'s been all through it.
Could you pack those things and ship them up to me?
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.
Hell... probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine.
Son, just tell me you're gonna nail that son of a bitch.
We're doing our best.
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.
Might've been mailed by the Tooth Fairy.
He wants Lecter's approval.
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.
I've scrambled a chopper.
Does Lecter know we have the note?
Not yet. It was found in a routine cleanup.
They don't open his mail?
Need a warrant.
X- rays only.
Where's Lecter?
The holding cage.
Can he see his cell?
No. But he's been there almost half an hour.
He'll soon start to wonder what's wrong.
We got to buy time, Jack.
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Call your building superintendent... or engineer, whoever's in charge.
Tell him to pull the circuit breakers on Lecter's hall.
Have the super walk down the hall past the cell... carrying tools.
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off, too busy to answer questions.
And don't forget:
Don't touch the note, okay?
Graham's on his way.
Listen up! We've got a note coming in on the fly... possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.
It has to go back to
Lecter's cell within the hour... unmarked.
We'll need Hair and Fibre,
Latent Prints, then Documents.
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people!
DOLARHYDE My dear Dr. Lecter:
I wanted to tell you...
I'm delighted...
that you've taken an interest in me.
And when I learned of your vast correspondence, I thought:
"Dare I?" Of course I do.
I don't believe you'll tell them who I am.
Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.
The important thing is what I am becoming.
I know that you alone can understand this transformation.
I have some things
I'd love to show you.
If circumstances permit,
I hope we can correspond.
I have admired you for years and have...
a complete collection of your press notices.
Actually, I think of them as unfair reviews.
As unfair as mine.
They do like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?
"The Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate?
It would shame me for you to read that, if I didn't know...
you had suffered the same distortions in the press.
I'm fed up with this bloody stupid building!
Every day something breaking.
I swear they ought to tear the whole fucking place down.
- How much longer do we have?
- Ten minutes, max.
BOWInstructions for answering... were probably in the section
Lecter tore out.
Why not just throw the whole note away?
It was full of compliments.
He couldn't bear to part with them.
Now we can mash just a little.
You're so sly.
BOWBut so am I.
Aniline dyes and coloured inks are transparent to infrared.
These could be the tips of "T's" here and here.
On the end, that's a "P," or possibly an "R."
Maybe this is where he's telling
Lecter how to answer him.
There's only one way to carry on a conversation... that's one-way blind.
Publication. Wait a minute.
We know this guy reads the Tattler.
That's in his note, right?
The Tooth Fairy, they made that up.
BOWThree "T's" and an "R" in "Tattler."
How do you communicate through a tabloid?
- You got what? News stories.
- Personals.
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer him through the personals?
- That could be it.
- We need proofs of the pages...
before the next Tattler's published!
I'm on it!
Investigator Graham interests me.
Not your standard gumshoe, is he?
More alert.
Purposeful looking.
You should have taught him not to meddle.
Forgive the stationery.
I chose it because it'll dissolve very quickly...
if you should have to swallow it.
If I hear from you, next time
I might send you something wet.
Until then, dear Doctor...
I remain your most...
avid fan.
The Tattler got an ad order signed 666...
Baltimore postmark on the envelope.
It's set to run this afternoon.
Chicago field office is sending the text through now.
- "Dear Pilgrim."
- That's it.
Lecter called him a pilgrim when we talked.
"You honour me.
You're very beautiful." Christ!
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...
"9:1, Luke 1:7."
- Code.
- Has to be.
We've got 19 minutes to get in a message if we can break this.
The Tattler can't hold its presses any longer.
It's simple.
They only needed cover against casual readers.
- I'm thinking it's a book code.
- Code?
The first numeral...
"100 prayers," may be the page number.
The numbers after could be line and letter. But what book?
- Bible?
- No, he's got "Galatians 15:2."
It has only six chapters.
Same with "Jonah 6:8."
It has four chapters.
He wasn't using a Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book to use.
He specified it in his note, in the part Lecter tore out.
BOWIt would appear so.
What about sweating Lecter?
In a mental hospital...
- I would think drugs...
- No.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago, to find out... where he buried the Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for dip.
If we sweat him, we lose the connection.
If the Tooth Fairy picked the book... he knew Lecter would have it in his cell.
- Can we get a list of his books?
- From Chilton, maybe.
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham, when they tossed his cell... took Polaroids so they could put everything back in place.
Ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves!
Where?
BOWThe Library!
I'm leery of letting
Lecter's message run... without knowing what it says.
I say let this one run.
We keep working on the code.
At least it'll encourage the Fairy to contact him again.
What if it encourages him to do something besides write?
I don't like this any better than you.
But it's our best shot.
National Tattler Building,
Chicago, II
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
BOWOh, my God!
Hello?
Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman.
I solved the code.
You need to know what it says right now.
Okay, Lloyd.
It says,
"Graham home, Marathon, Florida.
"Save yourself. Kill them all."
Yeah?
Bowman just broke the code.
- What does it say?
- I'll tell you in a second.
Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it. Stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
Lecter gave the bastard your home address.
Wait.
Mum?
AGENT Head down, ma'am.
Is he after you now?
No, Lecter just suggested it to him.
I hate this, Molly.
I'm sorry.
- It's a sick feeling.
- I know it is.
But you'll be safe here.
Crawford's brother owns this place.
No one in the world knows you're here.
I'd just as soon not talk about Crawford.
What are you using as bait?
Sometimes I use worms.
You like those?
Beneath the yellow folder... you'll find your latest rejection slip... from the archives.
It was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail.
I'm afraid I opened it without looking.
Sorry.
I think we'll remove
Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.
Atlanta P.D. Nailed him.
He had a fake Bureau ID... and was trying to get the Leeds family autopsy photos.
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta kicked him back to us.
Personally...
I'd like nothing better than to see the dirt sandwich... pulling five at Leavenworth.
But maybe there's a better way to handle this.
Yeah? What's that?
I think we ought to give him a story.
The Tooth Fairy's ugly... and he's impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Also, he sexually molests his male victims.
While they're alive?
Sorry, I can't go into those details.
But we do also speculate... that he's the product of an incestuous home.
No wonder the creep's such a loser, right?
That's a tip we got from Dr. Lecter, by the way.
So it's true that Lecter's helping with your investigation?
Yes, it's true.
The Doctor was offended a bottom-feeding lowlife like... the Tooth Fairy would consider himself in the same league.
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.
Will, your little
Washington hideaway.
This is an apartment I'm borrowing... till this creep goes down in flames.
I keep copies of the evidence so I can work on it at night.
Make sure you can read the name on that building.
Yeah.
All right, I got enough.
Just remember, I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
If my story draws the Fairy in an attack on Graham... and you nail the scumbag,
I get an exclusive.
Fuck you, Lounds.
When we see the story, we'll consider what to do... about your sealed indictment.
All right, it was a pleasure doing business with you, chumps.
I feel like I need a shower.
You okay with this?
Better he comes after me than Molly and Josh.
So, yeah, I'm okay with it.
I wish we had something better... but there's only ten days till the next full moon.
We've got to rattle his cage.
We'll stake out this apartment, put snipers on the rooftops.
You'll have a moving box tail,
24/7, in your car...
on the street, wherever you go.
You'll wear the Kevlar at all times. No exceptions.
You again?
Come back at 4:00 a.m.
When I open, all right?
Hey, I told you!
What?
You told me what?
Fucking dickhead!
Is that your fucking name on the sign?
Where am I?
What am I doing here?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I haven't seen your face.
I couldn't possibly identify you.
I work for the National Tattler.
It would pay... a big reward for me.
I mean, a half a million... or a million, maybe.
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Lounds?
No.
And I don't want to know.
You know, believe me.
According to you,
I'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure... a "bottom-feeding lowlife"... who's about to
"go down in flames."
I think you know now, don't you?
Yes.
Do you understand what I'm doing, Mr. Lounds?
No.
But I would like to.
I really want to understand... and then all my readers could understand, too.
I am not a man.
I began as one... but each being that I change makes me... more than a man... as you will witness.
I don't need to see you. No.
But you must, Mr. Lounds.
You're a reporter.
You're here to report.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No.
If you won't open them...
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
No!
Open your eyes!
Oh, my dear God Jesus!
Oh, God!
Do you want to know what I am?
More than anything.
I was afraid to ask.
Do you see now?
Yeah, I see.
Oh, God.
Mrs. Jacobi in human form.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds in human form.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Jacobi changing.
- Oh, my God.
Mrs. Leeds changing.
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.
Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds reborn.
- Do you see?
- Please, no.
No? No what?
Not me.
Why did you write lies,
Mr. Lounds?
Graham told me to lie.
It wasn't me.
- Will you tell the truth now?
- Yes!
About me?
- My work?
- Oh, yes.
My becoming?
Yeah.
I am the Dragon, and you call me insane!
You are privy to a great becoming... and you recognise nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is in your nature to do one thing correctly.
Before me, you rightly tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me,
Mr. Lounds.
You owe me awe.
Read.
That's all, Mr. Lounds.
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Soon.
There's one more way I can help you to better understand.
I want to understand.
I do.
And I'm really gonna be fair... from now on.
You know that.
Hello?
Oh, God, no!
LOUNDS I have had a great privilege.
I have seen with...
wonder and awe the strength of the Great Red Dragon.
He has helped me to understand his splendour...
and now I want to serve him.
He knows you made me lie,
Will Graham.
Because I was forced to lie...
he will be more merciful to me than to you.
Hello?
Oh, God, no!
We can let this tie us up in knots... or we can learn from it.
Maybe even use it to catch the bastard.
He had to have a van or panel truck... to move Lounds around in that big old wheelchair.
Go on.
He had to already have the wheelchair... or know where to get one fast.
It's an antique, not something you'd find in the house.
Does it strike anybody that he set this up in a hurry?
The Tattler comes off the press
Monday night.
By Tuesday morning he's in Chicago, snatching Lounds.
He either lives in the Chicago area... or he's within a driving radius of... call it six hours.
Find out in this area where the Tattler was available... for early distribution
Monday night.
Start with airports, all-night newsstands.
Maybe a newsie remembers an odd customer.
Lloyd, this cassette, enhance the audio.
Maybe you can pick up something in the background.
That wheelchair...
I want the maker, date, possible sources.
Graham and I will coordinate from Chicago. Let's hustle.
Look, there's not gonna be any answers in Chicago, Jack.
Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.
That was a chance to show off.
It doesn't even fit his pattern.
The Leeds and the Jacobis are what he needs.
I think I should go back to Baltimore.
After what he tried to pull?
Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note.
Not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.
Even if he did, he won't tell you.
Not unless
I can offer him something.
LECTER Congratulations.
That was most artistic, the way you disposed of Mr. Lounds.
Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.
Does it?
I hadn't noticed.
Oh, you will.
I have other resources.
Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?
Your first murder?
Of course you did.
Why shouldn't it feel good?
It does to God.
Why, only last week in Texas, he dropped a church roof... on the heads of 34 of his worshippers... as they were grovelling through a hymn.
He wouldn't begrudge you one journalist.
Put me next to him, Doctor.
You and some SWAT team?
Oh, Will.
Where's the fun in that?
He'll have to take his chances, too.
A roof can fall on anybody.
But not on Molly and Josh,
I take it.
Not yet, anyway.
First he kills the pet, then the family.
Freddy was your pet.
They're safe now.
No one will ever be safe around you, Will.
Clever work on his note, by the way.
And that blackout was an especially nice touch.
What else was in that note,
Doctor?
Put me next to him!
That's what you want, isn't it?
To help him succeed where you failed?
Twice?
Give him a chance to kill me.
Go on, then.
Seduce me with your wares.
Full restoration of your privileges.
Plus computer access to the AMA archives.
One hour a week under supervision, of course... but it's a one-time offer.
It expires the minute I walk out of here.
Bit measly, don't you think?
Turn it down, then. See what terms you get from Chilton.
Are these threats, William?
I'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe you've got nothing left to sell.
A little sample, then. Why not?
- Seen the Blake, have you?
- Yes.
No, you've looked but not seen.
Transformation is the key.
The man-dragon... his ugliness transformed by power.
Look for a military record with combat training.
Look for extensive tattooing... and corrective surgery, most likely to the face.
Come on, I'm past that already and you know it.
Give me what I need.
How is he choosing the women?
I've already suggested how.
The answer was in front of you.
- You looked but didn't see.
- Bullshit! No riddles!
Just tell me.
No!
It's your turn.
I asked you before for a small courtesy... and you responded rudely.
Before I tell you anything more... you will make certain arrangements for me.
What kind of arrangements?
Oh, nothing much.
Shall we say dinner and a show?
You ready to tell me what kind of outing this is?
Nope.
You're just full of surprises, aren't you, D?
Yep.
He's about six feet away.
Can you smell him?
Yeah.
Now, he's a little noisy, but he's sedated, I assure you.
Doctor Hassler's about to fix his broken tooth.
Glad you could come,
Ms. McClane.
We appreciate the infrared film, by the way.
Two more steps.
I'll put your left hand on the edge of the table.
Now, he's right in front of you.
Take your time.
- D?
- I'm here.
You go ahead.
Here.
Why don't you try this?
Nine steps from the front door to the clock... and three more to this room.
Sorry. Force of habit.
That beautiful tiger, this house, this music...
I don't think anybody knows you at all, D.
Everybody wonders about you, though.
Especially the women.
What do they want to know?
They find you... very mysterious and interesting.
Did they tell you how I look?
They said that you have a remarkable body.
That you're very sensitive about your face but you shouldn't be.
Oh, and... they asked me if... you are as strong as you look.
And?
I said I didn't know.
Where the hell are you, D?
Here you are.
Do you want to know what I think about it?
Now, would you show me where the bathroom is?
I have to do a little work.
- If I'm keeping you from work...
- No.
...l'll go.
- I want you to be here.
I do. It's just a tape
I need to watch.
It won't take long.
- Do you need to hear it, too?
- No.
May I keep the music?
What's it about?
Some people I'm going to meet.
So then... it's what? It's a corporate promo?
Some kind of homework?
It's homework. Yeah.
That's a good idea.
It's so important to be prepared.
My God, are you ever!
No. I won't give her to you. No.
Please, just for a little while.
No! You're hurting me!
No... she's nice.
She's okay.
I had a really terrific time last night.
But this morning you seem like a different person.
- Is something wrong?
- I have to go now.
- I have to go away.
- Where?
On a trip.
- When will I see you again?
- Reba, you have to get out. Now.
METCALF Dear Mr. Graham:
Here are the Jacobis' personal effects, as discussed.
I hope these things might help you.
Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.
How many more times are we going to watch this?
"See them living," he said,
"right in front of you."
It's something about these home movies.
Lecter keeps saying,
"You looked, but didn't see."
Lecter says a lot of things.
Sad damn thing.
But we already knew that.
We can't afford to let Lecter waste our...
No. Again.
Your dissertation must be nearly finished, Mr. Crane.
Nearly.
It's nice to be able to connect a face with a name... after all our correspondence.
But, you know, you don't look like I imagined you looked.
What did you think
I looked like?
Different.
Thank you.
Right there! There.
That's what he wanted the bolt cutter for.
To cut that padlock and go in through the basement.
But that's a different door.
I don't get it. The one I saw was flush steel with deadbolts.
Jacobi had a new door installed.
Beginning of January, I think.
It's in here somewhere.
Think he cased the house with the old door?
He brought the bolt cutter, didn't he?
He was sure he'd need it.
Why case it two months in advance and not check it?
I don't know. He was ready with the bolt cutter... like at the Leeds' house.
There he was ready with a glass cutter.
He must've seen the glass when he walked in the neighbourhood.
No. You can't see that door from the yard.
There's a porch lattice in the way.
Jack, he knew the inside of the houses.
Remarkable, isn't it?
Two hundred years old.
Yet so fresh.
So vivid.
He almost looks alive, doesn't he?
We've just gotten a report here from the...
Do you still have the Jacobis' check stubs...
and credit card statements?
We're looking for any kind of service call or purchase... that might've required a stranger... to enter the house.
A repairman, delivery guy.
Anybody in the house.
Yeah.
We checked.
I know we checked that... but now we got to go back to before January.
Last year's purchase orders.
Yeah.
No collar.
But please hurry. It's urgent.
No collar.
Metcalf says...
No collar.
The dog had no collar in a neighbourhood of dogs... but he knew which was theirs.
Same with the Jacobis' cat.
No collar, but he knew.
He knew about the padlock.
He knew about the pane of glass.
He knew the layout.
He knew how to get in.
Every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this...
Oh, Jesus.
Is Metcalf still on the phone?
Give it!
Byron, it's Graham.
You said Niles Jacobi took a few keepsakes. Do you have a list?
Yeah, right here.
I need to know if something he took was a home video.
A full-length VHS tape, compiled from shorter tapes.
I see one videotape.
Yes?
But it says, "Meet the Jacobis."
It's Chromalux.
We just got a fax.
An incident at the Brooklyn Museum.
A guy attacked two employees, and get this... ate the Blake painting.
What?
That's him. It's got to be.
If that painting meant so much to him, why destroy it?
And why didn't he kill those two women at the museum?
They both got a good look at him.
Maybe he's trying to stop.
Mr. Crawford, all you've got is a hunch.
I've got 382 employees, and they've got a union.
I can't just turn you loose on their files.
Not without a court order.
There are privacy issues.
The company's exposure.
One of the employees has already killed 11 people... that we know of.
If he gets away tonight... what's the company's exposure on that?
- I'll get our lawyers here...
- We don't have time for that.
Listen!
We're looking for a white male,
25 to 35...
- right-handed with brown hair.
- No...
Listen! Please. He's strong.
He's possibly a bodybuilder.
He might have some kind of facial disfigurement.
He drives a van or a panel truck.
That sounds like Mr. D.
Oh, my God.
Who's Mr. D?
Francis Dolarhyde,
Manager of Technical Services.
What does he do exactly?
He maintains the equipment for tape transfers.
Would he have access to people's home videotapes?
He has access to every tape that comes through here.
Thanks for dinner, and thanks for letting me vent.
Look, no problemo.
Reba, listen, I know it's not my place to say this...
Go on.
Well, if Dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is... maybe you ought to keep some distance.
I mean, what do you really know about the guy?
I appreciate your concern, Ralph. Really.
And I promise
I'll give it some thought.
- Hey, have a great vacation.
- Thanks.
- See you in a week.
- Good night.
I had a great time.
Good night.
Good night!
Ralph, just 'cause
I'm feeling vulnerable...
Wake up.
You wandered around in the house while I was asleep, didn't you?
What?
The other night, did you find something odd?
Did you take it and show it to somebody? Did you do that?
D? What is it?
What's happening?
- Sit still or he'll hear us!
- Who will?
He's upstairs.
He wants you, Reba.
I thought he was gone, but now he's back.
D, you're scaring me.
I didn't want to give you to him.
I did a thing for you today so he couldn't have you.
I was wrong.
You made me weak and then you hurt me.
No.
No, you can't have her!
Please don't let him have me.
You won't.
I'm for you.
You like me. I know you like me.
Take me with you.
Take you with me?
Yes. Put out your hand.
Feel this. That's a shotgun.
A 12-gauge magnum.
Do you know what it'll do?
I wish I could have trusted you.
I wanted to trust you.
You felt so good!
So did you.
- Please don't hurt me now.
- It's all over for me.
- Where are you?
- I can't leave you to him.
Do you know what he'll do?
He'll bite you to death.
He'll hurt you so bad!
I can't let that happen.
- It's better if you go with me.
- Yes, God, get us out of here!
- I'll shoot you and then myself.
- Oh, no.
- I have to shoot you.
- No...
I can't do it.
D!
Three steps to the clock.
From the clock to the door, nine more.
Oh, God.
What is that?
What the hell is that?
That's the place.
Goddamn it!
All units, that's his house that's burning.
FBI!
Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?
He's in there. He is dead.
You know that?
He shot himself in the face.
I put my hand in it.
He set fire to the house.
He was on the floor, and l...
You all right?
That's all I need.
I'd like to come back before I leave town.
See how you're doing.
Sure, why not?
Who could resist a charmer like me?
You know, whatever part of him was still human... was only kept alive because of you.
You probably saved some lives.
You didn't draw a freak. Okay?
You drew a man with a freak on his back.
I should have known.
No, sometimes you don't.
Trust me, I've been there.
Listen to me. There was plenty wrong with Dolarhyde... but there's nothing wrong with you.
Except your hair.
Your hair is a train wreck.
Can we please do something about that?
For next time, maybe? Please?
That would be nice.
Thank you.
Just get some rest.
You're gonna be fine.
Dr. Voss, please call Pharmacy 4421.
We found this in his safe.
Thought you might want to take the first look.
You've earned it.
When I read his journal, it was sad.
It was just so sad.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
He wasn't born a monster.
This guy was made one through years of abuse.
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?
- S'mores?
- Yeah, s'mores.
- Yeah, you're on.
- All right.
- Go look in the pantry.
- Okay.
Crawford.
Those remains you found in the rubble.
- They're not Dolarhyde's.
- What are you talking about?
- His damn dentures were there.
- But not his bones.
Wrong DNA.
Then whose are they?
Saint Louis P.D.
Is looking for... a Chromalux employee named Ralph Mandy.
He should be on vacation, so nobody missed him for a week.
- What is taking him so long?
- Are you kidding?
It takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.
Yeah, but now I have a serious marshmallow jones.
Josh, what are you doing?
MOLLY We can't come to the phone. You know the deal.
Wait for the beep.
CRAWFORD It's Jack.
It's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.
I'm scrambling everything that rolls or flies...
but they'll take time to arrive.
Will?
Christ, Will, where are you?
Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.
Your son is about to change.
Then your wife.
You can watch.
Then I'll take care of you.
Look at you.
I've never seen a child as disgusting as you!
You pissed your pants?
How dare you!
You dirty little beast.
You want me to cut it off?
Want me to do that, you little freak?
You want me to cut it off?
Do you? Don't cry at me, you little faggot!
Apologise! Say, "I'm sorry,
Daddy! I'm a dirty little beast.
"I'm a freak." Say it!
- No.
- Say it!
- Dad!
- Say it, or I will cut it off!
"I'm a dirty little beast.
"Freak! Harelip!
"And no one will ever love me."
Josh, run! Run!
Get down!
You okay?
MOLLY Josh?
Mum?
Will?
Where are you guys?
I thought I heard some kind of...
Will?
Molly, get down!
Will!
Shoot...
What?
Shoot him. Shoot him.
Mummy?
LECTER My dear Will:
You must be healed by now.
On the outside, at least.
I hope you're not too ugly.
What a collection of scars you have!
Never forget who gave you the best of them.
And be grateful.
Our scars have the power to remind us the past was real.
We live in a primitive time, don't we, Will?
Neither savage nor wise.
Half measures are the curse of it.
A rational society would either kill me or put me to some use.
Do you dream much, Will?
I think of you often.
Your old friend,
Hannibal Lecter.
Hannibal?
There's someone here to see you.
Wants to ask a few questions.
I said you'd probably refuse.
A young woman.
Says she's from the FBI.
Though she's far too pretty, if you ask me.
I'll tell her you said no.
What is her name?
- Hi, mr. schraft here?
- no, he’s at work.
You the electrician?
Wiring in this building is fucked.
Should have burnt down years ago.
Kinda place you flip the light switch, the fucking shower comes on.
- Yeah?
- yep.
All right, that’s me, i’m done. you want a beer?
No, i gotta finish this.
Don’t take this the wrong way. you’ve done a nice job,
But... you’re not a house painter are you?
You noticed, huh?
Shit.  i’ll do anything. i’ll take whatever i can get.
Yeah, same here.
Somebody needs somethin’ done, they just give old duke a call.
Duke? that’s your name?
Yeah, well, nickname.
Last name is wayne, you know, so it sort of stuck.
I’m a big guy, you know. duke wayne.
Cowboy electrician. and you?
Sean crawley.
Ah, sean. you irish?
I think my mom had the hots for sean connery.
James fuckin’ bond, huh?
Sean fuckin’ crawley.
How about you? is that all you wanna do, huh?
Paint other people’s houses white?
- I don’t know.
- you don’t know?
Hell, you’re a young man.
You should be following your dream or something.
Don’t you have a dream?
You know, some kind of stupid fantasy?
You mean at the movies or something,
Like being a private eye?
Who said anything about a private eye?
The car chases, the shootouts, the beautiful women?
Hey, you don’t need a be a private eye to get some pussy.
- I thought we were talking about stupid fantasies.
- not that fucking stupid.
- Hey, man.
- thanks so much, dude.
I don’t know what i’d do without you.
You’d walk. when you gonna get another car, huh?
- I don’t know.
- this is l.a., man. you need a car.
Can you give me your phone number?
That way something comes up, i can give you a call.
Yeah, i’d love-- that’d be great.
I don’t-- i don’t have a pen.
Do you have a pen?
Fresh outta business cards, huh?
Yeah.
- Hello.
- duke: sean?  sean crawley?
- Yeah, who’s this?
- this is duke.  how’s it goin’?
Fine, i guess.
Yeah, listen, i think i might have something for you.
- So what’s this all about?
- the boss needs something done.
- Mr. crawley.
- how you doing?
- Ray matthews. play golf?
- no.
That’s a shame. great game, golf.
I don’t get out here enough.
Oh, no. i’ll just watch if it’s all the same.
What are you talking about? you’re on a golf course, you gotta play.
Nice shot. grab that bag, will you?
So you describe your philosophy
On life as taking care of number one, no?
Stupid not to.
There you go.  these days and times you gotta do
Exactly what you gotta do just to survive, right?
That’s right.
And if along the way you had to...
Bend the rules a little?
I think i know what you’re talking about, mr. matthews.
What i’m talking about is what’s right and what’s wrong.
Now, i’m not suggesting that we...
Want to do anything that’s illegal.
But, you know, if, uh...
You get involved in something that was...
Anti-sociable. duke, what’s the term i’m looking for?
Ah...
Immoral?
Exactly. immoral.
So, uh...
What would your feelings be on issues of...
You know, things that are immoral, crawley?
Well, i suppose it’s up to us to sort it out for ourselves, i guess.
- Nicely put.
- very nicely put.
Mm-hmm.
So what do you want me to do exactly?
Duke: we need somebody watched.
His name’s eric gatley. he’s an accountant at city hall.
And you want me to follow him?
I want you in this guys jock,
Morning, noon, and night, okay?
I want you to get to know him inside and out.
If this guy takes a fucking piss,
I wanna know what color.
- ( Alarm rings )
- ( grunts )
- ( Clangs )
- oh, shit.
Shit!  shit!
- Oh, shit.
- watch where you’re going!
- ( Alarm rings )
- oh! have a good time. come here.
Woman: thank you so much. my turn next week, okay?
Hey. thanks again.
Eric: all right, bye-bye. wear your seatbelt.
- Girl: bye, mom. bye, dad.
- bye-bye.
- Go save the world.
- bye.
Eric: bye-bye.
Excuse me.
- Hi, susan.
- hi, tony.
- Doing okay today?
- uh-huh.
- You look good.
- thanks.
I’ll see you inside.
- Eric: miss park?
- woman: yes, hello.
- Eric: hi, how are you?
- woman: fine, thank you.
- Eric gatley.
- good to meet you.
Eric: listen, thank you very much for taking the time to come out here.
Ms. park: i appreciate your call.
So, understand i can’t leave you with any of these materials just yet
And i’m speaking for background only.
Okay, i understand. let’s see.
Here we have the original, this is the ’97 estimates...
Sean: yeah, it was that chinese chick from the 11:00 news.
- Duke: you sure it was her?
- yeah, positive.  gatley had this file.
Sean: he was showing her stuff. papers and shit.
Duke: jesus. jesus fucking christ.
All right, i’ll tell matthews.
You stay on the job, okay? it’s more important now than ever.
- Hey sean, you didn’t do so bad, huh?
- thank you.
Yeah, you may not be a professional, but you did a nice job.
Hey, crawley,
Nice fucking neighborhood you live in.
You know how long i’ve been fucking sitting here waiting for you?
About that long.
Don’t fucking stare at me, get in.
You know you--
You’ve been really good for me, crawley.
Well, i get the job done.
Let me tell you a little story.
Once upon a time there was this girl-- samantha.
She was, uh--
She was my secretary.
She was 18 years old.
She looked like she was 13, you know what i mean? yeah.
I was, uh--
I was head over heels in love with this girl.
I mean stupid, you know?
Like some teenage pussy.
I’d a done anything for this girl.
But it wasn’t-- it really wasn’t all that easy.
I mean, samantha lived with her family and--
And i was-- fuck, i was married.
Anyway, i had this guy i worked with,
He had an apartment that was close by the office.
So i worked something out with him where he would give me the keys,
He’d disappear for a little while and i could
Go up there with samantha.
The first time i ever take her up there--
And i tell you what, i wanted this pussy bad--
We get in there and the guy’s got a little fucking dog.
Right away, she grabs the dog,
And i’m going,
"samantha, leave the dog. let’s go back here."
I get her in the fucking bedroom.
Things are, you know, they’re leaning towards,
Where i wanna go, you know?
Suddenly the dog starts scratchin’ at the door.
She’s looking at the door and she’s laughing, you know?
Paying more attention to the fucking dog than me.
"sam, sam, excuse me a minute."
I walk out the door and i boot this fucking dog right across the room,
Like a fucking field goal.
It shuts him right up, i get in the fucking room,
And the next thing you know, i got the blouse is coming open and it’s all good.
And i know that fucking clam is shaved.
You know what i mean? i gotta see it.
And the fucking dog starts scratching at the door again,
Yelping-- and now she’s looking at the fucking door and she’s losing--
She’s losing her concentration. she isn’t in the fucking moment anymore.
"Excuse me, sam." i walk out the fucking door
And i grab the fucking dog,
And i snap it’s fucking neck like a twig.
I take the fucking little cocksucker and i throw him down the laundry shoot.
And i go back in the room...
It turns out little ol’ sammy fucks like a bunny.
There’s a point to the story, crawl.
Sometimes you gotta be a little bit ruthless.
Something gets in your way, you eliminate it.
You know what i mean?
So the question really is...
How far are you willing to go, crawl?
To get rid of a barking dog?
Well, i mean...
The conditions would have to be right.
What would these conditions be?
Okay, um...
Well, one-- there would have to be
No possible way of my getting caught or even suspected.
That’s a given.
Right.
And then, i’d have to be sure i was physically safe.
You know, i wouldn’t want to put myself in danger from
The victim or anyone else who might be around, so i--
I’d have to be in a guaranteed superior position.
You mean stronger?
Yeah, i mean one way or another, with better weapons or surprise or whatever.
Makes sense.
Okay.  four--
Whoa, what happened to three?
- We just did three.
- what was it?
It doesn’t matter. fine, this is three then.
Which is-- it’s actually part of two.
Anyway, it’s--
I’d have to be 100% sure that i could pull it off.
- You shoot the fucking guy.
- no, no, no.  you see, i can’t--
That doesn’t-- that comes back to the point-- to number--
The point about safety. where it can’t be a weapon that could ever be traced.
- That’s-- that’s good thinking.
- yeah.
Okay... what number are we at?
Who the fuck knows? you lost me back at three!
You know what? it doesn’t matter.
Five then, point five--
A reason.
I’d need a reason why i was gonna do it.
Such as?
Such as a... reward.
Reward?
Yeah, you know...
If there was a big enough reward for doing it.
How’s five grand sound?
Sounds like nothing.
15 has a better ring to it.
How’s 13 grand sound?
That’s my lucky number.
I’m sorry.
Don’t answer the door.
Don’t answer the door, you fucker.
Don’t be stupid all your life.
Hi, mr. gatley.
Is susan home?
No, she took our daughter to ballet.
Oh, shoot, i thought she’d be here on a saturday.
Yeah, no, i’m sorry.
- I’m from the midnight mission. can i leave a message?
- oh.
Sure.
I don’t have a pen and paper.
Uh... oh,
Yeah, hang on, sorry. i’m in the garden, i’ll just...
Thank you.
Eric: okay, let’s see...
This place is such a mess.
Oh.
Yeah, you know what? that’s actually kind of somewhat valuable.
I’d rather that you didn’t handle that.  thank you.
What are you doing?
Shh. just be quiet, man.
Don’t worry.
Just lie down.
Just lie down.
Where’s your hat?
Go to sleep.
Bye, mr. gatley.
I’ll call later this week.
Fucking asshole!
I’m sorry!
Sean: come on, duke.
Come on, you fat fuck! answer the phone!
Answer the fucking phone!
Ms. park: eric gatley’s wife, susan, has no idea
Why her husband was murdered.
Police have no new leads in the case, but...
I could reveal exclusively that i spoke
To the murdered city hall accountant just days before he was killed.
Eric gatley had been investigating corruption in city hall...
Shit, guy wears a hat like that deserves to die.
...He had been looking into the activities of this man,
Local building contractor, ray matthews.
It’s your shot. sean, it’s your turn.
- ...The work of a professional hit man d
- yeah...
...Made to look like a casual robbery gone wrong.
I’m sorry, i gotta go, george.
What?
We’re in the middle of a game here-- sean!
- Hello.
- duke: sean.
Duke!  oh, for christ’s sakes!
- Look, where--
- shut up and listen!
Tomorrow morning. the zoo.  first thing.
You got some talking to do.
Me?!  i’ve got some talking to do?!
- ( Dial tone )
- duke!  duke!
What’s going on here, duke? what are we doing at the zoo?
You know anybody that ever goes to the zoo?
- No.
- no, well, me neither.
This way no one will recognize us.
Besides...
I kinda like it. it’s nice.
- So you got my money?
- what fucking money?
- Matthews owes me.
- oh, fuck.
Come on, will ya?
Sean, you know what people do when the go to the zoo?
What?
They try to figure out what animals their friends look like.
Duke.  duke!
You never played this game before?
Of course, usually, it’s monkeys, i’ll grant you that, but i think we can do better.
- Duke--
- and no fair are the obvious stuff,
Like calling me a fucking elephant or a warthog or something.
You gotta use the imagination.
As for you...
Clearly we have to go to the reptile house.
Duke!
Duke: yeah, there’s a bit of a lizard about you, you know?
A little bit slimy,
Watchful, waiting.
- A little bit of camouflage.
- quit fucking around, duke!
- What’s so fucking funny?
- you are!  you’re fucking hilarious.
You come on the big tough detective.
You think you got it all figured out,
But you’re fucking pitiful. why do you think we hired you in the first place?
I don’t know, because if anything happened i can’t be connected to you.
Yeah, and...?
And i guess, because you thought i’d be good at it.
You?  what good are you at following people?
Figuring things out?
You’re a clueless little turd who’s about a good a detective
As i am a fucking ballerina.
You don’t even have a car, for christ’s sakes!
No, you’re useless. that’s why we hired you, because you’re useless.
Why?  fuck it, duke, why?
We wanted to rattle the guy, shake him up.
He’d had his dick out for so long we wanted to know
If he was going to fuck or fuck up.
So, i think of you. you’ll follow the guy.
He’s gonna see you, maybe get all shook up,
Freak out. then he makes a move and we haven’t touched him.
And then you go and kill the guy?
- That was your plan.
- oh, no, that was never my plan.
That was ray’s brilliant idea.
Fucking ray.
Duke: the only way for you to be completely safe is to disappear.
Sean: i did a job and i want to be paid.
Why would anybody give you
13 grand to do anything?
But i did it, and i want my money,
And i’m not leaving town until i get it.
And if i have to make it difficult for you, i--
You’re nothing.  you’re a worthless piece of shit
Who got involved in something you should have left alone.
You don’t tell me to do anything!
All right, you’re gonna get no more money,
And you will disappear, you understand?
I don’t want to ever see you again.
And if i do...
I’ll can kill you.
I can kill you and i wouldn’t even break into a sweat.
I could just crush you and then it would be over.
Like you said, nothing could tie us to you.
So go away now. go.
Oh, look. i think i found you.
Yeah, there you are.
Look, sean. look, look, i found you.
I found you, right there!
You’re an insect. a fucking ant.
Look, that one there-- he looks just like you.
- Thank you.
- mm-hmm.
Hey.
You okay? you sounded pretty pissed off on the phone.
Yeah, i know.
Well, what’s up?
You know those guys i told you about?
Yeah, the ones who won’t pay you?
Yeah, well...
It’s getting pretty scary, actually.
They’re trying to frighten me off, make me leave town.
If i were you, i’d just do what they say.
They owe me, george.
Yeah, but these guys get pretty serious.
I’d just do what they want, get out of town.
You know, there’s nothing keeping you here.
No, i’m not leaving.
I need you to do something for me.
What?
I need you to keep this for me.
- I don’t think so--
- it’s just contracts and shit.
It’s just proof i did the work. just keep it till i figure out what i’m going to do.
- I don’t know, man.
- george, they don’t know you.
All right? keep it safe.
- Sean.
- shit.
Where did you go? hey!
Get back here! hey, come on now!
What are you-- don’t make me run after you!
Sorry, george.
Come on, now.
Wow!
Ow!
Shit!
- He’s clean.
- carl, let’s go.
Sean: what the fuck, duke? what do you want?
Duke: i told you, i want you to fuck off. why are you still here?
All right, look, i got something for you.
- What’s that?
- train ticket to chicago.
There is a guy who’s gonna meet you at the station, all right?
- He’ll have your money.
- chicago?!
- We want you outta here.
- how do i know the guy’ll be there?
- How can i trust you?
- you don’t have a choice.
So long.
- I’ve got his file, duke.
- huh?
Gatley’s file. all the evidence he was compiling against matthews.
I’ve got it.
Yeah, it’s evidence of a different kind now.
Some personal notes of my own in it.
In fact, i think you’re name is mentioned once or twice.
What are you saying?
Come on, duke. you’ve seen enough movies, you know the line.
Anything happens to me and that file shows up.
Where’s the file, sean?
Let’s forget about this whole chicago thing, huh? what do you say?
We both know there’s no guy in chicago.
Take me back to town.
- ( Laughing )
- stay down!
- Carl: what’s up? uh?
- give me the fucking phone.
Kid’s got a file on gatley.
I want you to tell matthews--
Tell him to send someone around to his apartment, all right?
Search the place.
Where is the file, sean?
What if i don’t tell you?
What are you gonna do, kill me? i don’t think so.
- ( Clangs )
- oh!
So...
You’re just gonna beat me up, huh?
Where is the file?
My lips are sealed.
So, if you’re gonna beat me up later, you might as well beat me up now.
- Yeah, you’d like that, huh?
- come on, do it.
Do it now, it’s all the same to me.
You don’t care if i beat you up, huh?
I’ll still be alive,
So it doesn’t scare me.
Shit, you could spend the rest of the year just beating the shit out of me,
And at the end of it, i’ll still be alive,
And you still wouldn’t know where the file is.
So you see, unless you’re gonna kill me...
I can deal with it.
How about i cut your balls off?
Well, i’m sure a person can get used to it.
You would know.
- What did he say?
- he wants us to go to his place out in the desert.
- The fucking ranch?
- hey, that’s what he said.
- Oh, fuck that.
- if that’s what the man says...
Carl, put on some music.
It’s gonna be a long fucking day.
- ♪ What’s up? ♪ his

Duke: all right.
What are you gonna do to me, duke?
No balls, huh?
I’m gonna catch you later though, sean.
Mr. crawley. sleep well?
How’d you like our little hotel?
I need to piss.
We’ll get to that in a few minutes. sit down.
You know, it’s a beautiful day out.
On a day like today,
I should be playing golf.
Great game, golf. you know?
Helps you think.
Is that right?
Yeah, that’s right.
Tie him up.
Duke here is very proficient with knots. aren’t you, duke?
Used to be in the boy scouts, mr. matthews.
Ow.
Where’s the file, sean?
Come on, you know i’m not going to tell you.
You know what i’d like, sean? i’d like for you to vanish.
Vanish off the face of the earth, that’s what i’d like.
But you hired me. i did exactly what you told me to do.
What are you talking about, i was drunk.
You shouldn’t listen to me.
- This is crazy.
- yeah, tell me about it.
See, i got a problem here. i’m in a lot of shit.  cops are getting real close to me.
Well, i’m the last person who’s gonna go to the cops. can’t you see that?
Sooner or later the cops are going to come to you.
Okay? but without you around,
They can’t prove a thing.
Don’t you think killing me is gonna make things a little more complicated?
I mean, for one thing if i die that file comes to--
Whoa, whoa.  killing ya? who said anything about killing you, boys?
No one’s gonna kill you, sean.
See you, my friend, are the only killer in this room. my hands are clean.
And i would like to keep it that way.
Give the man a drink.
- ( Gagging )
- his nose, you moron.
- Sean: no.
- duke: come here.
- ( Gagging )
- more, more, more, more.
- ( Wretching )
- duke: oh, jesus.
- Filthy animal!
- ( wretching continues )
Carl, get some water and clean him up, will you?
You gotta be careful with whiskey, crawley.
Deadens the pain, but fucks the brain.
See, what i really need you to do is disappear.
You know, poof, gone, nobody, nothin’.
Then i had an idea.
You really don’t need to kill a guy to make him disappear, right?
Let me tell you a little story.
There was a guy who used to work for me, dino scarbor.
- Remember dino, duke?
- yeah, poor bastard.
Now, listen. great guy, good looking, sharp dresser.
Could kill the ladies, i mean, just a joy to have around.
Yeah, could talk the panties off a nun, couldn’t he?
So i got dino on this construction site, we’re working together.
A crane with a big, big block of cement comes over
And whacks dino right in the side of the head.
Didn’t kill him, trust me he wished it had.
- We don’t call him dino no more.
- we call him dumbo.
- ( Laughs )
- guy’s a vegetable, can’t understand a word he’s saying.
Believe me, i don’t think he can understand most of it.
He just sits there staring at the wall.
It’s pitiful. drooling all over himself.
You know it’s really, really, scary
What a single blow to the head can do.
Really scary.
You know, it feels like about a three wood.
I think i got the wrong club.
Come on, matthews. you’re not serious, are you?
You know...
Maybe you hid the file someplace, maybe you didn’t.
The way i figure it, i can make you forget where you put it.
I can make you forget everything.
- The stupidest thing i ever heard.
- come on, crawley.
Who’s gonna pay any attention to a shuffling
Juiced up head case like yourself, huh?
You can’t just make somebody a vegetable, you can’t.
Oh, no?
- Tell that to dumbo.
- ( all laugh )
Hey, carl. don’t want to leave any marks,
So cut off a piece of that mattress, wrap it around his head.
Matthews...
Ray: sean crawley on the outside.
Dumbo dino on the inside.
It’s gonna be fun.
No.
Let’s go.
Alrighty, i’m figuring right about there.
You ready, crawl? ho-ho!
Okay.
Step back, boys.
You ready?
Measure it right there.
- Ray: whoa!  par five. .
- ( sean weeping )
Long, ho!
Four! yeah, he’s coming around.
What do you think?
Man, he’s pissed all over himself.
You okay? hey.
He don’t look so good. you look really fucked up.
Ray: have a drink.
- ( Drilling )
- ( laughing )
It’s amazing you qualified.
It’s amazing. it’s so exciting.
All right, get in.
- Get in there!

I followed matthews.
Worked it out from the file. followed him to the ranch.
I’ve never been so happy to see you, man.
I’m confused, you know?
It’s like dogs i understand, but people...
They’re just ants, george. doesn’t matter.
Back there...
I realized what my part is.
I finally know now what i was always meant to be.
What?
I’m an exterminator.
What the fuck?! fuck you, okay? it’s not a fucking joke.
All right? you killed a guy.
- Two guys.
- why?!
Help me understand why? i mean, gatley?
Why?
I don’t know, it just happened.
It was his hat. you said it yourself, man.
He just looked so fucking dumb in that hat.
You killed him
’cause of a hat? a fuckin’ hat?
I killed him because i wanted to.
Fuck! jesus christ, man!
I risked my life for you!
And you’re talking about fucking ants!
What the fuck, man! you sound crazy or insane.

Sit down a minute.
My god! what happened to you?
- The cops.

Don’t let them take me, okay?
- We gotta get you to a hospital.  gary!
- no!  don’t!
Not the hospital. that’s how the cops--
Please don’t take me to the hospital.
- They’ll get me.
- you need help.  gary!
I knew you’d come.
I knew you’d come.
Woman on the floor!
Let’s get him over here, okay?
All right. let me take that.
Go down slow. slow.
- Easy.

Ow!  ow!
Okay, i’ll get him some clothes while you can check him.
What’s your name?
James bond.
James bond, huh?
Todd, james todd.
Well, james, why don’t you give me this?
No!
Okay, you can keep it. just put it down, all right?
I need to examine you. put it down.
Tell me where it hurts.
- No, no!
- all right.
- Sean: no! ou.
- here, i got it.
Stop it!  stop it! stop it!
James, it’s okay, i’m here!
Look at me. i’m here!
It’s okay. it’s okay.
- I’m sorry.
- go back to sleep.
- I’m sorry.
- it’s okay.
Bad dreams, huh?
Yeah, i know.
I know what that’s like.
Tell me about it.
What?
What happened to you, susan?
My husband, eric--
He was recently murdered.
What happened?
He was an accountant
At city hall, and...
He was investigating a construction company.
I guess the company didn’t like what he discovered and....
They put a hit out on him.
You’re doing really well. you’re a survivor.
I hardly recognize you from the guy we brought in three of four weeks ago.
Couldn’t have done it without you.
Well, it’s been really good for me too,
Being given the chance to...
- ( Sean grunts )
- james, you all right?
No, i’m fine. i just--
Just the mother of all headaches. it’s okay.
It’s all right. it’ll go away.
Like pain always does.
So, james...
You can’t stay in the shelter for much longer.
It’s really only meant for temporary accommodation.
We need the bed.
So, do you have somewhere to go
Or will you just go back on the streets?
No, no, i have somewhere to go.
Come on, you can’t stay here.
...It’s just that you don’t know anything about him.
I mean, who is he?
- Hey.
- hey.
- It’ll be all right.
- be careful.
- Man: hey, baby, where you going?
- see you tomorrow.
This is it.
Oh.
We, uh-- we eat in here.
Okay, i’ll show you the bedrooms.
And this will be your room, while you’re here.
- ( Car horn honks ) aby,
- that’s caitlin.  i’ll let you get yourself sorted.
- Okay.  thank you.
- okay.
Susan: you’re the best, mo.
- Hey, baby. thank you.
- ( car engine starts )
Caitlin, this is james, who i told you about.
- Hello, james.
- hey.
Well, thanks for letting me stay at your house.
That’s okay.
People shouldn’t be alone.
You know, they go crazy.
And then they start to do stupid things.
They forget how the rest of the world lives.
It’s not healthy.
I don’t know what i’m saying. it’s just...
Being in this room,
Where it all--
There’s just lots of things to remind me.
You got a new fridge.
What?
I mean, that can’t be the one.
No, i had to get rid of that.
I had to get rid of a lot of stuff.
- ( Phone ringing ) t rid
- excuse me.
Hello?  hi, gary.
Yeah, everything’s fine.
Tomorrow, um...
I guess so.
Yeah, just gonna need the address.
Hang on, let me find some paper.
Go ahead.
All right, good night.
You’re very efficient.
I didn’t even know there was paper in there.
To the both of us.
I feel like i’ve died and gone to heaven.
Mommy, i woke up.
Oh, sweetie.
You want a story, huh?
Careful.  okay.
Is this any good to you?
It’s eric’s.
It was eric’s.
No, no. you can’t beat me!
- You can’t!
- go catie!  whoo, yeah!
Look ma, no ha-- i--
- Oh.

Yep, i’m indestructible.
I won!  i won, mommy! i won!  yes!
Both: yeah!
You sure you have everything?
- Don’t worry, mommy.
- you’re gonna call me, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hi, everyone. right on time.
Hey, girls.
Hey.
All right, have a great weekend.
You’ll still be here when i get back, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- ( laughs )
Thanks a million, maureen.
Behave yourself.
- Susan: okay, girls.
- maureen: buckle up.
- Susan: bye.
- sean: have fun, guys.
Sean: but you can’t feel guilty.
- ( Weeping )
- i mean, there’s no point in feeling guilty.
It happened.
I mean, it just happened.
Somewhere out there there are people who are guilty.
But they’ll be punished.
You and me...
We just gotta move on with things.
I know.
Talking to you-- talking it all out.
We’re okay-- you and me, huh?
You remember the other night,
When i said i’d died and gone to heaven?
Yeah.
I wasn’t joking.
I did die back there,
And i’ve been reborn.
I mean, i am--
The person i was is dead, and i am a new person now.
I can start over. i can just...
Leave that all behind me.
We don’t really know each other, do we, james?
We know enough.
This is gonna sound really stupid, but...
We share something.
I don’t-- i’m not really sure what,
But when i first met you,
I felt like i already knew you.
Something...
Why am i doing this?
It beats me.
Your scars...
They’re so sexy.
- ( Screams )
- susan: it’s okay.
Oh, man! look at this, huh?!
The sun is shining! and the king is back in town!
That’s right! up and at ’em, world!
Look out, ’cause i’m gonna do it, susan!
Yeah, i’m gonna rejoin the human race.
- Here i go!
- go carefully.
Good start.
Yeah.
One more time.
And he’s off!
What the fuck?! don’t fucking do that, man!
What’s the matter, ants in your pants?
Jesus christ, sean. what the fuck are you doing? what the fuck!
- What if they fucking followed you, man?
- would you frickin’ relax?
Calm down.  everything’s fine, everything’s cool. no one knows i’m here.
- Everything’s cool?
- yeah.
I can’t go home, i can’t go to work.
I can’t do fucking shit.
I’m afraid they might get me.
I’m gonna make everything all right. all right?
I’m scared, okay?
They’re not gonna get you.
I’m scared of you, you fucker.
Me?
I’m just an ordinary guy.
Now, i’m back on my feet.
I just need to tie up a few loose ends.
Some things i gotta know.
I don’t want anything to jeopardize what i got.
Anything?  what?
Anyone.  you followed them, you found things out. there’s shit i gotta know.
Your file? what about the file?
Yeah, but there’s some stuff that’s not in the file. addresses.
Shit.
Oh, shit! my file!
Oh, my fucking file! you stupid fuck!
- Man #1: hey!
- man #2: whoa!
Susan?
Susan?
Are you home?
Who are you?
Susan...
Who are you?
Susan, i thought i could make it better.
It wasn’t my fault. i thought i could make it--
How could you do it?
- It wasn’t me.
- then who was it!
You destroyed everything!
And then you come back here!
- Just let me talk for--
- talk?!
What could you possibly say?! what lies?!
There’s nothing you could say! there’s nothing you could say!
- Susan--
- i feel sick.
My skin where you touched me-- my lips!
No! no, no!
It’s locked.
That door’s locked too.
All the doors and windows are locked.
I called the police.
It’s over.
Susan.  susan, i’m sorry about--
Sorry?
Ow!
Susan, please let me go.

Hurt me?!
For god’s sake, stop it! just listen.

Shut up and listen.
I want it over. we gotta finish this.
I’ve got the file. you want it, you come and get it.

Come on-- what do you mean, you don’t know?
Okay.  all right, i guess i could be there in a couple hours.
- That give you enough time?
- no problem.  we’ll see you there.
Fuckers.
Hello, duke.
I’m fixing things, duke.
First thing i gotta do is remove all evidence of myself.
Like i never existed. that’s what you wanted, right?
So, i guess we should start with disguising that wound on your neck, okay?
Okay.
I want the cops sorting through this mess till the end of time, duke.
I don’t want them ever to find me.
You know what, duke? i’m not a professional,
But i do a nice job.
Look at her.
We could have been happy together, me and her...
If it wasn’t for you guys.
You like barbecues, right, duke?
Just quit your griping, and do as you’re told.
- But this is bullshit, man.
- no!  shut the fuck up
And get in the house. it’s easy.
Motherfucker.
This is getting too weird. wayne.  motherfuck!
All right. all right, listen,
That little fucker’s around here somewhere. i want him now.
Let’s finish it.
All right, carl, you check upstairs, all right?
Becket, you check out by the shed.
I’ll check all around outside.  hey, hey!

All right, come on. let’s go!
Bullshit.
Fucking hog fill.

Cleaning up.
I was willing to make a deal!
- Bullshit.

I’ll fucking kill you!
It’s all over, ray.
Wait. wait, wait, wait.
You shouldn’t have fucked with me.

Wait, wait!

Oh, shit. oh, shit.
You didn’t need to do this.

That’s carl’s line.
Look, it’s finished.
It’s over.
I had nothing to do with this. help me, please.
My back.
Something happened to my back, please help me.
Just help me!
Oh, god.
Oh god, i feel so cold!
Please help me. if i stay here i’ll die.
I’ll die!
Why?
There needs to be a reason?
I’ll tell you what this is all about.
You ever watch ants?
- Ants?
- ants.
Saw some at the zoo once.
Thousands of them, just...
Eating, shitting, fucking, dying.
Just like they always have for millions of years.
What are you talking about?
What are you trying to say?
What i’m trying to say...
Is that it doesn’t matter what any of us do.
It’s a shitty world.
Or it’s the best of all possible worlds,
Just depends on how you look at it.
But there’s nothing anybody can do about it.
The ants will keep on doing what they do
And we just keep on doing what we do.
In a few minutes you’ll be dead.
And there’s nothing any of us can do about that.
I never did anything wrong.
It doesn’t work like that, becket.
Please, i never beat you.
I looked after you, please.
Nothing matters anymore, becket,
’Cause you’re dead.
You-- you’re going to kill us then?
That’s what i do.
Oh, shit.
Becket: re crawley, come back!
Help me! help me!
Crawley! oh, god!
Crawley!
Help me!
Crawley?
- Becket: crawley? awley!
- carl: oh, shit.
Becket: no!  no!
Becket: no!
Oh, no!

Thankyouforthe horse.
You liked him?
Oh, it's beautiful... but l thought we were going sailing today.
You promised.
Well,that one's too old.
See, now? That'll do.
Come on!
Come on, Mr. E.
-lt's broken.
-Who says?
Mokelock.
Now, Edward,we agreed.
No more Mokelock.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelockwants me where l am.
We canfix it.
Edward.
Sing a song of sixpence.

Baked in a pie.
Rise and shine.
Mr. E is doingfine.
Did we go sailing?
Almost.
Mokelock showed up.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelockwants me where l am.
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.
Where'd he get Mokelock again?
Mother Goose.
-Henry.
-Barry.
What's the matter, Barry?
Edward's parents are here.
He needs a haircut.
He loves itwhen you visit.
My husband wonders if that's true.
He wants to place Edward in the hospital. l'm sorry, Catherine.
Mr. Baines... l've been working on this projectfor seven years. l know, Henry. l know.
Please don'ttake offense,
Dr. Kent.
Yourwork's invaluable to this company.
Butyou're not sure about me.
We've waited eighteen months for signs of progress.
There has been progress.
There's no proof, Catherine.
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines... l'm notthe one who designed the procedure. l mean, l wish l could take creditfor it, but l can't. l was chosen to do a job.
They picked me.
But if you think there's someone better... or someone who's more devoted to your son,then--
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.
What is it,then?
There's no proof, Catherine.
There's no proof the procedure works.
All you're giving me is the belief... thatyour interaction with my son... is not a... hallucination.
Shit! l better get backto work.
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.
-Thankyou.
-Thankyou, Mr. Baines.
Come, shall we? Lucien.
Lucky she worships you.
Why? Because he hates me? l wouldn't say ''hates.''
Distrusts, dislikes immensely... can't bearthe sight of.
What's the verdict?
Well,we've got another six months... and Barry had to pushforthat. l wantto reverse thefeed,
Miriam... now more than ever.
We've been through this a hundred times, Catherine. lt's too risky.
Why not?
What do we have to lose?
When l did social work, itwas always better... when we tookthe kids out of their environment.
Foster homes can be scary atfirst... but eventually they see thatthings can be different.
Edward is like that right now.
He--he's living in a world that is not healthy.
Let's show him a different place.
All right.
Let's say we do ityourway.
We reverse thefeed, and we bring Edward into your mind.
Can you imagine his shock when hefinds... that he's been thrust into this whole otherworld?
-l do it all the time.
-You're a willing participant.
You're aware of what's happening.
Edward's in a coma.
And besides,we don't know what effect itwill have on you. l mean, you're already exhausted.
-Have you been sleeping?
-Yes.
-Any more nightmares?
-No.
-No.
-Good.
Leave work here.
Don'ttake it home in this.
Hey,you.
What are you lookingfor, hmm?
Want some milk?
That'sfun. Let me try it.
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.
Edward, is thatyou?
Edward,were there seagulls being killed on the beach... while you were sailing?
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is thatyou?
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurtyou.
Edward, is thatyou?
Go to sleep.
Help!
Somebody, help me, please!
Somebody!
Help me!
Can you hear me?
Help!
Thanksforwaiting, Cole.
Teddy Lee, no problem.
Special Agent Ramsey.
-Cole.
-Morning.
Whofound her?
The surveyorforthe railroad, about 6:00 this morning.
Skidmarks appearto match the tire tracksfrom Reno.
And it looks like he scraped the rail and lost some paint. lt's on its way to the lab already.
Dumped the body overthere.
Bleach.
Anne Marie Vicksey.
She makes seven.
Jeez,this stinks.
Do they all look like dolls?
Every unfortunate soul.
What's that?
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.
The way he puts itthere?
He makes itforthem. lt makes himfeel they belong to him. ls the water always this low?
Yeah,this time of year.
Give me a coroner's report right away.
Preliminaryforensics,too. l don'twant anyone dragging their ass on this.
So, how was work?
Oh, exhausting. l have no idea,Jean.
For God's sake.
Good luckwith the monster. l love you,too. l gotta go.
-OK. Thanks. Bye.
-All right. Bye-bye.
Hot off the presses.
There's nothing new to report, gentlemen.
A match on his semen.
Water in her lungs... show high levels of chlorine and rust.
What, pray tell, is this?
They say theyfound some dog hair?
From a canine unit?
No. There was no canine unit.
And Anne Vicksey doesn't own a dog,Teddy. l wantto see this.
Whatyou got,Teddy?
Hypomelanosis.
And that means?
A complete absence of melanin.
The dog is an albino.
He'd love an animal like that.
Gentlemen... l believe an albino dog is a rare animal indeed.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You poor boy.
You're gonna be OK.
Baby, l'm so sorry.
Jesus Christ, Peter.
Thoughtyou were gonna get some sleep, clean yourself up. l did.
-They're waiting,you know.
-l'm ready.
Let's go.
We're gonna do this two ways.
Breeders of German shepherds.
Ford dealers. l wantyou to be thorough, and l also wantyou to befast.
This guy's accelerating.
He only waited six days this time.
When hefirst started, months could pass.
And that means one of two differentthings.
One, he thinks we're stupid, and we can't catch him.
Two,which is the one that l believe... he wants to be caught.
The dog hairthing is sloppy.
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey in three inches of water.
He knew thatwe'dfind her.
Now,there's one thing l knowfor certain. lf we can't stop him... he ain't gonna stop himself.
Will this be all right?
Yes, ma'am,that's great.
Thankyou very much.
She was still living at home, ma'am?
We were looking through apartments.
Butthey're not moving in together... until afterthe wedding.
Julia wants to be married.
Did she ever mention anything out of the ordinary?
For instance, somebody she was seeing mad... or somebody perhaps watching her orfollowing her?
Pardon me.
Ramsey.
What if you made a mistake?
Maybe this isn'tthe man.
Maybe Julia's safe.
There's certain things that he does... that make us pretty positive thatthis is the man.
Lastyear, l lost my husband to cancer. l wentthrough such terrible pain.
ButJulia, she was always therefor me.
What's going on, Gordon?

We got a high-ground team on the roof... afour-man elementto the east.
We got an entry team in the van acrossfrom the house... a two man elementto the south.
Have you seen him yet?
No. There's been some movement in the kitchen.
Can'ttell what it is.
-You thinkthe girl's in there?
-We'll assume she is.
-FBl!
-Go!
Freeze, motherfucker! l gotthe dog!
-Clear.
-Clear.
They'll take him to County General.
Reid's already there.
Make sure he stays cuffed. l wanttwo men on him at all times. l don'twant anyone to treat him but Reid.
Not so much as a thermometer up his ass, understand?
She's not here.
You should come downstairs.
Mommy!
Please take care of my little baby!
Please, are you there?
Hello?
Please hear me.
Can you hear me? l need something. l need you...
Anybody here?
This is not happening to me.
This is definitely not happening.
Please help!
Have you ever heard of Whelan's infraction? lt's aform of schizophrenia. lt's very rare, and it's very severe. ln any schizophrenic... these areas would be affected... but in someone with Whelan's... they're hit hard, and they're hitfast.
Can'tyou load him up with thorazine or doxepin?
Normal psychotropics don'twork.
This thing is caused by a virus... that infects the neurological system in utero. lt lays dormant... until it's triggered by some kind of trauma.
Most likely, he's exhibited symptomsfor some time... butthe infraction, orthe breach... didn't occur until today.
The triggers can vary.
Uh, usually water-related, butthe results don'tvary.
He's notjust catatonic.
He's disappeared-- like having a dream and neverwaking up.
For how long?
Oh,forever.
Lee, l thinkwe might be missing the bigger picture here.
Now,whatever state that he happens to be in... there is a girl that is missing... and her name is Julia Hickson... and he is the only one that knows where she is.
He keeps them in this thing... for aboutforty hours.
Now, he tookJulia Hickson at 7:30 last night.
Peter,you know me. lf there were anything, anything...
What?
He provides them withfood... drinking water, and a toilet.
Now, she thinks she's been kidnapped... thatthere's a chance of survival... but it's just aform of torture.
This is a kind of ritual for him-- a cleansing before he takes them home... and turns them into a doll, a toy.
Now,this thing isfully automated... and unless wefind her by tonight... this will happen to her.
Atthe request of Mr. Cooperman... we've contacted your board of directors... and they've given their approval.
And so have Edward's parents.
Butthe decision is yours. lt's upto Catherine.
She's the one who would have toface... whatever risks there might be... so, l support whatever decision she makes.
Can l askyou something?
Please. lf he wasn't like this... if he was conscious... do you thinkthat he would tell you where she is?
There's always a chance of a confession. Yeah.
And there's things he's done that show a needfor disclosure.
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.
He wants someone to listen, to try and understand him.
Look, lfeelforthis girl, l do... but Stargher may no longer know the truth.
For severe schizophrenics... there's no discerning betweenfantasy and reality. ls it possible? lf he came to trust me,yes... but ittakes months to earn that kind of trust. ls it possible?
Daddy?
Come here... and save me! Save me! l'm daddy's girl.
His levels are tooflat.
What happened here?
We removedfourteen steel rings.
Should have left him the way he was.
He used to suspend himself, didn't he?
They're comforted by thefeeling of weightlessness... likefloating in water.
Now,this, gentlemen, is the catalyst.
The neurological connectic transfer system... not only maps the mind... it sends the signal to another party.
All you need to do is tune in... butyou do much more than tune in.
You become part of the show.
He's ready.
Why are there three stations?
For a while,we tried jointtherapy sessions-- two shrinks forthe price of one-- but Edward hated it and only talked to Catherine.
She has a gift.
Are you sure? l'm sure.
OK.
Response signal... functioning.
We implanted a touch-sensitive microchip in her hand... so if she wants to stopthe session... or if it gets too intense, she can give the signal... and we abort.
When we were ready for practical testing...
Miriam and l auditioned... some of the best child therapists in the country.
And all they did was observe and report, nothing more.
Catherine was the least experienced... but she came so highly recommended... thatwe decided,whatthe hell, we'll give her a shot... and immediately, we could tell she was different.
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.
You're an animal!
Hey,you.
Yeah,you like that, don'tyou? ls your name Carl?
You know, l know another little boy with a horse.
His name's Edward. l mean the boy, notthe horse.
What's wrong?
His victims.
Where you comefrom?
Gentlemen, she's back. l'll be rightthere.
All right. Come on, Catherine.
She's had quite a journey.
Unlike anything we've ever seen before.
-So she's made contact?
-Oh,yes.
She's gone very deep into his world.
Attimes toofar. lt's cold.
That can be dangerous.
What are you talking about?
Well, if she came to believe that Stargher's world is real... then theoretically, her mind could convince her body... that anything thatwas done to itthere... is actually done. lt's like the old wives' tale where you die in your dream... you die in real life.
Henry, could you raise the temperature in here, please?
-Dr. Kent?
-Just a moment, please.
Dr. Kent, can l come in there and speakwith you?
We have to be patient. l mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.
Let herwake up.
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?
Ourfather, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name.
Am l interrupting anything? ls it OK if l...
He knows you're here, doesn't he?
Myfriend Dr. Reid said... that it's very unusual-- schizophrenia,that is-- in a child that's this young.
They usually think it's autism.
Whatyou have to understand... is there's nothing wrong with his body.
What's paralyzed is a part of his mind. lt's so damaged by the virus... he can't even will himself to move.
You thinkyou can change that?
Do you believe there's a part of yourself... thatyou don't show anybody? l think everybody has that side of themselves.
During a session, when l'm inside... l getto see those things. lfeel them.
With Stargher, lfeltthings l neverwanttofeel again.
He's not even
Carl Stargher anymore.
He's this idealized version of himself-- a king in a very,very twisted kingdom.
The placefor him to indulge every...
You know, l don'twantto talk aboutthis in here. l could never do whatyou do-- devote myself to understanding a mind like that. l don'tthinkwe'll ever be able to understand a mind like that.
Butyou try. That's yourjob. l guess so.
You don't like whatyou do? l like it better than my old job.
Used to be an attorney. l was a prosecutor.
What happened? l had a case, um... where this little girl was molested.
And because of this one tiny piece of evidence... thatwas tainted, he walked.
Uh, Charles Gish walked away.
Nothing l could do about it.
The night after he was released...
Margaret's parents came home-- thatwas the little girl's name--
Margaret Sims.
And theyfound Charles Gish sitting in their living room.
He was watching television... and Margaret was sitting nextto him... and he had cut her open right down the middle.
The parentsfound
Margaret's heart in thefreezer.
Charlesfigured they'd probably wantto keep it.
Afterthat, l leftthe D.A... and joined the FBl.
Figured l'd justtry to catch 'em.
Till now.
You know, l started to tell you... that Stargher really isn't Stargher anymore.
Well,that's true, and it's not.
The dominant side is still this horrible thing... butthere's a positive side that--
Positive side?
Well,the way he sees himself as a child.
But isn'tthat him?
The boy Stargher made contact.
He's curious about me. lf l could reach the boy... then maybe he'd tell me aboutJulia.
Whatever happened to Charles Gish?
Old Charlie beatthe murder rap... because he was insane when he killed Margaret.
His attorney milked the jury for all they were worth.
Said that a life of sexual abuse drove him to do these things... and,you know, whateverthefuck.
All that same old bullshit.
Why is that bullshit? l believe a child can experience... a hundred times worse the abuse than what Gish wentthrough... and still grow upto be... somebody thatwould never, ever, ever hurt another living being.
And you're sure of that?
Yes, l am. l'm sure of that.
Hey,where the hell you been? l've been right here.
Well, nexttime tell me, OK? l didn'twantto disturbyou.
You looked so cute,you know?
You're all sleeping when you get that look on you.
Your colleagues wantto know whatto do with Stargher.
Tell them to prep him. l'll be rightthere.
Thankyou, Catherine.
Stargher have any pets?
You know, cats, dogs...
Yeah,you're a good boy, aren'tyou,Valentine?
That's supposed to help?
On a subconscious level,yes.
Anything thatwas special to
Stargher, gave him pleasure... should make him more accessible... more peaceful.
Peaceful?
Nice little pup.
-Mr. Novak.
-Doctor.
Thankyou.
Round two.
Hey, notfunny.
Come on, stop playing around. l'm not. lt's a power problem.
We're locked out, Catherine. l--l need you to check the circuit breaker. l wantyou to check circuits six through twelve.
Come on.
Get up.
Six through twelve. l'm already in.
What did she say?
Come here, boy.
Can you take me to Carl?
Need some help? l've got a presentforyou. lf you need me... or if youfeel like l'm around butyou can'tfind me... just...
Shine it like this.
Go ahead,take it.
You like it?
-Carl?
-What's the matter?
What?
What's wrong?
What happened over here?
Just broke all by itself.
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.
Well, hey, let's...
Let's break 'em all, how aboutthat?
You littlefucking liar! l should've drowned you like the runt of the litter.
You don't lie in my house.
This is my house!
-He's just a boy.
-Shut up!
You're not his mother!
She's notyour mother.
She left us, Carl.
Rememberthat.
See that?
Wait. Jesus Christ!
Whatthefuck is this?
Get back--Get over here!
Playing with dolls?
You littlefaggot!
God!
What are you, some kind of a woman?
-Get up!
-But, dad--
Damn it.
You want something to cry about? l'll give you something to cry about,woman!
Mama's boy! l didn't raise nofaggot!
Stopyour crying.
You wantto iron like a woman?
-Let me show you how to iron.
-No!
Help me.
See?
She was myfirst. l made such a mess.
Now what l have to do...
Why are you here?
Don't lie.
-l came to helpyou.
-You're lying.
Bitch.
Whore.
Cunt!
You sound like yourfather.
He was nothing.
He is nothing.
Who told you to say that?
Do you rememberthefirsttime he talked to you?
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming. ltwas my baptism.
Myfather, he... he pushed me under. l think l had some kind of seizure. l think l was drowning... and everybody just looked at me.
Nobody helped me. Nobody.
Except him.
Myfather... he took me home that night... and he broke three of my ribs... andfractured my jaw. l was six years old.
Whatyourfather did to you is evil.
What he did to you was wrong.
He treated you like a thing.
He was more... powerful than me.
No. No one should be treated like that. ls that right? ln whatworld do you live in?
Carl,where is Julia Hickson?
No names.
Where is she? l know you, Carl.
You wantto tell me.
Oh,you know me?
Oh,you know who l am?
Where is she?
Where's Julia?
That can't be right.
Danger pulse.
-No change.
-Christ.
What about emergency cessation?
Gradually terminate thefeed, disable the receptors-- lt could lead to massive shock... and, Henry, could you please shutthatthing off?
What's going on?
That hypothetical situation l told you about?
-lt's happening.
-Can'tyou stop it? lt's notthat simple.
Well,you stopped it before--
Yes,thatwas different.
Thatwas Edward.
With Stargher, his mind is unfamiliarterritory... and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.
Well, is there anything thatwe can do?
Whateverwe do runs the risk of making things worsefor her.
Worse. That's great.
So she's lost somewhere?
-No. No.
-No,what? l need you here.
Fucking stop! Stop!
Let me thefuck out!
Let me out!
Get me out,you sickfuck!
Fuckyou!
Let me out.
Do something.
Do something to end this. l got bugs crawling all over my body. lt gets worse.
You're completely unprepared forthis.
Ah, Dr. Kent, we've been over all this.
Yes, but l've been through the process.
She wentthrough the process, too, and it didn't matter.
You don't know him.
Be lucky.
Come on, guys.
Ready?
Peter,thefirstfew minutes... will be very disorienting.
Rememberto stay calm andfocused. lnstincts play a very important part here, so trustthem.
All right.
Peter,you've read herfile.
Hit herwith something personal.
And remember, Peter... it's not real.
Have you seen him? My boy?
My little one?
Hisfathertook himfrom me. l spit it out my hole.
Big deal. don't mean anything.
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul. ls thatyou?
You all right?
Hold me.
This isn't real.
Did daddy do a bad thing?
Don't be scared.
This isn't real.
Naughty worm. l'll kill you!
Fuckyou, motherfucker!
Catherine, wake thefuck up, now!
Mairzy doats and dozy doats
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey,too

When you were in college...
Your baby brother had a car accident!
He was in a comafor six months before he died!
And l'm sorryfor saying that!
Butyou gotta wake up!
God! lt's not real.
This is not real!
This is not real!
Not real! lt's OK.
Whatthefuck happened?
Where are we?
Oh, my God. ls this where he keeps them?
No, it's OK.
Don't be scared. l will never hurtyou. l'm yourfriend.
And Peter--he's afriend,too.
Do you know where this place is?
Like on a map? l am so proud of you.
Even if Peter doesn'tfind Julia... l promise l will come back and helpyou.
-What are you doing?
-Let's go. lt's over. l know how tofind Julia. l just can't leave him here!
God damn it, Catherine, let's go!
-Carl!
-l know how tofind her.
-Let's go!
-l'll come backforyou, Carl! l promise that l'll come back!
Catherine,we gotta go now!
-That means he's back.
-How's Catherine?
Take it easy, Peter. ls she OK?
Take it easy, Peter.
Just breathe.
-ls she OK?
-Yeah, l think she is.
Can you get me out of thisfucking suit?
Yeah, Cole here.
-Cole, it's Novak.
-Yeah,what's up? l wantyou to go down to the basement... at Stargher's workplace and call me when you get down there.
They haven'tfinished building the grid yet.
Fuckthe grid!
Call me when you get down there.
-You OK, Pete?
-l'mfine.
You wantto tell me what happened in there?
You in pain?
-What happened, Peter?
-l saw her.
-Who did you see?
-l know where tofind her.
-Who?
-Julia. l saw her.
OK. Why don'tyou come and let Dr. Kent have a look atyou?
-Cole?
-Yeah,this is Cole.
Now,what am l doing down here?
That machine that he uses-- there's a hoist. l wantyou to look for a plaque... or a metal plate with some sort of logo on it.
Yeah, l got it. lt's Carver industrial equipment... in Bakersfield, California. l wantyou tofind out every goddamn thing... thatyou can aboutthat machine-- who used it,who sold it, who bought it.
Justfind out everything you can. l'll call youfrom the chopper in abouttwenty minutes.
All right, let me have a look.
Good.
The FBl has leftthe building.
What? l haven't had a chance to clear Novak!
What did you expect me to do?
There's no way l could stopthem.
Go.
-l'm OK.
-Are you sure?
Let me have a look.
-All right.
-OK.
Peter,justtalk.
What if your mind is playing tricks on you?
They shotyou full of drugs, Peter.
Who knows if whatyou saw is real?
Catherine, open this door.
-l promise...
-What are you doing? l'm gonna helpyou.
Stop.
Do notjeopardize your career.
Stop! lt's dangerous.
What are you doing?
-Miriam.
-What's she doing?
-You know what she's doing.
-For Christ's sake.
Jesus!
-She changed the codes.
-You can't get in withoutthem?
-She reversed thefeeds.
-What does that mean?
The process is intended for herto go into his mind.
But instead, she's bringing him into hers.
Stop! No more! l promised l'd come back and helpyou.
See? l always keep my promises.
Can l stay here... with you?
Oh...no, honey, l'm sorry. lt doesn'tworkthatway.
There's nothing l can do aboutthat.
Yes,there is.
When l was a little boy... lfound this bird.
He was injured and... had a broken leg or something.
Well, myfather found outthat l had it.
And l knew that he would do something horrible to it. ltwas just a matter of time.
So l took itto the sink, and l--l held it under. ltwas betterforthe bird. l saved him. l can't do that, Carl. l won't. lt doesn't matter. ltfound me. lt alwaysfinds me.
Agent Novak? Go ahead.
-Cole?
-Novak, listen to this.
The hoistwas sold to a guy named Bainbridge... who tried to build a machine works out near Delano.
Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court... and the state winds up with the land.
And guess who they hire to seal the place up.
Aw,you'refuckin' kiddin' me.
No. l'm notthe kidding type.
Carl Rudolph Stargher.
-Where's the land?
-Exit 10, off highway 99.
-We're on ourway now.
-Got it. l know where that is.
Help! Help me!
This is the area.
My world... my rules.
Help!
Do it. lt's not real.
Me got boy.
Boy me got.
I'm sure we're not far off.
I'm glad you're sure of it, George.
Oh, shit!
Hold on! Hold on!
Oh, sweetie.
Everyone all right?
You okay?
Okay?
Everyone okay?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Sit back, sit back.
Fuck, I think we're stuck.
Oh, shit.
How're you doing?
Hey-- you mind just putting that down?
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
Where's the buck?
Will you guys cool it in front of my kid, for fuck's sake?
- Kim, Kim.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
We've been after that buck for 18 hours.
- I don't fucking care!
- Kim, Kim, Kim.
We just had an accident, and you fire your gun
- 15 feet in front of my fucking car!
- Kim, cool out.
- Yeah, Kim, cool out.
- Hey, listen, look!
We're a little shook up.
Kim, just cool out for a minute.
- Can you tell me--
- Goddamn it!
Kim, cool out, sit in the car.
Check on Miles.
Can you tell me who I can call in town to get a tow?
Nobody open this time of night.
That's just not true.
Can you tell me the next big town?
Is there anywhere closer than Danbury?
Hey, one of these antlers is cracked, Otis.
That guy's a real treat.
Did they tell you who to call?
No.
Let me see the map.
Fuck!
This is a bummer, right?
Yeah.
Were you scared when we hit that deer?
- Yeah.
- You okay though?
- Yeah.
- Some people out here hunt the deer and they catch the weaker ones who wouldn't survive the winter, that's the idea.
But it's sad.
- Poor deer.
- Yeah.
Shit.
I'm about 20 miles south of Danbury.
Um, I just passed a bridge,
Shadow Ridge? Shadow Creek?
Something--
Shadow Creek.
Your daddy's gonna-- daddy's gonna get us a tow out of here.
Right, Dad?
I said it was a mile after that bridge
- on Shadow Ridge, right?
- Yeah, sounds right.
They said half an hour.
Okay. Then I'm going to make us all dinner.
Right?
Yeah?
The antler on that deer is busted because of you.
I'm sorry for that.
I wish it hadn't happened that way.
That all you got to say?
I think we should just leave it at that.
Is that right?
Excuse me, can I...
Excuse me, excus e me.
Can you step away from the car, please?
Can I ask you your name?
- Otis.
- Otis?
My name is George, and I'd like you to please stay away from the car, if you don't mind.
My family's very upset.
We want to wait here for our ride.
Now, I'm sorry about the deer.
But it was an accident, there's nothing we can do about it.
I don't know how
I can be any clearer.
Rack of antlers like that worth a lot of money.
Hey, Otis,
I'm gonna go get the truck.
- Otis.
- I'm going to get the truck.
Otis, what do you say?
I say it's my deer and this guy busted an antler!
Otis, that ain't right.
We got to talk about this.
Billy made the first hit, so I don't know if it's yours.
The fuck with that.
I had the fatal shot.
Billy wounded him.
This guy took him out.
And you did the mercy killing.
Mercy killing.
Excuse me.
Guy's a piece of work.
Good shot, man.
That guy's got a problem.
Goddamn.
Are you dead or alive?
Alive.
Are you famous?
Yes.
Are you... in showbiz?
Yes.
- It's like a farewell butt, right?
- Yeah.
- Madonna?
- No.
Courtney Love?
No, you have to keep asking me questions.
Spice Girls?
Don't just assume
I'm a woman.
I think this is our ride.
What's he up to now?
Could have saved you some trouble. We got this.
- You the one that called?
- I called. What are you doing?
I'm getting you out of that ditch.
You could've asked.
No, no, no.
Looks like you got yourself a friend for life.
Are you going up to the Stooky place?
I guess you were right, Otis.
You all from the city?
You want to give it a go, Billy?
Wait. Just wait.
Wait a minute. Wait.
- Stand back.
- Relax.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay, okay. Thank you.
There it is.
Ha ha ha.
Whoo!
It's $40 just for coming up here.
- I won't charge you for the tow.
- Thank you.
I'll only charge you $20.
I'm not paying you anything.
Look who's got a bug up his ass.
Listen, I didn't ask for your help.
I'd already called for the tow.
You knew that.
I knew what?
I'm not doing this.
I'm not! This is ridiculous.
I don't think I understand what your problem is, George.
- I really don't.
- Here.
- Somebody's got some manners.
- George, let's go.
Thank you, Kim.
I make a point of pissing in your drinking water once a week.
New York City reservoir just a mile from here.
- That's nice.
- Don't say anything, just drive.
I drink bottled water anyway.
What a prick.
Whoo!
It should be to the left.
There's a bridge.
Bridge?
Only Richard would have a bridge.
Here we go, Miles, over the moat.
The moat to the castle.
Richard and Annie's mansion.
Yeah. It's a tan house, isn't it?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Well, of course, it's Richard and Annie's house.
Whoo-oo...
Richard and Annie's house.
George, shush.
See, babe, not even a dent.
Built to last.
Lap of luxury, George.
Hey, Miles, look at that.
- Huh?
- Hmm.
Looks pretty old, Dad.
Come on.
Let's go, Miles.
Whew, it's cold.
It shouldn't be so cold.
- There's a draft. You feel it?
- Yeah.
I'll turn the heat on.
Okay.
Want to unpack your bag?
Dad?
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah, I just found--
What?
The window was broken.
Go find some cardboard and some tape.
Ask your mother.
Oh... okay.
Dad?
Yeah?
Were you scared before?
Maybe I was more shook up than I thought by that thing on the road.
That's better, right?
Hey, Miles, why don't you go get the cards?
- Dad!
- Get them, we'll have a quick round.
All right.
So...
Pick a card, any card.
Ha! Da-dum-dum-dum.
Da-dum-dum-dum.
All right.
''Together.''
Hmm. T-o... g-e-t-h...
- I don't know.
- Come on, try.
Hmm, e-r?
Good, yeah, good.
Remember, it's basically ''To get her.''
See what I mean?
Let's see what's next.
It's ''Separate.''
This is a tough one.
I can't even spell this one Every time.
In fact, if you get this, you'll be top of your class.
You'll rule.
You will rule.
Come on, try.
S-e...
- p...
- Uh-huh?
- H mm?
- Where are you going, buddy?
- a-r...?
- Yeah? a-t-e.
Good for you.
Nice one. Well done.
All right-- Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Toughy, toughy.
''Onomatopoeia.''
- I don't think so.
- All right, all right, all right.
''L'chaim.''
- Dad!
- All right, all right, all right.
''Appetite, appetite.''
- ''Appetite.''
- Come on, Dad. We did two.
Come on, try ''Appetite.''
What's wrong with that?
- You can do that.
- Dad!
All right, all right.
Go on.
You're no fun.
Nice going, kiddo.
What if you're sitting in your living room and a bullet flies through the window?
Who do you call?
I'm just so glad we don't have Star anymore.
She looked just like a deer.
She wouldn't have lasted
10 seconds out here.
- I miss Star.
- There's no TV.
You've got those cool books there, Miles.
There are videos, aren't there?
Nothing good.
Nothing you've heard of.
Let's build a fire.
Cool!
Richard said there'd be some wood in the shed out back.
Miles,
- let's go get us some wood.
- Yeah!
Come on, bud.
Okay, help me find some kindling.
Do you know how to use an ax?
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, first you've got to get it balanced.
Get it right there in the hole.
Holy moly!
Careful, Miles!
I-yi-yi.
They let me use this road to pass through.
Dad?
- Is that him?
- Shh, shh.
He didn't get to keep the deer.
Go to your mom.
So he just drove across?
Just drove right by.
I don't understand why Richard would let anyone drive across the property.
Maybe Richard, or maybe Annie, wanted to seem neighborly so they let him.
I don't know.
I think Annie and Richard never come up here.
That's why they're so generous with their keys.
It was Annie's thing anyway.
I knew Richard's interest would fade.
He needs to be in the center of it all.
Who wants to retire to the country when you're young?
It's called an inner life,
George.
Just 'cause you don't approve of my inner life doesn't mean
I don't have one.
Ooh.
Besides, didn't he have some weird incident up here, and he just stopped coming up for a while?
I don't remember that.
Maybe he just told me about it.
What was it?
Some incident.
I guess I don't remember.
Probably had to do with that guy driving across the property.
Annie would've told me about something like that.
How you doing, Miles?
You liking the pasta?
Mmm, it's okay.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Come on, what is it?
That man knows where we live.
Miles, don't worry, sweetie.
I know I got angry with him outside the car, but he was very excited because he was chasing that deer.
It's really okay to hunt if you're getting in tune with nature.
Don't feed him that sack of shit, Kim.
- That guy was demented.
- George.
Your father exaggerates, you know that.
It's nothing to worry about, Miles.
Your mom can be very fair and even-headed, which is cool, right?
Except you don't want to be a softy, either.
You got to be wary of people like that guy.
They can be bad news.
No, queen!
King! King, king!
- Okay, okay.
- Jack.
Oh, five!
Five, six, seven, six-- no, no, eight!
Wait, wait, wait.
- Nine, five, five, three...
- Jack, Jack.
- Victory!
- No, no. You!
- Dad cheated!
- I did not.
- We have to let your father win.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
Okay, Miles, come on.
- To bed.
- To bed, to bed, to bed.
One more game, please?
- No, come on. Up you go.
- To bed, to bed.
What'd you draw?
Oh, nothing.
Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
No one there.
No one there?
Okay...
And no one there.
You're safe.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
Do you think that deer had a little family?
Oh, Miles... don't think about that, sweetie.
That's just sad stuff that happens sometimes.
But you know, in nature things like that happen, and all the animals, they adjust.
There's a balance.
Think about that, okay?
- Dad--!
- Dad!
It's not funny.
Good night, kid.
Night, Dad.
- Leave it open.
- I will, I will.
- Leave the hall light on.
- Shh-- go to sleep.
Can you tell me a little more about ''sack of shit''?
What?
Talking to Miles like that at dinner?
Oh.
- It was a bit harsh, I guess.
- What's the matter, George?
I don't know,
I can't put my finger on it.
Is it the reshoot?
Are you pissed off you're here?
No, no, babe.
That's not it at all.
Huh-uh.
This is nice.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Yeah...?
Hmm?
- Those fucking guys.
- Out on the road?
- Yeah.
- What about them?
I just felt the abyss between us-- me and that guy with his shotgun.
That wasn't a shotgun, but anyway...
And he had a pistol.
Did that threaten your manhood?
Yeah, I guess it did,
Dr. McLaren.
Well, it's very archetypical for the civilized man to feel threatened by the man of the country.
That one guy, he just seemed like-- how do you get through to someone like that?
- George.
- Aaah.
- George?
- What?
We have ways of restoring confidence in men with...
With emasculation problems?
Really?
Perhaps you should show me?
Exactly.
- Perhaps you could show me, doctor?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- This could take a while.
- Ooh, I hope so.
We'd like to start... with a full checkup.
Hey, you.
Ho, ho, ho.
Wow, is this to impress your clients?
No, my clients aren't privy to this information.
Oh, really? 'cause I think this one would cure them all.
Shhh.
- Is Miles in bed?
- He's fine.
Miles?
Are you there?
Mom?
I'm s cared.
Shh.
It's okay, honey.
Dad and I are right here.
Try to go back to sleep.
Anyway, Stefan's going to stick to the prenup, and he's not going to budge.
He's got a right to be pissed.
She slept with his best friend, who happens to be his accountant too.
She's not going to ask for money, she just wants out.
She's going to take him for all he's worth.
You're sweet to be naive on this one, but no.
All right, maybe you're right.
It's pretty tacky.
If there's any justice, she'll be hit by a bus.
Doesn't work that way,
George.
Here we go.
Outstanding.
Who wants to go into town with me after breakfast?
- I do.
- Me, too.
I need curry if I'm going to make that cass erole.
We must have curry.
Is very very important.
- Must have the curry.
- Dad.
I like the curry.
I cook the meanest curry this side of Delhi.
Gotcha!
One, two!
Think that guy really pees in the reservoir?
Shush, George.
You're going to get Miles all excited talking about pee pee.
We're going to go in this store, you want to come?
No, I'm going to go get the milk and curry.
What'd you say, olive oil?
Something for Miles to drink, too.
What should I get him?
Something he'd like,
George.
Okay, okay.
Cool it, baby.
Fruit juice or something.
All right.
I'll pull the car around.
- I'll meet you right here.
- Okay.
You like that?
It's okay, you can talk to me.
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know what it is?
Wendigo.
- Wendigo?
- Wendigo.
- What's a Wendigo?
- A Wendigo is a mighty, powerful spirit.
What's it look like?
It can take on many forms.
Part wind, part tree, part man, part beast.
Shapeshifting between them.
Shapeshifting?
Shapeshifting.
Can it fly?
It can fly at you like a sudden storm, without warning, from nowhere... and de vour you-- consume you with its ferocious appetite.
Appetite?
The Wendigo is hungry-- always hungry.
And its hunger is never satisfied.
The more it eats, the bigger it gets.
And the bigger it gets, the hungrier it gets.
And we are hopeless in the face of it.
We are devoured.
Is the Wendigo bad?
Nothing between the earth and sky is bad.
But there are spirits that should be feared.
'Cause why?
Because there are spirits that are angry.
Angry?
Do you believe me?
I guess.
Go ahead and take it.
Nobody believes in spirits anymore.
Doesn't mean they're not there.
He who hears the cry of the Wendigo is never the same again.
Miles?
Miles, let's go.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa.
You've got to be careful in here.
What have you got?
The man gave it to me.
What man?
Behind the counter back there.
Excuse me.
My son said the man up there gave him this little figure.
- Is that okay?
- What's he got?
That's... $5.
$5? Come on, Miles, who said you could have that?
The Indian guy behind the counter back there.
Is that possible someone gave it to him?
Nobody works here but me.
Nobody's been in here but me.
Oh, okay.
Come on, Miles.
Let's give it back.
He's kind of cool.
Will you take $3?
Four.
Okay.
You just blew our budget, Miles.
There was a guy, mom.
- He gave it to me.
- What kind of a guy?
Hey, Dad.
- What?
- Later.
Come on.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
Didn't you see the man?
I didn't see him.
Doesn't mean he wasn't there, but you shouldn't make stuff up that isn't true.
He was there.
I believe you, sweetie.
If it's true.
Mom.
Wendigo.
It can grow as tall as the trees and still it aches with hunger.
The Wendigo is hungry-- always hungry.
And it's hunger is never satisfied.
The more it eats, the bigger it gets.
And the bigger it gets, the hungrier it gets.
And we are hopeless in the face of it.
We are devoured.
It can fly at you like a sudden storm, without warning, from nowhere... and devour you-- consume you with its ferocious appetite.
There are spirits that should be feared... because there are spirits that are angry.
- Jesus.
- What?
I can't take this guy.
Seriously, he's like Boo Radley the way he's always around.
George, Boo Radley was a good guy.
Right, Miles?
Did you realize how close we are to those guys?
Those are some nice neighbors to have.
George, shush.
Look, Dad.
Look what I got from the man at the thrift store.
- It's magic.
- That's cool.
Why don't you go show that guy to your transformers?
They're not transformers.
What? What?
You got to show more interest.
Last week it was transformers.
What can I say?
You don't see it, George, but he lies and makes stuff up to get attention.
It's because you got to be there for him.
If we're going to do these weekends, you got to be engaged.
You put these ideas in his head that
I'm not interested. It's not fair.
Come on, I don't discuss this with Miles.
You've got all this anger you carry around from work or I don't know where, and he feels it.
- He thinks it's directed at him.
- Oh--
He doesn't know what it is,
I don't know.
- Everyone's got anger.
- Oh, George.
I don't want to be analyzed right now.
Miles sees this stuff.
He sees.
I got to make this phone call to Charles in the city.
I told him I'd call.
I'll take Miles out afterwards.
We'll go sledding.
Okay.
I'll cook.
I got the curry.
Thank you, dear.
Come on, baby.
Hey, hey, hey.
We never even looked around the whole house together.
No, go ahead.
Go on, make your call.
No, no, no.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.
I guess they're still fixing it up.
I'd love to have the time to acquire all this stuff.
Yup.
Annie has a good eye.
Mmm.
Aaah!
She really has this whole stag thing going here.
I mean, look at this.
Aah.
Poor deer.
I took this funny picture of the sheriff in town today.
Yeah?
He shot me this look.
It must piss the locals off, all these outsiders coming up here.
It's really great you brought your camera.
Get some pictures for yourself.
- Yeah. Hey, look at this.
- What?
- You know that reservoir?
- Yeah.
This whole town's buried under there.
- Hmm.
- 10,000 acres.
They flooded the valley in 1907 to make drinking water for New York City.
- Wow.
- That's a lot of displaced people.
We'd already displaced the Indians.
Now Annie and Richard live here.
Displacing Everybody.
A lot of Indian stuff in the area.
Yeah, it's the Catskills, George.
''Yeah, it's the Catskills, George.''
''It's the Catskills.''
Miles: No!
Miles?
Miles?
Miles?
Miles?
Are you okay, sweetie?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I just got sad.
- Are you cold out here?
- I'm okay.
What made you sad?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it is?
You can tell mommy.
Maybe he's just moody like his dad, right, tiger?
Sometimes it helps to talk about things when you're sad.
You've got to watch for those moods.
They'll get the best of you.
You'll end up taking soulful pictures of corporate logos.
Oh, you shush.
Don't listen to him.
Your father complains about his work, but a lot of people would kill for his job.
Don't listen to her.
Feeling sorry for yourself is very unattractive.
Miles, remember, boys against girls.
Hey.
Hey, tiger.
I think your dad wants to take you sledding.
- Right, Dad?
- Yeah! What do you say?
Um, okay.
All right, I'm going to make this call and we'll go out.
So you get ready.
I'll be right back.
- Yeah, man?
- Yeah.
Yeah, man.
You okay, sweetie?
- Don't worry, mom.
- '' Don't worry, mom''?
You're growing up so fast.
Now come here.
Hey, Chas, it's George.
So what's the verdict?
Are they serious about this reshoot?
Really? Fuck!
I'm up here, so...
It's nice.
Yeah, it's pretty cold.
Well, we had this-- this weird thing happen.
Yeah, we hit this deer.
It came right at the windshield, so that was bad enough, but then there was this one guy, man.
I'm telling you, Chas, this guy was bad news.
It scared me, yeah.
I was afraid for Kim and the kid.
So what do they say the problem is?
It's too dark?
In terms of light or tone-- like content, know what I mean?
Do they know what they mean?
Maybe it's just a question of contrast.
No, I mean visual contrast.
I could bring out the highlights.
Anyway, I'm not fighting for anything anymore.
Just tell them to tell us what they want,
I'll deal with it on Tuesday.
I'm taking Monday off like I planned.
They don't own me.
Okay, they don't own me till Tuesday, okay?
All right, Chas.
Thanks, man.
Okay, I'll see you.
Hey, hey.
I'm going to take Miles out.
We're going sledding.
You better believe it.
Hey, Miles, help!
Aaah!
Dad.
I know.
Ha ha ha.
Aaah!
No, aah!
Come on, kiddo.
Are you ready?
So, what happened?
They want to do it, fuck them.
What are you going to do?
You need to go back?
No, baby, I want to do this for us.
Charles can take care of it.
We could go back early Monday.
It's beautiful, it's perfect.
Come on, kiddo, let's go.
Ha ha ha!
We're off, we're off, we're off!
Here you go, buddy.
Take my hand.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Sledding, sledding, sledding.
You guys be careful.
- Oh, Mom.
- Oh, Mom.
Andy? Hi.
It's Dr. McLaren.
Is Everything all right?
I thought we weren't going to call on the weekends?
Okay, okay.
What happened?
Okay.
How do you feel about that?
Right.
You were intimidated, but...
What did you tell him?
Sorry, Andy, but that's good.
It's right, because you don't have the money.
So-- wait a minute, Andy,
I think they have call waiting here.
Hello?
Hey, Richard, thanks for getting back to us.
Listen--
Oh, yeah?
You getting a tan down there?
Listen, we called because--
Shit.
I'm sorry, can you wait a minute?
I have someone on the other line.
Hold on.
Andy? Hi.
I have to take this.
But listen-- you did well.
You asserted yourself.
Try to experience that on your own.
After you've thought about it, we'll talk on Wednesday.
Okay? It's important to keep some boundaries between us.
You're trying to get to be more independent, right?
Andy?
Okay, bye bye.
Richard.
Richard, are you there?
Hello?
Hel--
Shit.
''Whose woods these are
I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow...
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.''
- Miles!
- That's right.
The poet's name was Robert Frost.
He was writing about the cold.
- What do you think about that?
- Oh, Dad.
Now Frost could take a simple image and make it seem deep.
That's his rap.
Hey, what's the matter?
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- What's a Wendigo?
- A Wendigo?
I don't know. I never heard of that.
What's a Wendigo?
I don't know.
Where'd you hear about it?
- This man.
- What man?
- In the thrift store.
- In town?
He told me the Wendigo is this man who's part animal, always hungry, and he eats people.
The Wendigo only goes after bad guys, Miles.
You're safe.
You're a good kid.
- Hey, Miles?
- Yeah?
A lot of people make up stories to make sense of the world.
It's a big world after all, and nobody really understands how it all works.
Maybe for that guy it's comforting to think that the Wendigo is responsible for all the bad stuff out there.
That's okay.
That's what myths are.
They help us talk about stuff.
Like Mr. Freeze and Dr. Evil.
Dr. Evil.
There are good myths guys too, like Superman and Yoda.
- Hmm.
- It's important to know that they're just myths, just stories.
You'll end up being very disappointed when things don't come true that you're wishing.
Like when you didn't get your big show in Soho?
Soho?
You little monster.
You are a dead man.
Oh, Dad.
You--
I've had enough of you.
You little-- you're a dead man.
- No!
- You're a dead man.
Truce! Truce.
Truce!
Truce?
Truce?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Dad.
Come here, buddy.
Hey.
Come on, let's sit.
It's good you feel bad about that deer we hit, you know?
But things like that happen.
And you have to go through a period of mourning.
Like where you're sad, and then you put it behind you.$(where czy when)
You get it?
Where even the worst thing can be seen in another way.
'Cause you got to be flexible to make it in this old world.
Hmmm.
You sure you're not just stalling
'cause that hill looks steep?
No way!
Okay, buddy, let's get that ride so we can go home and bother your mother.
Yeah!
Come on, buddy!
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Miles?
Miles?
Can you hear me?
Miles?
Miles?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
Can you get up, sweetie?
Here.
Careful, careful.
Honey, you hit your head.
You're okay.
You're okay?
Huh?
Where's your father?
Where? Huh?
Where?
I don't understand,
Miles.
What happened?
- Daddy fell off the sled.
- How did he fall off the sled?
I don't know.
Hold my hand tight.
- Oh my God.
- He was here, mom.
He was here.
He wouldn't move.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Miles... did you hear anything when dad fell off the sled?
- I don't remember.
- It's okay, sweetie.
Come on, hold my hand tight.
Come on-- wait, wait.
We've got a whole deer to cut up!
Where are you going?
- Hey!
- Oh.
Can I help you with something?
I'm-- I'm trying to find my husband.
Husband?!
- There's been an accident.
- What kind of accident?
- Have you seen my husband?
- What's he look like?
What was the name of the guy who left?
He pulled out in his truck just before I got here?
Otis?
Brandon, put those on the bench.
It was you that was out in the road last night, right?
You're staying at the Stooky place this weekend?
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I saw a light on,
I-I needed to check.
- Come on, Miles.
- Just a minute.
Did you have some kind of accident?
- You want a tow or something?
- What happened?
No, I-I'm--
I'm sorry,
I-I was wrong. I--
I-I'm sorry.
I have to run.
Come on, sweetie, come on.
Hold on.
- Jesus Christ.
- Just let her go.
- Dad, where do you want these?
- Put them in the freezer.
- Spooky, man.
- Yeah.
- What was that about?
- They're just excitable city people.
Hey, man, what'd you do with the beer?
We drank all the last stuff I bought.
- What do you want to do with these?
- Put them in the freezer.
Unless you want to eat them tonight.
Okay, Miles, sweetie, you're gonna have to walk.
Daddy's probably gone home.
George!
George!
Oh, my God!
Miles, he did go home!
Come on. George!
George!
- George!
- Dad!
George.
Oh, my God.
Kim-- Kim.
What--
Oh, my God!
Miles, get a blanket.
Daddy's going to be all right.
We just want to keep him warm.
And a scotch--
Aargh!
- What happened?
- This is bad.
Who would believe it--
I'd swear I've been shot.
Those fucking guys!
- They shot me!
- Can we get you inside?
No, baby, no, no, no.
We've got to get to Danbury.
There's a hospital there.
We-- just get in the car.
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, baby, no, no, no.
I got to know we're on our way.
George, are you sure?
I don't know.
Let's do it!
Let's do it, Kimmy!
Oh God, oh!
Kim!
Miles!
Miles, help me!
Okay, push me, push my back.
- Let me do it, let me do it!
- Can you get up?
- Let me do it!
- Okay. Okay.
Oh God, George...
Oh God.
Hand me the blanket, sweetie.
Okay... Let's go, let's go.
Hey, you okay?
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, Dad.
Yeah, you see me fall off that sled?
- Yeah.
- How about that, huh?
I ran into a tree looking for you.
Aww, good for you.
Atta boy.
Shh, shh, stop talking.
Get the door.
It can fly at you like a sudden storm, without warning, from nowhere... and devour you-- consume you with his ferocious appetite.
The Wendigo is hungry, always hungry.
Its hunger is never satisfied.
Do you want this?
I don't believe it.
Miles, seatbelt.
I fell back off the sled.
I didn't know what had happened for the longest time.
I couldn't even feel the pain.
I didn't know if it was hot or cold.
But then I saw the blood,
I must have fainted.
When I woke up, it was like I'd been drowning and this was my last breath of air.
Like if I didn't take this breath, I'd--
I'd slip away for good... into some euphoria.
I was tempted, but I made myself get up.
I found the house, it was easy.
It was like I was carried by a big wind and dropped at the door.
This is it,
I can feel it.
I'm only half here, Kim.
Daddy's gonna be all right, Miles.
Daddy's gonna be all right.
This is an emergency.
My husband... has been shot.
I need to know where the hospital is in Danbury.
Fuck.
I'm heading west on Route 19.
Okay.
I need you to call the sheriff and have him meet us there.
And-- are you serious?
What's the number?
What's the fucking number?!
- What's the fucking number?
Don't be scared, kiddo.
Don't be scared.
It's going to be okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen to me-- remember that little thing you got from the store?
What was it-- yeah, there it is!
Yeah, it's got magic powers, right?
Huh? Isn't that what you told me?
Right? Huh?
I was listening,
Miles.
Miles, I was listening to you.
Don't be scared, kiddo.
Don't be scared.
It's going to be okay, huh?
Oh, Kim, oh baby.
What a fucking waste.
What a fucking waste.
Give me your hand, Miles.
Give me your hand, buddy.
Yeah...
Watch the door.
Okay, somebody get his feet!
One, two, three.
It's his abdomen.
Right in here.
Yeah.
Just a second.
I want you to tell Charles I'm definitely not doing that reshoot.
- Shut up, George.
- What are you going to do... when you got no one to shush?
I love you. Hang in there.
I got separation issues, you know?
Yeah, I know.
S-s-- s-e-p-- a-r-a-t-i-o-n.
- Dad?
- Hey, Miles.
Miles, listen to me,
I want you to take care of your mom.
- All right?
- Dad, what happened?
I don't know, kiddo.
Kimmy, Kim.
Ohhh, Kimmy!
Oh, such a beautiful day.
God, I remember so much about today.
Those eggs and-- a drive, and-- we went sledding,
Miles and me.
You're my family, my family, my family.
Oh, Kim, Kim.
Kim, you remember-- do you remember?
Do you remember his first week home?
Do you remember he kept us up for two nights screaming?
Yeah, I thought we'd never make it through.
Listen, I'm always going to be with you.
Come on, sweetie, it's going to be okay.
Take my hand-- my hand.
Second down and 9 at the 35...
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Um, excuse me.
Mrs. McLaren?
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Tom Hale.
Hey, there, buckaroo.
I'm the sheriff.
Do you mind telling me what happened?
My husband-- my husband was shot.
I think he was, by this man who we saw at-- at Braintree Road.
His name was Otis.
- Otis?
- Do you know who he is?
Mmm, yeah, well--
I'd seen him before.
He was-- he seemed capable of--
Now, Mrs. McLaren, we don't know for certain that your husband was shot.
Mrs. McLaren?
Your husband was shot once in the side with a high-powered rifle.
The bullet grazed his liver and the doctors are recommending emergency surgery-- immediately.
There'll be some papers for you to sign, so if you'll wait right here...
Well, do you know him or not?!
Yeah, Otis Stooky.
- What?
- Pardon?
That's the place we're staying,
- the Stooky house.
- Really?
That's where Otis grew up.
- What?
- Yeah, his mother died, and then she left it to Otis' sister.
Sister sold the place and moved down to Florida.
Christ.
You mind telling me exactly what happened, Mrs. McLaren?
Last night we-- we hit a deer with our car.
It was a fluke.
These men came out of the woods and one of them was named Otis.
Oh, I can't believe this!
Wrong place, wrong time.
Mrs. McLaren?
With your permission, the y'll get started right away.
Oh, God!
I cannot fucking believe this.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Miles, help me.
Jack, this is Tom Hale.
I want you to meet me up at Battle Creek Road.
Otis Stooky's place.
I need backup.
Do you copy? Over.
Hey! Otis, you in there?
Tom Hale.
Hey!
It's the sheriff.
You in there, Otis?
What do you want,
Sheriff?
I want you to step outside for just a moment, Otis.
What is it, Tom Hale?
Those people staying up at the Stooky place, they filed a complaint.
I just want to ask you some questions.
You come down to the station with me?
What kind of complaint?
Ah, come on, Otis.
Do me a favor.
They're from the city.
I've just got to go through all the formalities.
What'd they say happened?
Oh, I don't know.
Just something about them hitting a deer and you was there, and I got to--
I just got to get a statement from you, that's all.
- Aw, shit, Tom!
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
These people come up from the city, they act like they own the damn place.
Look, I get it every day.
That fucking Ben Stratton, you know.
Raising our taxes, kissing these people's ass.
Yeah, that's right.
You come with me now, huh?
I got Jack stopping by in a moment.
I'd like you to come down with me now, just to-- you know-- just to keep it simple, huh?
Well... okay, Tom.
Right, so we can say we did it, okay?
Okay. Sure.
Damn.
I was just going to watch the ballgame.
Yeah, I know, sorry to put you out and all.
That game was just getting started when I stopped by the hospital earlier--
What you doing at the hospital, Tom?
Routine stuff.
You know...
I don't think I'm gonna go down to the station there, Tom.
- What's that?
- I think you know what I'm saying.
Otis, I know it's been you shooting up the walls at the Stooky place.
- Why do you say that?
- People see you there.
I spend time at Everett's, you know that.
He's got that shooting range.
Listen, Otis, I know you got dealt a bad hand with that house and all, but a lot of people got problems.
City guy lets me take the shortcut through the property.
Yeah.
You know, Otis,
I was gonna let you off shooting up that place and all, but...
I want you to come down to the station with me now.
That really what it is, Tom?
What do you mean?
You come all the way out here over that?
Yeah, they're mad as hell.
Look, I got Jack stopping by.
You coming with me or not?
Okay. I'm coming.
I don't want to slap the cuffs on you, just to take you down and give you a $30 fine.
- Coat.
- Right.
Don't lie, Tom.
Give me my liver.
What--?
Give me my liver.
Hey...
You'll be okay.
You fainted, sweetie.
You'll be okay, Miles.
Wha-- what are you?!
The devil?
Fuck you!
I'm sorry, Mrs. McLaren, there was nothing we could do.
So you get ready.
I'll be right back.
- Yeah, man?
- Yeah.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sledding, sledding, sledding.
Where even the worst thing can be seen in another way.
Nobody believes in spirits anymore.
Doesn't mean the y're not there.
I'm getting you out of that ditch.
- You could have asked.
- No, no, no.
If I fall down
I'll try to get back up
I'll catch you rain
In this paper cup
And you can call my name
And I will come
I won't be far away
No matter what,
And you can hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out...
And if you lose your way
I will steer you straight
And if you lie awake
I'll sing you to sleep
And you can call my name
And I will come
I won't be far away
No matter what
And you can hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out...
If I fall down
I'll try to get back up
I'll catch you rain
In this paper cup
And you can call my name
And I will come
I won't be far away
No matter what
And you can hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold out.
Stare at this for a while, you ugly bastard.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking the specimen.
No. I haven't prepped the chamber.
I don't want him frozen.
I want him soft.
We've already discussed this.
I had to go over your head.
I'm moving him to our Scranton Facility.
You can't risk taking him through open country.
This isn't open for discussion.
His unique ability to regenerate
Iost and damaged tissue.
It just cries out for more research.
You'll risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes.
Yes.
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine.
-Sergeant?
-Everything's under control, ma'am.
-Dr. Wimmer, please.
-He's no longer your problem.
Can we get that rag off him?
What the hell?
Oh, my God!
Get out of here.
What happened?
I'm sorry.
Cryogenic breach.
Emergency lock-down.
Oh, God, no!
No.
Kay-Em?
No viruses, no bacteria.
No toxins. It's clean.
-It's still cold.
-Wow.
What is that?
It's like a big kind kind of frozen storage thing?
Probably a cryostasis unit.
I'd guess early Port series.
Quadroport 11.
Manufactured in 2010.
Precise historic records are inconsistent.
Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?
Open it up.
-What the hell is that?
-Humanoid.
Organic composition is unclear.
What's on his face?
Some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit?
It's a hockey mask.
Very good, Tsunaron.
-What's a hockey mask?
-Facial armor
Used in a sport outlawed in 2024.
Amazing.
Absolute museum-quality.
Are you paying attention,
Azrael?
Yeah.
Well, don't touch anything.
Guys.
We got another body here.
Kay-Em?
She's pertectly preserved.
Cell Crystallization is at 25 percent.
25 percent?
Suggest nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction.
Wait... Wait a minute, are you...
...are you saying that...
-...we can bring her back to life?
-Yes.
But she is deteriorating.
Opening the door has compromised her hibernation.
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.
Copy that, ready in five.
Not five, now.
What the...?
Look out!
55 cc's of etherene. You'll be fine.
Fine? I'm missing my arm!
Oh, you're so pretty.
-Are the doors secure?
-Locked and blocked.
Beautiful.
Lift off in three, two...
Yeah!
I love this part.
-What'd you find?
-You won't believe it.
Get the sarge on the horn.
Division four just entered the occupied zone.
-Casualties?
-Minimal.
How'd we get this screwed-up gig?
I didn't join the corps to be a babysitter.
-Brodski,
-Sarge, we found a viable.
Say again?
We found two bodies in deep cryostasis.
Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female.
Female?
Yeah.
Crutch, do you copy?
Crutch, do you read me?
Wake the hell up.
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.
Power up the lab.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
-What does she look like?
-She's cute.
Yeah.
And single.
I'm so lonely.
We need to get her to the lab.
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'll find out, sergeant.
-You won't bring him back, will you?
-No, it's impossible.
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.
Hi, hand.
-Any idea how long she's been down?
-4.55 centuries.
Must've been one hell of a wake-up call.
-I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?
Kinsa.
-You guys always find the cool shit.
-Where's Waylander?
He's in lab one, charging the bed now.
Find Stoney and Adrienne and get to lab two.
Once we're in the clear, I'd like to check your circuits.
-I'll bet you would.
-It isn't like that.
I need you in lab two.
-You found something?
-Two viables.
-In what condition?
-Pertect. We're attempting reanimation.
-What can I do?
-You, Stoney and Kinsa...
-They'll slow me down.
- Just walk them through it, okay?
Run a structural scan and log them in.
-I'll check back later.
-Fine.
-Okay, where are we?
-Board's all green. The N-2's ready.
Begin stabilizing
-cell fractures.
-Yes, professor.
I need a scan. Glycerol levels, cerebral profusion...
-...the works.
-I live to serve.
-Let's see what we have here.
Decrystalization of the membranes is at 32 percent.
-Somebody get her clothes off.
-I got it!
I got it.
Honestly.
Where's her diffusion barriers?
Seventeen and stable.
Here we go.
Stay still or you'll get an elbow where elbow where your wrist should be.
Specimen 4420 found in sector 39-30 L on Earth prime.
Subject discovered in cryosuspension.
-How's it going?
-Good. What's up?
-Where do you want this?
-On the specimen table.
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.
Initiating scan.
Smart and sexy.
Professor.
Take a look at this guy's scan.
Amazing.
How'd he function with that small brain?
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.
He's a big boy.
I bet he's hung like a mammoth.
Get out of here and come back when you're focused.
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.
-Thanks, Adrienne.
-Thanks.
Don't mention it.
See what you can salvage from the optic cortex.
-Then move on.
-My pleasure, professor.
Ready phase two.
Bring on the ants.
That's it.
Come to mama.
Temperature, 96.2.
Cool. It's working.
98.6 and holding.
Cell reconstruction is complete.
Internal defib in three... two, one.
Easy. Easy.
Vital signs are normal and strong.
No shit.
Easy.
Easy.
Did ya get him?
Where is he?
Tell me you got him.
Got who?
No one's here.
You're safe with us.
There was a leak in the cryo-unit and...
Was he contained?
It was contained.
But when the cryo-unit ruptured, you didn't escape it.
It put you into stasis.
For how long?
The year is 2455.
Now, I know this is a huge shock... but you'll be safe here.
You're aboard Grendel, a class-four, catamaran transport ship.
We're on our way back home and... you'll be just fine.
That's over 400 years.
Secure line. Perez, Dieter.
Solaris Research Station.
Connect.
Lowe. You bastard.
We've hit the mother lode.
Do you know what time it is?
I don't care.
We've got a goldmine.
A box of DVDs is not a goldmine.
I've told you, I can't move them.
Look at the file.
Two 400-year-old frozen specimens.
One well-preserved...
One well-preserved, the other one, are you ready for this? Up and walking around.
400 years old and walking around.
Yeah. 455 years, to be exact.
Who cares? Who gives a shit?
People. They'll pay huge money to see her.
Let me ask you a question.
Is this the first person you've reanimated?
Of course not.
How many people are out there today... walking around thawed out and looking good?
-Hundreds.
-Thousands.
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.
She's nearly twice as old as anyone.
-What's the difference?
-Doctor, a hundred years ago, when reanimation was... more unpredictable... sure, maybe.
But now... it's old news.
Damn it. I need money.
Oh, I know. I know.
The other viable is marked "Voorhees."
That's not Jason Voorhees, is it?
What do you know about him?
Jason Voorhees.
He killed nearly 200 people... and simply disappeared without a trace.
Why, to the right buyer he could be worth a fortune.
I've got him frozen here on the ship.
You work out a list ofownership?
No list. He's my find.
He's mine.
What about your students?
They're students. The educational experience will be enough.
Doctor, doctor, you are one son of a bitch.
Soon to be one rich son of a bitch.
Lowe out.
Professor,
I think that... we need to talk about my midterm.
Poor baby. No wonder you wore this thing.
Harder. Harder.
-Who's been a naughty little boy?
-I have.
Harder.
-A little harder? How's that?
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.
-How's that?
Yeah!
-Daddy wants it hard?
-Yeah!
-Yeah. That's it.
-Right there?
-You like it right there?
-Yeah.
A little harder for daddy?
Come on!
-Come on!
-You pass!
What do you think?
-Do you like them?
-They're fine.
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think this is going to work.
-Why do you want those things?
-Janessa has them.
-Well, Janessa's...
-Real?
Yes.
Let's not complicate things, all right?
I like you just the way you are.
I think you're pertect.
Okay.
Help, Wayland! No!
Somebody help!
Help me! No!
No! No!
I brought you something to eat.
Soon we'll be at Earth Two.
Earth Two? What happened to Earth One?
Yeah, well, it's dead.
The oceans, the soil, either will sustain life.
Can I do anything else for you?
You want to tell me what happened?
I take it being stabbed and frozen
-wasn't part of your plan.
-I'm a...
I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research.
The subject as Jason Voorhees.
Jason Voorhees?
Notorious murderer?
We executed him for the first time in 2008.
For the first time?
We tried everything.
Electrocution, gas, firing squad.
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.
We couldn't terminate him, so we decided to contain him.
Cryogenic stasis.
Freeze him until we could figure out what to do.
Seems sensible.
I thought so.
Unfortunately some people who were too smart for their own good... felt that a creature that couldn't be killed was. too valuable to file away.
In the end, it always comes down to money.
How do you thank someone who gives you back your life?
You'll be alive for a long time.
We'll figure out something.
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.
I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine.
Guys, our star patient is back.
Tsunaron and Janessa.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I see that my clothes fit okay.
These are yours. They're great.
Thank you.
-What are those?
-These are Janessa's love children.
You see now, it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females.
And you've met
Sergeant Brodski.
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.
And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14.
Tsunaron's little love-bot.
Easy, Janessa.
Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android.
-that I have been programing.
-Amazing.
She looks so real.
I am real.
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Lab two.
Where did you get that?
From your friend, with the hockey mask.
You brought him on board?
He's in the next lab.
We're safe.
Safe?
Our scans reveal him to be very dead.
Could your scans be wrong?
Get rid of him.
He's too dangerous.
That would be irresponsible and foolhardy.
He's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved.
Much like yourself.
He is an unstoppable killing machine.
He's not dead.
Believe me.
He's definitely dead.
Show me.
I'm putting us on lock-down.
Attention, we have a hostile on board.
-Grunt team, report to weapons.
-The chick?
Repeat, we have a hostile on board.
Grunt team, report to weapons.
Everyone else, get to lab one.
-Baby, I'm not ready yet.
-Hurry up.
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.
-Sergeant.
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know, sarge.
-Damn.
Look, sergeant, we need to talk.
-Do you have all your kids yet?
-Yes.
Oh, God!
Stoney...
-Stoney's dead.
-Oh, my God.
Stoney's dead.
Kicker! I want full armor and tac.
I want nothing left of this guy by the time we reach Solaris.
Roger that.
Let's get moving!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nothing left of him?
Take your kids to lab one and stay there till you hear from me.
I just saved your ass.
Don't get cocky.
You must feel like a wuss, huh, big boy?
-Check the score. It's still 9-3.
-Yeah, but I got my groove on now.
So, what do you say next kill wins?
Lock and load, killer.
You're going down.
You are so going down.
What the hell?
-I thought this was an alien sim.
-Yeah, it is.
Pause play.
-I said, pause play.
-He's not pausing.
No kidding.
I think we need to reboot.
That does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Okay, screw this.
Game over.
What the hell?
Drop the kid!
Drop the kid! Now!
Azrael, get out of here!
-I got him! I got him!
-I got no shot!
Move!
Sergeant Brodski.
Don't leave those kids alone.
What's wrong with you?
We're near Solaris.
They have
7 fully equipped unit that can deal with this.
I say we wait and sedate him.
-I am taking this guy out.
-I need him alive.
What you need is to get out of my way.
Look, there are other considerations.
Financial considerations.
My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship.
All right, a hundred thousand.
Two hundred.
-Five.
-Five?
-Dallas not here yet?
-Nope.
Briggs, find him, bring him up to speed.
Condor, you have a BFG?
You're with me. Sven, Geko, you got the starboard pontoon.
Sarge, what do we do when we find him?
I promised the doc we'd take him alive.
Man!
So, after you blow him to hell, put one in his leg so we can say we tried.
Yeah.
-Sarge, I got Dallas.
-Where the hell is he?
He's dead.
Sarge, we got a body in bay two.
-Who is it?
-It's Azrael.
What the hell's going on?
Got a blood trail heading toward the cargo bay.
Condor, Kicker and I will take cargo.
Rest of you take portside.
I hope they know what they're doing.
These guys live for this stuff.
Sorry.
-Don't do that!
-Dude.
-What?
-You scream like a girl.
-Screw you.
-You wish.
Lou, is that you?
I swear, you mess with an engineer... you'll wake up with a waste hose in your bunk.
Asshole.
What the hell?
Crutch, get down now!
-What the hell's going on here?
-Crutch, out now!
You wrecked my stuff, man.
We nailed him.
He must be here.
Condor, airborne.
Briggs.
Where the hell's Sven?
Condor, anything topside?
Negative, sarge.
No sign ofhim.
This won't work.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Everything's under control.
Condor, report.
Sven, report.
Condor, report.
Report!
Damn!
Sarge, we found Condor.
What's his condition?
He's screwed.
Let's smoke this fucker.
God!
Sarge...
Sven's dead.
Jesus.!
-You have got to get them out of there.
-They know what they're doing.
Oh, man!
Geko. Geko.
I got him!
I got him!
Yes, yes.
See, they got him.
Don't take your eyes off him.
I'm on my way.
Take your time.
He ain't going nowhere.
Briggs... get out of here.
Kicker. Briggs.
Where are you, damn it?
He's all alone in there.
It'll take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
Such a waste.
I told him to stay calm.
To wait until we got to Solaris and then we could take care of this... monster.
I said,
"Don't go in unprepared."
Brodski was just too proud.
Who locked the damn door?
Somebody wants to tell me what is going on?
Grunts are dead.
-Which ones?
-All of them.
Oh, man!
Lou, how long till we reach Solaris?
I'm taking us out of hyperdrive now.
Kids and their goddamn field trips, you know?
Just bring a psycho on board.
I know I'll get blamed for this shit.
Solaris to Grendel, we have you on approach. Stand by for docking number.
Grendel to Solaris, we need military and medical at the gate.
We got a big problem here.
Real goat fuck.
Grendel, what's your problem?
What's your problem?
Look... we'll be all right.
He's trapped in the cargo bay.
We're locked in here.
Can the Solaris grunts kill him?
Absolutely.
I've been in constant contact with Solaris.
Sixty highly trained professionals are standing by to get us off this ship.
Solaris to Grendel, pull up.
Abort docking.
You're coming in too fast.
Grendel...
What now?
-Warning. Prepare for impact.
-Hang on!
What's going on?
What the hell's going on?
Everyone okay?
What just happened?
-Waylander.
-Yeah.
We overshot it. We'll turn around and go back.
Hang on.
Oh, my God!
Solaris is gone.
Gone?
-It can't be gone.
-Look. It's gone.
What are we going to do?
Lou.
What sort of damage we looking at?
I'm sending out a distress beacon.
-Lou?
-Guys...
We've lost our entire port pontoon.
-The internal pressure is stable.
-The main...
-thrusters are offline.
-Life support?
We should be okay for a while.
-But he's out there.
-We'll be fine.
We're in a high-volume traffic lane.
Another ship'll come by.
We'll be safe here.
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Maybe he gave up.
You really think so?
I don't think he's out there.
Why don't you just stick your head out and have a peek?
Oh, my God! Go! Go!
Janessa, go!
Move it, move it, move it!
Come on!
Let's go!
Where's professor Lowe?
Hi.
Look... do you know how valuable you are?
I mean, fame, money.
With my help, you're going to have it all.
I know people.
I have connections!
Together we can make a fortune.
We can.
Oh, shit!
You want your machete back.
Shit, it's yours, take it.
Just remember who saved it for you.
Guys, it's okay! He just wanted his machete back!
I'm going to go back to my room because Stoney's meeting me there.
All right, look. How do we get off this ship?
I don't know.
Could you beam us off or something?
"Beam us off?"
The shuttle.
The shuttle.
What about it, Crutch?
Yeah, I can do prelaunch from the bridge.
Good. The rest of us'll head to the shuttle.
We'll start...
I'm with you, Crutch.
-You know how to use that thing?
-Yep.
Like riding a bike. Once you learn, you never forget.
Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold. Meet you at the shuttle bay.
-See you there.
-See there.
What's a bike?
We've enough fire power to level a moon.
Let's pack up and head for the shuttle.
So, you think we'll make it?
The statistical probability of survival is 12 percent.
Twelve percent? Can't you come up with better odds?
-No.
-Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!
Preparation for launch may be a simple procedure, but getting there alive?
It is a problem.
You telling me that there's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds?
Statistical probability of survival just went up to... fifty-three percent.
Want to go for a hundred?
He's here.
Quiet.
But if he's in here, he'll kill us...
Quiet!
One more sound, and I'll snap your neck myself.
Got it?
She's good with people.
Did you see that?
-What?
-I think someone's alive over there.
We don't have time for this.
-Which way is the shuttle bay?
-Straight through.
Go. I'll meet you there.
Just... don't wreck my pants.
Come on, girl.
We're going home.
Ah, Lou!
Jesus, that's twisted.
Course, I've seen worse.
Okay, let's get to work.
Brodski?
Okay...
We'll get you out of here.
Oh, God!
I'll go get help, and I'll be back.
Give me your vest.
-Bastard.
-Hey...
Lucky you weren't alive during the Microsoft conflict.
We were beating each other with our own severed limbs.
That's nice.
Okay.
Let's get us home.
Kinsa, are you there?
Yes, ma'am.
Crutch?
Prepare for fuel transfers.
Cells six and seven bypass.
Hydraulic lifters.
Pressurized and dampened.
-It's Brodski, he's alive.
-No shit.
I can't move him. Are Way and Crutch back?
-No, they're still on the bridge.
-I need help.
Hey, guys.
Brodski's still alive but Rowan can't move him by herself.
Go. I can handle it from here.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Watch your back.
Crutch, how are we doing for time?
With a giant shitload of good luck...
...we might be ready to go.
Good.
Rowan.
-Where's Brodski?
-He was here.
I don't get it.
And I am going home.
Lowe!
Shit!
I got company here, people!
Let's go.
Kinsa, open the door.
Open the damn door!
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?
Kinsa won't open the door.
She's lost it... and it's a really bad time for this!
Janessa, gently.
Give me the com.
Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.
No.
It's all over, honey.
We can go home.
All you need to do is open the door.
No.
Oh, shit. Come on, guys.
Guys!
Jesus Christ!
Open the goddamn door!
No! The fuel lines are still attached!
Kinsa!
Now what?
I...
Now, basically, we die.
Bullshit!
Okay, new plan.
You hold him and I'll run.
Hey, slappy!
Got a little something for you.
Oh, wow!
Gave her an upload.
Afraid I'll have to hurt you now.
Kay-Em!
That...
That didn't go so well.
Got you!
Yeah.
Hey!
Giddy up!
I had it under control, but thanks.
My pleasure.
Yeah.
-You did it.
-Kay-Em.
Who's your mama?
All right.
How you doing there, Brodski?
-I'm all right.
-Come on, let's get you patched up.
What a mess.
Lab two.
Tsunaron, is he gonna make it?
Absolutely. He's at 80 percent already.
This guy is strong.
What the hell?
Way?
Trouble. The collision has compromised the hull.
She's bleeding out.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
Over.
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
-Yes!
Tiamat, this is Grendel, we read you. Can you hear us?
That's affirmative.
We are reading your distress beacon.
-Are you in need of assistance?
-That's very affirmative, Tiamat.
How soon can you get here?
Our situation is extremely critical.
We're four parsecs away,
Grendel.
ETA, 45 minutes.
We don't have that much time.
Tiamat, this is Grendel.
We'll have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes.
Do you copy?
We copy you, Grendel?
Advise how you'd like us to proceed.
We'll take them down with us.
Tiamat... if you can't get here in 30 minutes, there's no point.
What?! Are you high?! Tiamat, this is Grendel.
You just ignore that last idiot.
You get your ass out here, okay?
You come here and you save us.
Why can't we just go over here?
It's no good. The pontoon goes, it'll take the bridge with it.
Not if we disconnect these walkways.
You can't just disconnect them.
We could blow it up.
There's macrocharge in the weapons
This could work.
We're going to try something.
If you're game, maintain your current course and speed... and hopefully we'll see you when you get here.
Copy.
See you in 45 minutes.
-Good luck, Grendel.
-Thanks.
Let's blow the walkways.
Come on.
Let's set the charges.
Who's got the remote?
-Right here.
-We'll meet up in walkway "B."
Go.
-All set.
-Good to go.
Hold together, baby.
Impossible.
-He's dead.
-I'd say he got better.
-He's been modified.
-Oh, you think?
Can you take him?
I can try.
You guys might want to run.
Kay-Em!
No!
Waylander!
Brodski, get in here, now!
Come on, guys!
Come on!
What the hell is going on?
Jason Voorhees is what's going on.
-Blow the charges!
-Waylander's got the trigger!
Hey...
Asshole.
I think she's holding.
I think we're finally okay.
I'd clap if I could.
Tiamat to Grendel...
Come in, Grendel.
We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking.
You ready to get off that boat?
Yeah.
Let's go home.
Holy shit!
We got to go! Now!
No!
Janessa!
Janessa!
Don't let go!
Grab her hand!
Janessa!
Reach out!
Reach for it!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, this sucks on so many levels!
Janessa!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Janessa!
Shit, he's still coming!
-Oh, shit!
-Come on.
Go!
-Which way?
-This way! This way!
Tiamat, we're at the evac door.
So am l, Grendel.
Lifeline secured.
Initiate collar pressurization.
Tiamat, open the outer doors.
Damn!
-What now?
-Let's get that bolt open.
I've got this.
Let me try an override.
Shit! Oh, shit!
Come on, come on.
Our exterior motor's got no power.
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.
-What's EVA?
-It's a space walk.
If he can jump the lines, we can reroute them.
Hopefully, that door'll open before this blows up.
-Sounds like a good plan.
-Tiamat, this is Grendel.
Our escape hatch is jammed. We're going EVA to try to patch it up.
You'd better get a move on.
I'm in the maintenance hatch.
We read you.
Opening outer doors.
Those hatches won't keep him that much longer.
We need to buy more time.
You're the expert on him, right?
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.
I'm at the control panels.
Rowan, are you there?
Yes.
I'll divert the main power supply and send it to you.
Gotcha.
See the bright blue diode?
Connect it to the terminal.
Was that you or me?
That was another part of your hull, Grendel.
You are running out of time.
Just a few more minutes.
We can disengage and come around again.
Negative.
Just another minute.
We'll stand by as long as we can.
-You ready, Kay?
-I was built ready, baby.
Initiate.
It's working.
He's buying it.
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, "Whoops"?
Nothing.
Not nothing.
You don't just say "oops."
I think he saw me.
Oh, man!
If you've got something brilliant, now'sthe time to do it.
I got something.
I got something.
Prepare variations using data file
Crystal Lake, 1980.
Kay?
Here goes nothing.
Initiate.
-You want a beer?
-Or want to smoke some pot?
Or we can have premarital sex.
We love premarital sex.
Try it now, Rowan.
Here we go.
You piece of crap!
He's done with the campers.
He's good!
Too good.
He's coming back.
Try it again.
It's engaged!
The door's engaged!
Brodski, you are the man!
Will we see you sometime soon?
I'm on my way.
Brodski, where are you?!
Grendel, we can't keep pressure lock.
We'll disengage in forty seconds.
Kay-Em.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
-Clear!
-No!
No, wait!
Disconnect.
He's coming this way.
You've got to be kidding me.
Brodski!
He's gone.
I can't believe it.
Tsun?
Kay-Em. Are you okay?
I'll be back on my feet.
As soon as I have some.
I'll get right on it.
It's beautiful.
-Look at that.
-A shooting star.
Make a wish.
It landed in the lake.
Let's go check it out.
Synchronized by hdan.
My lord, time is short.
Leave now, I beg you.
You'll be arrested.
Fetch some candles.
I'll be working late.
And my usual glass of wine.
This world had to change.
But the Revolution is now a terror sweeping the land,
and it's my turn to be swept aside.
Old prejudices make men blind, drive them mad...
devour their hearts and turn them into beasts.
In the year 1764,
the Beast reached our soil and made it its own.
A year later, its fame had spread beyond the borders of our province,
and it seemed no mortal would ever overcome it.
The Beast's assaults
slowly sank the region of Gévaudan into darkness.
Who goes there?
What's he done?
- What?
- He's a thief.
And her?
His daughter. Damned witch!
I healed their horses. They owe me.
Don't listen. They're liars!
- Did he heal the horses?
- Yes.
Begone!
Welcome to the land of the Beast!
Beware of wolf traps!
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac
and the man they called Mani were neither hunters nor soldiers.
A naturalist at the King's Garden,
Fronsac was a libertine
and a fine wit.
The man who shadowed him
was a mysterious foreigner.
At nightfall, the travelers arrived at the castle of Marquis d'Apcher,
their protector in Gévaudan for the duration of their mission.
Our people fear no ordinary wolf.
The Beast is different.
It flees men as if it knew to fear them, yet spares no woman or child.
Have you ever seen it?
How do you know it's just one animal?
The survivors all say the same.
It's bigger than a wolf and has no fear of firearms.
I understand your skepticism.
I don't believe any more than you in dragons.
I've had a report drawn up, a memoir of the Beast's crimes.
Judge for yourself.
You battled the English in New France?
Yes, I went to study animals and nature.
I returned with wounds and a captain's rank.
I've organized a hospital for victims of the Beast, in an old priory.
A woman from Lorciére.
The Beast attacked her coming from the fair.
Two men saved her, the Beast fled, but took half her face.
Tell me, how is M. Buffon?
And how fares Paris?
And L'Ingénu? Have you read it?
It's a bit late to discuss philosophy.
Quite right. Let's speak of theater.
Do you know any actresses?
What's in the theater this winter?
Put it there.
They are a gallant lot, it's said.
I've read some are free with their charms.
Do tell me.
Here, to satisfy your curiosity.
The Mercure de France!
We only get the Courrier d'Avignon.
- I'll show you the common room.
- He'll stay here.
Very well. Good night, sir.
It's not Versailles, but the wine's good.
It's big as a cow.
Jacques says he's seen many wolves.
It's no wolf.
Its snout is longer, its teeth are like knives.
- If not a wolf, what was it then?
- A demon.
Chevalier, the Beast has struck near St. Alban.
There.
There's no one there.
Halt!
What are those bastards doing here?
Good day, Captain.
Good day, Marquis. My respects.
Beware. There are traps.
Duhamel, Sir Grégoire de Fronsac of the King's Gardens.
He'd like to examine her body, with your permission, of course.
The one who brutalized my men?
- Had I known you ordered...
- I did not.
You did well, and I beg your pardon.
They're soldiers trained for war, not hunting.
Careful, she's stuffed with poison.
What sort of gardener are you?
When the Beast is killed,
His Majesty wants it studied in Paris.
I'll keep it after it's captured.
I'm having a look.
With that jaw, it must weigh 500 pounds.
This time, I'll get it... before the snow.
It can't get away.
- Ever seen it?
- Once.
Once, in my musket sight.
I wounded it, my word on it.
It collapsed, then at once revived.
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet, vanished in the wood.
Did it look like this?
It had a black stripe and spike on its back.
My friends, this is the sketch artist,
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac.
A man of Providence indeed, come from Paris to... sketch the Beast.
His Eminence, the Bishop de Mende, the Duke de Moncan, the Count de Morangias, and Madame the Countess.
Their son, Jean-François, who has also traveled.
- A clever hand, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
M. Laffont, our intendant.
Father Henri Sardis of St. Alban's.
Tell us, sir, is there talk of the Beast in Paris?
- They've written ballads.
- Prayers would do better!
Does Capt. Duhamel so need God?
Don't we all?
Duhamel just dresses his men as women to bait the Beast.
He's doing what he can.
Such indulgence!
Duhamel is incompetent.
His hunts exhaust the people, his ruffians devastate our land, and the Beast roams free.
If Duhamel is all I get for paying my taxes to Paris,
I'd rather give it to my valets.
- What do you say, sir?
- You're not obliged to reply.
His Lordship likes to argue, but he's a good Christian.
When you arrived, this assembly was talking my ears off with God this and God that.
It's said the Pope sent a spy to see if the Beast is a manifestation of the Devil.
Pardon me.
Marianne de Morangias.
A daunting task indeed.
The most elusive quarry in our land.
- Who's the hapless hunter?
- Des Forêts, a playwright.
- Then it's simple.
- Careful, she's a Morangias.
Sir, we were conferring...
- M. Des Forêts?
- Himself.
An honor. Good writers are rare.
Marquis d'Apcher spoke of you.
He thought of you for his memoirs.
Really?
He's in good spirits.
But have some finesse.
Wait till he broaches the subject.
Excuse me.
- Have you no shame?
- None.
Does the naturalist like our country?
I've only glimpsed its beauties so far, or one of them.
Is such the talk of court?
No, this is a couplet reserved for provincials.
I might go to court if there were ladies like you.
Dinner is served. Let's go in.
Whither thou goest...
In sailing up the St. Lawrence we found in our nets the strangest animal I'd ever seen.
I'd heard of the native's sacred fish, but I was sure it was a legend.
I was looking at a fish the shape and size of a trout, but which was entirely covered in a rich black fur.
A furry trout? Surely you jest.
No, sir.
Salmo truta dermopilla from Canada.
Soft as mink.
- Nature is extraordinary!
- The water must be cold!
This proves the impossible may be possible.
Well said.
It surely won you the King's favor.
I doubt he deserves it.
Though I do recognize your comedic talent.
Had I two hands, I'd applaud.
- Please pardon him.
- Your son is right.
This animal doesn't exist.
My taxidermist is a clever man.
Please excuse the prank.
Should this fable convince us there is no Beast?
That we're simpletons?
The moral of the fable is that dragons and unicorns only appear in fables.
Lies appear true when dressed in Latin.
Careful, sir. We may lose all sense of what you're saying.
Indeed, are you a naturalist or a philosopher?
Or worse, an actor!
I believe the knight is, above all, Parisian.
Enough talk of the Beast.
After all, it only preys on peasants.
How about a guessing game? Charades?
I've just composed a lover's lament.
May I, Countess?
- If it isn't licentious.
- Oh no.
It's very chaste and pure.
It's an improvisation.
It's called "Wolves Howl".
"I went not warily though I bore no malice, verily
"Your sly eye caught my heart in its prowl
"I howl"
Shall I see you soon?
Have you other amazing animals to show me?
You seem set in your idea of me.
Allow me to change your mind.
Try.
- Coming to the hunt?
- Certainly.
I can't allow it. Too dangerous.
Obedience is the virtue of well-born girls.
This young man is right.
That day in Gévaudan,
there was the greatest hunt ever in France.
The King offered 6,000 pounds bounty for the Beast.
Thousands of enlisted peasants, swordsmen and soldiers
were joined by every hunter and adventurer in the region.
For a few hours, we forgot we were the hunted.
You each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at 7:00.
Thank you.
You might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.
Your generosity rivals your courage.
Enough! For your sake, we'd better take it.
We shall, Your Lordship.
What is this ruckus?
Fine weapon, isn't it?
I had it made in Mende after a campaign.
Custom-made for me, of course.
Look. Even in Paris you'll never see such a bullet.
I make them myself.
Silver? Afraid of werewolves?
I like to sign my shots.
I'm a hunter, Fronsac.
And it has cost me dearly.
How did it happen?
I learned the hard way that one bullet won't always suffice.
And, Sardis notwithstanding, prayer won't cure gangrene.
- Did a bear injure you?
- A lion.
Yes, two years in the Navy,
I traveled a lot.
Do you know Africa?
My lords, my daughter caused all this.
Here. Punish her as you will.
Witch!
She's a daughter of the Devil!
- A demon has got her!
- She's ill!
She's not possessed!
Burn her!
She mustn't swallow her tongue.
She'd suffocate.
- She's not possessed.
- I know.
Naturalist, philosopher and a bonesetter as well?
She didn't show. I won the bet.
Marquis.
And the natives?
Superstitious brutes, like here.
Indian hunters eat the hearts of their prey for strength.
Are they brutes then?
In Africa, it's their enemies' hearts.
My lord the Count, Jean-François, you must move east...
There you are.
Your mother will be worried.
She always is.
If I listened, I'd be in a convent.
I knew you didn't believe me.
You're a libertine.
- Not when I'm in love.
- You're in love?
Ridiculous! We've hardly met.
You thought I meant you?
She must learn to ride like a lady.
No harm in a little exercise.
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees evil everywhere.
People died here.
How do you know?
I hear their cries.
Mani, stop it.
He's right. This was a Templar stronghold.
Twenty-five heretics were burned alive in the chapel.
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be.
You just need to look.
My brother and I played here.
Were you not afraid?
He said he would protect me from ghosts.
- No taste for the hunt?
- That a crime here?
The Indians say a portrait steals the soul.
My soul interests you as well?
On foot at a hunt?
- My fault.
- I didn't ask you.
- What possessed you?
- It's only a wolf.
- And if it were the Beast?
- I don't think so.
Thank you.
Pray the Beast is one of these wolves.
These won't devour anyone now.
Curious fellow.
- Where did you find him?
- New France.
Is he an Acadian?
An Indian. A Mohawk Iroquois.
An Indian? A real one?
He doesn't look it.
Come to St. Alban tonight.
We'll have fun with your valet.
He's not my valet.
- What then?
- He's my brother.
Really! Mixing your blood with that of a savage?
A man who shares one's hardship is no savage.
Mani saved me from the English at Trois Riviéres.
I thought the savages were cannibals.
As you can see, sir, Mani is no animal.
Can you reproduce with a woman of our race?
All women are the same color when candles blow out.
Yes, Father, they even have wit.
Indians and whites have had children.
We're one species.
Don't speak too soon.
It's a bit like the Negroes.
What say you, Sardis?
Your blood brother is God's child.
- Has he been baptized?
- He hasn't asked.
You are a man of your times!
Mani has his beliefs.
At home, he was a sort of priest.
If they have priests, they're doomed.
What are these beliefs?
Each man has an animal spirit, called a totem.
Amusing. How does it work?
Would you?
Never fear, it won't hurt.
Caribou. A sort of stag.
What says my wife?
Am I a stag because of my horns or because of something else?
And my dear Thomas, what's his totem?
Worm. Bookworm probably.
Snake.
For Indians, the snake embodies wisdom.
Serpent wise.
And our intendant?
Boar.
Lighten your spirit.
Perhaps for these barbarians the pig is nobility.
Who's next? Sardis?
And me?
What am I, a semi-lion?
Half an eagle?
Make me a lizard, so my arm may grow back.
Jean-François, enough.
What? Have I been gauche?
Let me be.
Mademoiselle? Your turn?
Pardon me, but I'm weary of your tricks.
I'll retire before you begin juggling or dancing on a ball.
Good night.
It'll cheer you, Fronsac.
It's the best house in Mende.
You'll sleep better than at an inn.
They're all for you.
And the new girl is very...
Dear little Marquis.
Come.
I'm expensive, Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Do you know me?
- In here, Gévaudan becomes very small.
Italian?
Just passing through.
I have money.
It's not only a matter of money.
What then?
- Who did that to you?
- An Iroquois arrow.
Not far from the heart.
I may be a lucky man.
And that?
A bear.
He didn't care much for me.
You haven't seen anything yet.
My business is dangerous.
Some men aren't so nice.
Something to remember me by.
A scandal! In my house!
- Valentine!
- I don't lay with sorcerers!
- What?
- Snakes on him! I saw them move!
Our reputation! You have to go!
It's nothing.
He's an Indian, not a sorcerer.
- Then no Indians!
- You have delicate whores.
Come on, girls.
Who will go with our redskin?
I'll double the fee.
- I like his tattoos.
- That settles that.
So, a sorcerer are we?
Will you do my portrait?
If you don't behave.
Weeks passed, and Duhamel's men couldn't find the Beast.
A third winter would be spent under its reign.
The snow could not stop it anymore than our rifles and dogs.
Recall how God warned us through the words of Moses:
"I shall come unto you like a bear whose cubs are ravished.
"As a lion I shall devour your children and spill their entrails.
"I will set upon ye a fearsome Beast
"to consume you and your flocks,
"and make your fields barren."
How long, O Lord, wouldst Thou forsake us?
A candle for each victim.
Is this truly the Age of Reason?
Have mercy!
Forgive me!
Have mercy!
Bless me!
What is it, my son?
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!
I'm damned! We all are!
Gather your men. We must leave.
Alert Mani. I'll find you on the way!
Hello, friend of the wolves.
I have something for you.
I want to see you. Alone.
In 10 days my mother's going to a retreat and my father to a cure.
- Ten days?
- I'm not as free as you.
The torch.
Bring the torch!
The storm is rising; the men are tired.
We'd best go home.
No. We must find the girl.
I found the child.
Captain, your web of traps snares more peasants than wolves, your men have plundered the population, and since you began, the wolf has taken 12 more lives.
It should never have escaped us.
How's that?
It should never have escaped us.
What say you, Fronsac?
What sort of wolf is this?
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.
Wolves don't attack men, or very rarely.
I studied them in New France.
Perhaps our wolves are different.
A rabid wolf will attack.
And dies within a fortnight.
For two years, the Beast has had its bloody reign.
Its victims bear wounds no wolf could inflict.
I've often found upon the body a piece of this metal.
- So?
- So... no animal has fangs of iron.
Then the Beast is not an animal? Fine.
How do we catch it?
While we speculate, it's killing our people.
Gentlemen, let us hear M. de Fronsac with utmost attention.
So you say, sir, this is no ordinary animal.
We all think so.
And for myself I'm pleased you concede this is something supernatural.
I concede nothing, Father.
I have only doubts.
Anything to add?
No, gentlemen.
I've received this from Paris.
Capt. Duhamel His Majesty has been informed of your ineffective efforts.
He requests you be relieved of your duties.
You and your men are to return to Langogne at once.
Sir Beauterne, Master at Arms, is on his way.
His mandate is to kill this ferocious wolf.
He alone is authorized to hunt in the diocese.
Gentlemen.
Then I'm forgiven?
I was curious to know my "totem".
Is that the word?
I would guess... mermaid.
Are you never serious?
I'll ask your redskin.
And the Beast? Have you spotted it?
Forbidden subject?
My absurd assumptions would get me laughed out of King's Garden.
If I said the Beast is flesh and iron mixed, that it's possessed of reason and may disappear at will, what would you say?
Country air has affected your mind.
It's eluding me.
After three months, you expect to have finished?
Should the Beast have surrendered?
Perhaps it's afraid of you.
Am I so fearsome?
A hard-won victory will be better savored.
Is it true you're going to Africa?
For now it's but a naturalist's winter dream.
And you? Ever yearn for new horizons?
A lady has more duties than yearnings.
Do you see Sardis over there?
Are you being watched?
He's there to protect me.
Alone with you,
God knows what could happen.
Let's go inside.
Our priest might catch cold.
Good evening, sir.
- You're in love.
- I don't know.
I do.
The cards?
I've never needed them for you.
So let's drink.
To Mademoiselle de Morangias.
- What?
- Her brother was here.
You slept with him?
Him? He can't stand to be touched.
He watches, he drinks, then he talks in his sleep, like all men.
Do I?
What do I say?
"Again!"
Know how Florentine women keep their husbands home?
Each morning, they give them a slow poison, and every evening the antidote.
That way, when the husband sleeps away he has a very bad night.
You needn't resort to that.
Anyway, we aren't married.
Make way for Antoine de Beauterne,
Royal Master at Arms, who has come to rid the country of the Beast!
- I am Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Yes, Buffon's envoy.
The naturalist embalmer.
M. de Beauterne is at the Intendant's.
Come at 2:00.
His Majesty asked my advice about your report.
Complicated fables indeed!
I believe the Beast is a wolf.
I shall go out for it tomorrow.
I would rather you didn't come.
Why is that?
The King left this affair to me, and to my sole discretion.
I have no need of you to end it.
On the table there's a letter from Buffon and our beloved king.
I'm at his service, but believe me this is not...
I've read your report. Trouble yourself no longer with this Beast.
It's my affair.
You may go.
Come here.
A woman from Lorciére.
It attacked her coming from the fair.
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet, vanished in the wood.
The Beast has struck near St. Alban.
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!
I don't believe anymore than you in...
Its snout is longer, its teeth are like knives.
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.
- The Beast is no animal.
- A rabid wolf will attack.
How do we catch it?
No animal has iron fangs.
Sir, come at once!
I saw him!
He was dispensing poison and saying satanic incantations!
God only knows for how long!
Let him go.
An Indian remedy, Father.
Only our prayers may save her.
But she was...
A miracle!
What happened to your brother?
- A man with the Beast?
- The child is incoherent.
Yes, the Beast is dead.
No cure for 10 shots in the gut.
We've brought your things. Begin at once.
- It's not the Beast.
- Get to work!
- Ridiculous!
- M. de Beauterne is coming.
Watch your lip!
Hello. Leave us!
Don't you like my Beast?
What is this? You know it's not the Beast.
Its jaw is twice as large.
You can fix that here.
What?
Paris awaits. I have only this wolf.
So make me a Beast.
- To fool the King?
- No, Fronsac.
I carry out his will.
You'd be wise to do the same.
Is that a threat, sir?
At my age? Come now, you know me.
You're too smart for threats.
Do your duty, the King will be grateful.
Otherwise, he'll be quite upset.
You have what you need.
I'm counting on you.
Good-bye for now.
Good evening, my unhappy friend.
Are you sad to be returning to Paris?
The Beast is dead. You should be happy.
Do you want me to tell you a secret?
I collect them.
Beauterne killed a simple wolf.
He is an impostor.
And I am his accomplice.
Come, let's drink to our betrayals.
You saw nothing.
You are no longer welcome at the castle, sir!
Tell Mademoiselle de Morangias that I am here!
- I've already told you...
- Speak of the devil!
My son and I were just talking about you, sir.
It is your daughter I have come to visit.
- I'm afraid that is impossible.
- I insist.
Let him come in, Mother.
Be careful, Jean-François, you know how these matters end.
Leave us.
Sir, Marianne is suffering.
I don't understand.
However, Fronsac, you are not a stranger to what ails her.
Where is she?
Follow me.
So kind of you to visit.
Mademoiselle, what ails you?
I am to return to Paris, but that depends on you.
Have a safe journey.
I warned you, Fronsac.
You have offered me only one present, and here I give you two for your collection.
I've been warned about men of your kind.
Men of my kind, mademoiselle, never condemn people without having listened to them.
I don't know how this happened, but let me explain.
You needn't bother.
Please, sir, don't make this more difficult than it already is.
Admit that you were not the man for my sister, and leave it at that, no regrets.
Do you believe that she will remain your nursemaid all her life?
Are you not happy to leave our province in one piece?
In other times, I would have you flogged for looking at her.
Times change.
Not everywhere, Fronsac.
In any case, not here.
I'm sorry!
Will you hit me too if I tell you to leave?
Good-bye.
Have no regrets. He didn't deserve you.
On this historic day, thanks be to Sir Grégoire de Fronsac of King's Garden.
The Beast's end is partly his.
But it is mostly thanks to Your Majesty.
Let it be known:
In your sole person resides sovereign power.
Only a beast could ignore it.
That Beast is no more.
I have only little merit.
With your power bestowed upon me,
I merely needed to appear, and the Beast laid down its arms.
What is this?
Beauterne's carried out his orders, as we all should.
- What orders?
- Mine.
This is M. Mercier,
Special Counsel to His Majesty for domestic matters.
It was his idea to send Antoine de Beauterne.
You're to thank for this prompt victory?
I admire your scruples, but it's for the greater good.
Have you read this?
It's no longer for sale, but you may keep it.
It was banned?
A fable undermining the King.
We'd have had trouble if we waited longer.
People are so gullible.
Better to lie than let lies be spread?
Truth is a complicated thing.
One must govern with simplicity.
No more Beast, no more problem.
It'll go on killing.
No one will hear of it again.
That's what counts.
I was forgetting.
His Majesty is most thankful.
It's said you want to go to Africa.
In six months, a schooner sets sail for Senegal.
If you wish, you'll be aboard.
Of course, we'll never speak of Gévaudan again.
Well, Fronsac?
Marianne de Morangias?
Madame, I don't believe I know you.
We both have a friend in common.
What are you doing here?
It's useless to hide behind that veil.
Your perfume is not that of a Lady.
Grégoire de Fronsac has only loved one woman.
It is your name he calls out in his sleep.
He will soon be leaving on a long journey.
Just perfect.
When you see Fronsac, do not tell him anything of our meeting, or you will lose him forever.
Who was that, my child?
No one.
That one, in the hold with the others.
These two, in my cabin.
Be careful, they're fragile!
Hello, Fronsac!
Hey, Marquis!
Good to see you!
Not as good as all that.
Two days after you left, the crimes began again.
The King no longer sends soldiers.
I can't find volunteers for the hunt.
I can't do a thing.
I don't know how to catch it.
Frankly, it wasn't entirely your talents I was thinking of.
Mani found the child.
Just one hunt, Fronsac!
You'll be back within the month.
Impossible! The King has forbidden us from returning.
- The King will not know.
- So you think.
Is the King's peace of mind worth all these sacrifices?
You won't change my mind.
- Do you want to bet?
- The last time we made a bet, you lost!
I would have preferred not to use this, but, here, it's from Marianne.
And Mani?
My friend!
How are you?
- We're leaving for the hunt, Mani.
- This time, we'll do it your way.
So, my friend, any good news?
Best in the world, Marquis.
In Gévaudan, the crimes continued,
but officially, the Beast was dead.
What really happened appears in no history book.
It was carefully kept quiet.
Is he welcoming us?
He wants to help us.
Go to the castle. I'll meet you there.
What is it?
Where do Jeanne and Pierre Roulier live?
Go straight on.
It's the last house in the village.
This is Jeanne, my nanny.
Pierre, fetch some wine.
I'm being watched.
They might know you're back.
I'll tear you away from your family.
I can't bear my mother, nor Jean-François.
I want to leave.
In a week, we'll go to Paris.
Why wait?
The hunt. I promised the Marquis.
You didn't return for me?
Look out!
Leave! Slowly, don't run!
Over here! Look at me!
Come here!
Go, Marianne!
What is this? Open up!
My God!
Tell me, do you really think we'll find this Beast?
We're short of men.
Mani knows what he's doing.
I'm hunting a man.
A man?
The Beast is a weapon serving a sick mind.
- Wouldn't a killer be secretive?
- Right.
The Beast's first mystery is its fame.
Its master wants people to talk, to be afraid and make noise.
How's that?
This book is sold all over.
It says the Beast is punishing the King's indulgence in philosophers.
Who wrote it?
I don't know, but the Beast has a master. I want him.
Perhaps your weapon will help... but only in your hands!
And you, Mani?
Which will you choose?
Mani doesn't like firearms.
Too much noise and smoke. Bad smell.
All will go well, Grandfather.
Don't worry. We're well prepared.
Tell me of the Americas.
Will you never go back?
Not all my memories are fond ones.
And Mani? Does he miss his tribe?
His tribe is no more.
Before our attack, the pox had decimated his village.
Orders were to execute survivors.
The women, and the children, too.
Only Mani escaped.
- How?
- We needed an interpreter.
I was to teach him our language.
Then I found him slaying the Captain.
Why didn't you turn him in?
Know how the Captain waged battle?
He gave his scouts infected hospital sheets.
The Iroquois bought them.
Three weeks later, we'd mop up.
- And that's our war?
- In any case, that is how we lost.
Where did he go?
- To speak to the trees.
- Trees?
Trees can speak.
The white man cannot listen or see.
See what, Mani?
Want to learn?
- What's this?
- An Indian sacrament.
At your own risk, Marquis.
- What's it do?
- Depends on the person.
They say they see the invisible.
So, Mani?
The Beast is in the forest.
The wolves will help us.
I see no better.
This night we shall dance the dance of blood.
And the Beast shall come to us with the sun.
It has no effect on me.
That night, Mani invoked spirits
in a language even Fronsac couldn't understand.
And the wolves brought them to the Beast.
Don't worry, I'll fix this for you.
Don't worry, girl. I'll see to you.
I'll take care of you.
Thomas is asleep. A close call.
I'm sorry for the Indian.
What is there?
Tell me, what manor is this?
I need to know.
It's a domain. A hunting ground.
Sir, you need rest.
Hurry! Fire!
He's over there! Come on!
Fronsac returned by Mani's side.
His revenge had hardly begun, but according to Indian custom, he must be sent to his ancestors at dawn's first light.
What do you want?
Too much blood has been spilled.
You're in great peril here.
I have business to attend to.
Is it worth your life?
How long have you known?
I don't know what you mean.
Come now, Sardis. How?
How did it get this far?
No one will believe you.
Go away, Sardis.
May God save you.
May the Devil take you.
You're under arrest by order of the Intendant.
Please offer no resistance.
That's ridiculous!
- A lady to see you.
- Later. Tonight.
Get up! You've got company.
- Aren't I in solitary confinement?
- Depends for whom.
Sorry.
Bring your guest some dinner.
- How?
- Many owe me favors.
Help me. I must write to the King.
You'd be hung before he read your letter.
I've yet to stand trial.
Here.
- Tell me of the Beast.
- A trained animal.
Cloaked in armor. I wounded it.
Why the sudden interest?
Two years ago, a confidential letter from Sardis was given to the Pope.
It spoke of a newly founded secret society whose purpose was to spread and defend, by any means, the word of the Church.
The Brotherhood.
Sardis, he was using the Beast.
The Beast is a warning to the King:
"Heed the power of the Lord or suffer Apocalypse."
Members are known as "wolves of God."
It serves the Church?
Sardis serves only himself.
These wild times have made him mad.
The group is beyond Rome's control.
In whose employ are you?
My duties include never letting that be known.
And you, you know quite enough.
Mademoiselle de Morangias, what an honor.
How fares the Countess? Please sit down.
And your father? Still in cure?
He's too fond of rich food.
Sir, you've arrested Fronsac.
How far a man such as he has fallen!
- He's neither thief nor murderer.
- Really?
Hear me, he must have had his reasons.
- If they killed the Indian...
- That's another matter.
You don't avenge a savage with Christian blood.
May I visit him?
Impossible.
Very well.
Paris shall hear of this.
You don't understand.
Fronsac passed away... last night.
In any case, they'd have hung him.
Upon reflection, he was lucky.
He was in your custody.
Perhaps he choked.
Or he caught a blight in the mattress.
You're lying. You're all lying!
Courage, child, it's the will of God.
Come.
- I'll escort you home.
- She needs rest.
- Let me alone!
- It's over.
He's already reeking.
Bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.
She threatened to go to the King.
That girl is dangerous.
Fronsac was buried that very night,
long before news of his death reached Paris.
No one knew what secrets he took to his grave.
For several days, the Beast did not strike.
But the sudden disappearance of its most dauntless foe
seemed to be a dark omen.
Hurry.
Father, I'm guilty. I have sinned.
Forgive me.
Marianne, day and night I think of her.
I hear her heart beating in my chest.
I want her on our side, Sardis.
- The Lord is testing you.
- I can't endure it.
The visions!
These accursed visions torment me!
Deliver me, Father!
I beg of you!
There's only one remedy for this evil.
Don't drink, Sister.
They want to kill you.
But I won't let them.
Who does?
Who?
We're going to leave, just you and me.
How about America?
You've hurt me, but I forgive you.
Please. What are you doing?
Stay.
- Would I harm you?
- Please stay away from me.
I need you.
You saved me when I was sick, no one else.
The sight of your face ended my nightmares.
Your hand on my brow chased away demons.
You can't imagine all I've done to keep you near.
I beg of you, don't shun me.
Why?
Do I disgust you?
You don't frighten me. Get out.
Because of this?
Never fear.
From now on, I'll take care of you.
Look.
No one knows. Only Sardis and I.
Leave! Get out!
Why?
You're not my brother.
Another man returned from Africa.
That's true, but it was for you I left.
All this would not be, if not for you.
All this?
It's your odor that foul thing smelled on me.
We're of the same blood.
When father comes back, he'll kill you!
Unless I kill him?
He's hindered us so long.
Go ahead. Do it, go ahead!
Why didn't you?
Is it so difficult? Look.
- Stop!
- Then you love me?
I love you!
Brothers, the Lord has told me the Beast will return to herald the return of values to our decadent kingdom.
And in a reborn France we shall be invisible princes, for God is with us.
The people cannot fathom the Lord's wrath.
The unjust censure of the King cannot withstand the public's rage.
When that wrath is at a climax, we'll bargain with the King.
If he couldn't repress one, imagine if, from all over the realm, other beasts burst forth.
The hour is at hand to reap what we've sewn.
Let us read from Malachi:
"The word of the priest is the depository of science,
"and from his mouth is sought knowledge of the law,
"for he is the angel of the Lord of Hosts."
"He who adores the Beast
"shall drink the Lord's wrath.
"He shall be tormented in the fire and brimstone
"before the angels,
"and the smoke shall rise in the century of centuries."
I've come back to name you:
Pierre-Jean Laffont.
Geneviéve de Morangias.
Maxime Des Forêts.
Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis.
Jean-François de Morangias.
Amen!
Fire!
Bastards! You're all under arrest!
Ghost or no ghost...
I'll split you in two.
See? No need to hold back.
I never intended to.
Too late. The Beast is immortal now.
Perhaps, but you are not!
- You trained the Beast.
- How'd you know?
You use silver bullets.
Marianne, look!
Marianne's not here, madman.
You've united us forever.
Line the bastards up!
Who do you think you are?
Look at them!
Not so high and mighty now!
Get back!
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.
And Sardis?
Wherever he runs, we'll find him.
Or the mountain will take him.
Shall we celebrate properly?
You've killed me once.
The better to revive you.
I could introduce you in Rome.
Will you come with me?
Too late.
I like you, Fronsac.
You make me forget all my duties.
Leave, before I change my mind.
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.
I've had her brought home. She's dying.
Get out! Go away! All of you!
Wake up!
Forgive me.
I love you.
Years passed, but Grégoire de Fronsac
and Marianne de Morangias never left my memory.
The world that made the Beast is dying away,
and I must hasten, for my story, too, is ending.
I remember Fronsac and I at Jean-François' hideaway
where the Beast awaited its final hour.
The old healer told us all he knew.
Jean-François brought an animal back from Africa,
who had a litter.
Only one cub was kept, the strongest.
Patiently and cruelly,
he'd trained it to be vicious.
Thus died the Beast of Gévaudan.
And I, Thomas d'Apcher,
am probably the last to know the whole truth.
The Chevalier invited me to Africa,
but my land needed rebuilding.
My duty was to my countrymen.
I've often thought of Grégoire and Marianne
throughout these peaceful years that have brought me to this age.
I never saw them again,
but I like to think they lived happily, far from here.
Vampires!
Here!
Be careful!
Watch out!
Vampires!
Gimme that stone!
Keep hold of it!
Don't let it go!
No!
Aah!
Hon?
What?
Oh-hh... you have another nightmare?
The vampires were back.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I've got to get some sleep.
Mom... do you like this place?
Well, it's a big change for you, i know.
New house... new country... hear that?
It's the wind.
Or the undead.
Mom?
Dad?
Tony,
if i don't get
some sleep,
then i'll be one
of the undead.
Come on, honey, you're gonna be late.
Got everything?
Jump in.
Put your seat belt on.
Hey... wave hi to dad and lord mcashton.
Scotland is beautiful, isn't it?
If you don't have vampires.
And you know we really don't, right? But a dream isn't real.
I know what a dream is, mom.
Okay.
I'm just asking.
But you know there is no such thing as vampires, right?
Mom!
You're on the wrong side of the road!
Whoa!
What did he say?
Everybody talks weird here.
Don't worry, things are gonna get better.
You'll meet some new friends here soon.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
This is for being a little creep!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
And this is for coming here in the first place!
On saturday night, we'll be able to see comet forsey in conjunction with the moon for the first time in 300 years.
And then-- and then the beam of light comes from the moon.
As usual, our american friend is full of stories.
What makes you say that?
I dreamt it.
Stupid yank.
Fine.
Now you've had your joke.
No.
I've dreamt it every night since i've been here.
And then there's a gathering.
A gathering of what?
A gathering of vampires.
Not again, tony.
I really saw it!
The comet, the beam of light, the vampires, and the vampire hunter.
All right, that's it.
You've earned yourself a chair in the hall.
Fly away back
to california, creep.
Look what i got you.
A golf club!
Yeah.
A junior set of golf clubs.
You know, the game was invented in scotland.
But there's no one to play with.
Well, that's the beauty of golf.
You don't need anyone to play with.
But i want someone to play with.
Then i'll teach you.
You never have time.
Now, look, tony, i'm trying here.
There you are.
The babysitter's downstairs.
Good.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late, hon.
It's business.
Lord mcashton invited us.
All the investors are gonna be there.
Hey, look at those.
Those are great!
I didn't know you could draw so good.
Great.
Good night, hon.
I want you in bed by 9:00, and don't give yourself any nightmares.
Mwah!
I love you.
Be a good boy.
Lord mcashton.
Bob.
And dodie.
Dottie.
Of course it is.
What do you think of our blimp?
- Oh, i like the blimp--
- me too.
How nice to see you.
He likes my blimp.
Okay, pet, it's time to-- oh!
Oh! Tony!
What a fright you gave me!
I didn't see you sitting there, pet.
Och, dear, you near stopped my heart, and it's near enough stopping as it is.
That's the truth of it, and you wouldnae want to do that to miss lorna now, would you?
Eh? Listen, you can have a wee read of your book once you're settled, but meanwhile brush your teeth and away to bed.
Bed for the undead?
Ahh... ha ha ha!
Got you now, you filthy thing!
Let the chase begin.
Right.
Ab ovo... in toto... what clan... are you from, brother?
Have the lights gone?
Who are you?
You are not a brother.
Well, i'm not a sister.
You're human.
You're full of blood!
Gonna keep it that way, dude!
I'm too weak... i'm not afraid... i'm not afraid... do you need help?
What twisted kind of mortal are you?
I know you.
I saw you in my dream.
Must've been a nightmare.
It was.
I must leave.
But you can't even walk.
Who needs to walk... when i can fly?
Whoa... aah!
You okay?
Do i look it?
Rookery.
Do you... do you know where i can get a cow?
If you want a glass of milk... no, not milk.
A cow.
Hurry.
Your eyes
are getting heavy...
you're falling
into a deep sleep... ugh...
i think
i'm gonna hurl.
Aww... it's just a little one.
Well, let's see how you like this!
So... that's not enough for you, eh?
Let's see you escape from me now!
Aah!
Shut your eyes, tony!
That was very clever.
But i'll catch you!
You can open your eyes now.
Wow!
Enjoying the view?
Yeah.
And thanks, dude.
You saved my life.
That truck was gonna splatter me.
You keep calling me dude.
My name's rudolph.
Dude is slang.
Like you call a friend.
A friend?
Well, we saved each other's lives, didn't we?
Yes, we did.
Friends.
My name is tony.
Come on.
Let's play.
Yes. We play.
Ah-ah-ah!
My best friend's a vampire!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I haven't heard music like this since my brother's wedding.
You see, it has a proper rhythm.
That's what i like.
Ah, the grandsons!
We came to say good night, grandfather.
Now, boys... this is tommy's mother and father.
That's tony.
Tony.
Of course it is.
The boys tell me that they have become great friends with your son.
He's our favorite plaything.
Boy there you have it.
Off to bed.
Well, lovely to meet you.
Tell tony we'll see him tomorrow.
Bright and early.
Ha! Will do.
They seem like terrific kids.
They are, they are.
If you'll excuse me, i need another... cheers.
Cheers.
So... how is my son fitting in? Okay?
He doesn't tell you?
Oh, he tells me plenty, but, you know kids.
I'm talking about tony's obsession with vampires.
Excuse me.
I think i should get home.
Rudolph, how do we get down from here?
We'll fly.
But i can't fly.
I got you up here, didn't i?
Well, i guess so.
Then stay calm... friend.
All right, let's fly.
As long as i'm
holding onto you, you're fine.
Trust me.
Ready?
Whoa, i'm flying!
Wow-ww...!
Wow! It's great to be a vampire!
Membership does have its privileges.
Look.
My mom and dad went to a party there.
I'm terribly sorry.
Excuse me.
Oh, mr. Thompson, awful sorry to bother you, but i didnae know what else to do!
What?
He's not here and i've looked everywhere and... no, no, i came up and he was-- until up about half an hour ago.
I can't understand you.
Say it again.
In english.
Slowly.
Come back with mrs. Thompson.
Help me find him!
Yeah!
Vampires are different than i thought they'd be.
Father's seen to that.
We're a family, not fiends.
That's why we only try to drink cow's blood.
But i thought vampires drink human blood.
We do, but we've got to make do with cows.
Why?
Because we've been hunted for centuries.
We always have to hide.
We want to become humans, not eat them for dinner.
He wasn't like this at home.
This is scotland, not san diego.
What do you expect?
He's an eight-year-old kid.
Oh, mr. Thompson, mrs. Thompson!
I've been waiting on you coming back!
Cannae understand.
Sent him away early, like you said, to bed.
And then i was up checking him and-- tony?
I mean, just for half an hour and i cannae underst-- i saw what i saw and i saw what i didnae see.
And-- and i-- i didnae see-- what's that?
I smell it, too.
So... those are your parents?
They look nice.
And tasty?
No, nice.
As in very nice.
They have their moments.
I suppose i must take my leave.
I haven't had so much fun with a boy my own age
since i really
was nine.
Thanks... dude.
You can stay if you want.
Maybe i should.
Do vampires always
sleep in coffins?
'Cause that's gonna be a problem.
Just as long as the sun can't find me.
This would be excellent.
I have to take out all this junk.
Junk? It's a treasure chest.
I've hidden in trees and watch mortals play this game.
What is it?
Nintendo.
Duh!
Nintendo duh.
Can i play with this nintendo duh?
It's nintendo. "Duh" is just a word people say when someone asks a dumb question.
Duh.
More like "duh"!
Duh!
Duh!
Duh.
I'll teach you nintendo tomorrow.
I know.
You must sleep now.
It's late
for mortals.
Until the night.
So you're, like, a thousand years old or something, right?
I've just been nine for over 300 years.
I want to be a vampire, too.
No. You don't know what that means.
Doing the most awesome stuff i've ever done in my life.
No blue skies, tony.
No birds singing.
No flowers in the sunlight.
Just this constant night.
Cool.
Good morning!
Now, why are you sleeping this way?
Did you have another nightmare last night?
Yeah.
Aww... poor baby.
No.
I dreamt i was... flying.
You did?
That's wonderful!
That's a good kind of dream to have.
Now, come on, get up.
Rise and shine!
Time to go to school!
Hiss-ss!
The sun!
Sorry, dude.
Honey, you hungry?
I could eat a cow!
Nancy... good morning, vampy.
You mean wimpy, don't you? Ha!
Out of my way, losers!
You dirty little-- fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fighting with the mcashton boys, of all people!
They started it.
Keep still.
It's still bleeding.
Let me get another tissue.
Now, last night
your teacher told me
that you'd been talking
an awful lot about monsters.
No wonder they keep teasing you.
Not monsters.
Vampires.
It's all the same.
No, it's not.
You know, it's gonna be rough making friends like that.
I have a friend.
You do?
What's his name?
Rudolph.
Where does he live?
Not far.
What's he like?
He's... a... he's very, very cool.
Well, invite him for a sleepover.
I already did.
There it is again.
What?
That smell.
I don't smell anything.
Nice, easy stroke.
Okay, give it a shot.
All right!
Pretty good!
When does the sun go down?
Not for a while.
But i need to be home before it sets.
What's the big hurry?
You bored already?
No. I know what you've been thinking about me.
Tony, i'm sorry i've been so rough on you lately.
I got the job on one hand and this teacher-- i know.
Mom told me.
Yeah.
Dad, do you think i'm crazy?
Oh, no, tony.
I just think that vampires belong in a movie somewhere,
not in your room.
How did you know he's in my room?
I'm kidding.
Not very funny, right?
Kind of funny.
Let's play golf!
Okay, that's the spirit!
Let's set up again.
Rudolph!
Psst!
What?
Rudolph!
Can we go flying again?
No, it's too dangerous.
I only came because of this.
Hmpf! My drawing?
You can have it.
Where have you seen it?
Why do you wanna know?
It's very important.
I'll only tell you if you take me flying again.
Yippee!
Whoa-aa...
we live down there.
Cemetery?
Cool!
I could get used to that.
So you didn't see the real thing, then?
I dreamt it all.
The amulet... the comet... does it mean something?
I can't say.
It's a secret.
Who am i gonna tell?
Who's gonna believe me?
All right.
It is the comet attamon.
It's the comet of the lost souls.
It could mean
the end of this curse.
What curse?
The curse of being a vampire.
It is a piece of the comet that fell to earth.
A great magician made it into an amulet of power,
and we lost it,
300 years ago to the sea.
Yes, yes, i saw it!
My uncle von
tried to catch it... and we've never seen him since.
From that night to this, our wandering has never ended.
I'll help you find it.
That must be what my dream really means.
Yes, you're to join our quest.
We'll truly be brothers now.
Hide!
My parents are coming!
But we're brothers!
They don't know that!
Go!
Mama! Papa!
Rudolph! Thank the stars you're safe!
My son, you must not stray so far away.
We were afraid-- i was only taking the road less traveled.
You got lost.
My poor rudolph!
Yoo-hoo!
- Anna!
- Brother, darling.
You're
the nervy one... sneaking off like some daywalker.
I wish.
So, father, did you find the stone?
No, but i'm sure we're on the right path.
We still have
48 hours.
Well, you see, that's--
i will not fail you!
Gregory!
No, gregory!
He's my friend!
A mortal!
I'm rudolph's friend, and he gave me a bite-proof guarantee.
You could be anything to my son.
Victimizer, slave... dinner, perhaps.
But you can never be his friend.
He likes vampires, and he dreams about us.
Am i in your dreams, mortal?
And he knows
about the amulet.
Ah... then he's a spy.
Rookery's knave.
Darling, he doesn't look like a spy.
And besides, even rudolph couldn't make up such a story.
Could you, sweetheart?
Mortal or not, he's just a boy.
But if you insist on eating him, go ahead-- i never said i would.
It's impossible.
- Leave, i say.
- But, rudolph--
should've never
befriended you.
Leave, i say!
Aah!
Rookery!
Get back!
Get back!
Go!
Take the family!
Run!
Do as i say!
Stay away
from my family!
Do your worst!
The age of chivalry is not yet dead-- you!
What kind of bloodsucker are you?
Ow!
Tony, are you all right?
Look out!
Come on!
Aah!
Oh!
Wow.
Hey!
What's your problem?
None of your business, pal.
It is when it's in my cemetery.
Visiting hours are from dawn till dusk.
Now... get a move on!
What you did was foolish!
Foolish... but brave.
We shared a vision.
He has a sympathy for our kind.
Oh, lovely.
Young von found the stone... then made his way to scotland... plucked from the sea by a merchant ship just as rumor had it.
Then he could still be roaming free.
There was a woman i'd never seen before... she wore a strange coat of arms.
We must find which family she belongs to, trace her crest.
I can help.
No... it's too risky to involve a mortal.
What have we got to lose?
We've been searching for three centuries-- this is what comes from contact with mortals!
Disrespect! Insolence!
Frederick, he does have a point.
All right.
Help if you can, but do not think to change your mind and betray us to our most hateful enemy, or my wrath will be revealed.
Am i clear?
I think my father likes you.
That... was liking me?
I know he can seem like a real monster because he's so stern with us.
He is a monster.
But you don't know what it's like for us vampires to be so tormented.
Oh, yeah, i do.
It happens to me every day at school.
Who dares torment my friend?
Flint!
Flint!
Wake up!
Wake up!
I am the lord of the underworld.
I am your master.
It's tony thompson.
Get him!
I don't think so.
I am the fiendish friend of tony thompson.
If you do not treat him with respect,
you'll feel my wrath!
Tell anybody what you have just witnessed,
and you will be bat bait.
What on earth is going on in here?
Nothing.
Cora.
Nancy.
Sleep well last night, girls?
Carry these.
Yes, master.
In three months' time, the weather gods permitting, mcashton's will become scotland's calling card
to not only
the golf world,
but... playing games...
while corruption
festers beneath your feet?
Typical.
What do you mean, busting in here?
Much as i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,
you need to know.
You have an infestation of vampires.
Do you know who you're talking to?
I might ask you the same thing.
Obviously a madman.
I'll show him the door myself.
Obviously, a madman.
Now what's all this talk about vampires?
You don't seem terribly surprised, my lord.
Well, one has heard rumors.
Legends.
Nonsense, of course.
But wouldn't you like it sorted out once and for all by a trained professional?
In fact, by the only trained professional?
Now, i will admit that my fee is substantial.
Fee?
I have to pay you a fee? For what?
For putting an end to your worries.
And face facts, my lord, you do have worries.
Has there been any biting in town?
No.
Not to my knowledge.
Well then, show me a biting.
There'll be no question of fees until i see proof.
Now... leave.
They think this is still some kind of public service.
Afternoon tea... mm... very civilized, very... stags are deers with horns, right?
Male deers.
Yeah.
Lots of scottish crests have those.
- Lots?
- Yeah.
It means they descended from hunters.
So... tony, why so interested in crests all of a sudden?
It's sort of... a new hobby.
Tony?
What are you
really up to?
Mcashton has stags on his crest, see?
Can i have this?
Sure. Go ahead.
And, dad, can i go to work with you tomorrow?
Uh, it's saturday.
Yeah. Why?
To check out your project.
Great.
Will lord mcashton be there?
- He lives there, buddy.
- But don't let that stop you.
I won't.
Tony!
Well... be proud he finally has an interest in something normal.
Enough weirdness going on around here.
No wonder he's having nightmares.
What do you mean?
My presentation got interrupted today by a guy claiming the village was infested by vampires.
You're making that up.
What guy?
I've got no family.
No one to be with.
Just me and all these dead people.
I'll drink to that.
To dead people.
And... to the living dead.
Oh, come on.
You're either alive or dead.
There ain't no in-between, pal.
Unless you're a vampire.
Vampires?
Heh heh!
You must be joking.
I knew you'd laugh.
It's only natural.
But we've been hunting them for over 400 years.
That long?
It's a family business, you might say.
For a hunter, you wear an awful lot of jewelry.
This thing... the vampires have one just like it.
But with one small difference.
Theirs is designed to help them.
This is designed to send them straight to hell.
All i need is the stone, and the magic is complete.
Heh heh heh!
Now it's-- it's magic.
There is a whole other world out there... if you just know how to look for it.
What's that?
There.
What is it?
Ohh... we're in luck.
Come on!
Wha-what is this?
This wasn't here yesterday.
This? Oh, yeah.
I built this.
I'll explain it
later.
Now... it must've gone down here.
I'm going after it.
Wait!
It's my graveyard.
It's my job.
I'll do it.
Ahem!
Well, uh... if you insist.
But take
this safety line.
Not that i'll need it!
There you are.
Heh heh heh!
And... down we go.
Down i go... heh heh heh!
Yeah.
Whoa... come on... you know you want it.
Aah!
Oh, ha ha ha!
Yeah!
Oh, ho!
The line grows taut.
His heart pounds.
He knows what's on the other end of the line, and he relishes the fight!
Hey-- oof!
Let me down!
Here we come.
Yes!
Let go, gregory, let go!
It's a trap!
Gregory!
Let go!
Oh, yeah!
Mmm... here you come, here you come... bingo!
You bit him?
Just a taste.
Was it worth betraying your family?
Well, you're the traitor, forever denying the truth of us.
You've turned us into cowards,
skulking around
our holes like worms!
What would you have us do?
Fight back!
Make these mortals' blood run cold!
And you could do it, gregory.
You're young, strong, ruthless... and willing to risk a stake through the heart to prove it.
Better a stake than this prison!
Do you think me oblivious?
What does it matter to you what i think?
If i think?
It matters greatly.
I feel your sting.
But you are frederick the great.
You feel nothing!
Let there be light!
Run!
We've uncovered a whole flock!
Oh, thank you so much for your public spirit.
Aah!
Oh, my hero!
Wow.
Who did that?
Hey!
I found out about the coat of arms.
It's lord mcashton's, my father's boss.
The missing stone must be at his house.
Did you hear me, sir?
You barely saved my life.
He's very, very weak.
I know just what you need.
Now... i must find a place to hide you children.
You can stay at my house.
We need darkness,
dampness, and decay.
Then you need our cellar.
I'm sorry, it's-- perfect!
I need to go upstairs, but have a good day's sleep.
And don't worry, i'm on it.
On... on what, dear?
Finding the amulet, mother.
That's how we kids talk today.
Oh.
- Bye, dude.
- Bye, dude.
Bob.
Bob, i hear something moving.
I don't hear anything.
Tony might be having a nightmare.
Go check on him, poor little guy.
It's not my turn.
It is your turn.
Really?
Really.
Tony.
Hnn?
Oh.
I thought you were my dad again.
Don't be surprised.
I only want you to have this... it's from the old country.
It will bring you luck.
And if you ever need me, just whistle.
You know how to whistle, don't you?
Ohh!
Sweet mother in heaven!
Good morning! Hey... good morning, mom.
Wow, today's the day i get to go to work with dad!
Yeah, i know.
Why don't you invite rudolph?
He couldn't make it.
Ah, the mysterious stranger.
Oh, he's around.
Well, it would be nice to
meet him one of these days, maybe have his parents over for dinner.
Actually, they'd rather have you for dinner.
Either way is fine.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go.
Okay.
Lord mcashton.
Ah!
Take these, please.
Hey, i'd like you to meet my son tony.
Finally... little tony thompson.
Let's feel that firm american grip.
Shake lord mcashton's hand.
Tony's very excited to hear about your family history.
Aren't you, tony?
Uh... not right now, i'm not.
Well, it's
a noble history indeed.
The mcashtons have ruled in these counties since time... immemorial.
You'll have to excuse me.
Tony... you stay away from that guy.
He's crazy.
I told you not to come back!
Unless--
"unless" is exactly what's happened, my lord.
Aah!
Not the kind of holes that are good for the golfing business, eh, my lord?
A biting right here in mcashtonland.
And there'll be more... unless we come to some arrangement.
It's elizabeth...
and her demon lover,
isn't it?
They've returned.
I told you you had worries.
Oh, come in.
If we got up here... on 18... uh... yeah.
Now... if we can...
crest up, okay,
before the green, i think we can lose the sand traps from 18,
and that way... our ancestor, elizabeth mcashton.
The stone of attamon!
My grandfather told me the legend.
He said it was to die with me.
It could still happen.
She saw a ship...
foundered upon the rocks... though there had been no storm...
no sign of life.
No crew, save one
who crawled ashore
injured.
But he was no mortal man.
His name was von.
Von sackville-bagge.
A vampire.
Elizabeth was taken
by this von and became one of the undead herself.
And then what?
Our family staked her.
And von.
Warm-hearted bunch, aren't you?
You of all people
should understand.
I'm joking, my lord.
I would've done the same myself.
So where is she buried?
Why?
Like you said,
we want to know if
she's walking around.
If i was a mcashton, i wouldn't want her looking for me.
How do you like your stake, my lord?
Ha ha!
Boo!
You're blocking the lord of the underworld!
We-- we don't mean to!
I want you to crawl back to your room, get under the bed, and stay there!
Y-yes, lord underworld.
I said, crawl!
Ahem!
Allow me, my lord.
I'm an expert.
All part of the service.
Here.
She was moved.
But no one's been down here since mother died.
I'm talking about centuries ago, my lord.
And judging from what i see... the tomb is just here for show.
She's in an unmarked grave wrapped in chains with a wooden stake through her ribs, the coffin purified.
Why?
Well, do you really want your mom to be buried next to a vampire?
No! No!
I loved mother!
She always smelled of gardenias.
Oh, shut up.
Then they buried her in unhallowed ground, probably outside the churchyard walls.
That's acres worth of land!
Which is why i come equipped with state-of-the-art vampire locators that you're paying so dearly for, my lord.
The little vampire sympathizer!
Yaaah!
Aah!
Ohh... now... you've made your bed, now... you can sleep in it!
No!
Nooo!
You can't do that.
- Let me out!
- It's murder!
He's just a boy!
Thompson's son.
He's one of them.
I've seen them all together slithering in the night.
I must tell his parents!
Let me out!
Now... there are plenty of ways
to get your throat
punctured, my lord.
Don't make me be the one.
Let me out!
All right, j-just tell me what to do.
Right.
That's better.
Now, go away... and remember... what?
Tony's calling.
He could be in danger.
Maybe he's found the stone.
Let's go.
Oh, the drama-- shh!
Oh, dear!
The sun.
Daylight or not, we must go.
Where are you going?
You stay here.
Shh!
Left, right, left, right, left, right... left, right, left, right, left, right, left... left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right... tony!
Whoa--oh--stop.
What do you mean by running off like that today?
You had me worried sick.
Well, that's not good-- wait, i suppose... this is rudolph under here.
Okay.
Well, this isn't your fault, rudolph.
But when you get home tonight, tony thompson, we're having a serious talk.
Okay.
Well... go on and play your game... left, right... whatever it is.
Left, right, left, right... and what's that all about?
Tony ran off from work today
and i got
really worried.
But i was so happy
he was playing with a friend and not obsessing about vampires.
Amen, husband of mine.
Which means we get the afternoon alone.
Mm. I like this rudolph already.
His parents want to have us for dinner.
Tony!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Dude, you heard me!
I heard you, my hero, and i wrote you a poem.
Who did this to you?
Rookery.
We better find elizabeth's tomb before he does.
It's about the power of love.
Who's elizabeth?
The last holder of the stone.
The woman in my dreams.
"Your face saw i in the cemetery,
filled with fright... rudolph, look!
For the night was scary.
Still, you faced the foe
undaunted.
It was there... it wants to lead us somewhere.
It was you i wanted...
to hold me
when the winds are..." behind the pillar, look!
Hey!
It's a door.
A secret passage!
This could lead to elizabeth's grave.
I wish we had a better light.
Wait, rookery seems to have left this behind.
Thanks.
Gone. All of them.
They could've gone to the cliffs.
Tonight's the night.
Mortality beckons.
Gregory.
He's stolen the amulet.
He will crush
our hopes.
His final mockery.
No.
He's a rebel, but... but treachery is beyond him.
If he has taken the amulet... it's to make the call.
Then we should go to the cliff too.
I'm still very weak.
I would fall from the sky if i flew.
We'll find a way.
Not like him to stay out this late.
What's "like him" these days,
ever since he met
that rudolph?
I thought you liked him.
I never really met him.
Well, i mean, i did, but he was wrapped in foil.
I know, but we've
never even seen him
we've never met
his parents.
Probably foreigners.
Foreigners?
We are the foreigners.
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.
Or the coppers, whatever you call them.
Bobbies.
Yes, hi, this is dottie thompson.
I'm calling
about my son.
You can't
understand me?
You know what? Forget it.
I'll call you back.
I'm freda sackville-bagge.
That's... wonderful.
Rudolph's mother.
I'm sure you're worried about tony.
Tony?
Your son.
We know who he is.
We want to know where-- tony is going to the cliff with rudolph and anna to watch the comet.
Anna?
Our daughter.
Dare i say your charming young man has cast quite a spell on her.
Well, we think he's charming.
Frederick sackville-bagge.
At your service.
Hi.
How about it, bob?
Want to see a comet?
Sure.
Are... we supposed to be in costume, like you guys?
Costume?
Uh... shakespearean aristocratic thing like you guys?
I don't wear the costume of an aristocrat.
I am an aristocrat.
Okay.
Whatever.
We should hurry.
It's urgent.
Urgent?
Well, the comet is near.
Oh.
We must be near the cemetery.
Follow me.
To the ends of the earth, my darling.
Where's your car?
We flew.
Let's take yours.
Hold up, thompson!
I've got a job for you.
You might not like it.
Oh, we didn't like it
300 years ago, but we did our duty.
That's the point.
Duty.
One... two... three.
It's over.
What are you talking about?
One... two... three.
You have to drive this stake through tony's heart.
Oh, my!
No worries.
He's already dead.
He's a vampire, bob.
It's not easy for a father to hear, but your son's a bloodsucking fiend.
Okay, don't worry.
I'll handle this.
Take them.
You'll thank me in the morning.
I've had enough of all you people,
now drop that ax and take your leave.
Yeah, take your leave, or you'll be building your own golf course, buddy!
Right.
I'm leaving.
You hear that, dottie?
Oww!
I told him to take his leave.
You were wonderful!
Bob... the comet.
My lady.
Those aren't aristocrats.
Those are vampires!
Those are vampires!
Those are vampires!
We have to keep moving.
Time is running out.
We can't go any further.
Why not?
There's something ahead.
Some kind of curse.
You have to go first,
tony dearest.
I found it!
Go see what it is.
It's a curse.
Stupid chains.
Break. Break!
Come on!
We need a miracle.
The curse is gone! Yes!
Whoa!
It's elizabeth.
Uncle von.
Father was right.
He did come here.
Oh, how romantic!
Their love,
preserved forever.
The stone isn't here.
Up here!
Up here!
Ohh... getting away!
Get her! Get her!
Here!
The stone is in my room!
No wonder i had those dreams!
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Heh heh heh!
What?
What's happening?
The call.
You go to the cliffs.
We'll get the stone.
Okay, let's go.
Robert, could you drive a little faster, please?
Darling, do you hear?
Hear what?
The call.
It's gregory, our eldest son.
He's calling the clan.
Yeah.
Mother!
Father!
We found uncle von's grave.
I mean, tony found it,
and he saw the stone
in a vision.
He and rudolph are after it now.
May their quest be fruitful.
Thank you, gregory.
Something weird is happening here.
Bob!
Oh, guuah!
Aah! Oh!
Don't worry, everything is gonna be fine.
Okay, just stay calm.
Freda says we're gonna be fine.
Hi.
Uh... my name's bob... and this is my wife, dottie.
Good night for a gathering, huh?
Leave them alone.
They're friends.
What?
Since when?
Where is it?
Somewhere around here!
How do you know?
How do i know?
I have visions, dude.
No need to bite my head off.
Biting is your job.
Mine is to find the amulet.
We've got to find it.
Rookery!
♪ I'm coming... ♪ oh! Aw, boys... you've locked the door.
I found it!
The stone of attamon.
Hand it over.
It belongs to my friend.
No, no, no, no.
It belongs to me now.
Give.
Not without a fight.
Oh? Well, i can't be bothered.
Tony!
Don't give him the stone!
Aah!
Let me go!
Get in there!
Get out
of the way!
Get out of the way!
Give me that stone.
No!
I said give me that stone!
My friends need it.
Oh, boo-hoo!
I need it, laddie... what do you want?
You want this?
Well, come and get it.
Ngggh... yaaah!
Aah!
Yee-haa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aah!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, no, you don't.
Give me that.
Ha ha ha!
Tony, the lights!
Turn off the lights!
Hey!
You leave that alone!
Stop that!
Sit back!
Tony!
Hey! You!
Whoo-hoo!
Oh-oh-oh... whoa-aah... going... going... gone!
We have only a few moments more.
After all of our wandering... all of our waiting... i've left our fate in the hands of two small boys.
It's all my fault.
I won't even ask
your forgiveness.
I don't deserve it.
Rudolph.
You've got it.
All right!
Yeah!
Aah!
Yeah!
Tony's near.
Where?
What'd she say?
There!
In the sky!
Ready... hover!
Oh!
I think you've been looking for this.
He has the amulet!
The stone!
Thank you, my friend.
We must get a move on.
Tony!
Mom! Dad!
The stone of attamon is ours!
Ab ovo...
in toto...
nil desperandum...
sine die... hey... that's my blimp!
Aah!
Mom! Dad!
All right, that's it.
I don't think so.
Catch it, tony!
Aaaaah!
The ceremony!
Tony! You know what we want!
Wish it!
You have to
wish it... now!
What'd you wish for?
What else do you want?
Hey... it's me... tony.

It was a nightmare.
So many dead people.
So many victims.
It all started a few days ago...
when I came here for a rave.
And, now, all that remains
is the rotten smell of death.
You must stop Curien... or else something terrible will happen!
Nice. So, where are they, dude?
We're gonna miss the boat.
Greg and Simon.
Greg's the guy
I played ball with in college.
A good guy, if not a little goofy.
Simon. They say God doesn't give
with two hands, and they were right.
He got the looks,
but not much between those ears.
Cynthia... Greg's girlfriend.
Pure eye candy.
I'm Simon.
Karma. Thinks she's Foxy Brown.
She has a crush on Simon, but Simon
only has eyes for Alicia, my ex.
We broke up a few weeks ago
so I could study and she could fence.
She loves it.
I don't see what it's good for.
Anyone have one of those invitations with the map on it?
Are you sure this is where the boat's supposed to leave from?
Maybe Johnnie gave you the wrong info.
Yeah, hon.
I'm pretty sure.
It says here the boat doesn't leave until 5:00.
Yeah, and it's 5:15 now, Simon.
Shit. We're so fucked.
They missed the boat to the rave.
If only they decided
to stay back in Seattle...
they'd all be alive today.
Unbelievable. It's going on all weekend.
You gotta come.
And you'll never guess who's here.
Hello? The cell phone reception's for shit out here.
Hello, sweetie? I'm losing you.
Are you there?
Hello? Shit!
Now, where was it you wanted to take me to?
I was trying my best
to function as a single guy should.
But at the back of my head, something
was nibbling away at my subconscious.
Hello?
What you doin' over there?
Good evening.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You got yourself some sort of hearin' disability?
I asked you a question.
I've come to charter your boat, sir.
You do, huh?
Well, that's too bad...
'cause this here's a fishin' boat, not the Pacific Princess.
Why don't you try the yellow pages?
We gotta get to this party on an island, and we were hopin' to use your boat.
You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are ya?
I said, shove off!
Or don't you sprechen Sie Englisch?
Why don't you just name your price, and we can skip... the old-man-on-the-sea routine.
A man's gotta eat, right?
What part of"shove off" didn't you understand?
Hold it.
Geez. Who's the U-boat commander?
- What?
- How much?
$300 sound fair?
- About 600 might.
- Six hundred? No way.
No one is talking to you.
Where are you headed, girls?
- Huh?
- I don't know. We got this map.
It's somewhere in the San Juans.
You must know where that is, right?
You crazy?
- They crazy.
- No, I don't think so.
- Excuse me?
- I said, forget it.
Yeah, forget it. Forget it.
- That means stop talkin', start walkin'.
- Why?
Why? Why? Why?
They always ask "why."
You know what they call this island?
Isle del Morte.
Morte. That's Spanish for "death," in case you don't speak Mexican.
Well, listen, friend,
I got me an island to catch right here.
And if this is some lame attempt to hit me up for more cash...
It ain't.
There ain't enough cash in the world to make us go back there.
- Keep the cash. Keep the cash.
- Let's get out of here.
Fuck it. A grand.
What do you say 500 now, and another five on the way back?
You can be mighty persuasive if you wanna be, Mr...
- Simon Cruz. And you are?
- Kirk's the name.
Wait, wait. Captain Kirk?
Does that make him Mr. Spock?
I don't like no Captain Kirk jokes.
Now, let's shove off before you say something else you'll regret.
All right.
It's all good.
Cap'n! Cap'n!
I'm not goin'.
I'm not goin'.
There's evil spirits on that island.
You just get the deck lines and let me worry about the evil spirits, okay?
Ahoy there, Captain Kirk.
This is the
United States Marine Patrol.
Stand down and prepare
to be boarded, Captain.
Oh, shit!
What are you gonna do?
We have no choice.
We got to do what the lady says.
It'll delay our departure for a while, though.
Delay us?
For how long?
Well, I imagine they're looking for guns, drugs, who knows what.
It'll probably take 'em a few hours.
And that's only if they don't find nothin'.
How much to lose 'em?
Did you forget what today is?
You can lose them, right?
Sure I can.
Who's talking, Alexander Hamilton,
Ben Franklin or you?
- It's the second Friday of the month!
- Do it.
Just a routine inspection, Kirk.
Don't even think
ofleaving my harbor.
Heave to! Where the hell
do you think you're going?
Heave to!
This is Casper.
McGyvers and I are moving out. Over.
Hate to break this to you, kid, but I would have done it for free.
The lady needs to dine on a humble pie once in a while.
- So you've run into her before?
- Run into her?
Hell yeah.
She's had a hard-on for me... ever since we got out of the service... and I didn't start working for Uncle Sam like she did.
Can't blame her for still getting wet over me, can ya?
Sweet.
- Come on.
- Come on what?
Let's go swimming.
Now?
You're crazy.
You're pretty enough to eat.
- You're nuts, baby.
- Come on.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
That's cold, baby.
Come on, you big wimp.
No, you go.
You have a good swim, babe.
Yeah, fine.
It's fine once you get in.
Come on, Matt.
You're no fun.
He's heading out to
the San Juan Islands, Cap.
Just maintain speed and distance.
I don't want him to make us yet.
- Cynthia's such a trooper.
- Don't come near me.
Must've eaten something back at the...
You know what?
Whatever you say, baby.
- God, it's cold.
- I know.
Greg, you look like shit, man.
Here.
Have another beer.
This'll make you feel better.
On my face!
Oh, yeah.
- Get back here.
- Come on, Matt!
Come on, Matt.
Don't play games.
Matt, where are you?
What a mess.
What an idiot.
Did you get a real good peek there, perv?
I wanna give this to you.
- What's this for?
- It's for your protection.
It's okay.
I'm on the pill.
It'll ward off evil spirits.
It'll protect you and your friends from harm.
Whatever, Gandalf.
Matt, where are you?
I'm lost.
Where are you?
What is that?
What is this?
Are you in there?
Are you in there?
Is that you, Matt?
Oh, my God!
Hey, Cap, I can get
a little closer to 'em.
Yeah. Let's keep our distance
and see where he's headin'.
- Slow down, slow down.
- Come on.
Did you hear that?
- Shallow water!
- Okay, Salish.
Hey, guys, there it is.
Yes!
Yes! Finally!
Easy, now.
Almost there.
Shut it down!
- I'm so excited!
- Finally!
I know where they're docking. Drop me
off on the other side of the island.
- You want me to radio for backup?
- Nah.
I think I can handle Victor myself.
- Okeydoke.
- They're on their way.
What do you wanna do now?
Let's go. I found a spot for our merchandise.
Start unloading.
If Casper comes after us... she won't find anything left on board to arrest us for.
Yeah, right up here.
Wait. Wait.
Let me see that a second.
Well, you're obviously no cartographer.
- What?
- Come on. It's this way.
- Smart too, isn't she?
- Yep.
Smart enough not to get involved with the likes of you, bro.
- What's this?
- Come on.
- Smells like someone farted up there.
- Look at all these bubbles.
It's disgusting.
Seems like a storm's comin' up.
Maybe so.
But that's all right.
Keeps Casper off our ass if she tries coming after us... while we blow on out of here.
What about the kids?
We can't leave 'em alone.
This is a bad island.
I ain't waiting around for 'em, not if we have a chance to slip past Casper.
- You'd better keep unloading.
- All right.
Fine.
Then we'll come back next week when the heat is off, huh?
- You hear somethin'?
- No, nothing.
- Where is everyone?
- Come on, Karma.
I can't believe this.
It's their loss. We have this entire place to ourselves... to dance the night away, and I intend to put it to good use.
- I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
- You would say that.
Do you mind if everybody isn't miserable, like you?
Yeah, you know what?
I remember when she used to be fun.
When was that, kindergarten?
How funny.
You're funny.
I think something bad's happened here.
Like what?
Well, they sure as hell did not go to 7-11 to get more booze... because the keg is full.
- Right on.
- Cheers.
- Chin-chin.
- Salud!
- L 'chaim!
- Well, what the fuck?
Doesn't this bother any of you?
We're on the island where the rave of the year's supposed to be happening... but it's completely deserted.
Yeah, it worries me.
It worries me there aren't any mixers.
Simon cannot survive on Bud alone.
Speak for yourself, dude.
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go find out where everyone went.
Okay? Is anyone else coming?
Hell no.
Me and Cyn are gonna... groove to some funky tunes all night long, right, baby doll?
You know it, sugarplum.
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming with you.
I'm starting to get diabetes from all this "sugar, sugar" over here.
- What about you, Studly Doolittle?
- Three's not company in this case.
I think I'll join you.
Good. We need a big, strong man to protect us.
Problem is, there's never a big, strong man around when you need one.
All right, let's go.
Why do I always end up doin' this shit work?
Cap'n, is that you?
Hello, Cleveland!
- Cut it out.
- What? Why?
Because I said so.
Said so, huh?
Maybe I should just...
Wait, wait, wait.
I think I feel some rain coming.
Why don't we... I think it might...
I think it might rain.
Why don't we go somewhere where we won't get wet?
Too late.
Close the Velcro.
Beautiful Velcro.
- We are gonna do the humpity-bumpity.
- Come on, baby.
The humpity-bumpity!
- Yeah, baby!
- One, two, three!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if the others come back?
- I can be quick.
- What else is new?
Hey, don't...
Don't take it personal, Greg.
- A lot of men have these problems.
- I just gotta take a piss.
Not in here, you idiot!
Go pee in the bushes!
Christ, I just...
I just gotta go and take a piss is all.
- All this beer's gotta go somewhere.
- For God's sakes.
Be right back.
- Hello?
- It's so quiet.
It's a gorgeous night.
Why don't we play for a little while?
Shall we?
Why don't you just stick to playing with yourself for now?
- By the way, what's with the accent?
- I don't know.
Salish, are you done yet?
Better hurry back, baby.
Mama's gonna give it to ya.
Greg, you're scaring me.
Come on, baby.
- Will you get a load of that?
- What the hell is it?
Looks like it was built a millennia ago.
Simon, it's centuries.
Right. Well, that's what I meant.
Should we go in?
I am not going in there.
Unless there's a spa and a 24-hour room service, you're on your own, hon.
Well, are you coming, or am I going in myself?
Didn't you ever watch Scooby Doo?
This is so not a good idea.
I am completely not in favor of doing this.
Well, the candles are lit.
I mean, someone must be home.
Hello?
Alicia, watch out!
What the fuck?
What the hell are you doing here?
- Where is everyone?
- Shut the door!
You broke my glasses.
Great. Nice.
Okay, what is going on here?
We'll show you.
Come on.
I've got it on tape.
Sorry. I have a lot of footage here.
I'll just fast-forward.
Everyone was partying, you know.
Drinking and dancing and just hanging out, having fun.
And then these things came and they attacked the rave.
They started killing everybody.
Those of us that could get away did.
We ran. We finally got to the boat, but it wasn't there.
These things, they just kept coming and coming and killing.
We found this house.
We ran inside and tried to hide.
That's when you guys came.
We thought you were more of them.
"Them"? Who the hell is "them"?
"Who"? Try "what."
- Rudy, they were dead people.
- Okay, guys, you saw the tape.
Those are reanimated corpses just like out of a fuckin' Romero movie.
- A what?
- A Romero movie.
You know, like, the holy trilogy:
Night, Dawn and Day.
They say he's gonna make Twilight of
the Dead one day, but I doubt it.
Yeah, I find this all a little hard to believe.
It was a stunt.
It was part of the rave.
- It wasn't a stunt, Alicia.
- You know what?
Simon says let's get out of here and let the cops ask questions later... while we're kicking it back in Seattle selling our story to the Enquirer.
Sounds great.
You got a boat?
- Yes, down at the beach.
- Thank God.
Then let's not waste any more time yakking. Let's just go!
We can't. We still have friends back at the rave. We're not gonna leave them.
We gotta get out of here while we still can.
We're not leaving without them.
Okay. Let's go.
- So, you came with that girl?
- What?
Let me give you a tip. I don't think she's a natural red, white and blue.
Met her at the rave.
So, who's your boy over there... with the Tom Cruise smile and the Rain Man brain?
He just so happens to be the biggest underwear model in America.
Congratulations.
- That's great.
- You okay, Simon?
Sure.
Where the hell are they?
- Greg? Cindy?
- Please, do not do that.
You're being taken, Hugh.
This is all just one big practical joke.
If you'd been here, which you weren't, you wouldn't think it was a joke.
Believe me.
What is that?
I'm so not touching that.
Hold this.
Let's flip it over.
Liberty.
Holy... Dude, what the fuck happened to you?
I was in there, and then all of the sudden... the frickin'... the banging, and then the frickin' thing fell over.
And I was stuck inside. Shit!
- You're in deep shit, huh?
- That's very funny.
Get that fuckin'...
Who are you?
- Where's Cyn?
- I don't know, bro. You tell me.
We gotta go find her.
Where the fuck did that come from?
What is... Oh, my God!
What is... Cynthia!
What the hell was that thing?
Our best friend.
Not anymore.
She was like a wild animal.
Did you see here face?
Oh, my God!
- It's horrible!
- What happened to her?
Everybody hold on a minute.
Maybe I can get us some answers.
McGyvers, come in.
This is Casper.
Come in. Over. It's out.
I'm not getting anything on the radio.
Anyone have a cell phone?
We already tried. It's not working.
- There's some sort of interference.
- Look, I don't know what's going on.
What I do know is I've gotta get you all off this island.
- How did you get here?
- On a boat like everyone else.
But it's gone.
It's been destroyed.
We didn't. We came in the Lazarus with Kirk.
- Where is he?
- He's in the inlet down at the beach.
- Can you take me to him?
- Are you gonna arrest him?
Not at the moment.
Right now...
I just wanna get you all as far away from here as possible.
Sounds like a plan to me.
I am so fucking scared, Simon.
I know. Me too.
I just can't believe Cynthia's dead.
I'm so sorry, Alicia.
Quiet, everybody.
Everyone, quiet.
Shit!
Can we go home now, please?
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
- Move it!
- Let's go!
Go!
- Oh, shit!
- Kirk!
It's gotta be down here!
It's gotta be down here!
- All right.
- Where is it?
- Oh, God, that's not Kirk.
- Simon!
- Don't jump in the water!
- Simon, don't!
- No, don't!
- Simon, don't go!
- Swim, Simon!
- Swim!
- Look out!
- Go, go, go!
Get out of the water, Simon!
Shoot him!
Rudy, behind you!
Swim, Simon! Swim!
No! Liberty!
Shoot it!
What do you think I'm trying to do, you fucking moron?
Come on.
Come on.
Fuck! You fucking zombie bastards!
You're not gonna fuck with us again, are ya, asshole?
Are you? Are you?
- My face!
- You all right? Let me see.
Let me see.
Could I have your coat?
- Oh, fuck!
- Here, let me see it. Let me look.
Fuck!
- Let me see it.
- Are you a doctor?
- Hardly. He's premed.
- I'm in med school.
At least you're not pre-law.
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.
- Is that a bite?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Hmm?
I've gotta get back to the patrol boat.
I can get on the radio and get us help.
Wait. Are you just gonna leave us here while you go looking for the cavalry?
- You're coming with me.
- Me? Why me?
Are you a doctor?
Are you wounded?
- Can you use a gun?
- Well, I can...
That's why you.
The boat should be a mile or so up the beach.
We'll climb aboard and come back for help. Understood?
- Come on.
- Greg. My name's Greg.
Come on, Greg!
- Hey, what the hell were those things?
- I don't know.
But what I do know now is why they call this island Isle del Morte.
You gotta do this.
You gotta do this.
There must be some kind of scientific explanation for this.
Liberty's right.
They gotta be some kind of mutation.
Yeah, from what? The shrinking ozone?
What, too little sunscreen?
Rudy, give me a break.
These are zombies pure and simple.
The sooner we accept it and deal with it... the better chance we have of getting out of here alive.
Your first mate seemed to know something about this island. What was it?
- Nothing but an old wives' tale.
- Like the walking dead?
Well... best I reckon, the story goes...
there was once some
crazy Spanish padre...
who was banished from Spain...
hundreds of years ago.
His name was Castillo Sermano.
You asked to see me,
Father Castillo?
Come closer, Captain.
I cannot see your face.
Are you afraid, Captain?
You know why
I was banished from Spain?
Your experiments are not of God.
God?
What has God done for you, or for me?
Nothing.
There is no God.
There's only me.
May he have mercy on your soul.
The Spanish were trying from falling...
the sands into the limeys.
They never made it to the garrison.
They say he murdered the crew of the St. Cristobol... enslaved the natives of this island, and killed whoever came here ever since.
Some say he still does.
- I'm sorry I asked.
- If you ask me... it's just a bunch of smugglers and cutthroats... looking for ways to scare people off.
Well, you would know, wouldn't you?
What can I say?
They're doing a hell of a job, ain't they?
What is it?
- I can't hear anything.
- Neither do I.
Run! Run!
We can't stay out here like this.
We're too vulnerable.
I know, but we can't leave until Greg and Casper get back.
We gotta get back on that boat, but there's no way I'm goin' in that water.
We can't. It's too far. Besides, we don't know what's still on that boat.
What about that house?
It's defensible.
We'll have shelter.
Okay, it's a good idea. We make a run for it as soon as they get back.
What if they don't come back?
What then?
- They'll come back.
- Yeah, but what if they don't?
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any weapons or food.
- I mean, we don't have shit.
- Actually, we do.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- This is why Casper's on your ass?
- You're smuggling Cuban cigars?
- Among other things.
Still hard at work smuggling,
I see, Victor.
Don't you just wish you could prove that, Jordan?
- What are these then?
- We just found them on the beach.
- Right.
- Crazy, huh?
I'm not gonna worry about that right now. We've got bigger problems.
My patrol boat's been destroyed.
My first mate is missing.
- What about Greg? Where is he?
- Yeah.
I don't think he made it.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone. I'm sorry.
We gotta go back there and look for him.
Maybe there's a chance he's okay.
- We can't just leave him out there.
- He's dead.
If you don't wanna end up like him, shut up and listen to what she's saying.
What else you got in there besides smokes? Anything useful?
Let me introduce you to my little friend.
And who said size doesn't matter?
Nice. But mine's bigger.
Mossberg 500.
Stainless shotgun with incendiary shells.
Saving the best for last.
Here you go.
Take it.
Good choice.
Desert Eagle.
I like the way you think, girl.
We can't stay here for long.
Those creatures are everywhere.
We talked about making a run for it to that house that we found.
That sounds like a good idea. We can hole up in there until help arrives.
If help arrives.
Don't worry. When we don't report in, the marine patrol will come for us.
Everyone know how to use their weapons?
- Shit!
- We're gonna have to make a run for it.
- What if they're already inside?
- That's a chance we have to take.
We can hold up a lot better in there than we can out here.
- Once they spot us...
- Oh, God!
Over here!
- The door's locked!
- You gotta be kidding me!
We could blow the door. But there won't be enough left to keep them out.
Forget it.
We'll find another way.
- We need more ammo!
- We haven't got any.
- I'm down to my last clip.
- Yeah, me too.
I'm saving mine for myself.
Are you okay?
Watch out!
- The window!
- Can you get through, Rudy?
Yeah. Come on!
Oh, shit.
Die, you son of a bitch!
Pull! Hurry!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Casper? Look at me.
Casper, look at me.
I need you to look at me.
Okay? Look at me.
Look at me.
You saved us, okay?
You saved us.
Shit, I'm out!
Fuck.
Let's get him to that table!
See if we can find something to use as a bandage.
Simon, we should check for more of them.
- Sorry.
- Where's Casper, Rudy?
She didn't make it.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay, Captain, this is gonna hurt.
Do it. Do it!
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Give me a light.
- Here.
Fuck. Oh, shit.
Don't look at me.
I'm the fuckin' Elephant Man.
- I think we should...
- Just get away from me.
I don't need your help.
- Hang in there, Kirk.
- All right, all right, all right.
Just get some rest.
- Is he gonna end up like Cynthia?
- I don't know.
What do you think's gonna happen to us?
- Does it matter?
- It does. It matters to me.
I mean, are we even gonna get out of here?
Even if we get out of here,
I'm finished.
Who's gonna be able to look me in the eyes with a face like this?
I'm a freak.
I belong in the fuckin' circus.
Don't talk like that.
I happen to think you've been very brave tonight.
And I still think you're pretty damn sexy.
You're not just doing this to make me feel better, are you?
I'm doing this to make me feel better.
It's so quiet.
Yeah, it's almost too quiet.
- Look at this.
- What?
Where are they dragging them?
What are they doing with the bodies?
I got a bad feeling.
What happened?
- Rudy, what happened?
- Why does it matter what happened?
She's dead. I didn't save her.
- It's not your fault.
- It was my fault!
It was my fault!
Were you here?
Did you see it?
Did you see... watch them rip her apart?
You know what?
You know what?
It's not gonna happen again.
We're gonna get out of here.
It's Kirk. You need to take a look at him. He's getting worse.
Okay.
How you doin', Captain?
- I wouldn't mind a drink.
- Okay.
That's all we got.
Not exactly what I had in mind, but thanks just the same.
Guys, check out this book.
It looks pretty old.
Maybe it'll help us.
Well, that cuts it.
I'm either gonna get better or I ain't.
In any case, you have no agua, a fistful of ammo left and zero rations.
Maybe it's time you stopped babysitting me... and started worrying about yourselves a bit more.
- What'd you have in mind?
- Check out the rest of the house.
See what you can scrounge and where you can fortify yourselves better.
There's no telling what's coming through that door next.
Maybe there's another way out of here.
You guys, this looks like a ship's journal.
According to the officer's logs, it says
Castillo Sermano killed the captain... then beached the ship and lit it on fire.
So the stories that Kirk told us make sense now.
You'd better go now. Go.
You're right.
- You gonna be okay?
- Just fine.
If not, I've always got this.
The captain's right. We gotta get out of here and search the rest of this house.
Let's go.
Let's start with the courtyard.
What is all this?
What's in there?
- I can't...
- It's locked?
- What...
- Oh, my God.
This is sick!
Sorry.
This is unbelievable.
- Why aren't these zombies alive?
- I don't know.
Rudy, take a look at this.
It's blood.
It's blood?
Yeah, but... it's not human, though.
It's like it's...
It's like it's been mutated.
I've never seen anything like it before.
It's completely unnatural.
It's fucking genius.
I'm not gonna let Salish live like one of them.
Kirk, where are you?
What are you doing?
They're gonna kill you.
I'm dead already.
See you in hell, boys.
Everybody get down! Now!
Get out of here! Everybody!
- We just need to...
- Lock the door!
Hurry, hurry!
What?
- What is that?
- Son of a bitch! It's gunpowder.
Well, it's a good thing.
We can use it, right?
The only way we can use it is if we blew it up, and...
No, it's useless, because someone would have to be here to...
I'll go to the lab.
I'm gonna see if I can find something.
I'll go with you.
Let's see.
What is this?
What happened?
Karma, no!
Oh, my God, it's the blood!
It brings 'em back to life!
Go!
Here!
Here, use this!
- Let's move this!
- Board it up with this!
They're breaking through!
Come on!
You guys, there's a door!
Get down! Go!
Simon, come on!
Just go!
Shit!
Where the hell are we?
Must be some kind of catacomb underneath the house.
Sorry, Karma.
This must be how they shift supplies from the ship to the house.
If that's the case, then one of these tunnels lead to the beach somewhere.
Let's go.
I'm out.
- Have they gone?
- I hope so.
Listen. Be quiet.
Let's go.
- Go! Go!
- Go, go, go, go!
- I'll take care of these guys.
- Karma, no!
Get out of here! Hurry!
Hurry!
- Greg, what are you doing here?
- What is this room?
Greg, we thought you were dead.
Greg, say something.
Alicia, get away from him.
That's not Greg! Get away!
Get off me!
- Oh, God!
- What do they want with us?
On the table.
On the table!
Hold him down.
Hold him down!
Your body parts... they will serve me well for a long time.
Beautiful.
The blood we found, it ties all the creatures.
You created it all so you could be immortal. Why?
To live forever.
It works.
After all these years, it finally works.
The blood lives like I said it would.
Fantastic.
Did you hear what I said?
It works.
I'm going to live forever.
Forever.
I will never die.
You think you can kill me?
I will live forever.
Forever!
Your skin.
So beautiful.
I've been waiting for you... for a long time.
What do you want?
I just want your flesh.
Run! Come on!
- Fuck, that was close!
- I can't believe what just happened!
Isn't it nice to know someone wants you for your body?
Yeah.
Depending on what they want.
We gotta get to the beach.
Come on.
Fucker!
Fuck you!
Game over, fucker.
Oh, my God.
Maintain perimeter.
"G" and I are proceeding inside.
Advise of any contact with reanimated
Homo sapiens. Maintain alpha alert.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
We're here to rescue you.
- Thanks.
- Is she okay?
Does she look okay?
What's your name?
Rudolph.
You got a last name?
Curien.
I feel guilty
because of what happened.
It was a nightmare.
So many dead,
so many victims...
and people that were my friends.
And now we go home...
me and Alicia.
Or whatever she is now,
whatever I've created.
God, ain't love a bitch?
Is this the end,
or only the beginning?

Have you ever done it with your dad?
You want to know the truth about teens today.
They tell the future of Japan.
That hopeless future.
Do you do this a lot?
Do what?
This.
Why are you here?
Work.
I told you to stop.
I said stop it!
Is it on?
I can't do this.
Touch me.
Wait.
This is wrong.
You're hard.
No.
Yes you are.
Wanna do it?
50,000 yen to do it. A blow is three.
I play with myself for two.
Video's an extra three.
Five to do it.
This is wrong.
We can't do this.
No fooling around on the job.
Hurry up and get undressed.
Take off your clothes.
Stop it, will you?
Don't do that at work!
Are you sure?
Ow!
That feels so good!
What's that?
You smell so good.
Let's fuck!
This is incredible! It's too much!
Here I go!
That's good.
I'm coming in you!
I'm coming!
Ow!
This is no good.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
You can't tell anyone.
Early bird.
What?
You came too soon!
Does it matter?
Early bird!
Stop saying that!
Is this a hard job?
How much?
- 100,000 yen.
100,000 yen?
Coming early is 100,000.
Have you had many guys?
Just you.
You're lying. Liar!
I only have 70,000 yen.
I don't believe this!
I'll give the rest to your mom.
Promise to keep this a secret, ok?
It's our little secret, promise?
Whatever.
It's our little secret, okay?
You should stop doing this.
You should study in your spare time.
It's been on the whole time!
What for?
Early bird!
Stop it!
You're all hard. You want to do it, don't you.
Have you ever been hit on the head?
Have you ever hit your mom?
That's the wrong brush!
I told you what brand to get!
Do you want to my gums to bleed!
Don't fuck with me!
Please, not my face!
Bitch!
No Entry
Takuya!
Takuya!
See you tomorrow.
You'd better be at school!
Organic Kale Extract
More.
I want more.
Thanks.
Get with it!
This is my friend.
He'll stay here a while.
Go ahead, don't care about me.
What are you waiting for?
Why are there commercials showing?
I went out. I'm sorry.
I told you to stay at home and work nearby the TV!
I'm sorry!
Shut up, bitch!
Ow! I had business!
I'm off to bed.
Good night.
I'll do it right next time!
Shut up!
Ow! I'm sorry! Don't hit my face!
Fuck your face!
Don't hit my face!
Not my face!
Good evening, I'm Asako Murata.
I'm Masashi Shimizu.
The newborn raccoon at the zoo got a new name yesterday.
Her name is Helen.
Could I have some ice?
Isn't she cute!
Just a little.
There has been a fierce discussion between ruling party members... following the Prime Minister's off-color remarks... at a reception yesterday.
Take off your pants.
What?
Want to do it?
What? Is there something wrong?
Not tonight. I'm not feeling well.
I don't feel good.
You forgot something.
You're so neat!
I'm impressed.
Stop it!
Come here.
There's a girl's room downstairs.
Whose is it?
My big sister's. She left, but her room is still there.
Really.
Don't look like that.
Excuse me.
I'm doing a report about young people today.
Say what?
Hey, are you putting this on tape?
Stop recording immediately!
Didn't you get it?
No more recording!
What the fuck...?
Howl, bitch! Let me hear you howl!
You look good, old fart!
Pretty good!
"I'm interviewing people."
Sounds good.
I'm done.
See you later.
Perfect.
Have a nice day.
I'm off.
Welcome.
Good morning.
Thanks for coming.
What happened?
I don't know. I got hit twice.
Maybe some of those young punks again.
May I take your order?
Coffee please.
What's up? We agreed not to meet for a while, right?
I've got an idea that's guaranteed to boost ratings.
Another one?
This one's for real.
A bullied son and his father.
That's nothing new.
That's not all.
Don't you remember the scandal?
You need to get away from work.
You even showed that video.
Remember what a fool it made of you?
This time I'm covering my son.
I'm the father.
What?
It can't get any truer than this.
I mean, this is the real thing.
Here's the title.
I'm going to call it "True Bullying".
I thought it was strange.
A nice lady like you turning tricks.
You know, it's different with someone who limps.
Is that so?
They feel different inside.
You know what I mean?
It's difficult to explain.
I wonder what yours looks like.
I didn't get a good view at it before.
Beer?
- No, thanks.
Who did this to you?
What is all this? Does it hurt?
It looks really bad.
You should go to the police.
I mean, a woman like you...
Does he beat you if earnings are down?
How much is it?
30,000 yen would be enough, right?
Could you whip me with this one?
It's fine. Hit me again.
That's good.
More. Go on please, whip me as hard as you like.
Welcome back.
I'm home.
What do you want?
Why don't you... take a little rest here?
How did you make me do that?
It's amazing!
This is so good.
It's so crispy, so crunchy.
Just look at this.
Look at the juice.
It's out of this world.
I want some more.
Okay.
And this is great too.
Here you go.
What is all this?
Someone's birthday?
No.
Bitch!
Ow! That was hot!
I said leave my face alone!
Come out!
Takuya!
They're here!
Everyone, can you see this?
Can you see this?
Everyone, this is my home! My home!
Did you see that?
The big strong bullies are here!
This is my wife!
She's a lovely little wife!
Dinner was delicious!
This is... I don't know who this is!
We're not acquainted!
This is my home!
Watch! It's amazing, truly amazing!
What a scene!
My wife threw this knife!
This is it! How should I feel?
I don't know how a father should feel!
But I know my family is being destroyed!
So what do you think? How do we judge this wonderful bullying?
I'm burning! I just saw fireworks in my head! It's hot, so hot!
What's taking you so long?
Hurry up and shit!
Take a shit, you little turd!
-l don't want to!
Think you have a choice?
Dump it!
Hurry up and shit!
Answer me when I speak to you, fucker!
What are you doing?
You're filthy!
This is nothing.
They're just beating him up.
Don't you mind getting hurt?
If that happens, I want you to go in.
That'll be the main story.
You're the brave girl reporter entering the spotlight.
Here's the plan.
You better listen, too!
Zoom in on Takuya if he's in danger.
Then zoom out, slowly.
I want a close-up of her expression.
Can you look really determined?
Then I open the door slowly, and start walking over powerfully.
I'll stare at them the whole time.
I'll yell "Stop!" as hard as I can.
This is stupid!
- What's up?
You can't use it.
Why not?
Think about what you're taping.
Stop it! Who the hell are you?
He asked me to come.
What's wrong with you?
I'm fed up with this.
- What?!
I don't love you.
I just feel sorry for you.
I can't stand you any longer.
I thougt you liked my idea!
What happened?
I want to go home.
Let go of me!
Hey, wait!
Who do you think you are?
Bitch!
Stop it!
It's because I come too early!
Just because I come too early. Bitch!
That's why I'm full of hot air.
It's very simple.
You like it that much?
You like them to last, huh?
Is extensive sex really that good?
Huh?!
I'll give you an extensive screw!
Come on, hold still!
Take off your clothes!
Now!
Fuck you, bitch!
Don't you fuck with me!
Always laughing at everyone!
Look, this one will last long enough!
Come on, get your clothes off!
Okay, now you will come!
I'm screwing you, long and hard!
Come on, pant! Pant, bitch, pant!
I want to hear you moan!
Moan like if you're enjoying it!
Let's do it long and hard!
I'll do it long. Long and hard!
What happened? Come on, make a noise!
Make a sound, do it!
We got a lot of things to do.
Follow me. Let's go!
Ready? We'll chop her in small pieces and put them in a plastic bag.
Keep taping until we throw her into the garbage.
Get a bin liner! Hurry up!
You can see it, can't you?
We can't have that.
Bin liners?
Here you are.
Wait a second. Look, I learned how to squeeze them myself.
I realized something when you were holding me.
I'm not special or pathetic.
I'm just an ordinary woman.
Look,see how they're squirting?
Do you see it?
Look how much comes out!
See how they're squirting?
We'll make a straight cut from the shoulder.
Then scoop out the breasts.
The nipples, too.
We'll draw on her arms here, and cut them at the wrists.
Her legs will come next.
Let's cut them off right about here.
Beautiful.
I've been covering how my son gets beaten up.
This has allowed me to explore my feelings as a father.
I never knew how
I really felt inside.
But now I finally understand.
It was neither anger nor sadness.
I felt it right here, and I wanted to have sex.
Some things are truly strange.
Come on, let's do it.
I don't care if you're a corpse.
Corpses are good enough for me.
Let's do it extensively and hard!
Here I come. Are you ready?
Don't be nervous.
I haven't felt like this in ages.
I'm nervous, too.
Shit, I can't undo my buttons!
This is good, really good.
I like how you've gotten all tight.
Everyone, what do you think now?
Here's a father whose son gets beaten up.
Here is a real father whose son gets beaten up. Isn't it wonderful?
What do you think?
This feels so good!
I'm going to come early again!
That's no good!
I can do it, I can do it!
Just watch me do it!
I'm really doing it!
Here I go!
Yes, you're wet! You got wet!
You're dead, but you're all wet!
The mysteries of life are amazing!
Even a corpse can get wet!
This is amazing! Amazing!
Hey, this is shit!
It's not a mystery of life, it's shit!
What the fuck did you eat?
You stink!
God, do you stink, bitch!
You wanna do this? God, do you stink!
You're dead, and you still want to fuck with me.
Do you want to shit on me, bitch?
Ow! What the hell...?
Why'd you get so tight?
Is it rigor mortis? This is no good.
I can't pull him out! What the hell...
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck do I do?
Hey, Keiko!
Keiko!
Keiko! Help!
Help me, Keiko!
Vinegar
Keiko! Help!
Are you sure this will really help?
They say it softens your body.
Wouldn't warm oil be more effective?
At least it would be easier to clean up afterwards.
Ow, it hurts!
Keiko, please do something!
I don't have a choice, do l?
Wait a second.
Excuse me.
What's up with her? She hasn't been that resolute since we got married!
You don't understand a thing.
Understand what?
Ow! She's even getting smaller!
Give me your arm.
What for?
- Just give me your arm.
Stick out your thumb. Hold on tight.
What's in the syringe?
Don't worry.
Ow!
Perfect!
I got out.
There... Aren't you happy now?
Rolling!
This is my wife Keiko.
Okay, let's put her down here.
She's getting stiffer and stiffer.
Keep filming! Get this part.
She's beautiful. This is really good.
She's so stiff.
What's wrong? Do you want a leg?
Do you like this part more?
No. She smells.
She smells?
You're right, she's started to stink!
You promised to bring it today!
Wait!
Why are you running away?
Just look at yourself!
They're here... They're here!
They're all here! Do your best!
Is the battery charged?
Okay, come on!
Here we go!
One more!
It's just like a big party!
"This product contains no fragrance."
This deodorizer doesn't smell.
Not bad, and it's only silica gel.
Sounds too good to be true.
That's enough. Let's go inside.
Look at him!
He's all yellow, he's beautiful!
We can't take care of them all at once.
We'll work steady, one by one.
I marked her. Slice her wrists, then chop off this joint.
Then take the bone inside...
Slice the skin...
What's wrong?
From today on, I'm going to study.
I have to pass some entrance examinations next year.
Is that so?
Tell me why you really came to our place.
You came to destroy it, didn't you?
That's what I thought all the time.
Thank you.
Her belly's softer than her head.
Of course it is!
She's squirting just like you!
Would you look at that!
Her entrails start appearing.
They're beautiful.
The white parts are so white...
She's resolving!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'll wash it for you afterwards.
Hey!
Want to have sex?
You get a special discount for being good-looking.
A screw costs 30,000 yen; a blow job 20,000. What do you say?
I need money.
The sea's so endless
You can't see anything.
The waves build up slowly, then they start to break.
There are tiny bubbles everywhere.
They're born, sparkling and shinig in the sun.
They move around slowly, they're floating and sinking.
They kiss and become one and then they float apart.
They slowly grow, then they burst... and sink back into the sea.

Aah!
Oof!
I don't need any help.
You're welcome.
Aah!
Unh!
Yaa!
Aah!
[screaming]
Come on!
He can wait.
Woman: Then fire them.
In fact, get rid of the whole division.
I don't care what Luthor would have done.
I'm in charge now, and if you can't accept that, I'll...
Mercy.
[groaning]
Help me.
I'm... I'm...
Sick?
Dying?
And you couldn't do it somewhere else?
After all I've done for you.
You mean letting me, a lowly chauffeur, run your company while you were away?
Oh, was I flattered.
But then I realized there was no one else you could trust to give it back...
Only me, your loyal dog.
Well, let me tell you something.
This dog took LexCorp out of the hole you dug and brought up the stock 38% all on her own.
So if you think I'm ever gonna let you...
Unh!
[gasping]
Looks like there's some life in the old suit after all.
Now where's professor Ivo?
[gasping]
I... I fired him.
You what?
He was one of our best scientists.
How could you do that?
Well?
I... I was trying to save money.
He's probably at his place in mountain view.
Unh!
Good girl.
[breathing heavily]
[screaming]
Superman: G.L.'s already patrolling the city, and Hawkgirl will join him as soon as we're done here.
Batman and I are going to follow up some leads, but I just don't know if it'll be enough.
So... A psychic sweep.
Of the whole city.
Is it possible?
I've never tried anything like that before.
Once the gate is opened, it might not be so easy to close.
I realize it's a lot to ask, but Luthor...
I know.
He must be stopped.
Smart guy.
Ivo, it's Luthor.
You've got to help me.
Will you get up? I'm d...
[gasp]
Looks like the cigarettes finally got you...
And maybe me, too.
[gasp]
Well, what are you waiting for?
It's not like I won't be dead soon enough, anyway.
Woman, thinking: I want him to love me...
But I don't think he even likes me.
Man: I wish she'd wear some vinyl.
Different woman: I smell bad.
I just know it.
20 showers a day.
I still can't get rid of it.
Man: Bald?
How could anyone say I'm bald?
I just have a high forehead.
Different man: I should ask her out,
but what would she want with me?
But I should try, though.
Woman: Rotten kids.
They don't appreciate me.
Man: I just need a roof over my head.
That's all...
And a drink. Yeah.
Woman: It's funny.
[all talking at once]
[voices stop]
[breathing heavily]
[all talking at once]
Man: I'll sue the pants off him!
Woman: I'll take him for everything he's got!
Man: She thinks she's so special.
Woman: What do I have to tell anyone?
Man: Looks like a gorilla.
[all talking at once]
[groaning]
Aargh!
A little help here.
When will professor come back?
Never.
He has to.
You miss him.
So do I.
He was one of my best friends.
He was?
Almost like a brother, and he would have wanted me to look after you if anything ever happened to him.
So... You're going to take care of me now?
Mm-hmm.
But you're going to have to take care of me, too.
Otherwise, I'll go to sleep and never wake up again.
Thank you.
Now, there's one other thing I need...
Fuel.
[buzzer]
Stay back, freak.
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Whoa! Whoa!
Hold it, big boy.
Yah!
Now, what did you want this for?
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Aah! Unh!
Mmm.
Aah!
[door opens]
[door closes]
Well, it looks like Ivo was right on the money.
His duplication program seems to be working rather well.
I assume you ran into Hawkgirl?
Girl with wings. Yes.
And seeing that you were able to get away with this,
I take it she didn't fare too well.
Is she still alive?
Yes.
Aww.
What's wrong?
Let me tell you a story.
It's about a young man whose dream was to build a great empire.
He succeeded.
Then he lost it all because of 7 very bad people...
Hawkgirl and her friends...
The Justice League.
That young man was me, of course, and now I have another dream.
It's to take back control of that empire.
And then, when the time comes,
I want to hand it down to someone who will continue my work...
The son I never had.
But none of that can happen until you give the Justice League what they deserve.
Mercy: He's the most deeply twisted man
I've ever met.
Of course I'll help you.
Good. If he contacts you, let us know.
You have my word.
He hasn't already contacted you, has he?
Don't you think I would have told you?
The two of you were very... Close.
I'm a different person now.
Right.
She was a little too cooperative, wasn't she?
You're learning.
I wouldn't mind hearing what she's really thinking.
[all talking at once]
Superman on radio:
J'onn? Any luck yet?
No.
Where are you?
I can't talk now.
Are you all right?
Leave me alone!
Grr!
It was some kind of android.
It had wings built into it and a mace, too.
Scary, huh?
Sounds like whoever made it had you in mind.
Yeah. It even acted like me.
Now, that's scary.
The android...
It's about 10 feet tall, gray skin?
How'd you know?
Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
Aah!
Ohh!
[sirens]
Aah!
You forgot to mention he's as strong as I am.
Hawkgirl: He wasn't like that before.
Aah! Aah!
Unh!
Ooh!
Unh! Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
[groans]
Unh!
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Hah!
Unh!
Unh!
[telephone ringing]
Ohh!
Ohh...
[grunting]
Another business call?
She fired Ivo months ago, and he's an M.D., something Luthor should be needing right about now.
One more thing...
Ivo's specialty is nanotechnology.
Green Lantern: Batman, it's Lantern.
We've found Hawkgirl's robot.
Where are you?
Don't even think about it.
Somehow this thing's copying all our powers just by looking at us.
We can't just stay here.
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
You come here, and all you'll do is make him even stronger.
Aah!
Lantern!
Unh!
Unh!
Hera help us!
She'd better.
No one else can now.

{114615}{114699}... but only kills student film, |, there may be a link.
{114701}{114737}But I can not find it.
{114739}{114825}You I'm excluded.
{115071}{115192}dissertation Brothers film. | All the victims were participating in it.
{115355}{115380}Right.
{115566}{115631}That's horrible.
{115634}{115695}How can it be worked Travis | by Anie film?
{115796}{115836}I think I see something.
{115951}{116002}- This is the link. | - And?
{116416}{116454}This is a reliable link.
{116457}{116559}Look, here's the tape. | Last picture film related ...
{116562}{116621}... the first picture | where participants are shown the film.
{116623}{116678}- It is not normal? | - Yes.
{116707}{116761}This is a bit of the final product.
{116783}{116857}This is a copy negative. | Film should not be cut and cemented together again.
{116859}{116925}Someone has changed the last part of the movie, | where players are shown?
{116958}{117070}Someone has changed the last part of Travis' film.
{117091}{117147}Yes, it would appear as if it were from someone else?
{117159}{117242}Only one person from that team | is still alive.
{117309}{117346}Oh, my God.
{118022}{118070}Mayfield? What the -
{118171}{118221}Okay, okay.
{118247}{118281}What do you want?
{118892}{118925}Travis.
{119031}{119068}This will keep it.
{119077}{119119}What happened to Toby?
{119162}{119211}It's like watching a ghost.
{119450}{119492}Professor Solomon?
{119495}{119548}You can talk with them? They have a gun -
{119550}{119581}Shut up!
{119687}{119720}Travis?
{119746}{119780}Professor.
{119786}{119816}But I thought -
{119818}{119890}Thank you for coming, Professor Solomon.
{119940}{119978}I'm really sorry.
{120025}{120075}You better sit back.
{120136}{120183}Take a chair professor.
{120220}{120258}Why the gun?
{120358}{120407}It is a fake.
{120410}{120441}Oh, my God.
{120487}{120525}What is going on here?
{120533}{120610}Toby stole my movie | and add closed captions to it.
{120663}{120766}Is that it; that makes it all happen? | No laskajta you.
{120781}{120887}Step back. Travis, why the disguise? | I thought you were dead.
{120889}{120923}And we have thought.
{120927}{120984}Tobiah film has failed.
{120986}{121056}He knew that my good | because he worked as a sound recordist.
{121058}{121168}Yes. I'm not involved in your movie, | these fake suicide psychiatric.
{121172}{121222}Sam did it. You know that.
{121245}{121307}You gave me closed captions, | that I was able to graduate.
{121390}{121430}So you never saw his film?
{121432}{121483}Yes. I never came close to his film.
{121574}{121630}Professor help me out of here.
{121645}{121703}You know what that means, or you?
{121718}{121742}What?
{121751}{121814}I gave you a perfect estimate of the sound of nothing.
{122086}{122134}Film is a medium made through cooperation.
{122141}{122217}And who the hell are you?
{122271}{122325}I have pushed pipe in Travis' mouth.
{122344}{122398}And pull the trigger.
{122494}{122518}Why?
{122531}{122563}Why?
{122569}{122625}To do this you planted.
{122664}{122702}Actually ...
{122705}{122799}... I need your fingerprints on the gun | to prove that you are murdered by Tobias and Travis ...
{122801}{122843}... and whoever it was.
{122897}{122937}Trevor, do you?
{122977}{123003}Smart.
{123150}{123187}Run, Amy!
{123192}{123216}Get up!
{123293}{123355}If you do not get out, | I'll kill this guy!
{123386}{123435}Or do you want to die now, asshole?
{123687}{123764}Come on, before you murder someone.
{124047}{124090}Amy, do not come out.
{124101}{124206}It is the truth about dvojèkih? You èutil, | when I blew his brother's brain?
{124211}{124274}It hurt will die twice.
{124287}{124325}Okay!
{124384}{124414}Let him go.
{124458}{124507}You got what you asked.
{124511}{124591}Do you think this is what I wanted?
{124615}{124662}Fuck, be a teacher!
{124677}{124725}What are you talking about?
{124788}{124840}When I was a student here ...
{124851}{124952}... the faculty in deciding on | Hitchcockovo prize during my ...
{124966}{125024}... and Chip Voelkerjevim film.
{125031}{125119}Therefore, the opinion of the filmmaker asked guest | odoèilni to make a vote.
{125158}{125234}Taylor Mayfield, documentation.
{125280}{125320}That one voice ...
{125332}{125426}... I was your father forever ruined careers | who would have had in Hollywood.
{125455}{125520}And I was forced to stay here forever.
{125537}{125566}But recently, ...
{125596}{125649}... Travis did a brilliant film.
{125694}{125738}And I saw a way out of this.
{125747}{125799}But I needed an alibi.
{125811}{125840}Then bingo.
{125845}{125940}You came into my office, | with some fine ideas about the film ...
{125946}{126003}... who gave me the cover.
{126006}{126084}Killed all | who participated in the Travis film, ...
{126101}{126169}... that seemed to be a movie your | and that with him gone.
{126178}{126218}Hey, girl. Whatever.
{126226}{126285}When you're waiting on my end to what by participating in prison ...
{126287}{126382}... I'll major in Los Angeles to film Travis | under the contract.
{126399}{126455}This only happens in movies, you idiot.
{126809}{126855}- Stop! | - Stop!
{126889}{126921}Oh, thank God.
{126929}{126980}- They tried to kill me. | - Lying.

{127019}{127113}First, a wild white girl | Drop the gun and it kicks off!
{127116}{127194}- But he is lying! | - I said, drop it and kick off!
{127419}{127452}Thank you.

{127655}{127702}This also includes the immortal!

{127867}{127930}- Do not listen to him. | -'s Exchange, professor.
{127932}{127973}You're safe.
{128022}{128067}This is true whether or not Amy?
{128072}{128136}I saw you zapušèati tower.
{128159}{128186}Listen.
{128228}{128293}But I have not told anyone that I saw.

{129777}{129821}But you know what they say:
{129840}{129910}"Those who do not know how to be a teacher."
{130361}{130407}What you gonna do now?
{130569}{130625}Come on. Shoot.

In My Skin
At three words an hour you'II never finish , Esther!
-Are you off?
-Yes. I'm going home to work.
I'm tired of this.
We shouId rent a pIace together.
With onIy one saIary?
I want to Iive in Iuxury!
You had a steady saIary before.
Yeah .
See the house?
Be great when it's finished .
He's a skirt-chaser. Go for it!
He's friends with the boss.
-Gee, thanks!
-I'm joking . That's him in the suit.
Good evening .
Is there any way
I can speed things up at the agency, other than that, to see what my chances are?
Not now, pIease!
I'II wish I hadn't got you in .
-Come on , there they are.
-I'II join you .
Shit!
Thanks.
I feII and tore my trousers.
My jacket's fiIthy, damn it!
I was out in the yard . Big pIace!
-He bought it for peanuts, apparentIy.
-ReaIIy?
You're ridicuIous.
No, this is mine! Get your own .
Don't be mean !
Can I borrow her?
I've got to go.
-You're joking !
-Sorry.
I promised my friends.
I'II phone you for a Iunch date.
I may ask your advice about my work.
I don't do Iunch dates.
I do dinner.
As you Iike.
Thanks. Bye.
Esther?
Esther!
Where have you been?
-Sorry, I'II expIain . Let's go.
-Just a sec.
Henri and I Iooked everywhere for you .
It was weird !
There was bIood on the bathroom fIoor but nobody there.
We were scared we'd find a corpse!
Any Iuck?
I Iooked everywhere.
Forget about it.
I'm off home.
Henri shouId caII the poIice.
No one reported an accident.
-So, where the heII were you?
-WaIking in the yard .
I'm not tired .
How about a finaI drink?
-Okay.
-A quick one then .
WeII , weII !
The joint and Iigaments escaped by an inch .
Had your tetanus shots?
-I think so.
-We'II give you a booster.
How did you do it?
I feII on some metaI on a buiIding site.
A tooI , I think.
You and buiIding sites don't mix!
This happened some hours ago.
Why didn't you come sooner?
I didn't know I was hurt.
I onIy noticed Iater.
Then I went to a bar.
I didn't think it was. . . .
Didn't notice? Didn't it hurt?
No.
It does now, and in the bar, but not then .
And it was too dark to see.
That's not normaI .
Shock has strange effects, but stiII .
You shouId have feIt it.
I feeI my Ieg normaIIy now.
I guess I wasn't thinking .
Scatterbrain !
Are you sure it's your Ieg?
Just a joke. I'm tired .
Can you feeI my hand?
Yes.
I'II do a test.
Round or sharp? Don't Iook.
Don't Iook.
Round .
Sharp.
Sharp.
I didn't touch you .
Good .
I'II anesthetize it.
You'II feeI a pinprick, then nothing .
You may need surgery to repIace the tissue.
-It won't aII heaI back.
-What do you mean?
Your skin wiII heaI unevenIy.
Like this.
A graft wiII fix it.
A few days in the hospitaI .
I'II consider it.
MedicaIIy, there's no need but it won't Iook pretty.
If there's no need , I'd rather not.
Think about it.
The dressing wiII need changing .
We'II discuss it then .
There you go.
HeIIo.
Why didn't you go straight to the hospitaI?
You gash yourseIf and caImIy go out for a Coke?
I guess I was in shock.
I want to go out. I did a hard night's work. Let's eat out.
I don't fancy it.
AIright.
It's strange that you feIt nothing .
The doctor said everything's normaI .
How about a boat ride on the canaI?
Don't fancy it either?
You suggest something .
-What was that?
-Nothing .
When you rip up your Ieg , you don't feeI it.
When I touch you , you jump and scratch .
Admit it's weird .
Say something .
No answer?
If you don't want to go out, just say so.
Don't endIessIy change the subject!
I said I didn't want to.
And I don't want to discuss the accident!
Esther.
Don't go to any more parties without me.
You were on the make. Admit it.
Are you sure?
WaIking in dark yards aII aIone sounds fishy to me.
I've had a proposition too.
From a woman?
A job offer.
What job?
In a bank.
They head-hunted me.
They want a new image.
They need a business journaIist.
I'd heIp to design their new P.R. strategy.
-ExceIIent!
-I'm not so sure.
Exciting , yes.
Good money, new job, but it feeIs Iike seIIing out.
I'II show you the dossier.
You'II wear a suit!
When I do this, can you feeI it?
No.
No?
There you go.
Here, I've read it.
I added some notes to cIarify things for the cIient.
-Fine.
-For Wednesday, okay?
It's short, but I promised .
Wednesday morning if you can .
Sure.
The rest is fine.
It's a good anaIysis.
Merci .
My job stinks.
Nothing but bureaucratic buIIshit.
Gives me a headache.
My job's okay but the deadIines are tiring .
Pierre, can you come?
Damn !
We'II have that coffee Iater.
Coming for coffee?
Not now.
I'm up to my neck.
If I stop, I'm sunk.
Don't stop, then .
I'II never finish with you hanging over me.
Take it easy.
I won't bother you . I just wanted some coffee and fresh air.
Come on ! I'II finish your work.
It can't be hard .
Joke!
I've been cooped up aII day.
Not even a Iunch break.
In my office.
Then I cut myseIf in the storeroom .
The storeroom , my office.
The air-conditioning , no windows open , can't breathe. . . .
I'II be okay.
If you're hurt, the first aid box is by the photocopier.
Is it? I'II get it.
Wait. How did you cut yourseIf?
On a metaI thing .
I guessed that.
What were you doing with it?
Cutting myseIf.
FIesh wounds. Nothing serious.
I was aIready injured but. . . .
Forget it. Some other time.
Why did you do it?
I don't know.
I think I may have misused a word , ''aIternativeIy,'' in the first part of my report this morning .
What are you working on?
A presentation to the Ministry.
Neat! Takes a speciaI kind of writing .
DanieI gave me back my report.
I have to rewrite some of it, but not aII .
On the whoIe, it was good .
I'II Iet you get on .
No, Iet's have coffee. It can wait.
No, I shouId . . . .
I shouId check that mistake or it'II bug me.
-Don't worry about it.
-Wait!
Is Vincent home tonight?
No. He's got to work.
-Stay at my pIace.
-ReaIIy?
Thomas is coming but you can sIeep on the sofa.
Esther!
Coming !
Esther, answer!
Why is the door Iocked? Open it!
Open !
Sorry. I Iocked it without thinking .
But I did answer you .
-Here.
-Thank you .
God ! You didn't do that?
No.
It's mostIy the accident at the party.
Don't Iook. Go, I'II disinfect it.
Stop staring at me.
Can you Ieave me aIone for a minute?
I hope you didn't touch my pans!
I'm the chef tonight.
I've decided to treat you to my cooking skiIIs.
Not that they're any good , but stiII .
It smeIIs good .
Here.
I had a tweIve-pack sent up.
The grocery downstairs takes orders by phone. It's handy.
I have to work tonight to meet my Wednesday deadIine.
Okay.
I don't know what to say about your cuts.
Say nothing .
But I'm worried .
You won't do it again , wiII you?
No, I did it without thinking .
You couId see a doctor.
Get some piIIs.
I do, if I'm depressed or anxious.
You couId see my doctor.
But he'd probabIy have you certified !
I know you , but it Iooks sick to an outsider.
Anyhow, there's no need .
-Isn't Thomas coming?
-No.
He canceIed .
Not that I care, so Iong as I have company.
How's your presentation going?
So-so.
I'm so fed up.
I deserve a more responsibIe job.
With my experience and cIients,
I shouId be a project manager.
I'd Iike that. EspeciaIIy the money!
You'II soon be a research anaIyst.
I feeI Iike a stooge.
I'm not so sure I wiII .
Tomorrow, at the office party,
I'II ask Modier if I get the job and when .
I wouIdn't.
You couId bIow your chances.
-So?
-I got the job!
I start in ten days with that jeweIry firm .
CongratuIations.
Who's in charge?
Me.
I'II be project manager, not just an anaIyst.
Junior manager, that is.
My MiddIe East knowIedge cIinched it.
WeII !
Fantastic.
You're not very experienced , but. . . .
Junior manager!
Good going .
Do you mind?
No. I got you in here.
It feeIs a bit weird .
I've been here five years, but I'm happy for you , if you think you're fit enough .
Yes.
It'II be hard work at first but I'II cope.
I'm sure you wiII .
So maybe I'II work for you?
Maybe.
Sandrine, pIease don't think I--
In the water!
Like everyone eIse!
-I've got no swimsuit!
-Who cares?
Go in your undies!
Sandrine!
Sandrine!
Off with her trousers!
Sandrine!
Enough . Let her go.
It's your Ioss, girI .
The water's great!
I'm sorry. It was stupid .
Doesn't matter.
Sorry.
I panicked and froze.
She's jeaIous.
Like she was at coIIege, onIy worse.
Her faiIures aren't my fauIt.
I don't want to see her again .
I was thinking this afternoon .
With my new saIary and yours at the bank, why don't we buy, not rent?
We'II get a Ioan and renovate a nice pIace.
How do I know it won't happen again?
You can't expIain it!
It was onIy once.
I don't intend . . . .
Fuck your intentions!
Did you expect that?
Look at yourseIf! Show me again .
I didn't expect it but it won't happen again .
What eIse can I say?
You ignore my new job--
I didn't ignore it!
I'm gIad about it,
I'II inquire about Ioans.
But that! I can't handIe it.
TaIk about it! Why can't you?
I toId you . It came over me, a mindIess urge.
I won't do it again .
What gave you the idea?
What did you want? That?
Do you Iike that?
Do you Iike it?
-Stop, you're scaring me!
-You scare me!
Is it my fauIt?
No.
Don't you Iike your body?
Yes, I do. But. . . .
This aII started with your accident the other day, right?
Maybe. I don't know.
Stop questioning me.
Okay, I'II stop.
I know you . I'II take your word it won't happen again .
Sorry I Iost my temper.
Let's dress up and ceIebrate your job.
I'II move in with you tonight, since I don't work at home now.
I'II feeI easier that way.
Okay?
HeIIo.
We need precise detaiIs of Ivar's brand image abroad ,
We need precise detaiIs of Ivar's brand image abroad , in markets where Iuxury has other referents.
Our main aim is to send our IocaI agents the data on which to devise their independent strategies.
We need data on the Iuxury market, especiaIIy jeweIry, the market Ieaders, their images, and naturaIIy the image of Ivar itseIf.
We'II want to access surveys from North America, BraziI ,
Asia and the mid-East.
We're ready to spend .
The stakes are high but we can't study every country.
Two countries shouId yieId a fairIy accurate picture, provided the cuIturaI zone matches your target markets.
DanieI says you're an expert on the MiddIe East.
Yes.
I'm not a speciaIist but I've studied the area, its economics, and I've spent time there.
-You couId orient us.
-I hope so.
We'II draw up a proposaI .
Esther wiII handIe that aspect.
An internationaI project.
Just what you wanted !
You're Iucky.
Better than packaging surveys!
You bet!
I'II Ieave you to pIan it.
ScheduIe severaI phases.
They seem to have money.
Give it the works.
Okay.
This wiII be cIeared .
Chair okay?
Thanks. Everything's fine.
How's it going?
Fine.
StiII got my beige trousers?
The Iaundry couIdn't get the stains out.
I'II write you a check to repIace them .
No. . . .
ActuaIIy, yes.
They cost me 900 euros.
I'm kidding .
I'm busy now.
I'II Ieave it with the receptionist.
Yes.
Yes.
The bedroom or verandah?
What did he say?
How many square meters?
Got to go. My dinner's here.
Around the cIock! Bye.
-Thanks.
-No! Leave it to me.
Let me smeII that.
Leave it to me, I said !
You shouId uncover it soon to Iet it dry.
I'II see.
Sweetheart! Your cute IittIe face on a magnetic card !
See?
Look in my bag .
I made appointments to see three apartments.
The descriptions are in my bag .
-Whereabouts?
-You'II see.
In the bIue foIder.
I may be having dinner with cIients tomorrow.
What's that on your hand?
Let me see.
Hurry up!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I thought. . . .
I hope you'II agree it's deIicious.
-It's a superb vintage.
-No, thank you .
-You don't Iike wine?
-No aIcohoI . Just water.
It's not aIcohoI , it's a very good wine. Shame!
It's no everyday wine.
You've tempted me. I'II try it.
You'II see.
ExceIIent. ReaIIy exceIIent.
WeII?
DeIicious, I admit.
I'II do without water.
You see?
To return to business, that was an interesting group.
Aside from the usuaI generaIities about Iuxury, our image came out cIearIy.
A hard meeting to run too.
You coped weII .
That woman on your Ieft kept contradicting the others!
Thank you .
PIease.
A few years ago, we issued a worIdwide press package.
We had to withdraw it from Japan because one detaiI upset them .
What was it?
The postures of the peopIe in the ad .
There was a hand gesture which we saw as being very eIegant.
It deepIy shocked the Japanese.
It was Iike a gesture of disdain .
For the reader, it signified refusaI .
TaIk about detaiIs!
CruciaI detaiIs!
Often , the whoIe thing hangs on such subtIeties in the IocaI cuIture.
We have to be carefuI not to send negative signaIs.
They say a transIation error brought Japan into WorId War II !
Communications are different in Japan .
We have a gIobaI strategy but Japan is an exception .
We have a marketing team there.
It's so unIike Europe and the U .S .
I didn't know Japan was so unique in that way.
Some years ago, we ran our gIobaI ads there.
The tests were catastrophic.
Two different cuItures.
It did our image more harm than good .
Status symboIs, especiaIIy, are perceived very differentIy.
The Japanese marketing department ignored guideIines from France.
They were aImost compIeteIy useIess!
We devised IocaI strategies instead .
You worked in Japan?
For ten years.
I trained there and stayed on , but Iiving so far away was hard .
I missed France.
I worked in Germany, then back to Paris.
What drew you to Japan?
I studied Japanese history, then got an M.B.A.
I knew the Ianguage and the country fascinated me,
Iess for its present than its past.
It was Iike a dream .
Seeing for reaI the things I had studied , or what was Ieft of them .
If you study a Ianguage, you want to use it.
That was another motive.
I'm sure.
I'd Iike to traveI too, in a few years.
We're part of a European group.
We can move around .
-Where wouId you go?
-Lisbon .
Oh? Why?
I go there on vacation .
I Iike the feeI , the superior quaIity of Iife, the peopIe, the mentaIity.
It's onIy a 3-hour fIight.
-That's quick.
-A good compromise.
Foreign , but stiII European .
I doubt I couId Iive in a totaIIy aIien cuIture, but I Iike Lisbon .
Excuse me.
-Sorry. Go ahead .
-No hurry, Madam .
I don't Iike the way
Lisbon has changed since the Expo.
I used to Iike the city's timeIessness and authenticity.
The Expo changed so much .
The Vasco da Gama bridge, the Barrio AIto. . . .
I found it Iost its charm .
Not at aII . The innovations were very good for the city.
They made Iife easier.
Creativity has bIossomed .
You see creativity?
DefiniteIy. AII those pIaces, Iike. . . .
There's an interesting spIit between everyday Iife, which is more provinciaI than metropoIitan , and the styIe and ambiance of dinner at the AIcantara or a pIace Iike the Lux, or the KremIin . FabuIous!
Much more inventive than most pIaces in Paris.
I don't know Lisbon .
You'd advise me to go?
I think it's a marveIous pIace.
Life there is stress-free and pIeasant, but the entertainment is first cIass.
Rather Iike Rome, no?
Rome is the exact reverse.
It has the cuIturaI poverty of a provinciaI town , and aII the aggravation of a big city.
-You're exaggerating .
-You don't Iike Rome?
Not much , no.
-Why not?
-I don't know.
My remark was offhand .
But whenever I was there,
I feIt uncomfortabIe.
-Perhaps it was you .
-No, not reaIIy.
It's Iike I said .
I found it very aggravating .
Cars, horns, scooters, traffic jams. . . .
The smaIIest practicaIities become exhausting .
-And that wind . . . .
-The sirocco.
It's infuriating !
I didn't take to the peopIe.
They're Iess friendIy than eIsewhere in ItaIy.
The women about town are so vuIgar.
The way they waIk!
Even their manners are bad .
The city itseIf is superb.
Its monuments, yes. Its museums aIways seem to be cIosed .
For entertainment and nightIife, it's poor.
Few cinemas. OnIy one arthouse.
Not many bars or cIubs.
Not that they're my scene, but my friends there feeI bored and cut off.
True, Paris has more entertainment but it's improving .
More screens are opening .
And it's so beautifuI .
I'm happy just waIking .
One of our project managers works in Rome now.
-For your agency?
-No, he ''reoriented ,'' as they say.
Besides, our agency is in MiIan .
He spent a few years in MiIan , but now he has another job in Rome.
He rents a pIace there and keeps one in MiIan .
Whatever he thinks of Rome, he prefers ItaIy to France.
I don't think he pIans to come back.
WouId you Iike to move to the MiddIe East?
So, in a nutsheII ,
Rome's awfuI , Lisbon's spoiIed .
-What city do you Iike?
-Paris, of course.
The worId's most beautifuI city.
Harmonious architecture, unspoiIed , outstanding surroundings, pIeasant IifestyIe.
Those trendy cIubs of yours, they're not my criteria.
I have nothing against them , but for me, that kind of pIace can never repIace the daiIy pIeasures of our IocaI bars and bistros.
Which aIways greet us so warmIy!
Not aIways, but don't Iet's generaIize.
You must have missed aII that in Tokyo.
DefiniteIy!
To return to what we were saying , how do you go about working with market research agencies in Japan?
Their methods must be different.
It can't be easy.
The air-conditioning is strong .
Excuse me.
Coming ! I'm getting wine.
We researched the whoIe concept of Iuxury, how peopIe feeI about Iuxury goods, be it perfumes or jeweIry.
TrifIes, Iet's say, but expensive ones.
We tried to gauge pubIic attitudes.
-WiII you have a dessert?
-No thank you .
-Coffee?
-Not for me.
We couId ask for the check.
Waiter! The check.
The survey
was originally designed to confirm,,,,
It's down there.
Your friend's there, in the ambuIance.
I was so scared .
Have you broken anything?
No, this is aII .
-You took quite a faII .
-Yes.
I drove a cIient home to the suburbs, around 1 1 p.m .
I got compIeteIy Iost with those traffic things, sending you here, there, making no sense. . . .
So I got Iost, then I saw this road thing , a kind of sign .
I compIeteIy Iost. . . .
I Iost controI and went over.
See? I tore my trousers.
How's your head?
WiII they X-ray it?
No, I toId them I'm okay.
The dinner yesterday went badIy.
I want to get to work on time.
I'II go to the hospitaI if I feeI anything .
You Iook tired .
It's aImost the same pIace.
NaturaIIy, your knee took the weight. . . but it's high .
You must have Iaid on the ground a Iong time to get those dents.
I don't know.
I guess it's that.
Something wrong?
I couIdn't sIeep.
It's about time I got up as weII .
Bad Iuck, but it'II heaI .
Don't think about it.
It wasn't just bad Iuck.
I shouIdn't have drunk.
You couIdn't know.
Cut out the drinking , cut out the probIem . Make sense?
Yeah .
You're stiII shocked and tired .
Don't sweat it.
You Iearned your Iesson .
It won't happen again .
Think about something eIse.
Me, your job, me again . . . .
We're seeing that pIace again at 5, remember?
We couId move on Saturday.
I won't forget.
Your dinner probIem wiII bIow over.
Yes.
I'II pick you up tonight.
The apartment, then the traveI agency.
Eric and Justine prefer ItaIy.
Me too. Is that okay?
Yes, me too.
I wish they'd taken X-rays.
I hope you're okay.
Don't worry.
I'II take a shower.
We shouId bring a tape measure.
Their pIans may be inaccurate.
Right!
Come in .
Good morning .
Sorry to bother you .
-I'm sorry I wasn't good at dinner.
-No, you weren't.
That kind of dinner is not for fun , or to have a good meaI . It's work.
Your professionaI behavior was seriousIy Iacking !
I've known you two years.
I won't judge you on one Iapse.
I was very embarrassed , both towards them and to find you were Iess mature than I thought.
There.
I have nothing to add .
Your survey was weII done, so you're in credit overaII .
A second Iapse wouId jeopardize your pIace here, at Ieast at your IeveI of responsibiIity.
Understood . It won't happen again .
Thank you .
We have untiI Friday.
The vendor's giving us priority.
Oh , cooI .
-We'II be set in no time
-Yes.
What did you want to discuss with the buiIder?
The pIumbing in the kitchen and the bedroom windows.
Same as you .
And that Ioad-bearing waII .
Yes. Hang on , I need some cash .
If that waII has to stay, it's no deaI .
Pity, because I reaIIy Iike the pIace.
It's perfect on the whoIe, but for that one potentiaI probIem .
Even if it's Ioad-bearing , there must be soIutions.
Are you Iistening? What's up?
Nothing . Just a sec.
The whoIe waII can't be Ioad-bearing .
We couId cut it in haIf to feeI Iess boxed-in .
We can't knock it aII down .
What are you up to?
What's wrong?
I've forgotten my wretched PIN number!
I know it.
There's nothing to cry about.
How much? 200?
We must answer by Friday.
It's onIy Wednesday.
I've been thinking about your job.
If they're training an in-house team rather than outsource the work, maybe they intend to create permanent jobs.
Perhaps they're pIanning to expand .
It's strange, since they aIready have
P.R. and personneI departments.
But there must be a reason for it.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't know. I've had a tiring day.
What's the matter?
Nothing .
Something's wrong .
Not with me.
I don't cry in the street.
I'm a normaI guy.
You must be so happy with me if you cry over a PIN number!
I'm thinking , what can I do?
ProbabIy nothing .
I'm not a drag or a pain , am I?
If I'm not the probIem , it's something I don't know about, so I don't know you .
You do know me. You do.
You aIways Iook for meanings.
Maybe I do.
PeopIe get tense, strung out.
The car accident. . . .
I don't know.
I'm turning in . You shouId too.
We'II feeI better tomorrow.
I'm coming .
Good morning .
I need some formaIin .
I don't seII it. It's iIIegaI .
Try asking a Iab, but they won't give you any.
A hospitaI , maybe.
What's it for?
I had a piece of bad skin removed .
I want to preserve it.
You're sentimentaI !
I never saw that before.
What's it in , water?
Is that how they packed it?
I broke the other fIask.
It's water.
They didn't strain themseIves!
But things deteriorate, even in formaIin , over the years.
I don't see what couId . . . .
Skin is tanned , normaIIy.
Human skin not often , thankfuIIy!
But it's the same.
What did they suggest?
I forgot to ask.
How do I tan it?
WiII it stay smooth and soft?
Yes, Iike anything made of Ieather.
WaIIets, cIothes. . . They're tanned .
Tanned and treated .
It's a whoIe technique.
To do it yourseIf, try potassium aIum .
DiIute it in water, smear it on , roII it out fIat. That wiII tan it.
It won't be treated or dyed , but tanned . It won't budge.
Press it hard .
It shouIdn't be too thin .
May I?
No probIem .
What's bad about it?
It Iooks fine.
It wasn't.
That's aII I have to do to tan it?
That's aII .
Anything eIse?
Yes. Foundation cream and aspirin or paracetamoI .
Yes, it's me.
Can you caII me back?
I'm on my mobiIe.
I'm afraid I won't be home tonight, but pIease caII me.
Take care. Bye for now.
Esther here.
I'm sorry. A mass of things has kept me from coming to work.
Can you apoIogize to DanieI , say I'II be in at 9 sharp tomorrow?
No need .
No, that was a friend .
He didn't know.
Can you give me EIodie?
Hello, This is your wake-up call,
- Hey, what's going on?
- What are you doing in my car?
Shit! Where are we going?
- How did you get in my car?
- What?
You said I could sleep here.
- You said it was comfortable too.
- No!
- You didn't say that?
- No. Get out.
- This is crap. Come on!
- Get out. I'm late.
Stop pulling.
You're hurting me.
You know what you could do?
Eat it!
- You lied, man.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's great.
- F you, pal.
F you, buddy!
Hey! Hey!
I'm looking for Cheerful Place.
- What are you looking for?
- Cheerful Place.
Isn't it right there?
Jesus, no.
Christ Almighty.
Oh, fuck.
Don't worry, kids.
Flappy's here!
Hurry up, we're gonna miss it.
I'm trying!
Get the hell off of me!
There's no reason for all this.
We can handle this ourselves.
It was an accident.
It's a goddamn misunderstanding.
Jill, would you tell them we can handle this ourselves?
What the fuck are you looking at?
It's your call.
You give me the say-so, he's gone.
Excuse me!
Perhaps you didn't hear me.
For Christ's sakes, Jill, open up your mouth!
- Could you take him away?
- What?!
- Get up!
- Just for a while, Travis.
- Just until you cool down.
- You coerced her into saying that!
- Simmer down, shitbag!
- Fine. Come on, you bitch!
- Stop!
- Take him away already!
Come on.
Come on, get in there.
Get in there.
Mrs. Lee?
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no. Don't be.
If you can wait,
I'll get you your money.
- Is he giving you a hard time?
- No.
- Not at all.
- Call me if you need anything.
- The money...
- No. Don't.
I understand. You won't be too old for a clown next year.
- Will I, Mommy?
- No.
There it is, then.
Same time next year, Mom?
- Sure. Thank you, Mr...
- Flappy.
It's the illusion.
It's for the kids.
I almost forgot.
They would have taken away my clown license if I'd let this one slip by.
- You wouldn't rat on me, though?
- No.
Here!
And eat an extra piece of cake for Flappy.
You need it more than I do.
- Twice in one day, loser!
- Fuck you, bastard!
Free refill, please!
Aren't you supposed to be at a gig today?
Well, it was canceled at the zero hour.
No wonder you are so damned testy.
What happened?
The abridged version goes something like this... will you cut it out?!
Husband pounds wife.
Wife screams.
Neighbors call cops.
Cops come, bust him.
- The party's over.
- Raw deal.
You got the cash, though?
She didn't pay you?
Fuck that shit.
Time is money, spousal abuse or not.
I'd be in small claims court, if I were you.
- Humanitarian to the last.
- Nevermind her.
I almost forgot the big news.
- My grandmother kicked me out.
- I've heard this before.
She was pretty official about it this time.
Her lawyer sent me a letter saying she doesn't want me around anymore because I don't pay bills or get up before 12:00.
- Nice.
- She can bite me anyway.
I'll be flying solo soon.
I got a job.
Where?
Tuott the Basehead hooked me up with Suds 'N' Stuff over the weekend.
Watch yourself on that corporate ladder.
Listen to this bull.
Is that your limo outside?
Driving around in that little shitbox.
That shitbox totes your ass to and fro.
You walk around with empty pockets like some poor-ass church mouse.
You know you need the extra cash.
Come work with me.
- You get your own jumpsuit.
- No, thanks.
That's how it starts.
Crappy job here, crappy job there, next thing you know, you're 70 years old, living on the dole wondering where your life went, and your best friend comes cable-ready with a remote.
That's beneath even you.
- What's up your ass?
- Nothing.
Shine bumpers if you want.
Nobody's stopping you.
I'm sure you'll do well.
You're right. I should hinge my future on dancing around like a mongoloid on a bad acid trip for a bunch of spoiled dick-heads.
- You think what I do is stupid?
- All I'm saying is your life expectations as far as clowning is concerned are far-fetched, dare I say, totally unrealistic.
It's what I want to do.
And I believe things will work out, and one day I'll make a good living at it. Cliché, but humor me.
How long did it take to build Rome?
Your problem is, zero patience.
I can see how the rise and fall of Rome parallel your existence.
You're barely surviving.
The money you make... sporadic at best.
How much of your monthly take goes for that nursing home?
$200. But I only pay half,
'cause Uncle Sam picks up the rest.
- How much do you make?
- It depends.
I usually bring in...
- maybe $500-$600.
- So, in other words, four.
How do you pay rent, car insurance and eat on 200 or 300 bucks a month?
Mosier knocks a couple of bucks off if I mow the lawn or do some maintenance.
Plus, to be honest, I don't exactly pay insurance on that shitbox, as you so fondly referred to it.
I'm in a quandary about the resting home deal.
Not for nothing, but your mom...
- she's a bitch.
- Hey!
That's my mom!
My mother had a hard life.
Her mother died when she was three, and her father expected her to take on the wifely duties...
- all of them.
- I've heard this before.
Why should you atone for his shortcomings?
- Plus, you call her names all the time.
- I know.
But she's still my mom.
And there's a difference between calling your mother a bitch and someone else saying it.
Sorry. She's such a bitch.
William, Sam Mosier.
I don't want to be a nut-biter, but I'll need some money from you soon.
There's just not that much grass to mow.
Guess what,
Mr. Flappy-the-Jerk-Off?
Your message sucks!
- Clowns suck too.
- Tell him to eat shit.
Pick up the phone!
I know you're there!
I want to thank you for being so goddamn worthless!
They are asking me for the money you owe!
They want to know why the rent hasn't been paid for this fucking cesspool you've thrown me in!
Bring the money today!
Now!
You have no more messages.
Do you mind?
Rumor has it that backseat's comfortable.
Get away!
What is he, your boss?
- Are you his bitch?
- No!
Who's ready for bingo?
Are you ready for bingo?
The fun starts at 7:00 in the cafeteria.
Don't forget your markers.
Excuse me, ladies.
How rude.
- Get I get you anything else?
- No, not unless
- you have a cure for my rheumatism.
- I wish.
Hi, Mom.
It's my nap time.
Why don't you follow suit, and make like that irritating little bitch?
What are you talking about?
I just got here.
I'm talking about you being a source of embarrassment, a colossal disappointment!
I wish I'd had the courage to take that trip down the back alley.
Come on.
I paid up some of the bill, so please, can we have a nice visit?
- Don't start with that.
- I am going to start.
This room, if that's what you want to call it, isn't provided by some divine entity.
I've had it up to here with that bitch of a secretary, reminding me daily that you're too stupid to remember that
I have to pay to live here.
It's not that I don't remember...
Don't interrupt me. God damn it, don't you dare contradict me!
You show me the respect I deserve.
If your father were alive,
I'd have him slap you in your snotty little mouth.
- Here we go.
- What did you say?!
- How dare you? Get over here...
- Relax. I didn't mean it.
- Get your ass over here!
- I won't let you hit me!
Forget it, I'll leave before that happens.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time, would it?
That's always the way it's been with you.
Couldn't stand on your own two feet to defend yourself, if your worthless life depended on it.
Run away, William.
It's your answer to everything.
You don't have to stay!
I know you don't want to come to see me.
Yes, I do.
I like to come and see you.
I just wish you'd relax a little and not get so short-tempered.
I get so lonely around here.
Nobody talks to me.
Nobody bothers with me at all.
They have their own little circles.
They don't want to know from anyone.
- They think they're better than me.
- Come on, Mom.
You know that's not true.
So, suddenly, you're some kind of big man?
Not so big that you can earn a decent living, let alone take care of your own mother!
I am so happy that God showed grace enough to take your father away,
- The account is nearly paid up...
- You know what you are?
- A whole lot of nothing!
- I'm trying...
Trying won't get you through life!
Actions will get you through it.
I thought you'd have learned that by now.
- If your father...
- Enough about him!
What do you have to canonize that son of a bitch?!
I know the way he was.
I know what you went through!
I'm sick of listening to how fucking great he was!
I'm sorry.
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Get out!
It was out of line.
I apologize.
I said, get the hell out!
Oh God! Somebody... get him out of here!
I can't stand to look at you.
Get the fuck out!
Don't let him get away.
You and me, go round to round,
Jersey style.
Take it on, you smelly bitch.
Hey, it's clowny!
- Give me a dollar!
- Yeah, give him a dollar.
Those boys giving you some trouble, Willie?
- Nothing I can't handle.
- Bunch of roughnecks.
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
I lost a couple of jobs this past week.
Will, I need your help.
Somebody's stealing my utilities.
- Oh yeah?
- Maybe you overheard something?
No, I haven't.
But I'll let you know if I do.
I know your word, Will.

Bachelor parties.
What's the occasion?
This place is fucking posh.
What took you so long?
Why is your hair wet?
Because I took a shower.
Good thing I did.
- Check this out.
- What's this?
An epiphany. The single greatest idea I've ever had.
What do you want?
- Hi...
- Order something.
Oh. Could I have a burger... charbroiled... with an order of fries and a coke?
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Can I get a coffee? Black.
I'm buying. Order something.
Nah.
What?
- What's wrong?
- You are invited.
Come to my poop party"?
You'll let people take a dump on you?
- What?
- You're sick.
I thought I knew you, man.
No. That's where
I got the idea from.
- Nobody's gonna crap in your face?
- Of course not, you idiot.
I changed my mind. Give me the same as him, with two free refills.
- Too late.
- Quit screwing around and listen.
Picture this.
It's the night before your wedding, and your friends have gotten together to throw you a bachelor party.
You expect some booze and bawdy behavior, and of course, the requisite buxom babe. Standard.
This guy will eat your boogers free, for nothing.
That's where I come in.
The groom-to-be is expecting a bimbo with tits from here till Tuesday and a gyrating lap dance.
Instead, it's a male clown with fishnets and garters and a bustier,
Did you eat crack for breakfast?
What's the matter with you?
It's a joke. Get it?
Instead of the stripper,
I show up to the party and shock the shit out of the groom!
You're confident there's a calling for that?
No one will be ripping my door off the hinges at first, but word of mouth advertising.
I could develop a cult following.
Admit, you've never heard anything like this before.
- You got me there.
- Everyone except the groom-to-be is in on the joke.
I show up 20 minutes before the real entertainment, put on a show, then take off.
It'll be funny!
Will you still use the name Flappy?
- 'Cause that will cause confusion.
- What do you think?
What's your stage name?
You need a moniker.
You can help me out with that.
I know. How about " Will, the naked and retarded clown"?
I won't be naked.
Think of something else.
Call a spade a spade.
What you're proposing is vulgar.
Vulgar.
It has sort of a nice ring to it.
- That might work, actually.
- Work it.
Well, here goes something.
Hello, boys!
Guess who!
Oh. I'm sorry.
- I must have the wrong place.
- Not if you're ready to get down.
- Looks like you are.
- I got him!
You and my dad, you're going to do the dog.
Frankie, back off!
He don't need to know that just yet.
You don't come near him until I give the say so.
This is my goddamn party!
I run the show.
Get your pajamas on.
I didn't get to do anything!
You promised he'd be pretty.
- He's fucking ugly.
- Close the lips, monkey balls!
- He's Daddy's treat!
- Shut up, Frankie!
- You're trying to kiss up...
- You're jealous, Gino, because Daddy let me hit the clown.
He likes me better!
He doesn't like you better.
Where do you think you're going?
This party ain't over.
There's a shitload of fun to be had before you call this a night.
Help me.
Get that, Gino.
This ain't no spectator sport.
- I can do that.
- Well, do it.
Gino, show your brother a couple of steps over there.
That boy has two left feet.
Stop that kind of dancing.
- Why do you get to be the clown?
- Because I'm older.
And I don't want any more lip from you.
- What is going on over there?
- He won't let me be the clown.
I'm older.
I'm pretending I'm the clown.
Frankie's Daddy's little boy.
That's all.
Frankie, listen to your brother.
He is the boss.
No!
What the fuck are you saying?
Shut the fuck up!
- I'll beat your ass!
- If you motherfuckers can't get along,
I am never bringing you with me ever again.
Is that what you want?
- No.
- No.
You know it's sweet.
Do you want to miss out on your chance to...
Shut your mouths!
I want you to watch him.
Can you do that?
- I can.
- Dad, he's getting away.
- Will somebody stop him?
- I could have stopped him.
Save some for us.
Where did you put my dust pipe?
- In the shitbag.
- Oh, the shitbag.
I almost forgot about the shitbag.
Gino... get the camera.
I want to make a record of this.
If I'm not mistaken,
Mr. Fuckface here is... cherry.
Daddy, you want it on SP, LP or SLP?
I don't give a fat rat's ass, stupid bastard.
- Just turn it on.
- It is on.
Shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna start the show.
What's your name?
I asked you a question, sweet ass.
Vulgar.
- Vulgar the Clown.
- Suck my daddy, swine fuck!
Daddy! He's ruining everything!
Shut the fuck up, Gino!
You fucking pussy!
Get your sphincter out of my frame, asshole!
Cut it out!
I mean, your real name, funny man!
Stop laughing.
Set him back up, you cocks.
We'll just take that part out.
All right, asshole.
Same question.
- What the fuck is your name?
- William.
- Why are you doing this?
- Okay, William.
Willy. Willy Billy.
- What is it that you do?
- I'm a party clown for kids.
No, you're not.
You're a cocksucker!
You want me blowing it down your throat.
- No.
- Liar. I know faggots like you.
Nothing like the feeling of some fucker's shaft down your throat?
Could be some basehead.
What do you care?
Probably suck down his infected manstuff, smile and call it cherry pie.
You get off on that shit, don't you?
- No...
- Yes, you do!
Come on, let me go.
I don't even know who you are.
- My daddy's name is Edwina.
- Shut your hole, you moron!
You always do that.
I won't try to press charges.
You're goddamn right you won't.
He's afraid of Dad.
Look at him.
He should be afraid of Dad.
Dad's tough.
- Let me fuck his cock pouch.
- Not yet.
- Now!!
- Soon, though.
Soon you'll taste what's good.
But first,
I want him to say the words.
Say, "I love to suck cock."
All right. All right.
I love to suck cock.
"My name is William, and I love to suck cock."
My name is William, and I love to suck cock.
- Tonight's the night.
- Please, stop.
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
- Some men you just can't reach.
- Please, Edwina.
Turn that thing off!
What the fuck did you say to me?
- Tonight's the night.
- Before that.
- You said my name.
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- All right. Ass on the bed. Now!
If I have to tell you again, the wind will be whistling Dixie through a hole in your face.
Me and you are going to bed.
That's a fact!
I'm going to make hate to you!
Get your ass up there!
What do you think?
We're going to kiss?
Get him on his fucking stomach!
Quit holding me up, Gino.
Come on.
Get away from me.
No!
- Time for the dog, Pop.
- Don't rush me.
- Daddy's going to cock him hard.
- Damn right, I am!
And you boys will toss the salad!
- You never had it so good, did you?
- He never did.
Rim job!
Now, the shame.
Daddy's making his move!
You know what you are, William?
A whole lot of nothing.
Do you know?
Who got the shitbag?
You're holding it, Dad.
He was good.
You... you fucking nobody!
Open up, Will.
When was last time you cleaned this place?
What are you doing?
Shit, what happened?
Who did this?
Did somebody rob you?
One of those fucks outside?
You sit there, all right?
You'll be fine.
- I'll call the cops.
- No!
Don't call anyone.
- You couldn't, even if I let you.
- Why?
Will, tell me what happened to you.
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you. Just... don't say a word, 'cause once I tell you, that's it, it's never mentioned again.
- I don't think...
- I don't care about what you think at this precise moment.
What I'm about to tell you... is not to leave this room.
It can't and it won't.
I'll deal with it in my own way.
So, please, no questions or suggestions about what I should do.
As far as anyone else is concerned,
I was down by Gravely Point, and got jumped by some guy with a limp and a.44 who pistol-whipped my ass and took my wallet.
All right?
What choice do I have?
This is what happened.
- I must have the wrong place.
- Not if you're ready to get down.
Now, the shame.
What happened after that,
I don't remember so hot.
All I know is that I woke up this morning alive, and I'm still trying to decide whether I should be thankful for that.
I don't believe this.
What did the doctor say?
You didn't go to the hospital?
- I just wanted to be home.
- Somebody has to look at you.
No questions, no suggestions.
One of those scumbags could have given you a disease.
- You agreed!
- I know what I said!
But we have to find these guys.
They're sick!
- You could have AIDS!
- You think I haven't thought of that?
You don't think that was my first thought?
Fucking A, right, it was!
But you know what?
If one of them did have it, there's nothing I can do.
- Will...
- Will you shut the fuck up?!
You're leaving them out there to do it to somebody else!
- Not my problem.
- It is your problem!
Cops can track dogshit like these guys down.
- You can help.
- How would that look?
- How would what look?
- A man dressed as a perverted clown, shows up to a party for three men and cries foul
- after being roughed up a bit?
- A bit?!
- There's more to it than that.
- Do you want to know why?
Because that's what a lawyer would do.
And I won't sit in front of a jury who thinks
I'm some degenerate defending my character.
- You're not honest with yourself.
- Will you stop reacting, and think about it?!
They held me down and raped me!
Exactly! That's why you shouldn't let them walk!
- You should...
- Syd, I don't want anyone to know!
That's why.
I don't want anyone to know.
I just don't want anyone to know.
- I don't want anyone to know!
- All right. It's okay.
No one else, right?
Nobody else.
Nobody else.
Mrs. Affleck?
This is Will Carlson, the party clown.
I know it's short notice,
I won't be able to make it.
I'm sorry, something came up.
No, I can't. I can't.
Yes, this is really Flappy.
No, it really is.
L...
I'll be there, Benny.
See you soon.
Hold up!
Watch where you're going, fuckstick!
Sorry!
- Hurry up!
- What's going on?
Some dickhead got his walking papers.
That thing friggin' rules!
Let's go!
- Walking papers?
- Divorce papers, dumbass!
Where do you think you're going?
I'll have that shitbox towed right out of here!
Don't you people have jobs? Let's go.
Move it back. Let's go.
I repeat, put the weapon down.
Let Ashley go, Travis.
I repeat, go fuck yourself!
She's in charge here, not me!
Not you, her!
Jill started all this shit!
Ashley knows it too!
You hear that?! She knows!
You think you can sneak around on me and get a divorce?
I want what's rightfully mine!
I want what's coming to me.
I know you don't want to hurt your daughter.
We both know that.
This is about something else.
Just talk to me.
Maybe we can figure something out.
- It'd be better...
- I'll tell you what'd be better.
Send that bitch in here!
She comes in, Ashley comes out.
Get your damn hands off me!
I have to go!
If your mother would listen, we wouldn't have to go through this.
You think I'm fucking with you?
You're talking about clearing this shit up, you've got cops skulking around!
Don't jerk me off, Captain!
It doesn't have to be this way.
That's the way it's gotta be!
If I go out,
I ain't going out alone!
I'll take a few of you fucks with me!
No one's been hurt.
Walk away with a clean conscience.
- It'll be better for us both.
- I'm better than you!
- Better than all of you!
- Talk to me, Travis.
I need to know everything's okay in there.
We're going to arrange a meeting with your wife.
Nobody else, just her!
You know I can't promise that.
You think
I'm some kind of asshole?!
You think I don't know I'm fucked?
You're fucked too!
No matter what you think, you're not walking away from this a winner. No way!
Is there anything you'd like?
Some sandwiches, coffee maybe?
- Something for Ashley?
- No!
There's only one thing on my mind.
You have the power to grant me one request?
Within reason.
What do you want?
Bitch's head on a stake.
A deranged father.
An innocent young girl.
It could have ended up yet another statistic in the growing holocaust of violent domestic unrest that plagues this country.
But a hometown hero got involved.
Or rather, a hometown clown.
A clown who's got something to smile about, one eternally grateful little girl.
Let's please welcome
Will Carlson, better known as Flappy the Clown.
Welcome to the show.
Will... what I'd like you to do now is to take us back.
Tell me what was going through your mind, what the catalyst, one might say, was that led you to confront this maniac?
I've given this some thought over the past few days.
To be totally honest,
I still don't know.
There was a little girl that you saved.
- A little eight-year-old girl.
- Yeah.
Then the fact that it was a child, perhaps, that moved you in some way?
Call me old-fashioned, but I've always had a soft spot for kids with guns pointed at their heads.
But seriously, you could have easily have been killed.
I can't tell you how many times
I've been told that,
- but here I am.
- And here you are.
Let's take a few questions from the audience.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Flappy.
Hi.
I'm glad you killed that worthless piece of trash.
I didn't kill him.
- I didn't kill him.
- You're no hero.
Now, is there a ceiling on how much crap we, as Americans, have to tolerate from like this?
Also, I was wondering if you'd consider doing another kind of party?
Umm... I didn't quite catch the first part of that question.
And as for the latter...
I didn't get that either.
I still do parties for kids!
Only humans can he heroes, right?
Tell that to Walt Flannigan's dog, a gutsy pooch who pulled his screaming master from a burning comic book store.
That story and other hometown heroes...
Don't.
Flappy.
- May I suggest a sandwich, sir?
- You may suggest nothing.
Please... he's a fucking party clown.
There's not too many of them.
Now find him and get back to me.
Jesus H. Christ, are you still out here from last week?
- Well, if it isn't Mr. Funny Pants.
- It's not his fault.
There's been a horrible wind shear all morning.
Relax.
Where have you been?
You're an hour late.
Somebody's got to secure our positions at the top of the entertainment biz.
Damn.
You're not even fucking listening.
All right, Marty, what's on your mind?
Well, Gil, how would you like to be responsible for programming one of the most popular kiddie shows of all time?
Well, Marty, I'd love it.
Kind of missed my window, though.
Sesame Street's been on for quite some time.
I'm talking about now, about a new show.
Gil?
I'm talking about Flappy.
- Who?
- He said Flappy.
I know what he said.
Stand over there, please.
You've got to tell me what you're talking about
- before I can give you an appraisal.
- First off, it's not a what.
It's a who. And he's making a big splash, Orca-style.
It's the hero clown.
The one who saved the little girl.
- The father and guns and everything.
- Boring.
He's become a media darling.
It's already transcended the local networks.
This guy has been on two nationwide tabloid shows.
And he's scheduled for prime time tonight.
And what did you say his name is again?
Flappy.
How can you not love that?
Not loving it.
Fine.
It's all right.
Just work on your... let me tell you about this one time
I brought this other kid's show
- to Gil's attention.
- Hey! Hey!
We agreed never to bring that up again.
Not even in jest.
Nobody knew that big, fat purple bastard would have such staying power.
Who is this Flappy guy?
People save kids every day of the week.
I heard some flea-footed dog saved his master.
- You want to give him a TV show too?
- People love him.
If you're a parent and you haven't secured him for your kids' party, forget it.
You're meat. They hate you.
This guy's gonna be big!
I can feel it.
That prehistoric shitbag, dude, he's scrapnel.
This Flappy is prime fucking rib!
- Strike while the iron's hot!
- All right. Listen.
We've got two months until our contracts are re-upped.
- If he's still as hot then...
- Listen.
- ♪ I love you, you love me... ♪
- All right!
All right, you pushy bastard.
Get this Flappy guy on board.
- Yes!
- No... and I repeat... no long-term deal, standard contract only.
I'm not marrying some wet-behind-the-ears rookie.
Gil?
Flappy's the word.
♪ Flappy's the word, is the word ♪
- ♪ Have you heard... ♪
- Marty, do you mind?
It's cool.
Flappy... you had better have me golfing with some players in Hawaii by year's end.
He will, sir. He will.
- The wedge!
- Wise choice, sir.
Look, I don't know who you're collecting for, but they can save a cell for me down in debtors prison.
Oh. Mr. Carlson.
Hi. No, I'm Martan Ingram.
Jayram Television.
You know, out at the highlands.
- Oh. I'm sorry. Come in.
- Thank you.
Come in.
You know how those bill collectors can be, wanting payment on goods and services, the nerve.
They can be trying. Ummm... let me cut right to the chase.
Have you ever done any television before?
A ton in the past few weeks.
Oh, the news, but I'm talking about before that.
Well, once I was eating at Ray's Ribtip Grill, and this old dude smashed through the window and killed this retarded kid, and they asked me for a comment on the 11:00 news.
Well... l...
I meant, have you thought of hosting your own show?
Well, I was trying to set up something on cable access,
- but air time doesn't come cheap.
- It can be pricey.
I was thinking that I... we, at Jayram... we're extremely enthusiastic about you hosting your own show.
Yeah, right.
Where's the camera?
Who are you,
Allen Funt's evil twin?
- You're serious?
- As a heart attack.
I always wanted to say that.
You'd be syndicated, which means that every kid, from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine, would be watching your show, or more specifically, you, the Flappy.
- I don't know what to think.
- I brought a contract along, and it's spelled out fairly clearly.
I was hoping we could... jeez...
I'm rushing you, aren't I?
God, I'm not even thinking this is sudden for you.
That's one way of putting it.
Surreal might be another.
Why don't we do this like real people?
Do you want to have dinner tonight?
If you want, feel free to bring your agent along.
- That's fine with me.
- I don't exactly have an agent.
Well... if we had to, we could wait.
No! I mean, no.
Why give those guys 10%?
It's just that my car is a bit on the fritz.
Not a problem. We'll send a car to pick you up.
- That would be great.
Ummm... why, though?
If you're partial to public transportation,
- by all means, take the bus.
- No, no. Why the show?
Why me?
I know I helped a little girl...
Helped her?
You saved her.
People remember things like that.
Have you ever heard of karma?
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.
Hi, Mom.
Visiting hours are over.
You have to leave.
The secretary said
I could drop by.
I'm sorry I haven't been by in a few days. I've been busy.
- I saw you on the television.
- You did?
That's what I'm here to talk about.
Of course, I was watching it in the community room.
I don't have a TV of my own, like everyone else here.
You will soon.
I have some pretty good news.
- Sure.
- No, I do.
Someone from one of the networks saw what I did.
It was a very stupid thing to do.
Some people think that.
It might not have been one of my smartest moves...
I don't know that you've ever made a smart move in your whole miserable existence.
I'm sorry about what I said.
When you talk about him...
I didn't mean it.
I got a little mad.
Can we forget it happened and start fresh?
I don't have to stand for that.
I know. I said I'm sorry.
I didn't come here to fight.
I came to tell you that I got a job.
On television!
Television?
They must have put you on as a maintenance man.
You have no skills.
What could you be qualified for?
I'm a clown, just like
I've always wanted to be.
It finally worked out.
For a while, it looked bleak, and I thought I might have to give it up, but I'm glad I didn't!
Still with the clown business?
You'll go nowhere with that.
I've tried to drum some sense into that skull of yours for years...
Mom, you're not listening.
I have my own show, my own regular TV show.
It will be called, Flappy's Fun House.
That's an absurd name.
They thought of the name.
But it'll be pretty good.
It has some positive messages, and no violence.
The idea is that it teaches and entertains at the same time.
What parent in their right mind would let their child watch such foolishness?
It won't last.
Even I can see that.
You'll end up right back where you started.
Seems you were born to be a bumbling idiot.
What is so hard about being happy for me?
Why can't you say anything nice?
Why bother telling you?
I'd just as soon you didn't annoy me with such asinine fairy tales.
- Television!
- Want me to show you the contracts?
- What do you need? Written proof?
- Maven on the move.
What you need to learn is what you do is nothing more than a hobby.
It's a job, not a hobby.
Yes, well, you've overstayed your welcome.
Go on, get out!
Bring some good news back with you next time, not some bullshit about having a real job!
I'll believe you have a real job the day you can walk in, and your hands aren't softer than a newborn's ass.
Out! I don't want to hear it.
You make me ill.
Well, kids, you won't believe this, but that's all the time we have for today.
Have no fear. We'll do it all again tomorrow, with more fun and excitement on Flappy's Fun House!
Yeah!
Now, I want to thank you, and you, and you, for helping me make this first show a big success.
I want you to do what Flappy did.
Stay in school and take care of yourself, because you know what?
You're the only you you've got.
And I'm not clowning around!
- Excuse me.
- You are a natural.
- You realize that, don't you?
- Hello, Flappy. Martan
Cinnamon, get the door.
These kids, they just...
- they love you.
- They do, don't they?
Absolutely.
I'm no psychic friend, but I'll bet that within a year, you'll be more popular than "It's Scotty" and those powerful Rangers.
- Really?
- Yes.
Fuck.
It came, Mommy!
- Flappy sent the video!
- So he did.
- Want me to open it for you?
- "Want me to open it for you?"
Would you two shut up?
I'm trying to watch a picture here.
- Shut up, you old fool.
- Shut up, old fool.
Hey, I don't want her talking to me like that.
- Can I watch it now?
- You certainly can.
What? I was watching something.
I noticed.
It's just that I don't care.
- What? I pay the damn rent!
- Watch your English around her.
What does that say?
Volume eight?
Have you been buying that crap and not telling me?
- What is it?
- It's Flappy's Funhouse!
I can read. What's a Flappy?
I like and love Flappy.
- That tells me nothing...
- Leave her alone.
Leave me alone. He's mad
'cause Flappy's better than him.
All right, that's it.
I'm going out with my boys.
We're bowling tonight.
- League champs, I might add.
- Oh, I care.
Do they have social lives?
I have never seen two grown men who'd rather hang out with their father constantly instead of going on dates, or at least attempting to meet women.
Oh yeah?
Maybe that's what we're doing.
- Have you considered that?
- Who in their right mind would be interested in you?
I can't believe I was for that fleeting moment.
You know, that front door hasn't moved.
Look at this. A clown.
How unique.
No one has ever thought of putting a clown on TV before.
You people are so easily taken, especially you.
My name's William, and I love to suck cocks.
I love... to suck cock.
For kids.
Gee, Ed, if I had known you were gonna develop such an affinity for it,
I'd have signed you up for his fanclub.
- Mom!
- What's the matter, jackass?!
He sure is one.
I was like, " 10 grand for a store opening?"
I felt like
I was robbing the guy.
I half expected him to ask me for help trafficking black market babies to Mexico.
I'd do it for 10 grand.
Which way to the border?
I'm getting another call.
Don't forget we're having dinner with Phil at Raskin's tonight.
I'll give you a call around 8:00.
Talk to you then.
Hello?
Hello, fuckface!
- Who is this?
- Say it isn't so.
You've forgotten me already.
And after we were so... familiar.
- What the hell do you want?
- It's all coming back to you now?
I thought it might.
What do I want?
That's a good question.
Immortality? Legendary status?
Wait! I've got it! $50,000!
For what?! Count yourself fortunate your ass isn't in jail.
I should have called the cops on you, you sick fuck!
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
I'll show them the goddamn tape.
I'll bury you!
What tape?
You put on a good performance that night.
You took off the clown garments... did it all.
The show was good.
Worth the money.
I didn't put on any show.
You know it.
What does your tape show?
What you did to me?
Go ahead, shoot yourself in the foot, by all means.
You're trying to call my bluff.
That's not all the tape shows, handsome.
It shows you getting down, but it seems you like talking about what you do.
- I don't believe you.
- That's fine.
It's just that my boy Gino, if there's one thing he likes it's fooling around with that camera, making little movies, editing...
I knew it. Give me my video.
Now listen. You'll want to work with me on this.
If I show that tape to a few people... the right people or the wrong people, depending on how you look at it...
Flappy's in for a world of trouble, wouldn't you say?
What assurance do I have that this tape even exists?
- Once you get the money, then what?
- You get the tape.
This is the only one?
How can I be certain another one won't mysteriously pop up?
- You can't be.
- Then why would I agree?
Because you have no choice,
Mr. Fuck-face!
Stop calling me that!
- When?
- Tomorrow.
How about the corner phone at Snub and Cornwall?
- I suggest you be there and wait.
- I want to know now.
I'd let you know right now, but I have my eye... on the most delicious young gentleman.
Couldn't be more than seven.
So supple at that age, so... goodbye, fuck-face!
What?
When you told me what happened that night, you didn't mention a video camera.
Think hard.
Are you sure you don't remember?
I'm sure.
I could barely remember anything the next day, let alone a year later.
What are the chances he would hold on to something like that?
I think he's bullshitting you.
That's the thing. I don't know.
I'd like to believe he is... but I'm not sure.
I don't think he is.
What are you going to do?
I'll pay him the money.
What do you think?
- Why?
- Why?
Take a look around you.
I worked hard to get where I am, and I won't let some pissant take it away.
- $50,000 is a lot of money.
- It's a gamble.
I just hope this is it after this.
Then we can threaten him with extortion after paying him.
That's insane! Why should we give him anything after what he did?!
- "We" aren't giving him anything.
- Fine.
Then what you should do is use the money to hire somebody to storm into his shitty house, beat his ass, get the video and then we'd be done with him.
He's a crazy old fuck.
How much of a threat can he be?
Are these yours?
You should never have cut school today, young man.
See what happens when you're truant?
Dad, he don't look so good.
And you do?
- Right now, let's go!
- Dad!
He smells like shit again.
- I do not!
- Stop.
Gino, do you plan on fucking it sometime today?
Well, I was thinking, since he doesn't look so great...
- what if I just finger-fuck it?
- Oh God.
Dad, Gino's scared of the little man's tiny hole.
I wish you would, fecal freak!
Did you ever see that movie?
This little guy around his age... he's walking to school and gets kidnapped.
Next thing you know, some psychic sticks her nose where it doesn't belong.
In the end, the kid gets saved, lives to see the light of another day.
Damned her clairvoyant ass anyway.
No fortuneteller will come busting through that door to save your sweet little hide.
I'll tell you what will happen.
You will take my man-size cock between your pretty little lips.
Then, it's time to give up the ghost.
I'm not sure you know what that means.
It's pain. It's darkness... forever.
You're gonna die, you dainty little fuck!
This is how I kiss.
And I'm gonna kiss you all over.
If there was a way to be certain...
You should have done something at the time.
It's fucking ironic is what it is.
A year ago, we could have nailed his ass to the wall.
It's a little too late for
"should haves" and "could haves."
What I have to worry about now is how to get the money to him without any traces back to me.
This is unreal.
He's going to get away with it.
Clean it up.
- He means you too, genius.
- Go on and clean.
Quit it, Frankie.
Hello?
I know you have it.
You would never let me down.
- No.
- Your mama didn't raise no fool.
Cut the shit!
This ain't no tea party!
Feisty. Don't get wise with me, Mr. Fuckface!
You're fucking with the bull.
You know where I'll stick those horns.
Here's the news.
You'll be looking for a '64 Skylark.
Damn, that was a good year.
My Frankie had his first piece of dick in a car like that.
Anyway, pull up the back-seat and put the case in.
After that, tell that old bastard Barron that's not quite what you wanted.
Can he suggest something else?
When he does, that's where you'll find your end of the deal.
That yard has ears, boy.
So don't try pulling any slick shit.
Money, then the tape.
Anything else would be a tragic fucking mistake.
Capice?
"Do not enter."
That's what you read.
Back it up.
Skylark? I've got one. A '64.
I got to shoot straight shit with you.
She's an ugly old whore.
- Ain't much to look at it.
- That's fine.
Joe-Joe, run to the pharmacy and get me some eye douche.
- You do it!
- Chop! Chop!
Got to keep these monkeys dancing.
What's with the case?
Are you a stockbroker?
No.
Holy shit!
You're not in the syndicate, are you?
One of those La Costra Nostra?
You got a machine gun in there?
No, I sell pools.
- Where's the car?
- You might as well be in the mob.
The prices you charge ain't nothing but a shakedown anyway.
I sell them,
I don't own the company.
I heard that before.
Well... here she is. What do you think?
Last one in the yard.
At least in this yard.
Yo, Pops, you got a problem with one of Tony's aftermarkets.
Tell him to hold his water.
I'm with a customer.
He said, " Go to hell and get your wrinkled ass on the phone."
Kick the tires.
Look it over, do something.
I'll be right back.
So what do you think?
Want me to gift-wrap her?
I was hoping you could suggest something else.
Listen, Mr. Pool,
I have hundreds of cars.
You have to tell me what you're looking for.
I'm not the Kreskin of the junkyard.
You are Mr. Barron, right?
I sure as shit ain't jolly Saint Nick.
Shit.
I'd hate to be that guy.
Shit!
Fuck!
Damn!
What I'm saying is he fucking ripped me off!
There still could be a tape.
Why wouldn't he at least give you a copy, just to let you know he has one?
I think he's full of shit.
It doesn't make sense.
The fact that you think this guy deals with anything on a rational level speaks volumes of how stupid you can be!
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
I know you're not used to me being the voice of reason, but you have to do something.
You gave him a chance, you didn't get the tape.
You don't want to hear this,
- but you should go to the cops.
- Let's get something straight.
Calling the cops is not an option.
Not until I decide it is.
He won't go away by himself.
You haven't given him a reason.
I know.
I'll be right back.
- Hey!
- Shitting with the common man?
I thought they built a throne for your golden asshole?
- What do you want?
- An autograph!
We got your money.
We spent some already.
We were talking over dinner on how you were a sweet boy, so beautiful before the consummation.
We want an encore performance,
- where you get fucked hard.
- Fuck this shit!
Easy. I wouldn't recommend declining the invite.
If I show that tape, you go back to being a party whore.
You don't show up, you get fucked in more ways than one.
I want to taste you again.
- Get your hands off me!
- Oooh... that's how I like it.
I'll be in touch, Vulgar... to let you know about the party.
Make sure your tits hang out.
If you don't follow my rules, people might see things that could get a corn-holer like yourself into some pretty hot water.
I'm going to fuck you again!
Shit! What happened?
What happened?
He was waiting for me in the bathroom.
Shit!
- Did you call security?
- They're gone.
Fuck.
What did he say?
He said... he said he wants us to kill him.
Hey, man!
- Have you seen my shirt?
- You're wearing a shirt.
Get back inside.
Good to see you. Haven't been down at the car wash in a while.
You know that tall jigger Lamont, started working there about a month ago?
No. Can we go inside?
He's this big jerk-off claims
I owe him 20 bucks.
"Fuck that shit," I said.
That's when... bam!... he hits me in the mouth!
Like I said, he's pretty tall, so I'm going to stay away till he cools down.
Sounds like a good idea.
Yeah, Lamont, he's... as tall as Jay James, but he's got the muscles of James, Sr.
He walks around like he owns the place, slapping people in the mouth, taking people's jumpsuits.
I fucking hate it when that fuck's there.
Anybody around?
Don't mind the mess.
Hey, boy.
This is Larry.
I'm thinking of changing it to something else.
That name reminds me too much of Lamont.
- If only you were Lamont.
- Tuott.
Sorry.
Can you give me a hand over here?
Can you believe I found this?
Right near the garbage just waiting for pick-up day.
Between you and me,
I found it in some guy's garage.
I'm sure he would have thrown them out.
What an idiot.
These two don't have any bullets.
That's a BB gun.
Oh.
These two do have bullets.
And they come with these things that go on the end.
- Silencers?
- Yeah.
They make the gunshots...
My friend told me that.
He said it's good because they don't have serial numbers.
You need any skag?
No, I'm good.
Do you feel like you're going to throw up?
I do.
Where did you get this car?
Whose is it?
Would you calm down?
You're making me nervous.
I bought it for cash.
It's untraceable.
One of Tuott's associates helped me a little.
I can't believe so much of our faith is placed in an arch-junkie.
We wouldn't have gotten this far if it weren't for him.
Thank God for Tuott.
I want to be certain of one thing.
Are you still 100% on this?
Yes. I told you that already.
I'm not going in there to have you pussy on me.
- We have to be in and out.
- I know.
The longer we stay, the better chance we have of getting caught.
And if we get caught, we go to jail.
And what they did to you will seem like a church social compared to what goes on in prison.
You've never even gotten a speeding ticket.
How would you know?
Did you ever see "Caged Heat"?
It is the same thing, except totally different, because you're with guys.
- Got some coffee change?
- Sure don't.
Come on, just a quarter.
It won't break your bank.
Fuck you, tightfist!
My legs feel like rubber.
Maybe they thought we called the cops.
- I doubt they're even in there.
- They're in there.
- I'm scared.
- So am I.
All right. Just walk in, do what you have to do... in and out. Can't be any more dramatic than that.
- I'll be right behind you.
- I sure hope so.
Hold on.
Is it him, Dad?
- Please God, let it be him.
- Hold on.
Gentlemen, the hole has arrived.
Calm down!
Don't go blowing your loads yet.
Boom-boom, in and out.
- Are you alone?
- What do you think?
Get your candy ass in here, then!
You must think your shit smells like a spring rain.
Walk right by me like I wasn't a person.
Next time I ask you a question, answer me.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
It's mine now, motherfucker!
What do we have here?
Look at you and all your finery.
Isn't he easy on the eyes?
Not really, Pop.
Give me a hand, buttercup.
Let me lead you on a trip down on memory lane.
Do him like you did last time, Dad.
Gino, last time,
Daddy had him...
- I know, because I was there.
- No, you weren't, liar!
You're such an idiot!
You know what I'm going to do?
I'll take you to court for slander.
- You're a law-breaking freak.
- What are you talking about?
Shut up! You're scaring him!
Show us what you got hiding under there.
- Gino, are you getting this?
- Yes. I'm not stupid.
A little more.
Shut that goddamn thing off!
I think somebody was fuzzy with the instructions.
What were you thinking when you got dressed?
You're here for me tonight.
Did that slip by you?
Are you brain damaged?
Turn it on. Don't miss one second of this.
High and hard until we beat the shit out of him.
High and hard. No other way with a fuck like this.
You treat him...
Don't shoot.
We're sorry.
Oh God.
Is that the game we're playing?
You try to kill my boys, my flesh and blood?
As it stands, you've got the hardest night of your life ahead of you.
I hope you watched the sun rise this morning,
- 'cause it was your last chance.
- Suck it!
Want me to shoot him?
Let me fucking shoot him,
Daddy!
How does it feel?
You know what's coming?
Don't fool with that thing.
Dad, tell him to put it down.
Shut up, chicken-shit!
Cut it out!
Dad, he's gonna hurt somebody.
Frankie, listen to your brother and put the gun away!
Frankie?
Frankie?
Frankie! You'll be all right.
Just a couple of stitches you'll need.
Frankie.
Listen to your dad!
Why did you do that to my brother?
My brother!
You fucking, fuckhead!
You fucking pervert!
I got your man.
I want some money!
Syd, get up!
I fucked up.
We're going to get caught.
- What were we thinking?
- Stop it. You didn't fuck up.
- Yes, I did!
- You didn't! We won't get caught!
Get into the car and out of here, all right?
- Get out of here!
- What about you?
I'll meet you back at the house. Go!
All right. You caught me.
Now what are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
Go ahead, you piece of shit. Do it.
It doesn't matter anyway.
You're finished, fuck-face!
Finished!
You're a murderer now.
You killed my boys.
You're going to prison. I have proof.
You don't have it in you anyway.
You're shaking.
Even in this light I can see it.
You're scared.
Just lie down and take it.
I know you haven't got the guts.
So do you.
Not like this.
By this fuck.
Goddamn you, fuck-face!
Fuck you!
Flappy! Flappy!
Get down!
Well, once again, injustice KO'd by Flappy, of Flappy Funhouse fame and our Special Girl Friday, Bella.
Let's have a big round of applause!
And let's have a bigger round of good-natured boos for our purveyors of quite a bit of nastiness around Flappy's Funhouse.
Our criminal clown brigade!
Thanks, Bella.
Now, that's all the time we have for today, kids.
Don't be like these guys.
Stay in school, and take care of yourselves.

NARRATOR: For weeks, rumors have spread across Mars,
from outposts to settlements, from town to town.
Something that had been buried for centuries has just been uncovered.
And as this mysterious force moves across the southern valley,
it leaves behind only silence and death.
Take your seats, please.
I just talked with the Cartel.
They're concerned that the rumors are getting out of control.
They'd like to make a statement in two hours.
Some of you may not know we've had another incident.
At 1520 hours yesterday a freight train, Trans Marineris 74 Yankee,
returned from the southern valley on auto pilot.
GUARD 1: Get to your security stations now!
GUARD 2:
Okay, let's move!
INQUISITOR: Initial reports indicated it was a ghost train.
It appeared no one was aboard until a single
survivor was discovered in a rear compartment.
GUARD 3:
Call for Med-Tech backup.
INQUISITOR:
Lieutenant Melanie Ballard, second officer for a squad of escort police.
They were assigned to transfer a prisoner from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine back here to Chryse.
Lieutenant Ballard was taken to hospital under guard.
She had superficial wounds but was in otherwise good physical condition.
However, traces of an illegal substance,
tetromonochloride, were found in her system.
MAN: Everything will be all right.
Take it easy.
Bring her in, please.
Lieutenant Ballard, please be seated.
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police officers have rights these days?
Representation by counsel won't be necessary.
Your rights are protected by the Matronage.
You can speak freely.
Then I'm not being charged?
INQUISITOR: Sit down, lieutenant.
This is a discovery hearing, and your presence is required as ranking officer.
I want your After Action Report.
Where's the rest of your team? The prisoner you were sent to pick up?
What happened at Shining Canyon?
Last Friday at 1750, we were slamming through a dust storm
on the edge of the southern valley.
74 Yankee was an ore hauler servicing the mines in the outer sector.
My squad was hitching a ride into Shining Canyon.
JERICHO:
You beat me.
Looks like you've played Tarts before.
DESCANSO:
No, I never done this.
JERICHO: Let's spin them again.
One down and one up.
Fuck me, the Five of Bats.
You've got the Wheel.
What's your wager?
Five bucks.
[DOOR SLAMS]
Helena. Hey.
Sorry.
Weather station's tracking a huge storm across the southern sector and we're right under it by now.
What's the mark on it?
3200 klicks.
We should be there by 1800.
[RUMBLING]
So, urn, just let me know if you need anything.
HELENA:
Melanie!
You high?
Fuck, Helena, it's just Clear.
Be straighter than this track long before we hit the canyon.
You better be. This prisoner transfer is no sleepwalk.
We're picking up
James Williams.
You mean
“Desolation" Williams?
Cooling his heels in the Shining
Canyon jail. Deep solitary.
What's the charge this time?
Murder.
Man's been up on murder three times.
He gets off every time on self-defense.
It's different this time. Sounds like he finally went psycho.
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.
Williams shows up at the Shining Canyon
Mine with some bizarre-ass story.
Sends three officers to the medevac before they locked him down.
You starting to see the picture?
All we got is you, me and this new guy Jericho and a couple of rookies.
HELENA: What do you think of Sergeant Jericho?
I mean, I was hoping we'd get a good, solid woman we could count on.
MELANIE: I don't know.
I guess we'll see.
Well...
I need you straight,
Melanie.
Don't worry about that, commander.
I'm as straight as they come.
Such a shame.
Check on our transfer schedule.
McSIMMS:
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
They ready for us?
This storm is really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.
Here's your coffee,
Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites, just the way you like it.
You want some?
No, thanks.
How long?
About 40.
Shining Canyon?
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee...
ETA, 40 minutes.
Everybody, check your equipment.
I don't want any surprises.
Is everything all right, lieutenant?
I couldn't help but notice that charming little scene with the queen bee.
Yeah, well, you know how the service is, sergeant.
She figures if I want to make captain, I'll have to pay the price.
The thing is, I don't give a damn about wearing another bar.
Yeah, it could be that.
Or she just has good taste in women.
Sergeant, you are seriously out of line.
I'd hate to spoil my record.
All right.
I know you think you're some pretty tough hombres.
You've had the best training, you have the best gear.
You probably think this is a routine prisoner transfer.
But that's what I want to bang into your heads.
There's nothing routine about this prisoner.
We are here to pick up
James "Desolation" Williams.
I want you all jack-ready and double-tough.
Officers, you can disembark here.
What time is departure? We'll need at least a half an hour to secure our prisoner.
We got about a four-hour turnaround and we're due back at this spot at around 2200. You can report anytime after that.
See if you can raise the yard master, will you?
Ed?
Ed, you out there?
HELENA: Rookies, use your breathers.
We're not going to have air like Earth for 10 more years.
Let's go.
God, I hate this thing.
You'll get used to it.
Two years ago we were still wearing full-face breathers.
Takes about a month to get over the headaches out here.
Huh.
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.
MELANIE: First time in the boonies, eh, rookie?
JERICHO:
Standard layout.
Just another shitty boomtown like all the others. Seen one, you can go home.
MELANIE: You're always cold, you can't get a decent shower and they don't tell you a one-year contract here equals two years
Earth time.
Gotta read the fine print.
JERICHO:
Where is everybody?
Yeah. Friday night, the place should be packed.
I mean, a whole 12 hours before sunup and there's money to burn,
whores to fuck and drugs to take.
Instead we got a graveyard.
Maybe they're all inside spending their money.
Me, I'm gonna get us squared away at the RecFac.
You and Sergeant Jericho check in at the jail.
MELANIE: Save some hot water for me.
Where were you before Chryse?
Utopia.
It was the arse end of the universe.
A penal camp full of work-amnesty cutthroats.
Sounds nasty.
But you seem to be holding together all right.
What you see is nothing.
I have numerous hidden talents.
Need some help with that?
You're persistent, aren't you?
I've changed a few minds in my time.
Not many of us breeders around.
I'd hate to miss a chance to give it a go.
What do you say?
[DOOR CLATTERS]
[CLATTERING]
Hello.
Anybody here?
[OVER PA]
Officer to front desk.
Well, hello, Mr. Williams.
No one's seems to be about.
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
You want me to pop the lock and oust the prisoners?
What do you mean, “pop the lock"?
It's a level-eight security door.
I got a mystical way with locks and mechanical objects.
There isn't a machine on
Mars that doesn't love me.
How about we check with the commander first?
So, what do you do for fun, then?
Are you a gambler?
No, I'm short-time, sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.
Let me put it this way.
Maybe I'd sleep with you if you were the last man on Earth.
But we're not on Earth.
JERICHO: It's a voltage overload, most likely.
You wanna check it out?
It's probably nothing.
But, on second thought...
Police officer.
Anybody there?
Oh, Shit!
Jericho!
This is not making me happy.
All right.
It's time to get backup.
JERICHO:
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
I almost killed you.
MELANIE: What's going on?
RecFac's a slaughterhouse.
What?
“Slaughterhouse"?
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.
According to what Commander Braddock told me right after we first arrived in Shining Canyon, she and the two rookies headed towards the recreation facility.
Me, I'm gonna get us squared away at the RecFac.
You and Sergeant Jericho go and check in at the jail.
MELANIE: Save some hot water for me.
Descanso, sweep left.
Bashira, stick with me.
Bashira!
Bashira!
Officer to train, do you read?
The casino, the barracks, the dining hall, the rec center. No one alive anywhere.
Commander?
What?
I can't reach the train.
Well, keep trying.
What do you think?
How we doing?
I don't know. This thing was built to stay locked.
And Williams is still locked up?
What do you mean?
Williams was arrested on the suspicion of murdering six rail workers and a payroll courier up at Klick 305 Hub Station.
The bodies were hung and decapitated, just like the bodies found in the RecFac.
So how did they pin that on Desolation?
He showed up here with the courier's payroll.
The cashier realized it was a stolen scrip. They made the arrest.
There's gotta be a day log here somewhere.
Sergeant's desk.
Here.
Last night the mine called in a work stoppage.
Reported winds gusting up to 60 knots.
Sixty?
That's what it says.
Anything else?
Arrest for theft...
Then nothing.
[WHIRRING]
Got it.
What's the hell going on around here?
We haven't had a meal or a piss break in six hours.
Descanso, open the door.
All right, everybody. Answer "here" when I call your name. Akooshay.
AKOOSHAY: What?
Just answer "here."
Yeah.
HELENA: Zimmerman.
I'm right in front of you.
Benchley.
Who's that?
AKOOSHAY:
She showed up last night.
Checked herself in. insisted on being locked up here with us.
Well, wake her up, sunshine.
Let's see what she has to say.
Hey, hey. Somebody wants to talk to you.
Who are you?
Whitlock.
What are you doing in the holding tank, Whitlock?
It's the only safe place at the moment, okay?
Can I go back to sleep now?
HELENA: No, you can't.
I need answers.
What's going on out there?
What's your ID?
Dr. Arlene Whitlock.
I'm the Spec Six Science Officer for the mine at Drucker's Ridge.
I left Drucker's about a week ago by means of a weather balloon I'd modified.
There was a disturbance in town.
Seemed prudent to get out.
Yeah, they said there was some sort of a riot, and the place destroyed.
Yeah, something like that.
I was adrift for several days.
Ran out of food.
I followed the rail road tracks until I got here.
Ah, shit!
Then the storm forced me too low.
I hit a windmill and crashed.
They were kind enough to take me in here.
Well, wasn't that nice of them?
Mel, Jericho, go check out Williams.
See if he knows anything about this.
Williams?
Do you know what's going on outside?
Are you aware of what's going on outside?
Let's go. This asshole doesn't know anything either.
JERICHO: You got some balls calling him an asshole to his face.
That's Desolation Williams.
I heard he took out at least six when they cornered him at Deimos Station.
Yeah, and this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate, Jericho.
Just goes with the territory.
Yeah, well, in my case, it's a bit different.
Perhaps a connoisseur like yourself would appreciate what I have to offer.
[BANGING ON METAL]
Go get the commander.
[BANGING ON METAL CONTINUES]
Disarm her.
Officer!
It was almost like she was...
possessed.
Like a force was inside her.
Who was she?
She was a dispatch officer.
We tried to make her comfortable.
The rookies took her to a storage room in the back of the jail.
Then the commander and I went back outside to look around town.
What do you think?
That the Science Officer's lying.
Tell me again about Williams.
I didn't read the full file.
Caught him with the money but he said didn't kill anybody.
Huh, of course. They all just died of fright.
And then cut their own heads off?
[SCREAMING]
[MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Put down your weapon!
Put it down!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Call Jericho.
Sergeant Jericho, we need backup.
We're 20 southwest of the RecFac.
MAN: Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!
Who goes there?
MAN:
Can't fight it! It's in me!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Commander Braddock!
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING
AND SHRIEKING]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
There's a man in there. Open it.
The lock is destroyed. We're gonna need a cutting torch.
How long? At least half an hour, maybe more.
What the fuck is going on here, lieutenant?
He committed suicide. But before he slit his throat, he yelled something,
Something like:
“Stay away!"
"Don't open the door."
"Stay away."
And now the commander's gone.
Helena!
Maybe he was contagious.
Or crazy,
I don't know.
I say we take him at his word and leave him locked in.
Look, one of us has to stay with the rookies.
Why don't you go back to the jail?
I'll find the commander.
Let's get the hell out of this place.
There's nothing we can do for this guy.
You're right.
Okay, let's go.
Drop your weapon, or I'll cut this dyke-bitch head off!
What the fuck happened?
Bashira let him out for some food.
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.
What do you want, Williams?
I want to get the fuck out of here.
Okay. We'll let you walk, just let the girl go.
Think I'm falling for that shit?
I can't let you take the rookie.
Take me.
Okay?
Put the gun down.
Put them down!
MELANIE: Drop your gun, Descanso.
Yeah, drop the gun,
Descanso.
MELANIE:
Okay.
Relax! Take it easy.
Relax! Relax.
You're gonna get what you want.
I know I'm gonna get everything
I want. Now let's go.
[GRUNTING]
Damn, girl.
I like you already.
Shit.
You okay?
Just swell.
Where's Williams?
He took off out the airlock.
He ran into the clinic. Saw him go in not even two minutes ago.
Let me guess, he's got your shotgun, right?
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.
He's still in there, though. I can see the back door from here.
MELANIE: All right. You two take the back door.
I'm gonna go in the front and flush him out. If he comes at you, shoot to kill.
Hey.
[CREATURE HISSING]
[SNARLING]
[GRUNTING]
Now what?
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
How the hell did that happen?
MELANIE: Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like you're coming with me now.
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.
I said move it.
I ain't going nowhere.
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.
Now move it!
[INDISTINCT SHRIEKING
AND WHISPERING]
Let me ask you something, Desolation.
You're so innocent, how come we found all that stolen flash on you?
I didn't say I was innocent.
I said I didn't kill nobody.
Let's say I believe you.
What exactly happened at K-305?
I don't know. I was just changing trains from Camp Sinai.
Had a little time to get me something to eat.
So I went into the station.
MELANIE: It was just lying there, so you took it.
You would have done the same thing.
See, that's where you're wrong.
I'm a cop, not a crook.
It's a thin line between a cop and a crook these days.
You think it's a big difference between you and me?
You just got the Woman behind your bullshit.
Look at you.
You look high right now.
You know I saved your life out there.
So why don't you save mine, and let me out of here?
Look, my job is to bring you back to Chryse to stand trial.
I don't think you did it.
But that's not my call.
So let's not make this any more complicated than it has to be.
WILLIAMS:
It's gonna be real complicated.
Believe that shit.
I ain't going back.
So you secured your prisoner.
Where was your commanding officer during this time?
I can only report what Sergeant
Jericho told me later.
After the man in the rover committed suicide,
Jericho went looking for the commander.
Let's get the hell out of this place.
There's nothing we can do for this guy.
Yeah.
You're right.
Let's go.
Commander Braddock!

Lieutenant.
We got a situation here.
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.
The commander's dead.
JERICHO [OVER RADIO]: Everybody in the mine's gone insane.
Jericho, can you read?
[STATIC BUZZING]
Jericho.
BENCHLEY: Hey, hey, come on, let us out of here.
Start at the beginning!
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.
I told you I got here last night.
Don't bullshit me!
BASHIRA: Lieutenant.
Okay.
What the hell is going on out there?
What?
In semi-arid regions on Earth, there are certain organisms that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains.
When the pools dry up, those organisms can't live but they don't die either.
They go dormant.
Below the surface, away from the hot sun until the next rain cycle begins.
Then they reemerge.
I think something like that's happening here.
I don't understand.
Well, whatever used to live here, we woke it up.
It takes us, okay?
I'm talking about a kind of possession.
DESCANSO: Lieutenant,
Sgt. Jericho's on the radio.
He said he found three people out there.
They're on the way in. They got an ETA of 5 minutes.
You should get on the radio and talk to him.
MELANIE: The hell do you mean he's found three people?
DESCANSO:
That's what he said.
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
MELANIE: You Okay?
WHITLOCK: No.
MELANIE:
Is something broken?
No, I'm all right.
But it's out of the body now.
Yeah, it's loose in here.
Lieutenant, sergeant's on the radio.
JERICHO [OVER RADIO]: Lieutenant, we're coming in. Can you read me?
Sergeant, where are you?
We're right down the street.
We?
Who's "we"?
I found three people alive out here.
Come and open the door for us.
JERICHO: I tried to reach you on the radio.
Just you make sure that door is locked.
There must be 200 of them fucking freaks, and any minute now they're going to be coming down the street looking to kick our ass.
Okay. Relax.
Who are these guys?
I found them hiding up in the mine shed.
Lieutenant, we got a situation here.
MELANIE [OVER RADIO]: Sergeant, you're breaking up. I can hardly hear you.
The commander's dead.
And everybody in the mine's gone insane.
Check the window!
They didn't see.
Who are you?
Who are we?
Who are you?
The man asked you a question.
My name's Jericho.
At least he's not one of them.
What's happening out there?
Who the fuck are those clowns?
What are they all sparked up about?
UNO: Used to be miners. Then everybody in this place lost their mind running around, chopping people's heads off.
Ease up, man.
We were up on the rim when they called the work stoppage.
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
What are they doing?
Shit, I don't know.
TRES: Look at that. They're knocking off early for the night.
How are we gonna sneak into our shift change if they lock up early for the night?
Shut up!
What the hell is that?
[SCREAMING]
Let's get the hell out of here.
We hid until the storm was over.
Later, I went out to take a look around.
Thought they were all dead.
Then some of them started to come to.
They walked around like they were confused or lost.
A few of them seemed okay.
They was trying to help the others.
Then they started changing.
Changing? What do you mean?
They act different, stand different.
Start cutting themselves for decoration.
Filing their teeth.
Making weapons.
Killing the ones who hadn't changed.
[GRUNTING]
UNO:
Cutting people's faces off
and wearing them for masks.
You lads got any weapons?
I mean real weapons.
Only cops can have guns.
Some detonators in them cases over there.
Do you know how these things work?
I know you need dynamite to use them.
Okay then.
We take our prisoner and we all get on the train.
What prisoner would that be?
That's doesn't concern you.
If it's Desolation Williams, it concerns me very much.
Now drop your weapon.
All of you!
Weapons on the floor.
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.
[IN ENGLISH ACCENT]
We lied.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Now go get Williams.
I don't think so.
What was that?
MELANIE:
Fucking kill me.
No problem.
JERICHO: Look.
Will you two stop fucking about?
Lieutenant, let Williams out.
Give me one good reason.
I just gave you about
200 good reasons.
They're probably outside right now.
Doesn't matter that Williams is wanted for murder, and it doesn't matter that this lot are scumbags.
What matters right now is that we stick together to get out of here.
All of us, including Williams, including them.
Who are you calling scumbag, motherfucker?
Now quit with all your fucking stalling and take us to Williams!
WILLIAMS:
I'll be goddamned.
Whoo!
Finally.
Man, this town done went crazy.
We had to improvise.
You like it?
I love it.
I want you to let him out.
What's up, D?
I'm still shackled.
What, are you pigs on a fucking break? Free him up.
I knew you'd let me go.
It's been a long time.
WILLIAMS: I didn't think you all could do it.
Piece of cake.
It was my plan,
Desolation.
[IN UNISON] Fuck!
WILLIAMS: I thought you were watching the door?
I was!
Bitch, you better open this door.
I don't think so.
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Then your asses will never get out.
Someone will find you guys sometime probably tied upside down in here with your heads cut off.
Tell your dogs to quit barking so we can talk.
Put them down.
Put it down.
Listen to me, Williams.
We don't have a lot of time.
You need us and we need you.
We've all seen what's going on out there and none of us is gonna survive if we don't stick together.
I need you to give me your word that if I open this door you and your boys will stand by my command at all times.
I never give my word.
It's okay. I never make deals with criminals either.
You got it.
What? Oh, no. You're making deals with cops?
And you are too.
Give her your weapon.
Everybody, give it up.
Well, introduce us to your friends.
These are my
compadres.
Uno, Dos
Uno must be the nice one.
[UNO CHUCKLES]
UNO:
You got that right, butchy.
I'm not as nice as Desolation, and
I'll cut your fucking titties off--
MELANIE:
Who's in charge here?
You better let go of my arm.
Who is in charge here?
You! You!
Je-- You, you, you.
Shit!
You just gonna stand there and watch her break my shit?
Yeah, and now that you're done mopping the floor, why don't get me a beer, killer?
All right, what's next?
We get more deputies.
You're deputized. Consider this a martial law situation.
Let's go.
When did this start?
It started a few minutes ago.
MELANIE:
What should we do with him?
WHITLOCK:
We can't take him with us.
Then here he stays.
Guys, what is that?
It's a Laffer, a black-market breather.
JERICHO: It has a
15-percent nitrous mix.
It gets you high?
Turns your brain into Swiss cheese.
One gross of detonators.
What are those good for?
It would help if we had some dynamite, but they make a pretty good bang.
We could put them into food cans or something, make some hand grenades.
All right, you got 10 minutes.
Hey.
Easy.
Here, let me do it.
[UNO LAUGHING]
That's beautiful!
That's what you get, dumb-ass.
You gonna be okay to do this?
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
MELANIE: All right, it's almost 2200 hours.
Here's the plan, short and simple.
Descanso and Jericho take the lead, everybody else follows.
It's about 50 meters from here to the station. Bashira and I are in the rear.
Any questions?
Hey.
Put your hand down.
All clear.
Let's do it!
Hey, bro, I don't see no motherfucking train.
Hey, lady, we don't see no train.
It'll be here.
All right, come on, let's go!
Oh! That's the mine office!
What the hell are they doing?
It's like they're tearing the whole town apart, building by building
MELANIE:
Come on, pick it up!

Where's the train?
I don't know.
You don't know? What the fuck is that supposed mean?
Lieutenant Ballard, to the train. Come in.
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?
Yeah, it's the same as plan A.
You got any fresh ideas?

They couldn't open the door from the outside, so we were safe... for a while.
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.
Where's your brother?
He didn't make it.
Oh, God.
Uno was your brother?
Yeah.
[ROARS]
[CHANTING]
[SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Look at him.
Whatever's inside of him has waited a long time to get out.
I didn't understand their design, how they move.
It's got to be the wind.
Yeah. yeah, the wind takes them.
And then once their host dies, they just drift along the rail road tracks from town to town, human to human.
What a perfect creation.
Vengeance on anything or anyone that tries to lay claim to their planet.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
What did you see at Drucker's Ridge?
I was at the mine when they called a work stoppage.
There was a section 740, a scientifically significant find.
[EXPLOSIONS]
A 740 applies to any number of things found on Mars:
A biological organism, indication of water, things like that.
After we dynamited the mountain we discovered an entrance.
It was a tunnel carved into the rock.
It had been hidden underneath the outer walls for centuries
and someone other than man had carved it.
WHITLOCK:
Jesus!
MAN: What the hell is that?
WHITLOCK: I don't know.
MAN:
Get the hell out of here!
It was me.
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.
BASHIRA: I made contact with the train.
They're about three klicks north of town on a decoupling spur.
They said the tracks are blocked.
Can they get through?
Yeah, they're working on it.
[ROARING]
You okay?
Yes.
Barricaded the rear door.
Good.
There's a maintenance courtyard out the back enclosed by a 5-meter wall.
There's even a rover parked out there.
Maybe we can make a run for it.
No, we wait.
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.
[YELLING]
Well, if a train's coming, they better hurry up.
What's the matter with you?
You did good out there.
Yeah, right.
It's a fucked-up situation.
I never put too much faith in cops, but you did all right.
You trust me?
Hell, no.
You know, I really don't understand you at all, Desolation.
The only one looking out for me is me.
Doesn't that bother you?
Nothing bothers me.
I stopped worrying a long time ago.
Don't you believe in anything?
I believe in staying alive.
Yeah, but for what?
Stick around, I might let you know one day.
When?
When the tide is high and the water's rising.
[GROANING]
Doing okay in here?
Mel.
Check this out.
What about it?
It's pretty solid.
One way in and a back door out, leading to the rear entrance.
A good, sturdy door.
So, what's your point?
It's rather cozy, don't you think?
I don't believe this. You lured me back here to seduce me?
Well, the way things are going
I thought this might be our last chance to, uh, to dance.
Yeah.
[GUNSHOT]
BASHIRA: Fuck him, whatever the fuck he is.
It's out of him.
Everyone go! Now!
Let's take her out back.
What the fuck do you mean?
We ain't moving her anywhere.
It's taken her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.
Easy, man,
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.
Come on.
WILLIAMS: Let's put her down, before they hear us.
Oh.
This belongs to her.
Where did you get it?
I stole it.
Do you know what it is?
It's her stash.
This will mess with anything in there.
Bon voyage, Mel.
Come on. Let's get the hell back in here.
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
No...
I will not!
MELANIE:
I was aware of having thoughts or memories.
Like I'd been invaded by something, and it was trying to take me over.
Something inside of me wouldn't let that other thing take over, and I fought it.
I didn't know where I was at first, and then it hit me.
I was outside, alone...
unarmed.

Haven't heard any of these things speaking English.

Give me those keys.
Come on!
Is it you?
Yes.
It's me.
MELANIE: I had a glimpse of the Martians,
of their minds, of what they want.
They won't rest short of the destruction of any invading species.
As far as they're concerned, we are the invaders.
BASHIRA:

Shit. They made a battering ram.
All right, everybody to the rear of the jail.
Bashira, you and Jericho go back to the storeroom. Load up on detonators.
You're the second line of defense.
So we stay here?
We hold them off as long as we can.
Then we fall back to the storeroom.
You know soon as we kill one of them, whatever's inside's gonna come after us.
I know. So if one of us gets possessed...
Leave them.

What the hell happened to you?
We got trapped a couple of klicks north of here trying to offload.
I'll get us out of here.
We've gotta go back.
Slow down outside of town, then come to a complete stop.
No way.
I'm giving you an order.
I don't care.
The answer's no.
The answer's yes.
Look, even if we get back to Chryse those things will just keep coming.
We've got a chance here.
We've got a chance to stop this thing before it goes any further.
This is about one thing:
Dominion.
It's not their planet anymore.
What about him?
Isn't our job to take him back?
Is he still a prisoner, or is he one of us?
I can give a damn about saving this planet.
Seems like it's been after me since the day I was born.
If I die,
I'm gonna die fighting, not running.
Hey, Whitlock, if we blew up the nuclear power station, what would happen?
I mean, there'd be a huge explosion, right?
No, not unless you retract the control rods and expose the core.
Then what?
Well, then you'd have a small atomic bomb, going "boom."
MELANIE:
How small?
I don't know. It'd blow out a radius of a mile, maybe two.
Would it kill them?
WHITLOCK: It'd certainly destroy their human hosts, but as for them...
Hell, I don't know.
Jericho, can you get us in?
I can try.
MELANIE:
The plan was simple.
Sgt. Jericho, the science officer and I jumped off
the train and headed towards the power plant.
The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station.
The idea was they'd provide cover and distract
the Martians as we set the charges in the plant.
Then they'd swing back, pick us up,
Like I said, it was a simple plan.
The only problem was it didn't work the way it was supposed to.
How you doing, Jericho?
JERICHO: I'm working on it.
Hurry up.
[GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING]
I'm gonna remove the water jacket and destroy the containment shell.
Okay, so where do I put the dynamite?
Officer to the train, they've spotted us.
Get your ass back here now.

Stay here and keep it full throttle.
What are you gonna do?
Lighten our load.
I think there's some more dynamite in the rear car.

See you later, you big motherfucker!
You okay?
Say your prayers.
I didn't know you was cut this deep.
Should have taken care of this hours ago.
You do that like a pro.
Yeah. Me and my brother have been through a lot of battles ever since we was kids.
I never thought I'd go to war with somebody like you.
I know when you get to Chryse you'll tell those people that I helped you, and I wasn't the cause of all this mess around here.
Because I know they're looking for somebody to blame.
I swear to you, Williams, as soon as I get back,
I'm gonna tell my superiors all about this fucked-up planet.
They'll drop the charges as soon as they get the report.
Okay.
That ought to hold it.
When you get there, have somebody look at it.
I couldn't get it perfect, so it might leave a scar.
I'm getting a collection.
You'll be all right.
Comfortable?
Yeah.
I'll get you a blanket.
[HANDCUFFS CLICKING]
MELANIE:
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, this is where I get off.
What are you talking about?
We'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't let you turn me in.
I can't let you walk.
What are you going to do?
Fucking shoot me?
Look, there's nowhere to run.
Anywhere is better than hell.
Catch you later.
Yeah, right.
Shit.
And what happened to Williams?
MELANIE:
I don't know.
When I woke up, he was gone.
And you were handcuffed?
He must have done it while I slept.
At that point I trusted him.
That's all you have to tell me?
That's all I know.
INQUISITOR: All right, Lt. Ballard,
I suggest you get some rest.
You're dismissed.
Is our statement to the Cartel going to be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Attention all police personnel.
Report to your nearest munitions station immediately for weaponry assignment.

He's picking you up at 3:30 tomorrow.
And the bus leaves the high school for the airport around 5.
How's my suitcase working out for you?
Whoa, Mom, Mom, Mom, you gotta leave that on.
Yeah, it's like the tag made the last flight without the plane crashing or anything.
So I figure it's gotta be on the bag, or at least, with the bag.
For luck.
Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
I'm still here.
So 17, on the loose.
Senior trip with your friends in Paris.

Yeah, yeah. Dad, we're all set.
Does that mean go?
Don't know.
Look, this is for both of you, all right?
Have a great time.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.
- Both of us.
Let's go.
Alex.
- Yes?
- You take care of them.
- I will.
You know, I didn't think anything could look worse than my yearbook photo.
How do you think I feel having to look at you all the time?
- What the fuck does he want?
- Shh.
"The airport does not endorse solicitors. "
Death is not the end.
It will be for you if you harass my students.
- Hare Rama.
- Fuck off.
I have to ask you a few questions this evening.
Did you pack your bags yourself?
Have your belongings remained in your possession the entire time?
Mr. Browning?
Oh, yeah.
Have you received any packages from persons unknown to you?
- Same as your birthday.
- What?
September 25, 9:25.
Your birthday's the same as your departure time.
Because I looked at him.
Are you sure?
Lisa, wait up.
No, it's okay.
Fuck, that was good.
Dick.
- Hey.
Hey, George, Dad said both.
Both of us, all right, man?
Just give me some cash.
Hey, hey, knock it off.
Excuse me.
Catch.
You asshole.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
Alex, let's go take a shit.
- Why don't you go by yourself?
- No, dude. Listen, okay?
Listen, take some knowledge.
We're about to board a seven-hour flight.
The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets, all right, if that.
Now, let's say halfway through the flight, your body wants that food out.
You gotta go torque a wicked cable.
And then right after you, like, directly after you walks in Christa or Blake.
You want them to associate you with that watery sting in their eye?
That reflexive gag at the back of their throat?
John Denver.
Died in a plane crash.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
At this time, we would like to begin preboarding...
...of Volée Air Flight 180 to Paris through Gate 46.
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?
Go. Go.
Go. Ow.
Ow. That hurt.
Oh, my little baby.
That's a good sign.
The younger, the better.
It'd be a fucked-up God to take down this plane.
Hi.
A really fucked-up God.
Yeah.
Hi.
- Hey, Tod.
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna sit here.
- Can you switch seats with Christa?
- Oh, God.
You know, I would, but I got a bladder thing.
It's a urinary tract infection.
Let's go ask Alex.
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake so she and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he said he had some sort of medical thing.
Please?
Yeah.
You're so sweet.
- Thanks, Alex.
- Thank you, Alex.
You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.
Fag.
Did you really think we're gonna titty fuck them over Greenland?
You know, because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fucking Stuart Little.
Thank you.
Thanks, man. That's great.
Sorry I'm late.
That's my seat right there.
Hello?
- I'm going that way.
May I have your attention?
To properly fasten your seat belts, slide the flat portion into the buckle.
- Equipped with six emergency exits: Two in front, two over the wing, two in the rear.
All exits are clearly marked.
Follow the red exit signs and public lighting in the aisle way.
Flight attendants, prepare for departure.
All right.
- All right, all right.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Huh?
It's okay.
- I wanna go.
- It's fine.
It's okay, honey, I...
What the...?
Oh, my God!
Everybody...
No! No!
Christa! No!
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake so she and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he said he had some medical thing.
Please?
What's up, dude?
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your problem?
Alex, qu'est-ce que c'est?
- The fucking plane's gonna explode.
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.
- If this is your joke...
It's not a joke. It's not a joke.
- Alex, take it easy.
- That's it, sit down, Browning.
- It's going down.
- We will remove you.
- I'll remove him.
I'll remove myself.
- Excuse me.
Get off him.
- That's my seat right there.
This plane is going down.
Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.
Get off the plane.
- Stay where you are.
- Just sit tight.
The fucking plane is going down.
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.
Okay.
- I got my ticket here.
- Get off me.
Jerk.
- Hey.
- You got this?
No one gets back onboard.
- That's my call.
- Wait, please.
I've got 40 students going to Paris.
Please, please?
- Look, you must understand my position.
- I understand, and I apologize for Alex.
But one of us needs to be on that plane.
I cannot let students go to Paris for ten days...
Carter, no.
- Sit the fuck down, Carter.
Sit down.
Sit.
One of you can go on the flight. That's it.
Larry.
Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.
The rest can take an 11:10 flight.
It gets in three...
I'll stay.
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane, it's fine.
Hi, Mr. Murnau.
See, I was in the bathroom.
And the lock, it was stuck, and...
Oh, wait, I didn't fight with anyone.
Damn.
Thanks.
I just... I called your parents.
They're on their way.
We should be going.
Alex, talk to me. Tell me what happened.
I saw it.
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.
I saw it take off.
I saw out my window.
- I saw the ground, and...
- Carter.
The cabin, it starts to shake, right?
And the left side blows up.
And then the whole plane just explodes.
And it was so real. Just like how everything happens, you know?
You been on planes that blew up?
You must have fallen asleep.
Whoa, we get thrown off the plane.
We blow, what, a half a day in Paris...
...all because Browning has a bad fucking dream?
But wait, "The plane, it's gonna blow up, it's gonna blow up. "
- Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
- Tod.
The only trip you're taking is to the fucking hospital.
Get off him.
Hey, hey.
Alex, stop it.
Come on, now.
There they go, here we stay.
- You're paying for my trip.
- I wish you were on that plane.
- You fucking prick.
Oh, shit!
Call it in.
Security...
You're looking at me as if I caused this.
I didn't cause this.
Are there any survivors?
How should I know?
- What, you think I'm some sort of...?
He's not a witch.
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel,
National Transportation Safety Board.
We've contacted all your families.
They are on the way.
Is there anyone here who feels they might need a little medical attention...
...or spiritual counseling at this time?
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?
Well, the cause for the explosion is still undetermined.
The Nassau County authorities are on the scene.
Naval Search and Rescue en route. We...
Excuse me.
I'm Agent Weine. This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBI.
I understand how you all must be feeling right now.
I know it's gonna be difficult.
We're gonna ask you questions regarding today's events...
...while they're still fresh in your mind.
This will prove invaluable to our rescue attempts and any criminal investigation.
You said, "Listen to me.
This plane will explode on takeoff. "
How did you know that?
I got this feeling.
This weird feeling.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding the plane?
Did you take any sleeping pills, any narcotics, hallucinogens?
- Alex, do you take any drugs?
- No.
I saw it.
I saw it happen.
I saw the plane explode.
Did the feelings have anything to do with your saying...
...that you wished that Carter Horton was on the plane just before it exploded?
- No.
- Then why'd you say it?
Because I really didn't think it was gonna happen.
If that's the case, Alex, then why did you really get off the plane?
My brother, George, he told me to go and keep an eye on Alex.
And so he stayed, and...
He told me to get off the plane.
Larry Murnau said I should get back on, but I told him that he should go.
I sent him back on the plane.
All right.
Nobody forced you off the plane.
You said you weren't friends with those that were.
So, Clear, why did you get off the plane?
Because I saw and I heard Alex.
And I believed him.
Honey.
Oh, God.
There he is.
Over here.
Thank you for the ride.
You're looking at the first piece of debris...
...to wash ashore from Volée Air Flight 180...
...which erupted shortly after a 9:25 p. m. Takeoff...
...from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
There are no known survivors.
However, Coast Guard and Naval Search and Rescue efforts...
...are continuing at this moment even as jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.
Authorities are pessimistic about the possibility...
...of finding anyone alive from the ill-fated flight.
All 287 passengers are feared dead.
Amongst the travelers, a class of 40 students and four teachers...
...from Mount Abraham High School in southeast New York...
...en route to Paris on a field trip.
There are reports that several students were removed from the aircraft...
...moments before departure.
However, investigators remain guarded about the specifics of this incident.
Authorities from the National Transportation and Safety Board...
...and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have arrived at JFK...
...to begin the initial investigation.
Eyewitnesses at the airport, as well as on Long Island...
...report seeing the plane explode.
No other aircraft were visibly near Flight 180.
At JFK, air traffic controllers are corroborating...
...these eyewitness accounts.
After the explosion, debris apparently rained into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.
However, investigators are cautious about verifying these accounts...
...believing they'll learn more from the found debris when daylight arrives.
Thirty-nine days have passed...
...since we lost our 39 loved ones, friends and teachers.
As each day passes without a determining cause for the accident...
...we ask ourselves, "Why?"
Ecclesiastes tells us:
"Man no more knows his own time than fish taken in the fatal net...
...or birds trapped in the snare.
Like these, the children of men caught when the time falls suddenly upon them. "
And so, before we can heal...
...before we can escape the presence of death and time...
...we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial.
I hope you don't think because my name ain't up on this wall...
...that I owe you anything.
I don't.
Because all I owe are these people.
To live my life to the fullest.
Why don't you stay off the J.D., then, huh, Carter?
Listen. Don't you ever fucking tell me what to do, all right?
I control my life, not you.
Carter.
I'm never gonna die.
Hey, Alex.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I took my driver's test last week at the DMV.
Got a 70. It's the lowest score you can get, but I passed.
When I was done with the test...
You know the guy that drives with you?
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyways.
He goes, "Young man, you're gonna die at a very young age. "
Yeah. Yeah.
Is that true?
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.
If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say no?
Fuck.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Miss Lewton...
- Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.
I'm gonna go up.
Hey.
Hey.
I don't want you to take this the wrong way.
But I miss you, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I miss you too.
But my father, you know, he doesn't understand.
Yeah.
Hey, look, when he gets over this thing...
...you and me, little road trip to the city, you know?
Catch the Yanks.
Yeah. Yeah, all right, we'll do that.
Cool.
- Look, I'd better go.
- Yeah.
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in class, they're gonna let me read it.
It says what I'm feeling.
Take care, man.
Because of you, I'm still alive.
Thank you.
"We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast.
But when we say this, we imagine that the hour is placed...
...in an obscure and distant future.
It never occurs to us that it has any connection...
...with the day already begun.
Or that death could arrive this same afternoon.
This afternoon, which is so certain...
...and which has every hour filled in advance. "
What happened?
Where's Tod?
Alex.
Get out of here.
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?
You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane, he took his own life.
- No.
Time to go.
Look, he wouldn't do that.
Okay? He said to me we'd be friends again after you got better.
Why would he make plans with me if he was thinking about killing himself?
Mr. Waggner.
- Mr. Waggner.
Here we go.
Easy.
All right.
Here we go.
Let's go.
Almost autumn.
It's only the end of June.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition.
If you focus, one week into summer...
...you can feel almost feel autumn coming.
Kind of like being able to see the future.
Why were you at Tod's house last night?
I've seen enough TV to know that the FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.
They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...
...what caused the crash.
They haven't ruled out anything.
The fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough.
Not to mention that one of those people had a vision, or whatever...
...of the plane exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious.
And it doesn't help that the visionary's friend just committed suicide.
Why were you there last night?
Do you know what this is?
This is a...
Who's the spring-head guy?
It's you.
Not a likeness.
It's how you make me feel, Alex.
I'm sorry.
You know, like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is.
It's reluctant to take form.
And yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
In four years of high school, we haven't said one word to each other.
At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.
I didn't know where those emotions were from...
...until you started freaking out.
I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it.
You can still feel it, can't you?
Something from that day is still with you.
I know because I can still feel you.
That's why I was there last night.
You know,
I've never dealt with death before.
This could all be in our head.
It just feels like it's all around us.
It?
What if Tod was just the first?
Of us?
Is that something that you're feeling?
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.
One last time.
So maybe I would know.
Then let's go see him.
Easy.
Gives me a rush.
This place?
Doing something I'm not supposed to.
Come on.
Hurry up.
- Is that him?
- I think.
Why did they make him up like Michael Jackson?
Yeah, that's him.
But whatever it was that made him Tod is definitely gone.
Christ.
Shh.
Please.
You'll wake the dead.
Why did his hand do that?
Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasms.
Look, um...
- I'm his friend and...
- I know who you are.
What are all those tiny marks?
Cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.
Pulling at the wire?
If he was pulling at the wire, he wasn't trying to kill himself.
- It was an accident.
- In death, there are no accidents.
No coincidences. No mishaps.
And no escapes.
What you have to realize is that we're all just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.
Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental...
...the red light that we stop at or run...
...the people we have sex with, or won't with us...
...the airplanes that we ride, or walk out of...
...it's all part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Design?
Does that mean if you figure out the design, you could cheat death?
Alex.
You've already done that by walking off the plane.
Your friend's departure shows...
...that death has a new design for all of you.
Now, you have to figure out how and when it's coming back at you.
Play your hunch, Alex.
If you think you can get away with it.
But remember the risk of cheating the plan...
...of disrespecting the design could incite a fury...
...that could terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
And you don't even wanna fuck with that Mack Daddy.
Okay, then, well...
Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in and...
No harm. No foul.
I'll see you soon.
The mortician said that death has a design.
Okay.
I'm talking about omens.
How do we know that just by sitting here, by sipping this coffee...
...or breathing the air or crossing the intersection...
...that we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death...
...40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow?
We don't unless we open ourselves up...
...to the signs it's willing to show us.
I don't understand.
Did you see Tod die?
Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, no, it didn't, but I mean, it might as well have.
This is a message of something, Clear.
Or someone, hinting at a design.
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Coffee.
Starts with a C and ends with an E.
So does the word choke.
So, what, we're gonna choke to death?
I wanna hear you.
We'll go nuts if you start with this shit.
The mortician said that death has a design, right?
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton...
...messed up that design for whatever reason?
I saw death's plan, then we cheated it.
But what if it was our time?
What if we were not meant to get off that plane?
What if it still is our time?
If it is, then it's not finished.
And we will die now, not later.
Unless...
Unless we find the patterns and cheat it again.
After hearing you, I do believe...
...that Tod killed himself.
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.
You all right, man?
- Hey, baby, come on, not now.
- Carter.
Oh.
It looks like we have a bit of a reunion here.
- Let it go.
- When are you moving?
A couple weeks.
- That's too bad.
You dick.
- We're losing our favorite teacher.
Baby, come on.
Look, guys.
There's something I need to tell you, okay?
- Alex.
- And you lived here your whole life? Yeah.
And now she's gotta move all because of Browning.
Enough, both of you.
They died and we lived.
Get over it.
I will not let this plane crash be the most important thing in my life.
I'm moving on, Carter.
And if you wanna waste your life...
...beating the shit out of Alex every time you see him...
...then you can just drop fucking dead.
Okay.
You look like a smart shopper.
Well, thank you.
Let's just say you were to see this knife set in a department store.
What do you think you'd have to pay?
Wow, that's a huge knife set, but how many...?
Hello?
- Is Alex there?
Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah, just a minute.
It's Clear again. You wanna talk to her?
The economy kept trading volume below average today, and stocks...
Clear, he's in the shower.
- Can I get him to call you back?
- Sure, bye.
She's concerned about you.
I'm concerned about you.
Why won't you talk to her?
Or me?
- Which could put a cloud over both stocks and bonds.
Dad, you and Mom have both been a big help.
But there's something I need to understand before I can talk to anyone.
- The Dow down 75.
The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight...
...on the possible cause of the explosion of Volée Air Flight 180.
Officials believe deterioration of silicon insulation...
...on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump...
...may have leaked combustible fluids.
- A spark in the fuel switch...
- That's Tod's seat.
...in the fuselage may have ignited the fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump...
...which would have set off the catastrophic explosion.
The path of the explosion.
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.
They're dying in the order they would have died.
That's death's design.
Miss Lewton's next.
And whenever I can fall asleep, I just...
I see Terry Chaney.
And in the day, out of nowhere...
...I hear the sound of my own voice in my head...
...saying to Larry Murnau:
"No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane. "
Everything reminds me of that day.
Right, yeah.
I'm hoping a change will help.
It's just that I've lived here my whole life, you know?
And everywhere I looked were great memories.
And now all I see is Larry...
...and those kids, you know?
Just looking out my own front yard makes me feel nothing but fear.
Laura, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Right.
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.
What are you doing here?
I was just...
I was checking the air in the tire to make sure it's safe.
Get in the car.
Put on your seat belt.
I believe that Miss Lewton is next.
- Next?
- Yes.
Yeah, next, because there's this pattern that's occurring.
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?
Mom's favorite.
So, what about this pattern, Alex?
Did you see it in another one of your visions?
Did you catch it in some TV static?
You know, I never asked for what happened on the plane.
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.
But I saved six lives on that plane.
Six lives, and everybody in my entire school thinks I'm a freak.
And I'm not... I'm not suffering from posttraumatic stress.
I don't have a narcissistic deity complex.
I'm not going Dahmer on you guys.
This just is.
There is a pattern for us all.
There's a pattern for you, there is a pattern for you.
There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.
But I'm gonna break this one.
Alex, you came to our attention at first...
...because you were under suspicion in this plane explosion.
Now, I know you didn't blow up the plane.
And we were ready to move on, but then the other survivors started to die.
First, your friend Tod.
Then Terry Chaney, while you were there at the scene.
And now tonight we pick you up at Val Lewton's house.
Alex, nobody has control over life and death.
Unless they are taking lives and causing death.
Now, can you promise me that no one else is going to die?
No, I can't.
As long as I'm in here, it's out of my control, I'm sorry.
Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.
Thank you.
That kid gives me the creeps.
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.
That's not what I'm talking about.
There were a couple of moments there...
...where I almost believed him.
Can I tell you something?
Don't take this the wrong way.
But sometimes, you give me the creeps.
You've gotta stop this.
Stop this, it's a stupid mug.
You're out of here.
Pretty soon, you'll be gone.
You'll be gone.
Miss Lewton.
Miss Lewton.
Okay, all right, okay.
Just stay still, okay?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Miss Lewton.
Hey, Alex.
Dude.
I don't know where he is.
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?
Because I didn't believe him.
If he does contact you...
...I think it would be in the best interest of your safety if you called us.
Now, here's my card.
Toll-free number.
Interesting work.
Carter, you dick.
What are you doing?
Terry's name should be on this wall.
Shit.
Why'd you want us to meet you here anyway, huh?
Because they're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
That's why you're taking me.
Why would I wanna see him?
Because he knows which one of us is next.
So drive the speed limit, okay?
Oh, and don't pass on the right.
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.
You're the next one, man.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down.
So you guys drive down there, we'll meet around the middle.
It'll take half the time.
Do you think they're still up there?
Somehow, Flight 180, are they still in flight?
Somewhere, are they safe?
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...
...I used to worry so much about my parents dying.
Lying awake at night just worrying.
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was 10, my dad went into a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around. "
So on reflex, or thinking it was a friend joking, he did.
And the guy blew his head off.
Life became shit after that.
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.
She married this asshole...
...who my mom with my real dad would have crossed the street to avoid this guy.
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.
If that was the design for my father and my family...
...then fuck death.
God, I have thought a lot about that somewhere, Alex.
It exists, that place.
Where my dad is still safe.
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes that night and just kept driving.
Where me and my mom and my dad are still together...
...and have no idea about this life here.
Where our friends are still in the sky.
Where everyone gets a second chance.
Alex, we can't give up.
Look, I can't go home.
All right? After Miss Lewton, they're gonna be looking for me.
No, we're taking you to my dad's cabin.
It's only a couple miles from my house.
All right, Browning, you fucking warlock.
- Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
- Why do you think I was hiding?
Billy told the FBI he saw you running from her house.
I was running because they blame me.
They blame me for Tod, they blame me for her, for the plane crash.
The fire, like, caramelized her blood, Alex.
Your shoe prints were in it.
- Your fingerprints were on the knives.
- I told you they were not...
I'm not talking about whether or not you did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.
Did you know she was gonna be next before she was?
Yeah, I did.
- I knew.
- All right.
Out of us, who's next to see it?
Please, tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win a Super Bowl.
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.
I knew I should have felt up Tammy in the pool that time.
- What are you whining about? I'm next.
- He didn't say anything. Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Do you think it's gonna make it easier to know, Carter?
Huh? It's not, it's gonna make it fucking harder.
You know, you get off having control over me.
- You let me decide how to deal with it.
- It doesn't matter who's next.
Because we're all on the same list. All of us.
Oh, fuck. Really?
All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?
Me and Terry, we'll be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?
Carter, what are you doing?
Carter, slow down.
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you.
- Knock it off.
- May as well go out on my own free will.
Not with us in the fucking car.
- Jesus, Carter, no.
- Stop it.
Carter, stop the car.
Hey, what's the worry if it ain't your time?
I could get nailed and you all wouldn't give a shit, right?
- It's only me.
- It doesn't work that way, Carter.
And I fucking hated French class.
Control yourself.
- That's what I'm doing.
I know what you're doing.
And it's all right to be scared.
I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.
I control my life, I control my death.
You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
- Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
- What are you doing?
Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ.
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel.
Carter, stop.
Hands on the wheel, Carter.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Carter, easy.
I am so close to puking right now, you don't even wanna know.
We're afraid too, Carter, but we're not going to quit.
Stop what you're doing and stop this fucking car.
Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.
- Billy.
- Move it.
- Hey, open the door, Billy.
- Move the fucking car!
- Hey, open the fucking door.
Move the car.
Open it.
Open the door.
Easy, easy, open the door.
Open the door.
Billy, open the fucking door!
Billy, open it!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Carter, listen to me. Don't do this.
Goddamn it! Get out of the fucking car.
Carter, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.
This isn't the way.
It's not the way. Get out of the car.
- Come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!
- Carter.
- It ain't my time.
Oh, shit.
Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.
Carter, get out of the car.
Come on, get out!
I can't get out!
Alex! No!
Man, he really is next.
- Get out!
- Get out!
- Come on!
- Fuck!
Oh, God.
I saw it. I saw the belt.
- Scared now?
- It broke.
Bullshit. He saved your life again.
That's right.
You're next, Carter.
I'm staying the fuck away from you.
- Shut up.
- We don't need this shit right now.
I don't need it ever. What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.
Hey, fuck you, Billy. I'm not dead.
Oh, you will be.
You're dead, you're dead.
And you ain't taking me with you!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Jesus fucking Christ!
You should've been next.
You should've been next after Lewton.
That's the plan. That's the design.
- You should be dead.
- You're the fucking devil.
I saw the seat belt. I knew it would rip.
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.
Just like the explosion, I saw it.
- The police are coming.
- Fuck, I saved him.
Because I saved him...
...it skipped Carter, went to the next in the path of the explosion, Billy.
I have to see it.
And if I see it, then I intervene.
And if I intervene, I cheat the design.
What, intervene?
What are you, God now?
Gods aren't afraid to die.
Gods don't die. We do.
- You know?
- Baby, you're losing it, okay?
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.
You can hide, and get your head together.
Okay, after Billy, I'm next. I'm next.
- And then me.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.
I'm not gonna let it happen, okay?
- Listen to me, all right?
- Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you two just get the fuck out of here?
Rusted.
Tetanus.
Nice one.
I overlooked it.
You tried to capitalize.
But I caught you, you fuck.
I can beat you.
Yeah, I mean, not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!
- She was there a minute ago.
- What are you talking about?
I'm not turning him in.
It's too dangerous for him out there alone.
- I go with you.
- You can't.
Clear, you just tell us where he is.
Wait at home, I give you my word...
...that we will bring him in safely in protective custody.
I never moved.
Christa asked me to change seats but I never moved.
I would've been up next to Tod.
Fuck, why didn't I remember that?
I never moved.
Clear's seat was in front of mine.
She's next.
Alex!
Alex!
Come on, get in the car.
We're going around. Get in the car.
Come on!
- Go!
Move!
Oh, shit.
There!
Come on, let's go, over here.
Alex!
Alex, we're trying to help you.
Fritz, get away from it.
Come on.
Alex!
Run!
We lost him.
From the direction, there's only one place he's heading.
No shit.
Clear!
No.
Oh, my God.
Don't move. Stay there.
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tires, okay?
The car's gonna explode.
I can only hold on for so long, you know what to do.
Don't!
When I do this, it'll skip you, and it'll be over.
- It's the only way we can cheat death again.
- No, don't!
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.
I'll always be with you.
No!
Alex! Alex, get away from there.
No!
Alex. Alex.
Damn it, you can't do this to me.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Alex, Alex?
Alex, Alex? Oh, shit, he's not breathing.
Hold on, Alex. Come on, stay with me.
- Well, we made it.
- Paris, I can't believe it.
I just can't believe we got on a plane again.
You know what I'm saying?
Wow.
It's weird being here, huh?
We finally completed a puzzle.
It's just there's something missing, you know?
- To Terry.
- Yeah.
- To Tod.
- To all of our friends that can't be here.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What?
If you would have told me six months ago...
...that the three of us would be sitting here having a drink...
- Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean, sometimes it just feels like the two of you...
...are the only ones who can really understand.
You were right, Browning.
It did skip us. There was a design.
We beat it. You know, we won.
I think the only thing we won, Carter, is a chance at a full life.
A chance that I won't ever waste.
Yeah, there's just something...
You know, something I can't figure out.
- What?
- About the design.
Alex, just let it go. All right?
I swear... Just hear me out, all right?
- Oh, my God.
- It's just... Listen.
Now, the path of the explosion determined the order of our deaths, right?
When I intervened and saved Carter...
...it skipped him and went to the next person in the path. It went to Billy.
All right, and then it was Clear.
But I intervened and saved her, so it went to me, but in my case...
...no one intervened, right?
I was thrown from that power line by the explosion.
- So...
- So why did it skip you, right?
How do we know that this isn't exactly what was meant to happen?
That out of everyone on Flight 180, you, me and Carter were meant to live.
Maybe that was the design all along.
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.
What? I didn't make up the rules.
Somebody's gotta intervene before death can skip them.
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.
For all I know, it could circle back and get us all again.
But I am the safest fucker in the world because you're still next.
Can we just stop talking about this?
Let's figure out what we're gonna do tomorrow.
I'm gonna meet you back at the hotel.
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.
Okay, Clear? Just stay here.
All right?
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.
- No, Clear, stay there.
Okay? Stay away.
Alex!
Alex!
I told you, you were next.
- Then it just skipped me.
- So who's next?
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!
Okay, you're great.
You got the line?
Yeah. Come on up, slowpoke.
Help!
You okay? You know, we're 50 miles from anybody.
Who are you screamin' for?
You!
Come on.
Just pull me up!
Rich?
Just pull me up.
All right, don't be a dick,
Richie. I need a pull.
Rich?
Rich?
What...
(Radio Evangelist) When you plant seed into your own kin, you anger God.
(Radio Newscaster) Still have not been able to locate the two college students.
Richard Stoker and Halley Smith have been missing since last Monday... after failing to return from a weekend of rock...
Hey. How are you doin'?
Do you have any idea whaùs going on up here?
Tractor jackknifed about five mile up.
Spilled chemicals and shit all over the road.
Any idea how long iùll take to clean up?
Couple hours.
Couple hours?
You in a hurry?
Yeah. I need to get to Raleigh tonight.
What you oughta do is get back in your car,
Mm-hmm.
Fix your hair a couple hundred more times...
Thank you.
Hey, Doris.
This is Chris Flynn.
I have a 7:00 p.m.
Interview with Mr. Keller.
I'm, uh, running about 30 minutes late.
I was wondering if you could...
Hello? Hello?
I'm not gonna make this.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pay phone?
Uh, this one's not working. Do you have another phone I could use?
Long distance?
What isn't long distance from here, right?
You cuttin' wise with me, son?
No, sir, I'm just...
I'm runnin' behind... and I really need to make a call.
Well, thaùn there is my only phone.
Right.
Well, uh, the highway's really jammed up.
Do you know of another route heading south?
No.
No.
Why is this Bear Mountain Road dotted like this?
Dirt.
Dirt road?
'Fraid they ain't got around to pavin' it yet.
It looks like it runs into the highway about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?
If you say so.
It could work.
Thank you very much.
You take care, okay?
You're the one gonna need to take care.
Xxxxxx (Radio, Indistinct)
Wejust got nailed, man!
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
Goddamn drunken hillbilly!
Hey. Hey, you all right?
I'm so sorry.
I was just...
Jesus.
I was just comin' around the bend.
I didn't even see... I got distracted.
My God, you coulÔve died!
Are you guys all okay?
Yeah, yeah. You wanna sit down?
You might be in shock.
What were you doing driving so goddamn fast?
All right, all right.
Why was your truck parked in the middle of the road?
Because we blew out our tires, asshole!
I'll pay for whatever damage was done.
Thaùs my mom's car!
All right, Frannie.
The man said he'd pay for...
Oh, looks like you killed my bike here too.
I'm sorry. L...
How did you blow out your tires?
Someone left some barbed wire in the middle of the road.
I can't believe someone just dropped it there.
Nobody dropped anything.
I just found this tied to a tree.
Somebody did this.
Southern hospitality at its finest.
(Woman) Redneck assholes.
I'm gonna try and find a phone.
I think I saw a gas station like a couple miles back.
I'm gonna come with you.
There is no phone.
I was just there.
Why don't we just wait for someone else to come along?
What, like Speed Racer here?
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay, you guys go, and we'll just stay here, Francine.
And get high.
Yeah. So what?
Careful. They don't like stoners.
Who are you calling a stoner?
Your mom.
Hey, whaùs your name?
Chris Flynn.
You hurt, Chris Flynn?
No, I'm fine.
Good.
'Cause you're the mule.
Oh, no.
You know, I can carry that. You just had the whole car accident thing.
Yeah, we'll just stay here and maybe get hit again.
Are you guys sure you're cool?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll be just fine.
Thank you.
Mess you up.
Yeah, smoke it up there, uh, Skippy.
Yeah, have fun.
(Man) I don't fuckin'believe this.
Your mom's gonna kick your ass.
God, I cannot get out of my head what just happened.
Are you sure you're all right? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm fine.
What are you guys doing out here?
Uh, uh, oh, camping.
Uh, I don't know. Actually, we're lost.
You know, a lot of people say... who have been through similar traumatic experiences... that the following moments kind of feel like you're moving kind of in slow motion.
Do you feel like that?
No.
I should tell you that my voice is fairly low and normal speed.
Pretty good. (Coughing)
(Francine) Mm-hmm.
Where'd you get this?
Um, I got it out of my daÔs room, actually.
You can finish it.
I can't believe they called us stoners.
Dickheads.
(Girl) Are you sure you know where we're going?
(Chris) Yeah. There was a map at the gas station.
Oh, I'm so tired already.
I'm starving, and I'm being eaten by ants.
Are there any on my back?
No, nothing there.
Oh, hey-ho! I call it. Uh, squirrel.
Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.
I don't think iùs a squirrel.
Iùs a mink.
Really? How do you know?
Probably ran over it.
In medical school, they make you work on animal cadavers before you get to the real thing.
Iùs a mink.
Oh.
Iùs a mink?
I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.
Hmm. Better get a move-on, then.
You know, we shoulÔve just taken her to New York.
No. You know how she loves this outdoor stuff.
Yeah.
If you ask me, though, nature sucks.
Well, the next time she gets dumped, we'll take her to New York.
Drop your pants.
What?
When do people always show up, Evan?
What are we doing?
Consider it an experiment in probability theory.
Really?
Mmm. I love you.
I know.
(Southern Accent) Now get them trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.
All right.
(Man) You know, I've been thinking about this whole wedding thing... and I think we should take a trip down to Mexico.
Mm-hmm.
I'm talking about a long weekend... margaritas, the two of us on a beach alone, sunset.
And, you know,
I'm talking about just, just eloping.
You know what I mean?
Uh, wait a second.
You wanna know what I think?
Yes, please.
I think if you ever want to get in my pants again,
Affirmative.
This is the last time you use the "E" word.
Okay? Okay.
Yeah, iùs a disgusting word.
Hey, guys, hold on.
Hey, is anyone up there?
Hello!
There must be people nearby.
Anyone up there?
Somebody had to start it.
Leùs keep moving.
Hello?
Freaky.
Oh, look at this.
Iùs fucked!
Nothing. Nothing.
Hey, did you find anything to eat?
They took all my Power Bars.
Um, no.
No. Sorry.
Damn it. Scott and Carly took all our friggin' sunscreen.
Does he have any good CD's?
Mmm. Definitely not.
You know, I think this guy must be some kind of doctor.
Maybe we could get him to write us some prescriptions when he gets back.
(Sighs) He doesn't have any smokes either.
Almost out.
Evan?
Evan? Where are you?
Hey, baby, what are you doing?
I'm just... amusing myself.
Whoooo!
You, uh, getting anything there, chatty?
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.
Why didn't you just fly?
I put all of my money into that car back there.
Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we should discuss about the band for our wedding.
I think we should hire a... you know, a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer... as opposed to a James Brown-type lead singer... because, you know, really, leùs be honest, there's only oneJames Brown... and, you know, a faux James Brown is really quite intolerable.
Evan? Where are you?
You pissing or something?
Evan?
You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips, and my grandmother would be... yes, revolted but also strangely fascinated in a completely disturbing way... and, um...
Baby?
Carly, I wa...
I was kidding.
Carly?
Evan?
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!
Guys, hold up for a second, all right?
Baby, seriously, this isn't funny.
Jesus God!
Baby!
L...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I coulÔve killed you, woman.
I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.
You wanna know why I love you so much?
Because you're so fun to play with.
Is that why you love me?
That really scared me, baby.
I'm sorry.
That really scared me.
Would you not do that?
Hello!
Hello!
There's, uh, nothing like stating the obvious, huh?
Hey, baby, look at this.
Whoo! Hey, Carly, I think this would be good time for you to confront your fear of...
Don't!
Okay, that is not funny.
Look who's scared now.
Sorry.
Whatever.
Just get me to a motel room... run me a very hot bath... and be prepared to provide me with a lot of orgasms.
Oh!
I think they need to be alone.
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.
They're happy.
Iùs a hard thing to find.
Yeah.
Got it?
Limber tongue. Got it.
You're stupid.
(Woman) Maybe we shouldn't have left Francine and Evan.
Don't worry. They're fine.
(Chris) You guys okay?
(Scott) Super.
(Woman) Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.
(Carly) Thaùs because you don't have the Redneck World Atlas.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think we've just been saved, kids.
Can I get a...
Make this quick.
Actually, maybe we should keep walking.
What? The next house is gonna have a white picket fence?
Yeah, if there is a next house.
Hey.
What?
Hello?
All right, this isn't right.
Hello?
Hello? Anybody home?
Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
I was gonna see if they had a phone.
You guys can wait out here if you want.
You can't just go barging into someone's house like that.
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm just thinkin'...
West Virginia, trespassing... not a great combination.
Look, I need to pee.
Well, I need to remind you of a little movie called Deliverance.
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.
Hello?
Hello?
Carly.
Hello?
What the fuck?
(Jessie) Leùs just do what we gotta do and get out ofhere.
Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.
Hello!
Okay, who lives here?
(Carly) I don't know, but can you help me find a bathroom?
Baby, I think this is the bathroom.
Oh, fuck.
(Chris) Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
(Scott) Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.
Help me find the bathroom.
Then we'll go.
Baby, what if this place belongs to some kind of cult?
I read in Newsweek how economically depressed places... are like breeding grounds for all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.
Order of the Solar Temple, Church of the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.
Remember them?
Hey, brainiac!
Shh!
All right.
Maybe that door.
Christ!
(Chris) You okay?
Iùs just a paddle. Iùs all right.
Whoa.
God, look at this place.
Yeah. Iùs like the garage sale from hell.
(Carly)Jesus.
Can you believe this?
(Scott)Jesus, these guys are ripping people off.
I mean, this is like
$30,000 worth of stuff.
(Jessie) Chris.
Mm-hmm.
We should leave.
This is kind of creepy.
Yeah, this is it.
Okay. Be quick.
Okay!
All right? Two minutes.
All right?
I'll be here.
Ew!
Guys, guys, check this out.
Oh, no.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Scott. Scott!
Scott, we have to go now!
Jess! Jessie!
Jess!
Hey! Guys, what is it?
We need to get back to your friends.
What about a phone?
There is no phone. Shit!
What about a phone?
There is no phone. Shit!
There's a back door.
I saw a back door. Come on.
Go, go!
Okay, hurry. Shit! No!
Shit!
Scott! Scott!
Iùs not gonna budge! Come on!
(Man Speaking
Unintelligible Language)
Go.
Go.
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go, you guys! Run!
Go quickly.
(Chris) Come on.
Where are they going?
I don't know.
Jesus, did that really just happen?
Do you think Evan's okay?
Please.
(Crying) I can't. I can't.
Carly, come on!
Get up!
You didn't see what they did to Francine!
You didn't see what we saw!
Carly! Carly! Sweet pea!
Look at me. We are gonna get out of this, I swear to you.
We are. Okay? We're gonna find a road.
We're gonna get to a town.
And we're going home.
We're gonna get married. All right?
And we are never going into the woods again.
All right?
(Chris) We gotta go.
Come on. This way!
Leùs go! Come on!
What is this?
Jesus.
All these people.
Baby. Fuck.
(Carly) How can they do this?
I don't understand.
How'd they get away with this?
Oh, my God. All these people.
Maybe one of them still runs.
Look for keys.
None of these cars are gonna run.
Come on. Look at them.
Oh, fuck.
Get down! Get down!
Come on!
Okay.
What do we do?
They left their truck running.
(Jessie) So?
We gotta take it.
How are we supposed to do that?
One of us leads them in the wrong direction... and the rest commandeer the truck so they'll run for the runner.
Iùs a classic military move.
Who goes?
Me.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Over here!
(Scott) Oh, shit. Oh, God.
Go!
Listen. Help him. Get to the truck.
I'll meet you there.
I love you.
Fuckers!
Asshole motherfuckers!
Assholes!
He's okay. Shh, shh.
Come on.
Here, here. You're okay.
Go ahead. Go, go, go.
Go to the truck.
Come on. We gotta go.
I can't! I can't!
Come on! Come on!
Carly, get in!
We gotta find Scott!
We have to find Scott!
Where is he?
Where is he!
There he is!
There he is! Scott!
Run, Scott!
We're over here! Scott!
(Jessie) Scott! Come on!
Scott, leùs go!
Come on!
Come on, Scott! Scott!
(Chris) Leùs go!
Scott, come on!
Come on, Scott!
Come on, Scott!
Scott! Scott! What are you doing?
Scott, whaùs wrong?
Scott!
Scott! No!
No!
Let go of me! Let me go!
Scott!
No!
Drive! Drive!
No!
Drive!
Oh, God!
Whaùs happening?
Oh, God, whaùs happening?
Jess, please, can we go back? Please!
Carly, we have to keep going. Okay?
Scott.
Are you sure this is the road from that map?
Iùs gotta go somewhere.
This better get us out of here.
Shit.
Shit!
Come on!
Back it up.
Come on!
Iùs not gonna go any farther.
Come on. We have to get out.
We gotta find out where we are.
The highest ridge is up there.
Come on.
Whaùs the point?
They're gonna find us anyway.
Come on. Leùs go, Carly.
No. If he's going, I'm not.
He got us into this.
Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.
We need to keep ourselves alive, or it was for nothing. Okay?
We're all in this together, Carl.
Come on.
I want him back.
Shh.
I know, I know.
Carl, look at me. Okay? Look.
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.
We're gonna find the police and make sure those motherfuckers are punished for this. Okay?
Carly.
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.
Iùs gonna get dark soon.
Come on.
We need to find that road quick.
I know.
Just a little bit farther.
Chris!
Iùs a bear trap.
(Carly Laughing,
Echoing)
Whaùs up?
I gotta rest.
Hey, guys.
Look.
Oh my God.
Iùs a watchtower.
Hello! Is anyone up there?
Shh! Shh!
I don't think anyone's up there.
Doesn't matter.
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.
You okay?
Come on.
Guys, I don't see any roads or towns out there.
Leùs not stand by the window.
They might see us.
Hey.
We're all gonna die.
Carly, I need you to come help me look around, please.
Hey, Chris.
Jess.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Iùs a radio.
Thing looks prehistoric.
Do you know how to use this?
Uh, let me try.
(Carly) It could still work.
(Chris) Don't move anything.
Keep it on the frequency they had it on.
(Carly) It works.
Can anybody hear me? We have an emergency. Can anybody hear me?
Say "Mayday."
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?
Someone is injured.
We need help.
Hello. Please, is anybody out there that can hear me?
Hello.
No.
Get down.
Cover the light.
Shh.
I think they're passing us.
This is Ranger Base Emergency.
Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.
Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.
I don't know my position. Just help us.
Shh!
I need another copy of that.
I repeat: : What is your position?
They're coming.
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.
We must be north of Bear Mountain Road.
Someone is trying to kill us!
They've murdered our friends!
They're after us right now!
I'm having some trouble hearing you.
If you're in the tower, stay there.
Do you copy?
Yes, we copy! Just hurry, please!
This is an emergency!
Help me move this. Come on! Come on!
(Ranger) We'll come to you.
They're after us!
Someone's been shot!
Our friends have been killed, and we need help! Please!
Fuck!
What are they doing?
I don't know.
I think they're going down.
Jess.
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody there?
Can you hear us? Hello?
Jesus, what are they doing?
We're on fire.
They're trying to burn us out.
Oh, my God.
Carly!
Come here!
Let go of me! Let go!
I'd rather jump than burn to death!
(Jessie) Calm down.
You're right.
What?
She's right.
We have to jump. Those branches are only a few feet down.
Thaùs more like 20 feet.
I don't want to burn, and I don't want to be chopped into pieces. We can do this.
I'll go first.
Chris. Hey.
Oh.
Aaah! Chris!
Chris! Aaah!
Chris!
You okay?
Do you think they saw us?
I don't know.
We gotta move.
Come on.
Shit. Shit.
Carly, come on.
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.
I can...
I can do this.
Car...
Shh.
Come on. Come on.
(Shouting In
Unintelligible Language)
He's coming.
I know. I have a plan. Come on.
(Gleeful Yelling,
Laughing)
Jessie, this way.
Can you hold this?
Why?
'Cause we're gonna knock this fucker out of the tree. Can you hold it?
Yeah.
All right. Don't let go until I say so. Okay?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna make sure he comes this way.
No. You can't move as quick as I can.
Jessie.
Jessie.
I'm right here!
Come and get me!
Where are you?
Here I am!
What...
Hmm?
Hey!
Sorry about your friends.
Last Friday I came home, and there's a message on my machine... from my boyfriend, who... says that we shouldn't be together anymore.
Within 20 minutes of me... telling Carly... she had Scott and...
Evan and Francine... all blowing off work this week to take me out here.
Thaùs just the kind of friends they were.
And now they're dead.
Iùs not your fault.
Iùs not.
They're here!
No, they're not.
You were dreaming.
I wish.
How's your leg?
It hurts.
Which is good.
If it didn't hurt... Road.
(Jessie) What?
Road. Look.
We gotta get down there.
Take that slope right there.
I can't believe it.
How are we gonna get you down?
I'll get down...
Chris!
Go!
Chris! No! Chris!
Chris! Chris!
Chris! Get off of me!
Jessie!
Jessie!
Hey, stop!
Oh, thank God!
Are you crazy?
They took her. Come on. We gotta...
Just calm down.
We gotta move.
Are you one of them folks who called me from the fire tower?
Will you shut up and listen.
People are dead!
Dead? What people?
Help!
No!
Mmm.
No.
Help me. Please.
Help me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Yeah?
Can you help me?
Please help me.
No!
No!
Help.
Somebody, help me!
No!
(Speaking
Unintelligible Language)
Help me!
(Jessie) No!
You're okay. Come on.
Just stay with me. You're all right.
Come on. Iùs okay.
Keep looking at me.
All right? You're okay.
Thank you.
Shh. Everything's okay.
Chris!
Chris!
Chris.
Get off of me!
Shoot them.
I only got one shot left.
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Just die.
(Man On Police Radio,
Indistinct)

What the hell were you thinking taking her that way?!
- The park is the other way!
- Annie wanted--
What-- what does Annie want?
I mean, Annie can't talk,
- she can't think, she can't--
- She can think.
If you ever looked at her you'd know.
Please. She's all right.
That's the main thing.
- Can't you just stop it?
- Oh, you know this?
You know she's all right.
What if the damn dog was rabid?
It wasn't.
Mrs. Stanton told me.
What? And you believe her?
Just like that?
That woman's an idiot, a careless idiot.
Anyone can say anything, Sissy.
Maybe someday you'll learn that, that anyone can say anything.
I saw the dog tag, Daddy.
Why do you always treat me like a fool?
- Stop it! Both of you.
She'll hear.
Do you want to upset her?
Oh come on, honey, give me a break. You might as well...
Come on, guys!
Wait up!
I figured you could use something stronger. I know I could.
Down the hatch, come on.
It's quick, isn't it?
What they do.
And it doesn't hurt them.
It's quick, it doesn't hurt, they just go to sleep.
Come on, drink your drink.
You know as well as I do that Buddy never bit anybody before in his life.
It was her.
He sensed something in her.
Annie, please open the door!
Annie, open this door, now!
Drink your drink.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm telling you, there's something wrong with that little girl, and I don't just mean that she's autistic.
Sissy:
Please open the door!
Annie, turn the music down!
Somebody'll call the damn cops!
Mrs. Stanton:
There's something about her that's wrong.
And Buddy sensed it.
Dogs know, oh you bet.
Did you hear that?
Music.
Someone has it really cranked out there.
- Oh!
- What the hell?!
It's an earthquake!
It's not coming from the ground-- It's--
Ahh!
Aah!
Come on! Run!
- Run!
- Ahh! !
Come on, come on!
- Open the door.
- Now, Annie!
Come on, hurry! Hurry!
- Oh God!
- What's happening?!
I don't know!
Annie, let us in!
Annie!
Annie, please, open the door.
Kill it, Sissy.
Just what the hell are you doing?
What the--
Sister, look at this.
Sister, I got Baby.
Yes, I know.
Annie... what have you done?
And that concludes this years' course-work in the psychology of the unseen world.
I would like to leave you with three thoughts if I may.
The first, is that the investigation of psychic phenomena is an honorable pursuit, in spite of the field's tattered reputation.
The second, is that reality is not always quantifiable.
Our inability to count, weigh, sort or photograph some things, does not mean that those things are non-existent.
Third, and most important, next week's exam will not be graded on the curve.
Seriously, I thank you all for your attention and to remind you of what someone rather famous once said,
""The truth is out there.""
Enjoy your summer.
Professor Reardon, a question please.
A question.
Your question?
There are rumors that you're planning a scientific investigation of Rose Red this summer, the Rimbauer Mansion, a sort of psychic field trip.
Is that true?
- You are...?
- Kevin Bollinger, Class of 'O3.
I don't recognize you,
Mr. Bollinger.
Is that because the group is so large, or could it be that this is your first visit to our happy family?
Actually, I'm a reporter for the campus newspaper.
Oh, my sympathies,
Mr. Bollinger.
Is it true,
Professor Reardon, and if it is, are you planning on using departmental funds or college general funds to finance your latest spook hunt?
As any regular attendee of these classes will tell you,
Mr. Bollinger,
I'm extremely interested in Rose Red.
I talk about it all the time.
Have a picture on my office wall, not to mention one of Ellen Rimbauer.
But as Professor Miller can tell you,
I have filed no request for either general funds or money from the department to underwrite what you term ""a spook hunt.""
If you feel like asking him to confirm that, he's-- he's right up there.
A question of mine,
Mr. Bollinger.
Did Professor Miller, perhaps, suggest you stop by my class to pose your question instead of dropping by my office like a normal reporter?
Never mind, Mr. Bollinger.
Let's consider the issue closed, shall we?
- But you never answered my question.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Exam next Tuesday at 2:00 and I'll see you then.
If I embarrassed you,
Professor Reardon, I am sorry.
Hmm.
I don't believe it,
Mr. Bollinger.
Carl Miller stuck a key in your back and wound you up.
And it was his intention that I be embarrassed.
I am not.
Even if you're not planning on using college or departmental funds for your Rose Red expedition, won't you be using a lot of psychology department equipment, a lot of very expensive equipment?
Haven't you already entered into an agreement with Steven Rimbauer, the last remaining family member?
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bollinger.
- Hi, Professor Reardon.
- Hello.
Well, Joyce.
- We have to discuss this.
- I think not.
Well, we'll have to discuss it sooner or later.
You know, speaking for the department, I think I can say our patience with your shenanigans has grown quite short.
""...spooks.
Somebody call...""
Pfff.
Uh...
Oh...
Professor Reardon?
I was wondering if you could discuss my--
Not now. My office hours are clearly posted, can't you read?
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, um, uh, wait...
Ms. Spruce, isn't it?
Kathy Spruce, that's right.
I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bite.
Office hours are between
2:00 and 3:00. Try me then, okay?
Yes, Ms. Reardon.
Out.
Out.
Oh...
Far out.
Hmm...
Waterman residence.
Mr. Waterman, Joyce Reardon.
Oh, hello, Ms. Reardon.
I've been meaning to call, but I've been uh...
Joyce, please.
I've been kinda busy.
I understand, but I'm finalizing my list of participants for my little Rose Red field trip, and I 'd really like you in.
- Have you thought about it?
- Rose Red is a dangerous place to conduct psychic experiments,
Ms. Reardon--
Joyce.
As I'm sure you must be aware.
With all due respect, Emery,
Rose Red is a dead cell.
I'm sure it is, if you're not psychic.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll just let you get back to what you were doing, shall I, and move on to the next name on my list?
I doubt there are that many.
Not post-cognates of my calibre.
You might be surprised.
Good afternoon.
Wait-- wait-- wait--
I didn't say no, did I?
Didn't you?
No.
But 5,000 is a trifle low.
If you were to be offering a bit more, say...
7,500 for instance?
- Mr. Waterman,
- Emery, please.
5,000 is my first, last and only offer.
And a generous one considering the fact that there have been no phenomena in Rose Red for five years or more.
Since they stopped the tours and took away the fresh meat.
Isn't that what you mean?
Forgive me but I find that ridiculous.
The funding for this expedition is coming out of my own pocket.
And 5,000 is all I can afford.
So what do you say, Emery?
In or out?
All right, I'm in.
But I warn you, if you want a videotaped debriefing afterward, I get extra.
That's fine, Emery.
Memorial Day weekend.
Mark your calendar.
You send me a check,
Joyce, and I will.
Good day.
Putz.
Poisoned...
Guess not.
Emery...
Hey, whoever you are, save the warnings for someone who's not broke.
Okay?
Emery?
Emery!
Emery!
Here you are.
There are some more bags out in the car.
They're going out of business at Griffin's.
Everything's 25% off.
That's too much cream, you'll make yourself fat.
Er.
- I beg your pardon?
- Fat-er.
I'm already fat.
Cream clogs up your arteries, Emer.
A little's okay but that's too much.
Get my things out of the car.
I tell you, I made a killing.
Mom, I was doing the bills just now.
Well, what about the bills?
A lot of them are past due.
It's the credit cards, Mom--
I'm very careful with the credit cards.
I'm a very wise shopper.
I'll get your stuff.
Isn't this just the best bear?
I'm gonna put him on the end of my bed with Hester and Fester.
What rhymes with Hester and Fester, Emmy?
Pester.
The woman from the college who wants to investigate
Rose Red called again.
See? Something always turns up.
God provides, I've always said so.
Rose Red's supposed to be dangerous.
If you take the usual precautions you'll be fine.
And we'll pray, of course.
Were you able to get her up to 75?
No. She's financing the expedition herself.
Or so she told you and you believed her, of course.
You want to call her back?
I have the number.
No. A deal's a deal.
One of the few sensible things your father ever said.
Did you tell her it would be extra for interviews after?
- Physicals? EKG's?
- Yes.
And no X-rays.
They give you cancer.
Now run along and get my bags.
Then you can have your pie.
Office hours are over.
Come back tomorrow.
- I said office hou--
- Extra credit, Ms. Reardon.
I'll do anything, look good in a bathing suit, look great in one of those
French maid's outfits.
Come in, you idiot, and close the door.
All right.
Teach, you're looking good today.
- Ooh...
- Mmm.
The idiot wants to know how you're doing.
Well, I won't lie to you, it's been a tough day.
But I have a very important call to make.
- Oh...
- So...
What, this is the Wheaton girl?
The one you really want?
Her sister. If you can sit there and keep quiet you can stay.
But if you feel an attack of monkeyshines coming on, then go. Get out now.
That's pretty tough talk considering it's my old family's homestead you want to go exploring in.
But...
I'll be good, Dee, I swear.
I won't do that, sorry.
Hello? Ms. Reardon?
Yes, how are you?
I'm all right.
But you know how hard it is to keep people away from a phone in this place?
Also I'm on my break, so let's make this fast.
Uh--
I could call you later.
No, I don't think so.
I still live at home to be near Annie and... my father knows who you are and what you want.
He doesn't approve.
What are you saying?
Annie won't take part?
I'm saying that if I bring Annie to Rose Red... the chances are good that
I could never go home again.
That'd be all right with me but,
Annie shouldn't be there without someone who understands her.
Mm-hmm. And-- and your parents don't?
Well... my mother's scared to death of her and, my father...
I think my father hates her.
What can I do?
There's a school just outside of Tacoma for people like Annie.
No, there's no one like Annie I don't think... but... it's a place for autistic teenagers.
A good place.
I might as well cut right to the chase, Ms. Reardon,
5,000 isn't gonna be enough.
If you can promise ten
I might try to make this happen.
1 0,000 done. I-- I'll bring the check to you myself.
This afternoon.
Where-- where do you work?
No, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.
Look, my time is short, Ms. Wheaton.
Please, call me Sister, why don't you? Everyone does.
Mr. Rimbauer has agreed to open
Rose Red for my group over the Memorial Day weekend.
It's only nine days away.
I need to know if
I can count on Annie.
In fact I'm having an orientation meeting this Monday night, for the participants here in Wimser Hall at the University.
It would be great if Annie could join us.
You understand that if Annie goes to Rose Red I go too, don't you?
That-- that's fine, of course.
When can I know,
Ms. Wheaton? Uh, Sister.
I-- I might be able to scrape up as much as $1 2,000 if uh, that is, if you can make a solid commitment to the expedition right now.
I can't do that.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Reardon.
- Wait!
When can I expect to hear from you?
- I'll be in touch.
- Wait! The-- the-- orientation Monday night?
I don't know... it...
I don't think so.
Ohh.
$12,000? You know, I'm-- I'm starting to think that I sold the old homestead cheap.
You didn't sell it, you're renting it.
For a single weekend.
I've gotta have Annie Wheaton.
Why?
I've got the makings of a good group here, but they're candles.
Annie Wheaton is a searchlight.
If anyone can wake up Rose Red, she is the one.
I told you before, Dee, waking up Rose Red isn't a good idea.
I want Annie.
I want Annie Wheaton.
Hello, dear.
Hey, Mom. Hi, Dad.
Mrs. Wheaton:
Long day? You look tired.
I'll microwave you a TV dinner.
It's okay. I had something to eat at the restaurant.
Is Annie okay?
- Annie is fine.
- Yeah, wearing out her ears again.
Not to mention ours.
If it isn't ""A Summer Place"" it's that other crap.
""Pennsylvania 69,000"" and ""In The Mood.""
Same two, over and over all afternoon.
- I guess she just likes it.
- Yeah, I know that.
I just can't figure out why.
Thank God for small favors.
Annie...
Annie... come...
Despite what some people may think, psychic powers-- telepathy, telekinesis, precognition, all the rest, have no moral gradient.
They are neither good nor bad.
Houses are different.
Shirley Jackson was right.
Some houses are born bad.
Houses like this one.
Houses like Rose Red.
I knew it was big, but that's enormous.
Fortunately for us, an enormous dead cell.
There have been no overt manifestations in Rose Red since 1995 or so.
I believe that some houses have their own inner life that may or may not be conscious.
If there was once consciousness in Rose Red, it manifested itself early.
The Seattle of 100 years ago was a different world, more different than any of us can imagine.
Survival was an actual issue, not a TV show.
Fortunes were made, often by bandits in tall hats.
You could get out of the way or get run down.
Those were the options.
In the year 1906, you were on your own.
Rose Red... was built by John P. Rimbauer at the top of Spring Street in the center of Seattle, as a wedding present to his wife.
Rimbauer was founder of Omicron Oil Company, until 1950 the biggest oil company in America.
1950 was the year
Ellen Rimbauer disappeared.
The trouble with Rose Red started even before there was a house.
Construction crews worked
24 hours a day, seven days a week.
But that wasn't the problem.
The problem was that even before there was a house there, that piece of ground made people mad.
Literally mad.
The Teamster made no effort to get away, just dropped the gun in his wagon and went down to a Seattle saloon, which was where the police found him.
The Teamster's name was Harry Corbin.
When he was tried, he claimed he remembered nothing from breakfast till the time he woke up in jail with a knot behind his ear.
The judge didn't believe him, neither did the jury.
He got 25 years.
I think Harry Corbin may have been Rose Red's first victim.
First male victim.
There has always been a difference between the way Rose Red treats the ladies and the gentlemen.
- What do you mean, exactly?
- In time, Nick.
All in good time.
John Rimbauer and Ellen Gilchrist were married on November 1 2, 1 907.
He was 40 and she... was 20.
By the day they said their I do's,
Rose Red had been under construction for a year.
Already there had been three deaths, in addition to the murder of Rimbauer's first foreman.
Pick it up!
One man was decapitated by a sheet of falling glass.
Another fell from a scaffold and broke his neck.
And the third... choked to death on a piece of apple.
This is the way
Rose Red looked when it was completed in 1909.
In case your memory needs refreshing, this is the way it looks today.
It's as if it metastasized.
Rose Red has how many rooms?
- No one really knows.
- On Monday you can count
74 and come back on Friday and come up with 87 or 97.
That's impossible, isn't it?
That's Rose Red, sweetheart.
How many people have disappeared?
There must be an accurate account of them.
23 since the end of the first World War.
You'll forgive me if I say
I find that impossible to believe.
Of course you do.
Anyone would.
But I assure you it's true.
Five men and 18 women.
Rose Red has always been particularly fond of the ladies.
Remember we're speaking of a house
- which has fallen dormant.
- It better be, because $5,000 isn't enough if it isn't.
- When was the last disappearance? almost 30 years ago.
As I said before, there have been no observable phenomena since--
- Who was the last one?
- Pam...
We've got a lot to cover, we don't need to focus on--
A woman on the Historical Society's annual tour.
She was with the group when they went upstairs.
It wasn't until the tour was over that they realized she wasn't with them anymore.
What's that?
They didn't find her, but they found her purse.
Finished?
Yeah.
Thank you.
The lady's name was Liza Albert.
Since her disappearance, the house has been closed to tours.
With no psychic energy for the house to feed on, it seems to have fallen into a sleep, then a coma.
- And now...
- It's a dead cell.
Exactly.
I wouldn't bet on that if I were you.
Rose Red wasn't finished when John and Ellen got married, but they weren't in a hurry to set up housekeeping.
They passed the time with an enormous, leisurely honeymoon.
They were gone a year.
They circled the globe on liners like this one...
The Ocean Star.
John Rimbauer's favorite part of the tour was Africa.
Ellen didn't enjoy it quite as much.
In fact, she nearly died.
- Was it malaria?
- Probably not.
In her diary she called it
""an unmentionable disease carried by men and suffered by women.""
Doesn't exactly look prostrate with worry, does he?
With or without him,
Ellen recovered.
When she and John finally took up residence in Rose Red, she was pregnant.
January, 1909, that would have been.
John thought the house was finished.
They're here!
How beautiful you are,
Rose Red.
He didn't know that the house would never be done.
Not in his lifetime, not in hers.
What makes Rose Red one of the world's most fascinating psychic artifacts... is that the house continued to grow until its death in 1995 or 1996.
Until 1950 changes and additions were made according to the will of Ellen Rimbauer, and her will, ladies and gentlemen, was iron.
After 1950... after 1950...
Rose Red grew on its own.
In the fall of 1909,
Ellen Rimbauer gave birth to a son.
Grampy.
- Your grandfather, really.
- Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
In her diary she wrote,
""I have called him Adam, for he is the first.""
Sukeena, the woman who came back from Africa with her, saw her through the difficult labor.
In her diary, Ellen never refers to Sukeena as her servant.
First she calls her,
""my friend.""
Later, ""my sister.""
When Ellen gave birth to a daughter with a withered arm, she blamed her African sickness and her husband's sexual appetites, although she wrote,
""In my mind they are one,"" to which she added,
""Damn all men.""
John and Ellen's daughter was born in April of 1911 .
And April was what they called her.
In the years following the birth of Ellen's daughter,
Ellen became convinced that her fever, which recurred periodically, would kill her young.
That made her easy game for Madame Stravinsky, as she called herself.
If you have anything to say to us, you may use my body... to speak.
Give us a sign.
Show us a sign.
Not even Sukeena could convince her that the old lady was a fraud.
Beloved spirits, we invite you to commune with us.
Show us a sign.
Fraud or not,
Madame Stravinsky, known to police in San Francisco and Los Angeles as Cora Fry, changed
Ellen Rimbauer's life one night in August of 1914.
Sukeena!
- You must build.
- What did she tell her?
That Great-Gram wouldn't die until the house was finished.
Great-Gram told her it was finished, and Madame S. told her,
""It isn't finished until you say it's finished.""
""Until you say.""
Ellen took it seriously, probably she was right to.
Everything else aside, she never had another attack of her African fever.
- It was probably psychosomatic.
- Just PMS, right, Em?
I wouldn't be at all surprised.
A new wing, the first of many, started going up the next week.
What did her husband say about that?
Rimbauer: Nothing, she gave him a son in 1909, a daughter in 1911 .
She had a withered arm, but the son was fine.
It was the son John Rimbauer cared about. In his mind Ellen had fulfilled her function, and could do what she liked.
Would you agree?
Yes. Besides... he had affairs of his own to tend to.
Ellen continued to make additions to the house until her disappearance in 1950.
Over 40 years of well-financed eccentricity.
When she ran out of conventional things to build, she hired contractors and architects to build
- unconventional stuff.
- Such as...?
The so-called tower folly was completed in 1921 .
John Rimbauer jumped to his death from it two years later.
Was it suicide... or did he run into something he couldn't deal with?
The certificate said accidental death.
The gossip said suicide or ghosts.
In any case, during its active years, and they were very active, women in Rose Red tended to turn up missing, and men tended to turn up dead.
- The bad days are over.
- Yes.
Indeed.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Then what do you want from us, Ms. Reardon?
First off, let's all get on a first-name basis, shall we?
That will make things less difficult.
This can be... a difficult field.
People either don't understand our goals, or refuse to credit our findings.
Some people are actively cruel.
And...
Research goals?
Yes, yes.
My research goals... specify measurable psychic phenomena.
Hard data in other words.
Telemetry readouts... and anomalous energy levels, primarily.
I want readouts that even the most... stupid, sarcastic, obtuse member of this so-called scientific department will have to accept.
If I get a little crazy on the subject from time to time, please forgive me.
I've put in a lot of long days.
If Rose Red is a dead cell, how much proof can you expect to find there?
If you apply electricity to the muscles in the leg of a dead frog, the muscles will contract hours after the frog has died.
You people are my psychic equivalent of electricity.
My goal is modest... a single twitch.
One single twitch.
If I get it... my reputation will be secure for the rest of my life.
More importantly, together we can legitimize a branch of psychology which has been treated as a poor relation for far too long.
What are you doing here,
Mr. Rimbauer?
What are your special talents?
Just protecting the family interests.
I promised the professor one good shot at the mansion and then the developers await.
Tech-Star Condominiums, the future.
You're gonna let them tear it down?
It's a piece of history.
History don't pay no rent and the kid is broke.
Hardly the most noble of motives.
Are we the team?
The whole team?
- She hopes not.
- Beg your pardon?
I was hoping for one more, but that's looking iffy.
If I have to make do with you five, then I'll count myself lucky.
I'll see you this Friday at 2:00 p.m. sharp.
I'm sure it will be a Memorial Day weekend to remember.
If you could all please join me...
I'd like to close with a circle.
This sort of thing went out with high-buttoned shoes.
Joyce, is there anything you'd like us to focus on?
Good will, good thoughts, each other.
- That's lovely.
- Thanks.
Say cheese.
Vic, are you okay?
Fine.
I'm gonna go make some room.
He looks a bit gray about the gills.
No, no.
Maybe half a glass, but no more.
Just a minute, please.
The Huskies were caught off guard by the weak-side blitz.
The linebacker starts to drop back, and then rushes the quarterback.
Y-ello.
Hello. I'd like to speak with Rachel. Is she there?
- Who is this?
- I'd like to speak with Rachel.
I know who this is.
The crazy lady from the college.
- How you doin', crazy lady?
- Is that for me?
My business is with your older daughter.
- I'd be grateful--
- You've got it wrong.
You have no business here.
Not with Sissy, Annie, or any of us.
Don't ever call here again, got that?
Daddy...
- that was my call.
- That was some crazy lady.
- That was my call. You have no right--
- Yeah, I do, as long as you live in my house and eat my food.
Stop it, both of you.
I know what the crazy lady wants.
Just like I know you've been talking to her behind my back.
Let me tell you this,
Annie's not going near Rose Red.
- Mama?
- She doesn't say. I say.
Mama?
Won't you help me once?
Please, just this once, will you speak up?
I've told you 1000 times,
I won't take sides between you and your father.
Mama.
What about Annie's side?
- The Gatt School--
- What planet are you living on?
You'll put her in the Gatt School with $5,000?
- Professor Reardon has promised 12!
- I knew she was crazy.
What's your excuse?
$20,000 is what it would take.
- $20,000 at least. A year.
- Rose Red is famous.
If something happens while we're there, it'd be worth a fortune to Annie.
Sure. I can just see her on Geraldo.
"Hi, I'm Annie Wheaton."
"I'm gonna tell folks all about a haunted house."
- Stop it! Don't mock her!
- I'm saving her.
From crazy lady number one, and crazy lady number two!
That is it, Sister.
This case is closed.
I won't hear any more about it.
- I'm calling her. We're going.
- No, you're not.
- Stop it, Annie! Stop it!
Make her stop!
What do you think, Dad?
What do you think
Annie wants?
- Stop it, Annie!
George!
Make her stop!
For God's sake!
Please, George, make her stop!
We thought you were lost.
No, just misplaced.
- May I propose a toast?
- Sure.
To Rose Red.
To Rose red.
Joyce... she's looking, still hoping for one more.
A sixth.
Six is the number.
A girl. A teenager.
And I think our dear professor will be in luck.
Is that something you see?
What's your special trait,
Pam?
I'm what psychic journals call a touch-know.
It doesn't always work, but sometimes when I handle things,
I see stuff, or I get feelings.
Of course, a lot of times there's nothing.
What about you, Vic?
Two people... mid-20s.
She's in a blue dress.
Vic:
He's in jeans.
He's blonde over-golded.
He's got a case of roaming hands and rushing fingers.
What in the world are you talking--
...Go outside.
- You wanna?
- Sure.
Tres chic, n'est-ce pas?
- You're precognitive!
- I can tell a hawk from a handsaw when the wind's in the northwest.
What about you, Cathy?
I'm an automatic writer.
- A Ouija board.
- Yes.
But I don't like the Ouija board.
The channel's too wide, and sometimes what comes through is unpleasant.
This is better.
Sometimes it's precog, sometimes it's astral.
Mostly it's just people to people.
Someone concentrate hard.
You, Pam.
Oh. Okay.
Let's see.
Uh...
Okay.
I guess it's not going to work.
Steve?!
What about you, Ste--
Nick?
He calls her Dee.
Why does he do that,
I wonder?
Nick?
I do a little of this, a little of that.
Sometimes I get lucky and things turn out all right.
What about our new friend, Emery?
What do we know about him?
- Your friend, not mine.
- I think Emery is post-cognitive.
He sees the past.
Not the most comfortable of talents.
Here's to good thoughts.
Goodwill.
Good thoughts, goodwill.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Where are you from?
When are you from?
Is it Rose Red?
Read my lips.
Save the warnings for someone who's not broke.
Okay?
I remember that day.
She was happy, wasn't she?
- We all were.
- Oh, man...
- Would you look at this?
- Huh?
Mr. Wheaton:
Those were the days, huh?
Ignorance is bliss.
Daddy, what Annie is, isn't anyone's fault.
It's not hers, it's not mine, it's not yours.
I know that.
But you're too busy thinking about what you want for Annie to think about what she can do.
Have you forgotten what happened after she got bit by the Stantons' dog?
How the stones came down?
Or what she did to those pipes?
After what she did tonight... how can you have any doubts about what she wants?
Sweetheart, taking Annie into a genuinely haunted house?
That's like using a lighter to see how full your gas tank is.
It's a chance.
That's what you don't understand.
It's a chance for her to get out--
And for you to get out from under.
I just want what's best for Annie.
I know, Sissy, but you don't know what that is.
Believe me.
Whispering voices:
Annie... come...
Come...
Pity you can't do the same with the other 40,000 or so.
People read it today and line their kitty litter boxes with it tomorrow.
I think they'll remember the photo.
Some will take that for inspection the next time the university bond issue comes up before the voters.
A photo like this could put
1 00 worthwhile programs to beggary.
But what do you care?
Do you have a point, Carl?
If so, get to it.
- I have a lot to do.
- Crystals to polish?
Ouijas to wax?
Did you put that kid Bollinger up to this? You did, didn't you?
You told him where to go and when to point his camera.
Tsk-tsk-tsk...
Your paranoia's showing.
Ah!
It's a nasty little cut.
Well, listen...
I'm afraid I have bad news for you, old girl.
I'm not old.
Not yet anyway.
And I'm certainly not your girl.
- What are you talking about?
- The Executive Committee has been in session regarding tenure.
What? Why? No one in the department's up for tenure.
The only thing that--
You really are a bastard.
The Committee voted five to two to revoke your tenure.
We tried to contact you so you could attend.
You'll find a message on your machine.
I'm surprised the spirits didn't tell you.
The general consensus is it's time to stop the silliness.
I will fight you every step of the process.
Of course, and you'll lose.
Your days of haunting the Wimser Psychology department-- to coin a phrase-- are not quite over, but they're numbered.
When I come back from Rose Red with proof, you--
This is the rallying cry of crackpots and deluded religionists.
Since the Stone Age, the proof is out there.
This is sad, really.
You used to be a respected writer and lecturer in child psychology.
But then you got bitten by this... virus!
It is a legitimate field of psychological investigation.
It's crap! It's sleazy!
It's a spit in the eye of rational thought!
But the good news is, that Rose Red will be your last goose chase as a member of this faculty.
You're an idiot and you're blind!
What if you find proof?
Let's just suppose.
Proof, photographs, audio recordings of the clanking chains, telemetry of some sort.
What good would it do?
Have you considered such thoughts?
I feel remarkably well today, in spite of all your crap.
This is the world we live in and experience with our five senses.
Skin... smooth and rational.
Every cause has its effect, and every effect can be predicted with the right database.
But there's a world under that world, blood, under the skin.
That's what rationalistic asses like you never see.
It's a world that's liquid instead of solid, hot instead of just warm.
It is a world full of mystery, Carl.
You don't like it, do you? No.
So don't give me your bull about bond issues and busted programs.
You're afraid of what's under the skin.
But I'm not.
Do you hear me, Carl?
I'm not.
- If you've given me something--
- That's what it comes down to, huh?
The bottom line?
You're afraid of catching something.
Go on, get out of here.
Go wash your face, then you can trot to the infirmary and get an AIDS test.
When the semester's over, you're done here.
You're finished teaching.
You're crazy!
- You're totally insane!
- Good day, old boy.
- What are you looking at?!
- Nothing.
Then go look somewhere else!
We did it, didn't we?
We nailed her.
What's on your face?
Never mind.
Never mind.
We have a great deal to talk about, young man.
The story's not over?
It's just beginning.
It's just beginning.
From the Department of Questions Better Not Answered, if a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it,
- does it make any noise?
- Mm-hmm.
Who cuts the barber's hair?
Who leaves money under the Tooth Fairy's pillow?
How come no one realizes
Clark Kent is just
Superman wearing glasses?
- Mm-hmm.
- If I didn't own Rose Red, would I be in bed with you right now?
Mm-hmm.
Hello.
- How was your day, dear?
- Give it back.
How was your day?
Or would you prefer that
I just rolled over and made myself small?
They revoked my tenure.
Carl Miller dropped by the office to give me the news himself.
- Wait. Can they do that?
- Maybe. Probably.
Bollinger's article in the paper made us look like the Stupid Family, with me as the Head Stupid.
You want to turn off your light?
You're pretty damn calm about it.
I heard from Sister.
She accepted the $12,000 I offered.
When I come back from Rose Red with hard data, there'll be four dozen universities willing to hire me.
First,
I'm going to write a book.
It is going to sell a gazillion copies.
I once heard you say that the only certainty when dealing with the paranormal is that nothing is certain.
What if you spend three days in Rose Red and nothing happens?
But it will.
Annie Wheaton is my guarantee.
She's--
Let's just say she's one of a kind.
You know, Rose Red is not a true dead cell.
Annie's going to wake it up.
And if you would just let the house stand for another six months,
- the research possibilities--
- No. No.
It's coming down in July, and I can't wait.
I cannot wait.
How can you hate it so much?
It eats my relatives!
- I'm sorry.
- Did you miss that in your research?
It's just that it means a lot to me.
Yeah, too much maybe.
You'll need some down time when this is over.
Some serious R&R.
Well, you have the cell phone.
Right here.
- And you've got plenty of film.
- Of course, but I don't know if this is such a good idea.
Don't tell me you're afraid.
No, of course
I'm not afraid.
It's just big.
What if I get lost?
Kevin, you know, you're about to step out in the real world in a couple of weeks.
That's where you're apt to get lost.
But you nail this story, you can write your own ticket.
I thought that's what you wanted.
Why don't you come in there with me?
I do have a few things to do, like running my department, overseeing finals...
Call me when you get the pictures, either I or my wife will come get you.
She can't stand that Reardon bitch either.
If they catch me in there, they'll tear me apart.
There's no reason why they should.
If you're reasonably careful.
I guess.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Don't forget this.
And try and get a good picture of them being psychic.
- Professor Miller, I don't think--
- Stiff upper, boy!
Stiff upper!
Professor Miller...
You're a step away from stardom, dear boy!
Just get the pictures!
Solarium... kitchen... tool-shed... back door... front door...
Oh.
- I thought this house was empty.
- It would be,
Mr. Bollinger, I believe.
- The reporter.
- Yeah, I'm Bollinger.
- But how did you know?
- Come in, sir.
You're expected.
Ma'am?
Where are you?
This way, sir.
Hello?
Hello?
Ma'am,
I seem to have lost you.
Ma'am?
Is anybody here?
Ma'am?
Screw this.
Okay, very funny, but I want to leave, all right?
Let me out!
I could use a little help in here!
- I'm in the greenhouse!
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
I'm out of here.
Come on.
Get a grip, Bollinger.
Miller over phone:
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
Bollinger?
Bollinger, is that you?
Hello?
Hey.
They'll be here.
Come on.
Wait!
Don't make me chase you,
Emmy!
- Mom, I'm okay.
- Yes, you're always okay?
Now, listen to me.
If anything happens that you can't handle, anything beyond a few telesmic manifestations,
- call me and I'll come and get you.
- I will, Mom. I have to go.
You call me anyway so I know you're all right.
I always do.
I have to go.
- They're waiting.
- Let them wait.
They won't do much without you, huh?
Now, turn around.
- Mom...
- Turn around.
And stay away from that blonde girl.
She looks like a tramp.
Now give Mommy a kiss.
You're all over lipstick.
Fix yourself.
Friends, I see new frontiers in abnormal psychology stretching out before us.
How exciting!
...Especially if you move your bowels!
Gosh, the day before summer camp must have been a busy time
- in the Waterman household.
- Shut up!
Off to the house on haunted hill, I see?
Oh and with-- with about 100,000 worth of department equipment.
I've got all the proper paperwork if you want to see it signed in all the proper places.
Oooh... signed by Rogers.
When I was on vacation, he was acting in my stead.
Very clever of you.
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Just trying to be pleasant.
If you'll excuse us,
Professor Miller, we're in a hurry.
Yes, of course.
Places to go, ghosts to bust.
Isn't that right, Mr. Rimbauer?
Yeah, more or less.
Yes.
Well, keep the equipment in one piece.
Good luck.
The spirits have done it all in one night.
That's what Scrooge says when he wakes up a changed man.
That's what he made me think of.
Scrooge on Christmas morning.
I don't trust him.
Hello.
Are you the group?
The Rose Red group?
Yes.
I'm Pam Asbury.
This is Cathy Kramer.
Hi.
- Victor Kandinsky.
- Vic. Just Vic.
Oh.
Nick Hardaway.
And Emery Waterman.
And...
- you must be...
- I'm Sissy Wheaton. This is Annie.
I was sure we were going to miss you guys. Traffic was horrible.
- We're glad you didn't.
- Sister--
- or do you prefer Rachel?
- Either is fine.
Just quit it.
Good God. She's retarded.
If you keep your psychological evaluation of Miss Wheaton to yourself, we won't ask you any embarrassing questions about your relationship with your mother. Chin, chin.
Folks,
I think we're ready.
You've reached the cell phone of Carl Miller.
Please, leave a message after the tone.
Bollinger, where are you?
I told you to keep that phone with you...
In any case, they've left the campus.
They'll be there in 40 minutes, so be ready.
Then call me back.
There she is.
It seems to be looking at us.
It is, Cathy.
It is.
Steve.
Mommy?
Where are you?
Mommy?
I'm scared.
Where are you, Mommy?
Steve.
Steve, you okay?
Huh?
Yeah, sure. Fine.
You wanna know a secret?
I've never done anything like this before and I'm pretty much scared to death.
Be not afraid.
Only believe.
We're lucky most of the electronic stuff was delivered and installed earlier this week.
- What are these?
- House plans.
Probably as useful as a 14th century map of Africa.
And here, a coil of rope.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Are you okay?
Boy's voice:
Mommy? I'm scared.
Stevey...
Stevey... come...
What is it? What can you hear?
- Steve...
- It knows we're here.
It wants us here.
God help us.
It wants us here.
Come in...
Come see...
Houses are alive.
This is something we know.
News from our nerve endings.
If we're quiet... if we listen... we can hear houses breathe.
Sometimes in the depth of the night, we hear them groan.
It's as if they're having bad dreams.
A good house cradles and comforts.
A bad one fills us with instinctive unease.
Bad houses hate our warmth, our humanness.
That blind hate of our humanity is what we mean when we use the word ""haunted.""
Steve?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I heard it, too. .
Then it stopped.
- What? What did you hear?
- There were words.
It wasn't clear... did any of you?
Cathy:
I might have heard something.
Or it might have just been my imagination.
- Steve, what was it?
- How would I know?
I don't have a psychic bone in my body, as you well know.
You tested me yourself so there's no real--
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Pam... can you come here?
We might as well get started.
Will you...?
All right.
Emers old boy, why don't you come and give us a hand?
It seems to be the butler's day off.
- Don't call me that.
- Come on.
For $5,000 you can carry a couple of boxes, can't you?
I'm not being paid for my services as a porter.
Pam? You all right?
I thought this house was empty.
You would be
Mr. Bollinger, the reporter.
Pam?
I'm Bollinger.
How did you know?
Come in, sir.
You were expected.
This way.
Come in, sir.
You were expected.
This way.
How old were you when you got lost in there? Eight? Nine?
- What are you talking about?
- The room with colored light.
The smell of sawdust.
What happened?
What did you see?
What frightened you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, don't you?
But you're not saying.
What is it?
It's cold. Just... cold metal, that's all.
But you spoke.
There was something there, but it's gone.
I didn't like the way it felt.
The caretaker must have left it there.
After he let in the guys who brought the equipment.
- He'll miss it.
- Not after the summer.
Come September, there won't be a gate to open.
There's a flashlight for each of you.
I suggest you keep it on or near you at all times.
The power's fine most of the time.
And if it goes out,
I don't suppose looking for the fusebox does much good.
Nope. Neither does calling
Puget Sound Energy.
What about your equipment?
If the power goes, everything of mine switches to batteries.
I think we better get started.
Where's Annie?
She's wonderful.
Friday afternoon,
3:1 7 p.m.
We've just experienced our first paranormal phenomenon-- a phantom draft.
The only thing I insist on is that you don't go off exploring on your own.
The geography of Rose Red can seem unstable.
Maybe we should double up on sleeping arrangements.
I don't mind sharing with Cathy.
Or the three of us could go in together like summer camp.
I'll sleep with Emery and after midnight we'll raid the fridge.
Won't we, Em?
The bedrooms are perfectly safe.
The important thing is not to go off wandering.
I think you'll find this interesting.
You could make Thanksgiving dinner for a hundred people in here.
Maybe after the place was fumigated.
You're such a charmer.
Was I talking to you?
Ellen Rimbauer called this
""the health room.""
We call it a solarium.
A railroad executive named
George Meader, a friend and drinking buddy of John Rimbauer, died in here after the end of the first World War.
According to a doctor he was stung by a bee.
Died of an extreme allergic reaction.
As I told you, in Rose Red's heyday men didn't fare well here.
That's not very reassuring.
I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Just use the buddy system when moving through the house.
- Now--
- Whoa.
What?
What's this?
Did the caretaker leave that, too?
I doubt it.
Well, then who?
Press redial and see who answers.
Hello, you've reached Professor Carl Miller of the Psychology Department.
I'm not able to answer the phone at the present time.
Leave a message at the beep if you like, but remember your Shakespeare.
Who is it?
Brevity is the soul of wit.
Hello, Professor Miller, this is Joyce Reardon's friend,
Steven Rimbauer.
We have found a piece of your property here in Rose Red.
I'm fairly sure you didn't drop it yourself since we saw you an hour ago, but I've got a good idea who did.
The guy who wrote the newspaper story. Am I right?
Now trespassing isn't a very serious crime and abetting a trespasser is probably even less serious but your dignity is going to take a hit at the very least.
Guess who's going to be the cover boy on next week's newspaper?
You have a nice day.
Bravo, Steve.
Bravo.
Cathy:
You can't be certain that that is Professor Miller's cell phone.
Oh, of course it is.
If you want proof, dial some of the numbers in memory.
I bet one of them is that son of a bitch, Bollinger.
If the reporter had the phone, where's the reporter?
Maybe the house ate him.
Isn't that what it's supposed to do? Eat people?
Probably something frightened him, the sort of thing that neither he nor Professor Miller believes in and he just ran off.
Perhaps he's still in the house.
If he is, then we'll find him.
Come on, folks. Let's--
Joyce, are you sure we shouldn't notify somebody?
Why should we?
If Bollinger's here, he's trespassing, like Steve said.
If we call the cops then we're apt to find ourselves with half a dozen police tromping through the house and roiling up the atmosphere and he'll win.
That pig Miller will win in spite of everything.
And I can't have it, okay?
I just won't! I can't!
It's okay.
He doesn't get to win.
If we find Bollinger we can give him a cup of tea and a good spanking and send him on his way.
- Sounds good to me.
- Yeah, me too.
On with the show?
On with the show.
It's a pity no one kept up those vines.
There hasn't been a full-time groundskeeper at Rose Red since Omicron Oil fell off the Big Board a quarter century ago.
I believe we're lingering in the kitchen because Joyce wants to tell you about my Great-Aunt April.
- Go on, Joyce.
- Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure. That's what we're here for, right?
Besides, it was all before my time. Go on.
April was six years old when she disappeared.
Her brother Adam was away at boarding school.
Boarding school at eight?
It was Rimbauer's idea.
Ellen ranted and raved, but John, at least this time, put his foot down and kept it down.
He didn't trust Rose Red even then.
This was the last place
April was ever seen.
Sukeena stepped into the pantry over there for what she swore was no more than 30 seconds.
When she came out...
April?
I'm a little teapot...
- April, honey, where are you?
April?
50 men searched the house and grounds.
They found nothing.
Not so much as a lock of hair or a thread from her dress.
Great-grandfather was convinced that
Sukeena had something to do with it.
So he had her taken downtown.
Ellen objected in the strongest possible terms but John respectfully declined to listen.
Ellen, stop it!
Please, John!
Sukeena!
Sukeena was taken to a small basement room you can probably imagine, and questioned for 50 hours.
No sleep, no food, no bathroom breaks, no mercy.
I don't know.
She was gone.
I don't know.
In the end she convinced them that she didn't know anything about April's disappearance.
But it cost her... it cost her three teeth, a broken nose and a broken wrist.
Eventually, Ellen's maid was allowed to return home again.
The only home she had left.
So when do we get to upstairs?
I heard that's where the really weird stuff is.
No time like the present.
Come on, everybody.
I didn't notice that one before.
Neither did I.
For the rest of the weekend could you please remember
- who's running this expedition?
- Sure.
Nick, could you come here, please?
If you could tie the end of your rope to that pole, it'll help us find our way back.
Couldn't we just go back and get the plans?
In this house, the plans don't always mean a lot.
It's only a safety measure.
So follow me and prepare to be amazed.
I'm a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
Hear me shout...
Ellen called this the perspective hallway.
It was her first major addition.
And no architect designed it, either.
She made it up herself?
Way to go, Ellen.
But she didn't.
Then who?
Sukeena.
- Her maid?
- Her companion.
It's so wild.
Like something in a fun house.
It's making my stomach turn.
I guess they're pieces built in perspective.
Camouflaging the real doors was Great-Gram's idea.
She didn't want them to spoil the illusion.
Bollinger!
Hey, Bollinger, are you in there?
Whoa.
Annie, no!
No!
You be quiet!
If you wanted this place to wake up.
I'd say you've been successful in that regard.
Cathy:
What was that? Who screamed?
Does she ever get assertive, or does she always waffle like that?
She doesn't talk much, but what she says, she means.
Yeah, I'll say.
In the mid '60s, a team of scientists, one of them a geologist, spent time investigating Rose Red and heard the house scream several times.
They recorded a couple of them.
Although on tape they don't sound very impressive.
What did they conclude?
That they were hearing the sound of underground water, perhaps amplified by the old water drainage pipes that run under this part of Seattle.
Underground water?
People faced with these sort of phenomena tend to protect their belief systems ferociously.
This hallway was the last place
Ellen Rimbauer was ever seen.
They moved in on January 15, 1909.
Ellen marked the occasion each January 15th by wearing the same white dress she wore the day they arrived.
For many of those years
Ellen threw a party on January 15th and everybody who was anybody showed up-- politicians, hoodlums, sports players, stars.
When the actress disappeared, the parties stopped.
Finish telling us about old Mrs. Rimbauer.
She disappeared on
January 15, 1950.
She was 70.
A maid saw her and wished her good evening and she swept by as if she didn't even hear her.
And that was the last anyone ever saw of her.
Come on.
Lots more to see.
This is the gymnasium.
Although the exercise equipment is out of date--
This room demands a particular form of exercise.
What? How... ?
It's the mirror library.
It's not in the plans, but I remember seeing it as a boy.
I was afraid to go in because I thought I'd fall.
They're not in the plans?
How can they not be in the plans?
Cathy:
There's a camera.
Not good. Not good at all.
The property of Kevin Bollinger.
Oh, God. Mr. Bollinger!
Mr. Bollinger, are you here?
What's wrong?
I told you this might happen.
The lights will come back on.
In the meantime, use your flashlights.
I think we should go back downstairs.
Shh. Nonsense.
Oh, my-- look.
Steve, roll tape, roll tape.
Annie...
Annie, no.
Annie, don't touch it.
Annie, no!
Annie, come here.
Come with me.
Stop her! Somebody's got to stop her!
Are you okay?
How did you know to do that?
I don't know. I just did it.
Here take it.
I don't want it.
Here. Give it to me.
Try and get some pictures.
Good pictures of them being psychic.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I think it's someone talking to Bollinger.
Yeah, I bet I know who.
Is Bollinger alive?
Can you tell?
He was when he dropped this camera. Beyond that...
I don't know.
I think we ought to get out of here, Joyce.
Okay, let's head downstairs.
Break time.
Thank God.
Wait. It's not the same.
The hallway.
- No, nonsense--
- No, he's right.
We should be going back the way we came, but we're not.
What is that?
Steve, what's going on?
The building's started again.
You wanted to wake the place up.
Now you got what you wanted.
But who's building?
And what?
I don't know.
You're lying.
No, I'm not lying.
Is it too hard to remember?
Or too frightening to remember?
It's gone.
It stopped.
Then I suggest we go downstairs before it starts again.
Annie, I need your help.
Now put your hand here and push from here.
Annie, what are you doing?
Nick...
Not now, Joyce.
Annie!
That wasn't funny.
I know another way down and there might be something worth seeing along the way.
Are you sure you know the way?
Yes.
Oh my God.
""Oh my God"" is right.
More camouflaged doors, Stevie?
Great-Gram was never above using a good trick twice.
This was her little joke on her husband's business life.
Did he get it?
I doubt it.
I don't even really get it.
Here's the real door right here.
Just press right there.
This house has everything, but chow.
Joyce. It's this way.
Oh. Of course.
I knew that.
Better, Emery?
Than nothing I guess.
Too much mayo in the crabmeat.
What do you want, big boy?
Bare-breasted nymphs to kneel at your feet and offer you delicacies from silver platters?
Stop it right now.
Stop harassing me.
There's a difference between joking and harassing.
Did you never learn that?
I learned plenty in high school, believe me, from guys like him. And you.
Come on, give it a rest.
Emery I might be able to provide you with something you like better in a little while.
Tell us about the actress,
Joyce.
I've always been a sucker for celebrities.
Well, that's her, on Ellen's wall of fame.
Deanna Petrie was a fairly big star in the '40s.
Musical comedies mostly.
She could dance, sing a little, and she was sexy as hell.
She was one of Ellen Rimbauer's favorite guests at her January 1 5th parties.
In 1 946 she showed up in what Hedda Hopper called
""the cocktail dress.""
It was what she was wearing when she disappeared.
She spent most of the night, here in the billiard room, wowing the guests with her many talents.
She left behind a single earring.
A maid found it the next day, but there was no longer a girl to go with it.
Deanna's disappearance made Rose Red's reputation.
And now Annie, if you've finished eating,
I have something to show you.
It's nice.
You'll like it.
I promise.
It's okay.
Go up, Annie.
Go up and see what you find.
It's not dangerous, is it?
No, not a bit.
Go on, Annie.
You okay, son?
Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Annie.
What in the world is it?
Whatever it is, she likes it.
Cathy, you were right.
- Revelation 12.
- Oh, yeah.
No corporal presence in six centuries.
No psychic pulse.
Emery, are you thinking of dressing for dinner?
You tell me.
Read my mind.
Annie, Glen Miller.
That doesn't work.
I tried it while I was setting up.
Sorry, Annie.
Ah!
Joyce?
It's all right.
Got three loaded for Reardon.
Large, with two six-packs of soda.
Yep, thank you.
Told you there might be something you like better.
Loaded. Excellent.
Miss Asbury?
May I?
Okay.
Do this often?
Every chance we get?
How much?
This is some place.
Is it haunted?
Yes, by the ghosts of delivery men who asked too many stupid questions and never escaped.
This is unbelievable.
What are you doing to me?
She's terrific.
Wouldn't think you'd need a telemetry readout
- just to count heads.
- Not human ones certainly.
Oh.
I'm really worried about Mr. Bollinger.
Don't bother.
He'll show up eventually.
I wish I could be as sure of that as you seem to be.
By the way, where's Vic?
Right here.
Anyone care to dance?
Not me. I'm pooped.
Where have you been?
I lost my book.
Nice story time.
We've heard the one about the actress.
Tell us about
Rimbauer's partner, Mr. Posey.
Remember that seance
I told you about?
Starring the famous gypsy psychic, Cora Frye?
Mm, yes.
That was 1914 and the war in Europe was heating up the American economy.
Omicron Oil was in clover.
Money was rolling in.
And John Rimbauer was tired of sharing it.
So in October of that same year he gave Douglas Posey the bum's rush.
According to family legend,
Uncle Posey had a taste for cowboys.
He liked chaps in chaps?
Was he into roping or branding?
Probably a little bit of both.
John Rimbauer bought him out at distress sale prices.
He was told never to come back to Rose Red, but he did.
Once and that was in 1915.
John was in Europe and Adam and April were at home with their mom.
Grand-dad never forgot Posey tossing him that Tom Mix hat.
He wanted to keep it and he threw a tantrum when his mother tried to take it away.
And the rose. He never forgot
April catching the rose.
Why did Posey wait a year to do it?
And why here? Any ideas?
If you wanted answers, you came to the wrong place.
Following the suicide,
John and Ellen kept Adam out of Rose Red as much as possible.
As I told you, he was at boarding school when his sister disappeared.
He knew damn well that something was very wrong here.
Even then.
The male descendants in the Rimbauer line mostly stayed clear of the family manse.
I wasn't here more than half a dozen times as a kid.
I got off on my own just once, I was eight.
- Wait, I thought your father--
- My father hated this place.
He was afraid of it.
But it was my mother who brought me.
I forgot until today.
Blocked it out, I suppose.
Nick reminded me.
She probably couldn't find a babysitter.
What was she looking for?
Antiques, loot...
I think she was drunk.
That's my memory of it.
She so often was in those days.
I know she and Dad were broke.
After we lost the oil company, it's been a family disease, broke-itis.
While your mother was treasure hunting, you got lost?
Yeah, I mean it was no big deal--
You were upstairs before you realized how lost you were.
One floor above the mirror library.
Or was it three floors? Or 1 0?
Because when this place gets going, when it feels lively, when it has energy to draw on,
Rose Red can make itself as big as it wants, can't it?
Finally you got to the top. and that's where--
Oh my God.
What is it? Do you know?
It's a cluster manifestation with rising elements, like an earthquake!
It's the house!
It's coming alive!
How many are there?
Can you tell?
Damn this thing!
I'm not so sure there is anyone here!
I know it sounds crazy, but--
Be gone!
Aaaah!
Annie, don't touch it.
- Go.
Annie.
Go ahead.
Go.
Annie, come.
I'd advise none of you to go wandering tonight.
- You'd agree, wouldn't you, Steve?
- As a matter of fact, I would.
If you're quiet, if you listen, you can hear houses breathe.
Sometimes, in the depth of the night, you can hear them groan, as if they were having bad dreams.
Could I ask you something?
Of course, Emery.
Will-- will you come to bed with me?
Look, isn't that your mom?
That's not my mother.
That's just an old--
Pam?
What are you doing?
Say cheese!
Say cheese, Emmy!
Oh man!
Five grand wasn't enough, Ma.
Not at all.
20 wouldn't have been enough.
- Ah!
- Voh-doh-dee-oh-doh.
Want to get it on?
We've got all night,
Emery.
- We've got forever.
- You're not there!
- No there!
- But I am.
I'm your girl.
I'm your dream girl.
Not there. Not there.
Not there. Not there!
- Say cheese!
- Who is it?
- Cathy.
Come on. Hurry up!
What is it?
It's Steve.
He's found something amazing.
- It explains so much.
- Explains what?
What are you talking about?
Annie.
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I am safe and warm...
Annie, turn the record player off.
Dad'll be pissed.
Reach out
To me
There're no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed
With love.
What is it?
Did you open that?
If you opened it, close it.
I can't sleep with the closet door open.
I'm afraid of the bogeyman, aren't you?
No... ogeyman.
- No bogeyman?
- Og--
Ogey-lady.
Bogey-lady?
Night-night.
You are going to get it now!
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Just pay your bill and kiss my ass!
- No luck?
- No.
My mother is going to go crazy.
It's not a very long trip for her, even at the best of times.
- I'm sorry about that.
- Yeah, well...
I'm thinking of getting out of here before she shows up.
I get very tired of her... showing up.
Also, Rimbauer gets on my nerves.
Joyce too, actually.
""If you look to your left, you will see the ghost of
April Rimbauer and Douglas Posey.
Don't worry, they're perfectly harmless.""
And you know what? Underneath that phoney tour guide shtick, she is as crazy as the Red Queen.
""Off with their heads.""
And that creepy kid with that creepy doll...
She's... nuts too.
Rimbauer is just smart ass du jour.
What's this?
Your shrink routine?
Just get it off your chest.
A dead cell, isn't that what Joyce called it?
You want to know about dead?
I had a dead movie star in bed with me last night.
- Deanna Petrie?
- Yeah.
It didn't last long but it was a very... physical manifestation.
I'm getting tired of Rose Red's little tricks.
If Joyce wants some of her $5,000 back,
I'll just see her in court.
If my mother doesn't hear from me soon, she is really going to go nuclear.
- Operator: ...And try again...
- I will not try again later!
Good morning, Annie.
All right, then.
Good morning, Steve.
Ah, good morning.
- Is that Annie?
- Annie it is.
Would you like some eggs?
It would be a pleasure.
No, thanks.
- Have you seen Joyce?
- Yes, fiddling with her equipment.
Looking as if she last had a good night's sleep circa 1 972.
I'd tread carefully if I were you.
- She's crabby, huh?
- Very.
The video was cloudy, the audio garbled, no recorded telemetry of any use.
What's that?
That's the wine cellar.
Isn't it marvelous?
The door was open when I came down this morning.
- Haven't you seen it before?
- No.
Rose Red hasn't just woken up.
It's become the House & Garden version of Frankenstein's monster.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
Listen.
- Have you heard much of that?
- Enough to worry me.
And Bollinger's persistent non-appearance worries me too.
You would think, if he were still here-- here and alive-- that we'd have run into him by now, wouldn't you?
I don't know.
And the longer we go without reporting his disappearance, the more peculiar our position becomes if he turns up dead or if he doesn't turn up at all.
Dom Perignon 1949.
It's a very good year.
In my experience, they're all good years.
What goes better with scrambled eggs than champagne?
Pull the cork, Steve.
Will you wet your whittle?
It's a little early for me.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Mmm...
You know this place is feeding off us.
And although I'm sure it finds us all rather tasty, its primary sources of nourishment are little Annie
- and you.
- Me?
I don't have a telepathic bone in my body.
I don't know what you were before you came here, but I know now that you are a powerful psychic transmitter operating on Rose Red's wavelength.
It almost had you once.
It wants you back.
- It wants Annie too.
- You're crazy.
Crazy?
Maybe.
But I vouch that Joyce is crazier, and she means to have her proof, even if someone has to die for it.
- You're wrong.
- Really?
Let's ask Mr. Bollinger if we meet him again.
What are you doing?
Trying to make sure Miller actually sent Bollinger here.
If he did, I'll call the police and report him missing.
- Joyce won't like that.
- According to you, she's not very happy anyway.
Professor, what are you doing here on a Saturday morning?
Minding my business, as I hope you will yours.
Ah! Who locked this door?
Janitor: I imagine you locked it yourself, it being your office.
You must have the number.
It's your cell phone.
Will you talk to him if he calls back?
- I'd be delighted.
- Thanks.
Steve's voice:
Guess who'll be the cover boy on next week's paper?
You have a nice day.
Damn you!
...received at 8:42 a.m.
This is Steven Rimbauer again.
I need to talk to you about Kevin Bollinger.
He slit his wrists and wrote your name on the wall in his own blood before he died.
And Joyce suggests you come out here before we call the police.
Maybe we can work out a way to minimize this scandal, but it's imperative you come the second you get this message.
End of message.
You have no more new messages.
Have a nice day,
Professor.
Good morning, Annie.
Good morning, Annie.
Good morning, Annie.
Good morning, Annie.
Good morning.
Steve.
Good morning, Steve.
Good morning, Steve.
Right.
Wow... knock yourself out.
That's pretty good.
She can also bend spoons, turn on the lights, and set off car alarms.
Jeez.
- I got babies.
- Yes, very nice babies.
I got Adam...
I got April.
She never talks to strangers.
I'm impressed.
In fact, I'm stunned.
Well, I've never heard Glen Miller playing out of a flower before.
You're-- you're Rachel?
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yeah... most people call me
Sister or Sissy, for short.
I think I prefer Rachel.
So this is a very big deal for Joyce, right?
The biggest.
Because of all the disappearances,
Rose Red is a white whale in the field of psychic research.
And now that Miller's gotten her tenure revoked, it's even more important.
If Joyce comes back with proof of paranormal activity, she'll be okay. If not...
I had no idea things were so dire for her.
She's paying me a great deal of money-- paying Annie, I should say.
- I wonder if she can afford it.
- I wonder too.
You really don't know?
Forgive me, but I thought you two
- were closer than that.
- In some ways, we are.
In other ways, we're not even in the same neighborhood.
Tell me about her.
She's 15.
She's autistic.
She loves "a summer place".
She loves big bands.
She's also telepathic and psychokinetic... which are probably the least important things about her.
- Can I show you something?
- Sure.
Everything was dead at this end of the room yesterday.
The house is coming to life.
We all feel it.
Maybe, but the house didn't do this.
Annie did.
It's the other side of what she is.
It's not all frozen pipes and falling stones.
When I look at her,
I don't see ruin.
I see roses.
When Annie was five, a dog bit her.
Ah! Annie, make him go away!
Annie! Make him stop!
Make him go away!
What happened? Oh my God.
He bit her!
Your dog bit my sister.
Oh my God.
Buddy, get back in the house!
I'm so sorry.
He's never done this before.
He's never bitten anyone.
I'm so sorry.
We'll take care of that.
It'll be all right.
It'll be just fine.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Sister, look at this.
Sister,
I got Baby!
Stones from the sky.
And they all just fell on the Stanton's house.
Nowhere else on the street.
It was the dog that hurt her, and the dog had been destroyed, but--
Annie didn't understand that.
- Stop it.
- Answer me! Are you proud of this?
- Oh, stop it, Daddy.
- I'm not gonna stop it!
Come on, how could you be so stupid?
How could you let a reporter get a hold of Annie's drawings?
Annie came in while
I was arguing with my father, and... well...
You could say she launched a protest.
She froze all the water in the house.
She's a big time telekinetic and that's all Joyce cares about.
- Joyce is--
- No!
No, I-- thank you.
I do understand.
I think even Annie understands why we're here, in her own way.
But for me, the thing that's important about Annie, all that's important about Annie... is that she responds to love with love.
There has to be a place for the Annies of the world.
It would be nice to think so, but the world isn't always fair. That's all.
I know it.
I understand.
For the lamb shall feed and lead them unto living fountains of waters...
We must drink from the grape, and not the grain.
Maybe later.
You sure?
Could we...?
What is she thinking?
Any idea at all?
Not the slightest.
Miss Asbury, you look lovely this morning.
If only I'd have known,
I'd have dressed for the occasion.
What's wrong?
Ms. Asbury?
Pam?
It's not much further.
Who are you?
I might ask you the same thing.
Patricia Waterman,
Emery's mother.
Carl Miller,
Professor Miller.
Nice to meet you.
Are you going in there?
- I'm afraid so.
- Good. I've come to get my boy.
Get the gate, would ya?
Come on!
Put your back into it!
- What is it you found?
- Something amazing, it explains so much.
- Maybe we should tell the others.
- We will, but I wanted to show you first.
Dastardly bitch!
Em?
Emery!
What is wrong with you?
Look what you've done to my car.
Emery!
Come back!
Patricia: Emery!
Woman! Could we exchange insurance information?
Where are you?
Woman!
Patricia: Emers!
Emery!
Not there. Not there.
Not there.
Emery!
Emery!
Emery, what's wrong?
Stop running!
Let me help!
Pam?
Pam?
Woman!
Where are you?
Pam?
Be not afraid, only believe.
Be not afraid, only believe.
Where am I?
Emery!
Emery!
Oh my God.
It is her.
Woman!
Where are you?
Emery!
Emers!
Is that you?
Emery!
Only believe.
I don't believe.
I don't believe.
No!
Emery!
Help me, Mommy,
I'm so scared.
- Emers.
- Help me.
Mrs. Waterman?
Where are you?
Somebody, help me!
She's alive!
Please help.
Not there. Not there
Not there.
I don't want to go!
Open the window.
- Let me in!
- Not there.
Emery?
I'm having a heart attack!
Call 911.
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin.
- Call 911.
- Not there.
Not there. Not there.
Not there...
Emery, look at me!
Please, look at me!
I'm... for God's sake, open the window!
Not there, not Mommy, not Vic, not the actress, not anyone, not there...
Not there. Not there.
Not there, not there in my hair, foul or fair, don't you dare, no one there, peach or pear, no one there, in my hair, foul or fair...
Don't you dare, no one there...
- What's going on?
- No one there...
Vic!
He came to you for help, and you turned your back on him.
What the hell's going on?
Oh God.
Sir, pardon me, sir?
Yes?
Are you here for Mr. Bollinger?
- Is he here?
- Yes... waiting for you in the solarium.
If you're Professor Miller, that is.
He's all right?
He's not hurt or...?
I believe he's impatient to go home, sir, but otherwise he seems quite well.
It's Rimbauer.
What is going on?
I'm sure I cannot say, sir.
Ms. Reardon's party seems rather rambunctious.
Does it indeed?
Take me to Bollinger.
Right away, sir.
How did I get up here?
Will you slow down?
Where are you going?
Hello?
Ma'am!
Where are you?
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
An instant of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
THE DEVI L'S BACKBONE
We'll be there soon.
What the...
It fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.
They came... they defused it... and they left it there.
Nobody can move it.
Follow me, please.
Carlos... wait for me here.
We won't be long.
Who are those people outside?
The caretaker and two men who help him.
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.
They're building a chicken coop.
What's going on out there?
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Domínguez again?
Yes. Ayala's wounded.
They're always in trouble.
They've brought another boy.
As if we didn't have enough already.
Let's go.
Are you a new kid?
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?
I'm Gálvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he sure sees a lot.
I'm Carlos.
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?
No, but I've got some comics and toys.
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.
I can barely feed the ones who are here. I'm sorry.
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.
Oh, no!
I'm the brave one.
Ricardo was a man of books, of ideas.
He decided to die and leave me here to defend his ideals.
The Nationalists will arrive any day and what will they find?
Reds looking after Reds' children.
Not to mention this!
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy... take the rest of the gold.
There are 10 ingots left.
At least you can buy guns.
I can't even buy bread with it.
- Take it away.
- We can't.
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.
The boy goes hungry here or gets killed out there.
Class time!
Come on!
Look, Owl, a comic book!
I'll swap you.
Look at this marble.
It's my favorite. It's from China.
Or look at this one.
Owl made it himself.
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.
Hey, you! That's mine!
- Are you here to stay?
- No.
Then why are you here?
I came with Mr. Ayala, my tutor.
- What's the hell's a tutor?
- He looks after me while my father's away.
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.
Take the comic from me.
Go on.
Take it away.
C'mon.
Carlos, look!
Mr. Ayala.
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!
Stay with him for a while.
He seems quite meek.
I'm sure you'll get along.
We'll have to fix it.
The Count of Monte Cristo.
Has Edmond Dantés broken out of prison yet?
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.
Why don't you read on, then tell me?
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.
She teaches math and reading.
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?
Her name is Carmen.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.
Why did they leave me here?
Why can't I be with my father?
Carlitos... you're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.
So be patient.
Your soap has to last you all year.
Be careful with it... or you'll be punished with two weeks of extra tasks.
You can play in the yard, but never inside the building.
This is your bed.
Number 12.
Why are there so many empty beds?
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...
For your locker.
Do you understand?
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.
See where they put the new kid?
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!
Pig and I think that even though you complain a lot... you're all right here.
Far away from the war, well hidden.
Well looked after.
- What could be better?
- Granada.
Why go to Granada?
We're getting married.
We'll buy a farm.
Sure.
Granada!
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?
I don't need anyone.
I've managed fine on my own so far...
Right.
And without parents.
- Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.
That's why they eat so well here... too much gold.
You don't believe me now, but you will.
I'll try these two tonight and let you know what happens.
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?
- No.
- All right, so long.
I don't like those two.
They make me sick.
This place makes me sick.
When I was a kid...
I'd stand here... in the middle of the yard... and I'd look up at the sky.
I dreamed of getting out of here.
I prayed to become rich... so I could buy this dump and tear it down.
Forget it now.
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.
Well, I'm glad you came back.
Let's go to my room.
It's getting cold.
San... ti...
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?
The fucking new kid spilled our water.
Come on.
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.
Isn't that off limits?
No one's ever been caught.
What about the "one who sighs"?
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?
Who's the "one who sighs"?
- You're chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.
You're a shit, a queer.
All right, I'll go.
But you're coming with me.
We'll each fill a jug.
But if you're scared...
They say she's switched off.
But I don't believe it.
Put your ear against her, you'll hear ticking.
That's her heart.
She's still alive.
And she knows we're here.
Hide!
That one.
C'mon.
See you outside.
"No one's ever been caught."
Bastard.
Shit!
Hello.
Who are you?
Do you live down here?
Many of you will die.
Jaime!
What are you up to?
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.
It flatters pity...
It flatters pity not to be able to hide.
Let your lips bear witness... to the blaze in your heart.
No one will believe the fire if the smoke sends no signals.
He who cares for his well-being keeps not his feelings silent.
My grief is greater than I.
And that being so... it will be easier... it will be easier... for it to defeat me... than for me to command it.
Consideration does not suffice to prevent the cry.
He is not a brave prisoner who dares not break down his jail."
A grain of strength.
Carlos, are you going to tell me who was with you last night?
He's not going to tell.
He'll squeal in the end.
Just wait and see.
You understand?
Then, for the last time... who was with you last night?
I was alone.
That boy won't talk.
If we want to know who was with him...
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.
Perfect.
Very well.
You may begin.
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.
They're ravenous.
Look at how they're eating.
The first one to look up from his plate is his accomplice.
Marcos, Gálvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here.
I knew you wouldn't squeal.
Dr. Casares tricked me.
Just what I said.
It isn't your fault we were punished.
- Dr. Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!
Careful.
Come on, Owl.
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!
Well, well!
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.
Are things that bad?
If the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...
Try it now.
I told you.
- Dance with me.
- No.
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.
I can't dance.
Ayala said so.
Catalonia is about to fall.
Then Madrid will fall, and then...
There's talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?
Yes.
Sometimes I think that we are the ghosts.
Gálvez... last night, you didn't shoot.
That's right.
- Wow, that's great!
- It's for you.
Why are they laughing?
Fuckers.
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.
England or France might still intervene.
That's just wishful thinking.
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.
No, I'm not like him.
Twenty years ago,
I found the place for me.
And I stayed.
That's all.
Look at it jump!
Where's the new kid?
Are you the "one who sighs"?
Do you live down there?
Listen.
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.
Ass-kisser!
Throw him down!
Go on!
He can't swim!
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!
There he is!
Grab him! Careful!
What's going on?
What have I told you?
And you, eh?
What the fuck are you doing down here?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.
Get out!
Out!
Say a word about this and I'll cut you in half.
Got that?
There you go.
Our Carlos has been here five minutes... and he's in trouble already.
Have you read any more of Monte Cristo?
Do you believe in ghosts?
There aren't any in the novel.
I think I saw one, here.
Carlos, as you can see...
I'm a man of science.
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.
Europe is sick with fear now, and fear sickens the soul.
And that, in turn, makes us see things.
In town... they call this...
"the devil's backbone."
They say a lot of things.
That this happens to children who shouldn't have been born.
"Nobody's children."
But that's a lie.
Poverty and disease.
That's all it is.
The liquid they're in is called "limbo water."
In the old days, it was made with various spices... cloves, rum.
So this is very, very old rum.
I sell it in town, and the money keeps the school going.
Do they drink it?
They say it helps to cure blindness, kidney ailments... and also, apparently... impotence.
Rubbish, but you know... after 60, men will pay anything just to...
You know.
So if you're going to believe in ghosts and all that rubbish... you should have a sip of this to heal your wound.
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?
Yes, of course.
And be more careful!
Calm down.
I'm not going to hit you.
So don't make any noise.
Carlos... get out your comics so we can look at them.
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.
Look.
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.
She's a looker!
Who drew this?
Her pussy's the wrong way round.
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you lot know?
Look, a slice of fig cake.
It's a bit squashed but it tastes good.
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.
All right.
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.
You're a real artist.
When I grow up,
I want to draw comics.
- Like mine?
- No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.
And big ships with lots of cannons.
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?
Did you hear that?
A sigh.
I didn't hear it.
I heard it too.
Don't kiss me.
Right, I forgot.
This is the last time.
"This is the last time."
Same old story.
Don't make any noise.
Scared the old man will hear?
I've never been scared.
I'm ashamed.
Yeah.
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.
He's a gentleman.
What a pity that isn't enough.
You need a hard cock as well.
And your husband and the doctor...
Tough luck.
The old man looks at you with love.
He did that even when your husband was alive.
I was 17.
By then, they took care of the poetry... and I of the flesh.
This leg...
I don't like to think about this leg.
It hurts.
Some days I can't bear it.
But I need it to stay on my feet.
I saw those lights again today
in the sky.
That's the war.
It'll never end.
The war's shit.
Well, I like it.
You like it, dickhead?
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.
My mother says... that the earth's so dry here and the air's so hot... that the dead get stuck halfway to heaven.
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs."
Not that again, you little shit!
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.
Since then, no one has dared takeJaime on.
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.
Shit, I'm telling the story.
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...
Santi got scared and ran away... and maybe some shepherds found him and he's alive.
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.
Yeah.
They sell the blood to rich people to cure their tuberculosis.
And where's the ghost?
It came with the bomb.
Maybe if you ask it...
Take that one.
Out of the way.
Put those in, but be careful!
Don't break them.
Miss.
Look, I found this.
I thought you'd like it.
Open the gate, Jaime.
It's lovely.
It may look like gold, but it isn't.
Well, for me, it is.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
What's that?
Kids' stuff.
Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?
- Gálvez?
- A pig.
Well, a boar.
Why not a giraffe?
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.
Very good.
Your tutor taught you that.
In those days, men had to act in groups.
No one could give up.
Imagine the death of a mammoth.
It must have been terrible.
A mammoth steak, great!
When you get to draw your comics...
I could help you write the stories.
I don't need anyone.
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?
Tomorrow, we'll continue with the second part of prehistory.
Leave your things in the dormitory.
Then it's recess.
Santi...
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.
Here you go.
There isn't much.
Hey, you! Bastards!
What's going on?
International Brigade.
Two Spaniards, six Canadians, one Chinaman.
What the fuck's a Chinaman doing in a Spanish war?
You, look at your damn feet!
Against the wall!
A friend of yours, Doc?
Bomb... if you're alive... tell me where Santi is.
Santi.
Talk to me.
I don't want anyone to die.
Many of you will die.
Please.
A grain of strength.
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.
I need to talk to you, but I don't want the boys to hear.
Things are very bad out there.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.
Go where?
To Marseille, with the Ricards.
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.
Fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!
I always thought there'd be an afterwards.
There is no afterwards!
Carmen, if anything happened to you...
Doctor.
The boys are waiting for your permission to have breakfast.
I'll need some papers.
But we'll go.
Boys, you may start.
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.
She's coming for me soon.
Last night I saw the "one who sighs."
Last night?
You're making it up.
It's Santi. I'm sure.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
What about me?
Fuck me, right?
That's good.
I want you to finish breakfast, but while you're doing so... listen very carefully because
I have to tell you something...
You may go, but the gold stays here.
The gold?
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.
What are you doing?
I hid you here so you wouldn't die outside with no one to mourn you.
Give me the key.
You know what?
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.
The lost one.
- A prince without a kingdom.
- Shut up!
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.
Will this weapon work?
You know that while you whisper sweet things to this old hag...
I'm the one who has to screw her?
And now... get out.
What did you see?
You know already.
I don't know anything.
Tell me.
Santi.
He's the "one who sighs."
He's dead, isn't he?
Come on, boys.
Conchita... would you bring me a few cans of gas for the journey?
Please, no!
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.
It'll be a long journey.
The older boys will have to look after the little ones.
If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.
What are you doing?
Are you all right, ma'am?
It's my bad leg.
It's heavier than ever.
Did you think someone would just give us a farm?
What are you doing with that?
You're crazy.
They're all inside.
You going to shoot me?
Please...
- What was that?
- The children!
Get them out!
It's going to blow up!
Get out! Outside!
Carmen?
Alma, leave it be, come on!
Get out! All of you!
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.
Don't move, don't look.
Is it bad?
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!
They won't have heard the explosion in town.
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.
If I walk all night,
I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.
I've...
I've got something to tell you.
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.
I couldn't...
I can't hear you.
So, please...
This time... let me do the talking.
- I've learned a new poem.
- Yes.
A poem.
"Stay by my side as my light grows dim... as my blood slows down... and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain... as my heart grows weak... and the wheels of my being turn slowly.
Stay by my side... as my fragile body is racked by pain... which verges on truth... and manic time... continues scattering dust... and furious life bursts out in flames.
Stay by my side... as I fade... so you can point to the end of my struggle... and the twilight... of eternal days... at the low, dark edge of life."
Miss.
A grain of strength.
Carlos, look.
Dr. Casares.
That son of a bitch.
I should have killed him when I had the chance.
But he'll be back.
And I'll be here... waiting for him.
Carlitos... bring me my records, my music.
I need them.
All right?
Are you hungry?
"Eat beans, good for the heart.
The more you eat, the more you fart."
My stomach's all upset.
But the little ones might be hungry.
Could you kill someone?
I could.
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.
But I didn't kill him.
- I thought...
- I was with him.
I saw everything.
It started in the pit.
I dared him to come down with me at night to gather slugs.
Run, Jaime.
Jacinto's here.
- What did you see?
- Nothing.
- Did you see the safe?
- No.
Did you see the safe?
Why the fuck are you in here?
Who was with you?
Get up.
Get up.
I was a coward.
I was always afraid ofJacinto.
Very afraid.
But not anymore.
The next time I see him...
I know I'm going to kill him.
Look who's here.
Let's see how he handles her.
Say you're sorry and get in the car.
I'm not scared of you.
You're making me look like a fool.
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at us.
I'm not afraid of you.
Say you're sorry.
You're an animal.
Doctor, I did what you told me.
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.
Conchita.
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming, Doctor!
Help me on my feet.
Jaime, put on the record.
Turn the horn towards the window.
Didn't you say he was dead?
Bastard!
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.
They're leaving!
All my life
I've always stopped short... left things unfinished.
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.
I will never leave this place.
We'll wait for you upstairs.
I'm not going to run away.
I want to talk to you.
Nothing.
They must have driven on.
Tell me, what do you want?
Jacinto.
Bring him to me.
I understand.
I'm going to help you.
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!
I had to break the old man's fingers.
Even dead, he's stubborn.
Hurry up! Come on!
There's something here!
Marcelo! Out of the way!
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.
This is yours, isn't it?
We have to get out of here.
One of us has to climb through the window.
And then open the door.
And what then?
What's wrong?
You scared?
Yes, I am, asshole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.
You're not bleeding.
You're not even hurt.
Santi is dead.
Jacinto killed him.
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.
Do you want to sit and wait?
You think he'll let us go?
That it'll all work out if we behave?
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.
Yes, but there's more of us.
Wait!
Wait.
Check if they're still working.
- Go on.
- All right.
Gálvez, did you hurt yourself?
A bit.
Fuck! Look again!
There's nothing here but souvenirs, photographs! Just crap!
One of us has to go out and get Gálvez.
- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.
No, not you. I'll go.
I'm skinnier.
Who opened it?
Dr. Casares opened the door.
He said I'd be all right, and that we should be brave.
There's no fucking gold here!
You hear me?
You and your fancy ideas!
Fuck!
Gold, gold... My ass!
My father.
He was from Calanda.
He was an accountant.
Quite elegant. Look.
My mother was from Toledo.
And that's me.
It's blurred 'cause I moved.
But that's me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal could put us up?
We don't have much time.
"How lonely, the prince without a kingdom... the man without warmth.
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga."
I saw that gold.
It's here.
We just have to look for it.
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?
We're at war.
A drop in the ocean.
Look, Jacinto.
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.
I'll need a hand.
Come on, Pig.
You're crazy, asshole!
Fuck you!
No, fuck you!
It's all for me.
Son of a bitch!
What a joke!
Gálvez, you go over there.
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!
Santi...
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
A moment of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect
trapped in amber.
A ghost.
That's what I am.
TO MY PARENTS
Billy! You get number three up now!
Don't come in to eat before you do.
Check the other two. Make sure they're wired up good.
I don't want them blowin' over again, the first big wind.
Lot of good they're doin'.
Billy, you been messing with the post puncher?
No!
I told you what would happen if you screw around with this thing.
I said I didn't!
Don't want 'em blowin' down again.
Big wind, my ass.
You're the only big wind out here.
Jacky!
You been messing with the damn post puncher again?
No!
Billy, you little asshole! Why don't you rat yourself out for a change?
What did I do?
You little butt sniff.
I ought to come out there and kick your ass!
You Wish!
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him in the ass for me, Macky boy.
God! Would you shut up?
Jacky!
Jacky!
Jacky!
Jacky!
Billy!
Where are you?
Billy!
Daddy!
Billy!
Let go! Help me, Dad!
Billy!
Help! Help, help, Dad, help!
Billy!
Help! Help me! Dad!
Billy!
Dad! Let go!
Billy!
Daddy!
Billy!
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams! Go Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Tough as nails, hard as rocks, we are Bannon's fighting cocks!
Fighting Bantams, tough as nails!
Bow down now or kiss our tails!
Out for blood, we're lean and mean!
Bannon County's death machine!
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Bannon Bantams power and might!
Bannon Bantams, fight, fight, fight!
Incoming!
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!
You don't mess with a mighty bird!
Down the court, we'll clean your clock.
Better not mess with the fighting cock!
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!
Bannon Bantams.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Who was that? Don't even ask!
These big Bantams kick your ass!
Strike like lightning from the sky!
Screaming out our battle cry!
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Go Bantams!
Hard as rocks, we are
Bannon's fighting cocks!
How long can they keep this up?
Forever. They have a fight song with the word "cock" in it.
Why aren't you sitting with your honey?
Someone should tell him he just won the state championship.
I have a feeling he didn't get to play enough.
Well, shouldn't you be sitting with him?
After a game, he says he needs to be with the guys.
You kill his post-game buzz?
Basically.
If they lose, it's a totally different thing.
Can't pry him off me.
Shit!
Okay, everybody stay down.
Sit tight.
Son of a bitch.
What in the hell would you call that?
Ouch!
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's sharp as a son of a bitch!
What in the hell are we looking at?
It's sharp enough to flatten a tire, whatever it is.
You know how thick that rubber is?
It had to be shot into it like a bullet.
Jesus Christ! The damn thing has got teeth in it.
They can't just whip the jack out and pump this mother up?
Driver can't change a flat on a bus.
They need a mechanic.
- So?
- So?
Do you see any mechanics around here?
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre, they're probably saying you gotta change the flat.
Where she'll give us the latest update on...
Izzy.
A continuing story we call,
"The Horror in Poho County."
- Sheila?
- Hey, Poho update.
Well, Peter, the fire which gutted an old church
south of Pertwilla four days ago,
continues to offer up a gruesome bounty.
County sheriffs excavating the charred ruins say
the body count is now up well past 300.
County coroners say the bodies were found stitched to each other,
covering the basement's walls and ceiling.
One on-the-scene witness called it a human tapestry of torture and sadism
and a sight he will never forget.
Sheila, the details keep getting stranger and stranger
every day this week, it seems.
Any new information?
Some of the corpses they had found had false teeth made out of wood.
That means some of the bodies they're finding down there are over 200 years old.
But, Peter, it's the condition of the cadavers
that's the strangest fact of all.
The County coroner's office reported yesterday
that they have yet to find any one complete body.
Believe that, man?
No, they're making it up.
Each one missing either an external limb or an internal organ.
What connection this has...
This is 226 on East Nine.
We are down and disabled.
Home base, do you read me?
You get a good look at the points on this thing?
It's either ivory or some kind of bone.
Throw that damn thing away before you need a tetanus shot.
Pop! Pop, he dropped something.
Pop?
It was out in the corn, Papa.
Here, look at it.
We're out on East Nine. We are down and disabled. Come back.
Say again, this is 226.
Anyone read me?
We are down and disabled out on East Nine. Come back.
We gotta be in some kind of sun spot or something.
There's no signal getting out.
It's gonna be dark in about an hour.
Well, we still got five tires on the ground, which means we can probably limp home if we keep to goin' slow.
Say again. This is 226.
Anyone read me?
All of you at the same time?
Lady cheerleaders?
That's not smoke
I smell, is it?
Minxie.
There's not a girl in the world these days stupid enough to kill themselves by sucking on cancer sticks.
Am I right?
Back on the bus, ladies.
You saw me, right?
Run that fast break?
You see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
Anybody gonna read about it?
Why you give old Dante back there so much ink?
I'm serious.
People are starting to think that you're sweet on him.
Really? I heard that was you.
Hey, it's okay if you are, man.
I mean, live and let love, right?
Why don't you piss on somebody else's shoes, Jake?
Hey, shouldn't you be folding towels somewhere or sniffing jock straps?
You think you can manage the team, Super Genius?
Was I even talking to you,
Jock Strap Boy?
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!
So this is all because what, I don't write enough about you?
You know what the story is on your scars there, right?
No, tell me.
You got into a fight when you snuck into a bar.
So?
A gay bar, bro.
You do know what they call you, don't you, Izzy?
That's my name.
Or isn't he?
Hey, let's not make this a social event out there, everybody.
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving.
Hey, does that come in a man's size?
That means you, too,
Kimball. Let's go!
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!
Tippi Hedren, man!
Kimball!
Stop clowning around and get your ass back on the bus!
Off the top, gentlemen.
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.
You know, you could talk about it.
It might help a little bit.
What did I play today,
12 minutes?
Well, it was a great 12 minutes.
Hanna's got it in for me.
Him and his little token white boy, Barnes.
I don't know, maybe I got the wrong skin color to get equal play on this team.
I know you don't mean that.
Maybe they just wanted to make sure everyone got a chance to play in the championship.
Everyone's not the reason why we made it to the championship.
Half the losers on this bus had nothing to do with us making it to state. I did.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Jesus!
Jesus Christ!
Don't tell me.
- We blew the other one.
- How?
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.
Shit! We've got to break out the flares and get these kids off the bus.
Hey, hey, hey!
You wanna sit in here and hope somebody doesn't come along plowin' into us doing 90,
All right. Duane, you clear the bus.
I'll set the flares.
What is that, a flare gun?
Plan on being lost at sea in this thing?
You makin' fun of my lock box?
'Cause everything in this thing has saved my sweet ass at least once.
I don't believe it.
All right. Bring your coats and stay in a group.
This is Betty Borman out on 226.
We're broke down on East Nine, middle of Kissel County. Anyone read me?
Want me to help you push it off the road before I go?
I don't think we can move it.
It's on a bare rim in the back.
If you'd let the highway patrol know, we'd appreciate it.
Sure.
Come on, guys. Come on.
Let's go. Off the road.
Come on, guys. Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.
This side of the fence.
This side of the fence.
Scott, come on.
Everyone stays back and off the road. Now!
Stuck in the side of the tire again.
Oh, God.
Don't tell me that's a belly button in the middle of that thing.
Minxie, stay off the road.
That's everybody. Off the road.
Get everyone back on the bus.
You just said they shouldn't be...
I know what I just said.
But there's something goin' on out here and I don't like it.
I think if we just stay...
Coach?
What the...
What?
Where the hell's the coach?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Get everyone back inside and close the doors.
Okay, champions, getting back on the Betty Boop.
Bucky, get on the two-way, see if you can raise anyone.
I'm talking to you, Scotty!
What the hell happened to the coach?
Get everyone back on board and close those doors.
Do it, Scotty.
All right. You heard him. Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Hurry up! On the bus.
Now! Now! Now!
I repeat. Bus number 226, broke down on East Nine.
Charlie!
We have an emergency situation out here.
Does anybody read me?
This is bus number 226. We are broke down on East Nine.
Jake.
What happened?
What did you see?
What did you see?
Come on! Did you see something or not?
She flew away.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
What I just said. People don't fly the fuck away!
Sit down, Scott. What the hell's goin' on out there?
I said sit the fuck down and shut up, God damn it! Now!
You, too, Jake. Everybody.
Go sit down, Scott.
You got a problem with me?
No. You got one with me?
- Do I what?
- You heard me.
We don't have time for bullshit, Scotty.
Go sit down!
Scotty!
What the fuck?
Get the fucking doors! Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!
What was it?
Scotty, what the fuck was it?
Scotty, come on!
Scotty, we just... I don't know what it was, all right?
It had wings.
Big fuckin' wings!
Central, this is unit 17.
We did a drive-by of the general area.
Also found no evidence of forced entry. Over.
0-3-2, we are 10-7 Opper's
Diner for a little coffee and pie.
Do you copy that, Central?
This is Central.
Copy that, 0-3-2.
All units, anybody else getting some weird stuff out Kissel County way?
I just got two calls, 10 miles apart, both reporting abductions.
All units, be informed, this should be strictly 10-36 information.
Someone burning a marijuana field out there tonight?
'Cause these two stories are way, way out, baby.
Roger that, 0-3-6.
Jacky! Kissel County!
If you ask me, this is Poho related.
Repeat, Poho related.
And you all know what I'm talkin' about.
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.
We are stuck in a broken-down school bus out on East Nine.
And we are in serious trouble.
Do you read me?
Come on, is anybody even out there?
This is Andy Buck.
We are stuck in a broken-down school bus out on East Nine.
Javelins?
We've got spears on this bus?
Sticks.
You wanna wait around so you can poke at that thing with sticks?
That thing shows up here again and I'd rather have a sharp stick in my hand than nothin' at all.
Hey, guys, Betty's flare gun.
A bunch of flares for it, too.
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.
Scotty, you're not talking about getting off this bus?
You see that?
That means that there's a farm down at the end of this road somewhere and that's as far as anybody would have to get to.
With that thing out there?
Scotty!
With that thing out there?
Scotty! That thing hasn't been back here in almost an hour.
That doesn't mean that it's not still up there somewhere.
And that doesn't mean that it is.
Hey, this isn't about who can run the fastest, okay?
Or being a pussy.
What is your problem?
You tell me, Izzy or isn't he?
Hey, check yourselves!
Both of you!
Do I make you nervous?
Thinking you're gonna come on to me and every other swinging dick on this bus makes me nervous.
Yeah, it makes you fucking stupid, too.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Scotty, come on.
You get that hand off of me or we're gonna have one more missing person out here.
There's nothing about any of us on this bus that's more important than sticking together.
It's the only way we're gonna get through this.
You wanna play cock of the walk now?
Now's not the time for this shit, Scotty.
Big K, sit. I'm serious.
Wanna play cock of the walk, bro?
Why do I think you wanna call me something else?
Wanna call me something else,
Scotty?
'Cause I don't think you get
I can see you thinking it, whether you say it or not.
Just stop it right now!
Both of you stop it.
You guys all worked together today to win a ball game.
Now that something really serious happens, you can't even be civil to each other?
You tell him, not me.
Whatever your trip is, we ain't got time for this shit.
We should all be looking for ways we can defend ourselves until help gets here.
We have got to move this piece of shit!
On what, the rims?
Can you drive this thing or not?
We wouldn't get two feet, man.
What do you want me to do?
What the hell does it want?
What the fuck?
Is it looking at me?
Whatever it is, it's a smell freak, man.
Get that light Off it.
Hey, don't shoot that thing in here, man.
He's right. It will fill this place up like a smoke bomb.
Did that just come off the door?
Bucky, get on those front doors and get ready to open them.
What, you think we're gonna run outside?
If it fucking comes inside.
Minxie?
Minxie?
Minxie? Minxie?
Minxie?
Minxie?
Takes it all. Eats everything.
He takes it all.
He knows no mercy.
Every twenty-third spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat.
Eat what?
Eat what?
Eat us.
Minx?
Are you okay?
Look at me.
I thought you were gone, girl, you passed out.
Look at me.
Are you okay?
Your eyes went all the way in the back of your head.
I think he's gone, man.
I'm willing to bet money on it.
You willing to bet stepping off this bus?
'Cause that's the real bet.
How long's it been?
It's gone.
It came, it did its thing.
It went away.
It went away, but what the hell was it doing?
What do you think it was doing?
He was picking people out.
What?
It can smell something in people.
In their fear.
Something that helps it pick people out.
Pick people out for what?
I don't understand how you would know that, sweetie.
A dead boy told me.
I think he was trying to warn me.
He was trying to warn all of us.
This thing has been around for thousands of years and that nothing has been able to kill it.
This is a dream you had?
Well, the boy was dead. So, yes, I'm assuming that it was a dream, Scotty.
You were waving pom-poms at people this morning.
Now all of a sudden, you're a psychic hotline?
I don't know!
You wanna explain it to me? Because I can't.
That boy was trying to warn us that by morning it has to go back into the earth...
Oh, come on.
Into the ground for 23 more years.
And then what? Lives happily ever after?
Why don't you clean out your bong, all right?
Scotty, just listen to her.
It is coming back.
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.
What, are you gonna believe it?
And it doesn't matter if we're hiding on this bus or if we're hiding under our beds.
It'll find us.
The ones that it picked out.
Minx. Take it easy, okay?
The boy told me that it can smell in our fear, who it wants.
And what from them it wants to eat.
Hello, is anyone out there?
Hello. We have a serious problem out here.
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?
Is anybody out there, please?
We have a... This is Andy Buck, we have a serious situation...
Does anybody hear me?
Dad!
Hello? Look, can you hear me?
226, are you still there?
I'm so fucking still here.
Okay, okay. Just say again what you just told me.
We're not playing games here, right?
Just say it, man!
We're trapped in a broken-down school bus out on East Nine.
And something is going to kill us if we don't get help out here right away.
Where on Nine East?
In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?
What's trying to kill you?
What are you talking about?
Just tell me, are you the fucking cops?
Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the Nine.
But it's a big highway and so is Kissel County.
Are there any landmarks near you?
Are you close to anything?
Yeah, I'm close to peeing my fucking pants, man.
Can you just please tell me that you're on the way?
I can't really judge the strength of your signal but it doesn't sound close.
What does that mean, man?
It means it's gonna take me a while to get to you.
Look, we kind of have a time-critical situation here.
Roger that.
And please tell me that you're coming with back-up
'cause if you're not the cops, you gotta promise me that you'll call them and you'll tell them that we're stuck out here.
I'll call them.
I'll call them right now.
But what you've gotta do is hang on.
Can you do that?
Hang on!
Keep headed east.
Dad?
Just get us out there.
Do it.
Yes!
It's happening, man.
It's fucking happening!
We're being fucking rescued!
Help me! Get this thing off me!
Get this thing off me!
Look out!
Half its fucking head's gone.
Fuck.
You gotta be...
Fucking kidding me.
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.
It's dead, right?
Don't know. Don't care.
It won't open!
Stop Pushing on 'em!
They open in!
Something got screwed up!
Maybe it only opens from the outside.
It's an emergency exit, idiot.
Then you fucking open it, man!
Get that door open.
How can fucking exits not fucking work?
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
He jammed it.
We thought he was trying to come in.
But this freaking thing was making sure we couldn't get out.
Break the fucking doors!
Holy shit, man!
Hey, we can pry this thing open.
Give me a pole or a bar or something metal.
Something big. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll work.
Come on, D.
You need to get to this side.
Come on, everybody.
Come on!
This thing's like a fucking shower curtain, man.
It's crazy.
Oh, man, show like you got a pair.
Man, fuck you!
Everybody. Let's go.
Shower curtain?
This thing's like a fucking piece of toilet paper.
What's it doing, Minx?
What's it doing, Minx?
What's it doing up there?
It just tore its head off.
It's time to go.
What are you talking about, man?
Help is coming.
The Nine is big.
Remember?
What if he's an hour away?
What if he's going the wrong direction?
There are fucking cops on the way, man.
And you want the rest of us to sit underneath that big hole in the roof and hope that thing doesn't come crashing in here?
What do you mean,
"The rest of us"?
I mean...
It's time to stop being polite.
There are two classes of people on this bus now.
It had its pick of twenty of us back there and it picked two.
Dante was one.
Another one was you, Jake.
God damn it, Scott...
And we all saw him go for you, Bucky.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Two classes of people?
What, the will be eaten and the won't be eaten?
Fuck you, Scotty!
Minxie says this thing gets anybody it picks out, no matter what.
Don't put me in this.
She also said that after tonight it goes away and for a long time, Scott.
You tell us, Minxie.
Are we safe if we can hide out till morning?
Or is this thing gonna come after these guys with everything it's got
'cause it only has till morning?
We're screwed, right?
Yeah.
Scotty.
You're not talking about throwing people off this bus?
It's funny you should say that, D,
'cause the only other one we know it picked out for sure was you.
Hold on a second!
We all saw the way it sniffed you out back there.
You were the only one it gave tongue action, man, and we all saw it.
Scotty!
I don't understand what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to stay alive.
You're trying to split us up!
We have just dropped a notch on the fucking food chain, man.
This is about living or dying now.
Okay?
And if this bus is the only thing keeping that fucker away from us, how safe are we, you guys?
With everybody it's hungry for sitting inside it.
I wanna see hands.
I wanna see hands.
'Cause as shitty a deal as it is, I gotta say,
I'd like you,
Bucky and Jake off this bus, man.
Now, you listen to me, you piece of shit!
He looked at you, too, bro.
I saw him and you did, too.
He looked right at you and smiled.
And when you made Jake take the lights off it, he could've looked at you twice and licked its fucking lips, but we don't know that.
So you keep your little black list.
'Cause when he takes you out and I hope he does,
I'm gonna be the one getting as far away from your sorry ass as I can.
Time to go is right.
I'm gonna go find that farm.
Then I'm going with you.
You know I'm coming.
You wanna keep this bus?
Then you sit in it.
Right under that big hole.
See how long you last.
Look, I'm sorry, D.
You are so right about that.
Come on, guys.
Come on. Help is on the way.
Why are we splitting up?
He said he was coming. We're gonna leave and he's gonna pull up.
This bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.
You're really gonna let them go alone?
What, do you wanna go with them?
We don't know who it picked out.
Jesus Christ, it looked at everyone!
Scotty, let go of me.
Let go of you?
Let go of me.
Fuck!
Rho, tell me you're really walkin' away from me.
You used me, you used all of us.
All you care about is yourself.
Rho! You want to know, Scotty, what I found out today?
When people get really scared, it's just like when they get drunk.
The real person comes to the surface.
We could've protected D and Jake and all of us if we'd stuck together.
You know, like in a team?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Jonny, you little cocksucker,
I will fucking fry you, man!
You open these goddamn doors!
You open it right now!
Jonny! Open the fucking doors, man!
Open the doors!
This is my bus, too, man!
Run!
Oh, God!
Run! He's right behind you, D.
Get back! Get off! Break off!
- Shit!
- Hold on. Hold on.
Hold still!
Stop moving! Stop!
Come on, Scotty!
You're hurting him.
You're hurting him.
- Stop! Pull it out!
- Hold on! Hold on!
Stop it! Keep back.
Stop moving!
- It's in there like it's welded!
- Stop! Stop.
Pull that out!
You're hurting him.
You're hurting him.
Stop it! Scotty, stop it!
- Shut up! Okay, hold him. Hold him.
- Scotty, stop it! Scotty!
Scotty, hold still! Hold him!
- Stop it! Scotty!
- Hold still!
Oh, God! God!
Please, hurry!
Oh, God, please help!
D, I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry!
Oh, please take it out!
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!
What is it, boy? What is it?
Papa!
Go! Go!
Where did you come from?
From that bus?
How far up ahead?
Come on. Answer me.
It doesn't matter.
There's no one on the bus and you can't kill it.
Jacky, get the dog inside.
Look, you can't stop it!
You get in the cabin with Jack Jr.
You stay down till this is over.
This will never be over.
It doesn't matter what you do.
It'll be back,
23 years from now,
23 years from then.
Get us to that bus.
Jonny?
Jonny?
What was that?
Jonny.
Bucky! What're you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You let her in, Jonny?
Have you seen anybody else?
What are you doing?
That thing is after you, Bucky.
Hey, there's no farm out there, man. I must...
I must've run 10 miles all over this fucking valley.
Bucky, come on.
Just please go away.
No, please. Don't make me go back out there again, man.
It's fucking freaky out there, man, please.
Get around the bus.
Jacky! Get us around this bus now.
Now!
Get around the bus!
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there, now!
Jacky?
You all right?
Jacky, answer me!
Jacky, answer me! Are you okay?
I think so.
Jacky, get us away from the bus!
Come on, go!
Get us away from the bus!
Get gem', Jacky, get gem'.
Get us away.
Move it!
Dad!
Dad?
Yeah?
Dad!
All you kids, get down.
Jacky! Jacky!
You try to get us away from the bus! Now!
Come on!
Dad!
Dad, get out of there!
The spool's jammed in the cradle!
Dad, just get out!
The cradle's welded to the truck's frame.
Get out, Dad. No, he'll rip my gun right out of the truck!
Dad, just get the fuck out of there!
Dad! Dad!
Are you okay?
Dad!
Dad?
Dad!
You're not gonna believe this. But
I think I found a way out of here.
What?
Minxie said it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter what Minxie said.
Right?
The others might've gotten away.
We don't know that.
Kimball, too.
Hey, nobody gets to decide we die.
No dream, nobody. Nobody gets to decide that.
That is bullshit!
I hope so.
Come on, I wanna go show you a big ugly bug.
That's the truck that passed us this morning.
Remember, with the big bug on top of it?
You think we can just drive away in it?
No, but I think I know how to hot-wire a truck.
That's how I got in my bar fight.
I was tryin' to steal somebody's truck.
A gay bar?
Jesus Christ!
Wherever he was goin',
I don't think he made it.
Oh, my God, the keys are in it!
Come on, man, the keys are in it.
It's not birds.
Fuck! Shit!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on.
Go, man! Go!
I'm a sitting duck back here, Izzy, step on it!
I've got it floored!
Go! Come on, go faster!
Make it go faster!
I can't!
Go! Go! Go, man!
Go! Go! Izzy, go!
Go! Izzy, move this piece of shit!
Come on! Come on! Move it!
Izzy! Go! Go!
Izzy, do something!
Izzy!
Get down!
Izzy!
Come on! Come on! Izzy!
Do something, fucking do something!
- Get out!
- What?
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Get out.
Are you fuckin' crazy?
Izzy! Izzy! Come on! Izzy!
Stay down!
Stay down!
It isn't dead.
Its time ran out.
It looks dead to me.
You Taggart?
That's right.
Can we see it?
Can you read?
Is this something real? I heard it was a bunch of bullshit.
Still five bucks.
Where'd it come from?
My dad killed it.
Yeah, but where'd it come from?
It's five bucks from you, too.
How'd he kill it?
Ask him.
Come on, man. We ought to go get our money back.
BOY 12 What the hell is it?
What do you think it is?
We don't touch it.
What's the story on this thing?
Whatever you've heard. Probably.
You expect us to think that, that thing's real?
Don't really care.
How'd you kill it?
Stabbed it right through the heart with a big homemade harpoon.
When?
About 23 years ago.
You waitin' for somethin'?
About three more days, give or take a day or two.
You've heard of the tunnel.
The one we all go through sooner or later.
At the end, there's a door.
And waiting for you on the other side of that door... is either heaven... or hell.
This is that door.
Why is this patient in lockdown?
They didn't tell you about Laurie Strode?
No.
You must have heard of her.
Sister of Michael Myers?
Michael Myers, the serial killer?
Well, you'll hear all the gossip soon enough.
For now, let's just get...
No, no, no, wait.
Tell me about her.
She decapitated a man.
Aah!
Oh, my God. Why?
Halloween.
Three years ago.
Twenty years after the first murders... her brother finally found her.
Tracked her down to the school where she was working.
There were several murders.
Lots of confusion.
Guys, over here!
Oh, my God.
She killed the wrong person.
Unh!
Father of three.
Why didn't the paramedic say something?
His larynx had been crushed.
Don't let on you know.
Hello, Miss Strode.
Did you enjoy your dinner?
She hasn't said a word in years.
Extreme disassociative disorder.
The doctors think she's a suicide threat.
They found her up on the roof more than once.
Must be the guilt.
Now all she does is stare out that window.
God knows what she sees out there.
Hello?
Anyone out there?
Boooo!
- Holy shit!
- Ha ha ha!
Harold, are you trying to give me a heart attack?
No.
How the hell did you get out again?
And who are you supposed to be today?
Oh. John Wayne Gacy.
Born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 17, 1942.
Come on, big guy.
Killed 33 people.
Buried them under his house.
I know, Harold.
- He was executed on May 7...
- I know, Harold.
Willie, I'm not trying to criticize your work... but if you put Harold in his room... how come I see him in the basement?
L... But just two seconds ago, he was...
Come on. Let's go get him.
How many times do I have to tell you?
You gotta be sure what you're doing.
Willie?
What are you doing?
I skipped dinner.
- Hurry up.
- OK.
Harold?
Harold, what are you doing down here?
What's gotten into you?
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Unh!
Aah!
Hmm. Ted Bundy.
Born November 24, 19...
Hello, Michael.
I knew you'd come for me sooner or later.
What took you so long?
You failed, Michael.
You want to know why?
Because I'm not afraid of you.
But what about you?
Are you afraid of me?
Are you afraid to die, Michael?
I just have to be sure.
Unh! Unh!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
I'll see you in hell.
Michael Myers.
Born October 19, 1957.
Killed his older sister,
October 31, 1963.
Killed 3 high school students,
October 31, 1978.
Also killed three nurses and a paramedic, same night.
Was believed to be dead, then killed four students...
Was believed to be dead, then killed four students...
Hillcrest Academy, 1998.
Has been missing, unheard of, last three years.
Now he's back.
Carl Jung tells us... that the human psyche contains... a figment of ourselves... that even the collective unconscious denies.
Good morning, Paul.
It's nice to see you in class.
Am I keeping you up?
What do I mean by all this, people?
I mean that inside all of us... there lurks a dark, malevolent figure.
A kind of boogeyman, if you will... that Jung called what?
Stick with me, people.
Take that Kierkegaardian leap of faith.
Jung said we must face down our fears... and face up to the figure he called... what?
- The shadow.
- The shadow.
Yes, Sara, very good.
Thank you.
I'm glad somebody was awake.
Wow, what a class.
Hey, Sara!
Sara, wait up!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Guess what?
Uh-uh. What did you sign us up for this time?
Eee, ha ha!
We gotta find Rudy. Come on.
Hey, Rudy.
Don't distract me.
I can't help myself.
I am distracting.
Have you checked your email?
No.
Why?
Did you send me something?
We're in!
They picked all three of us!
- What? Are you serious?
- Uh-huh!
Oh, God! Yes!
All right. That is all good.
This isn't one of your little jokes, is it?
No, but Sara doesn't want to go.
I might go.
I just haven't decided yet.
No, no, no.
That is unacceptable.
It is unacceptable.
We're gonna be bigger than "The Osbournes."
We're gonna be large.
Every time I let you two talk me into something...
I live to regret it.
Listen, without me, you would die of boredom.
Us! Without us, you would die of boredom.
Whatever.
Are you sure they're not just putting us in some house... with hidden cameras in the shower?
No.
It's like we're investigative reporters... searching a crime scene.
And look at the scholarship.
Yeah.
Besides that, thousands of people... are going to see my face... our face.
Don't do it.
That's the house where it all started.
He walked its hallways, hid in its closets... dreamed in its bedrooms... helped his mother in the kitchen... watched TV in the living room with his dad... played in his sister's bedroom.
Then one day, he picked up a knife... and he never put it down again.
That guy's fucking weird.
Don't pay attention to him.
He's trying to scare us.
I just need to send a quick email.
"Deckard...
"you'll never believe what I got myself into."
Deckard? Who's Deckard?
Oh, it's my screen name.
Sara needed some tech support setting up her offline reader... so I, uh...
You told her you're a graduate student?
- Graduate of what, junior high?
- Shut up, all right?
We talk every day.
It's kind of like we're dating.
She's never even seen you... and Yahoo chat rooms do not count.
Yes, they do count.
Did you know in the old days... knights used to spend their entire lives... courting ladies that they would never even touch?
They would just send each other sonnets and stuff.
That's before internet porn, man.
Whatever.
Now what are you doing?
Just give me a second, all right?
I hope Sara shows up.
And wearing something acceptable.
She can't still be mad at us for the last time.
Here she is. Hey!
OK, everybody listen up!
Sara, are you gonna wear this?
I thought I told you we were gonna be on camera.
I'd like to start this off by saying the search is over.
You six have been selected... to explore
America's worst nightmare... tomorrow night, Halloween... live, in front of the whole entire internet universe.
You six will enter the birthplace of evil... in its purest form... the childhood home of our most brutal mass murderer...
Michael Myers.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, what do you hope to find in the house tomorrow night?
My way into network broadcasting.
Pfft!
I just want to say that Michael Myers... is not just a man behind a mask... he's a legend.
I'm interested in how Michael Myers... embodies the politics of violence... embedded in pop mythology.
Never underestimate the effect of a poor diet.
Too much protein, not enough zinc, next thing you know... you're cutting up bodies in your bathtub.
Look at Hitler.
He was a vegetarian.
The brother was seriously malnourished.
You don't have to go far to find Michael Myers.
He is the great white shark of our unconscious.
He is the dark-eyed child of our spirits.
He's every murderous impulse we've ever had.
He's the little voice that whispers to us... to strangle the old lady... taking too long at the checkout counter.
Get to know him, baby.
He's you.
Tell us, Sara, why do ordinary people turn to murder?
Well, I, um...
I think it has something to do with upbringing.
Aah!
Damn! That girl can sing.
That's what
I'm looking for. Ooh.
Ha! Hunh!
Hyah!
Get his ass! Get his ass!
Get his ass!
Who's better than Wat Chun Lee?
Whoopin' everybody ass while he's smokin' a cigarette.
Oh, shit. Who's knockin' on my door this late?
Whoever this is is distracting me... from seeing Wat Chun Lee whoop some ass.
Sara? Ooh.
Sara, what are you doing here?
It's late.
I'm dropping out.
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm so freaked out
I can't even sleep.
Slow down, slow down.
What's the problem?
Can't you see
I'm not like the others?
I know you're not like the others.
You know you're not like the others.
The others ain't nothin' but a bunch... of smart-ass, wise-crackin', posin' wannabes.
You are the real deal.
Every existing element about you... is what the internet audience really wants.
I don't want to be famous.
What do you mean you don't want to be famous?
That's the American dream.
I think I'm just scared.
It's OK to be scared.
Being scared is good.
Fear is good.
Fear motivates.
Fear gives you the feeling of being alive.
Fear makes me want to throw up.
Trust me, please.
When it's all said and done, at the end of the day... you'd be surprised of how much you surprise yourself.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just...
It's OK. Do me a favor.
Sleep on it.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You can sweat it tonight, man.
Now take your tail on outta here and go to bed.
Ol' Freddie boy, damn, you good.
Shit you come up with off the top of your head, boy.
Why don't you just pat yourself on your back?
Oh, Wat Chun Lee! Oh!
Now, are you coming out soon... or are you planning on subletting?
Mmm! Sexy girl! Ha ha!
Don't you think it's a bit too revealing?
I think it's perfectly revealing.
Aah!
What?
Are you OK?
Did you see the boogeyman or something?
The boogeyman?
How very Jungian.
Dr. Mixter's class?
I'm taking that course, too.
I hope they have this in black.
- Thrift stores.
- Oh, how marvelous, darling.
Ahh, there she is.
Oh, my God, you've been pussy-whipped.
What's worse, you've been cyber-whipped.
By the way, where's your costume?
I can't go out tonight.
I promised Sara
I would watch her first episode.
She's really nervous about it.
No, Mickey Stern's party is tonight, and you know that.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, man.
I guess I forgot.
Forgot?
Do you have any idea... what it means for two freshmen to get invited?
It's never happened before!
Your sister invited us... so you wouldn't tell your mother about her tattoo.
That's besides the point,
Myles Barton.
You can sit here in your little dream fantasy world... or you can come with me to this party... and learn to walk like a man.
What's it gonna be?
All right, let's go.
Ahh, chat room romance?
He's just a friend.
He's probably fifty and bald, with a bad toupee.
- Jen.
- Probably collects human skin.
Give me a break, Jen.
OK, everybody listen up.
I'd like to start off by saying... the home that you will be entering tonight... has been rigged up with several cameras... but for the most part... the audience will see only what you see.
See these cameras right here?
I kinda like these cameras.
They can pretty much be clipped on to anything.
A hat, shirt collar, your coat collar.
The viewers can pretty much control... what they want to watch... switch around from camera to camera... depending on what seems to be the most intriguing to them.
So if you guys want to be stars for the night...
I suggest you do something that is very interesting... so that it's worth the while of the viewers... to want to keep their cameras on you.
Cameras are so phallic.
Is that good or bad?
Depends who's watching.
Hey, Orson Welles, pick a placement and move on.
Look, low angles... scary.
High angles... scary.
Medium angles... boring.
I bet you learned that shooting... all those weddings and bar mitzvahs.
Hey, hey!
I went to Long Beach State.
Same as Spielberg.
Charley, we're on a schedule here.
Tell Max to rig a camera in the sister's room.
Max is back at the hotel helping Freddie.
OK.
Freddie!
Baby, calm down.
It's all good. Just relax.
I got it all under control.
There was this Firebird parked in front of the house.
Totally about to ruin the establishing shot... but I called a tow truck.
Yep, it's on its way.
All righty. Bye.
Look at you, Charley.
That's a nice angle, boy.
Look, there he is now.
All right, here we go.
Mr. Harris!
Can we ask you a few questions, Mr. Harris?
- Right over here.
- I got one word for you.
- What's that?
- Product placement.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Product placement,
I like the sound of that.
While we're going around the house... discovering the secrets of Michael Myers... we could be drinking Pepsi or sporting The Gap, right?
Nice sexy thinking.
I kind of like that.
How's everyone doing this evening?
We'll get it started like this, see?
In the next ten minutes... we are going to enter a mystery... wrapped up inside of a riddle inside of an enigma.
Now, remember this.
Everything you see... absolutely everything you see is real.
There's no actors... none of the components or contents in the house... have been messed with, mixed up, diluted... or tampered with in any shape, form, or fashion whatsoever.
Now, I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen... but what I do know is that no one will be allowed... to leave until the show is over.
Our state-of-the-art camera surveillance system... will pick up anyone who tries to sneak out.
Let the Dangertainment begin out this motherfucker.
Well, people, let's do it.
Rudy!
Way to go.
This is gonna be fun.
I read that after the murders... the family just sealed it up... and left without taking anything with them.
It's not exactly a house you put on the market.
Yeah, but I'll bet it has... one of those big nice old kitchens, you know?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna check it out.
What are we gonna do?
We don't have to do anything.
Technically, we just have to be in the house.
Aren't we supposed to be looking for answers?
The devil made him do it.
I'm done.
We owe it to the people watching... to at least take a look around.
Oh, that's cute.
You're already worried about your fan base?
You are this close to getting voted off the island.
Hey, check this out.
You want something tasty and delicious?
You ever tasted forty-year-old fennel?
Eww, don't.
It's got to be rotten.
- That's strange.
- What?
- It smells fresh.
- Yeah, it does.
You know, Donna, you got great legs.
What time do they open?
That'd be 1:00?
God damn.
Sara.
You think this is the one that he used to do his thing?
No. They'd keep that in an evidence locker somewhere.
Whew.
- Boo.
- Aah!
- What, are you scared?
- No.
What's in here?
What is that?
OK, so I admit... that this place is a little creepy, OK?
No, no, no.
You have no idea.
- Look at this.
- Wow, a chair.
My God.
Do you think they actually kept him in this?
What is that?
Looks like the medieval key to Sara's chastity belt.
- Rudy!
- OK, yeah.
Maybe we should poke around a bit... see what else we can find.
Ha! Aye-aye, captain.
Why are you touching me?
Don't.
Go poke.
Hey, what's going on?
Sexy.
Look at you!
Scott, what are we doing here?
Hey, come on, man, be cool, all right?
Relax. Have fun. Shit.
Hey, Myles, do you think anyone will know... we're supposed to be from "Pulp Fiction"?
- Huhh!
- Huhh!
Today, you're scared of the boogeyman.
Ha ha ha!
He's gonna get you.
He's coming behind you.
Boogeyman!
Ohh! Shit!
Careful, Jen.
Ahem. Hands off, bud.
Bet this is Judith's room.
You know, the older sister.
The one he killed when he was six years old.
Hey! Keep the camera on the money here.
I think it happened when she was right there.
Poor little Judith... helpless... brushing her hair... young... and naked.
Yeah, because that's gonna happen, right?
Come on, Jen.
One flash, and you could light up... a thousand computer screens.
Launch your whole career.
You think?
You crack me up.
It's a good wardrobe for you, Jen.
Wait! No! There was somebody else in the hall!
Come on.
Come on, lover boy.
- Whoa!
- Aah!
What are you doing, you big perv?
They're exploring the house of a mass murderer... live.
You want to watch?
- No way.
- Sure.
Oh, OK.
Impulse control disorder.
Huh?
That's my theory.
I think Michael Myers had fits of rage... that he could not control.
Kind of like a klepto or a nympho or a pyro.
So, instead of stealing silverware... he slashes the necks of teenage girls, huh?
Oh, come on... haven't you ever had an impulse that you could not control?
- Continuously.
- You mean continually.
"Continuous" means continuing uninterrupted... while "continual" means reoccurring periodically.
Donna, when are you gonna get out of your head... and start thinking with your body?
Please.
Does that line ever actually work... on the chicks in the music department?
Art history, too.
Sometimes even poli sci.
Well, it doesn't cut it with critical studies.
Bummer.
Besides, screwing a music major... would be tantamount to lesbianism.
I could get into that.
Sara, I'm telling you, it's in the food.
Remember that guy who was on trial... for murder in San Francisco?
All he ate was Twinkies.
Rudy, do you ever think about anything other than food?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Jen?
Jen?
What's going on?
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I turned my back for a second and she was gone.
Jen!
Jen?
Jen?
Jen.
Jen?
Jen?
Jen?
Turn it down!
- Gotcha!
- God, you bitch.
Slut!
That's not right, OK?
You're foul.
Uhh, so foul.
This is to us, for successfully... let me give you a little more... puttin' together something collectively... so ingenious as a team and a duo... that we should definitely be able to secure... a lot of food on the table for ourselves... as long as everything goes as nicely... as it's goin' right now.
I'm gonna get her back for that.
Watch me.
Oh, my God!
Cheers.
Oh, no! No!
Mm. Mm.
Wait, what just happened?
- We just lost Bill's camera.
- Oh, shit.
He must've dropped it.
Fucking idiot.
Find another view quickly, please.
Freddie, relax.
I think this is going really well.
- Really, baby?
- Yes.
We are doing our thing.
OK.
To Dangertainment.
Salute. Heh heh heh.
And this must be the bed where he was conceived.
Stop showing off, Jen.
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Rudy!
- Sara!
- Jen, help me!
Are you OK?
Rudy, help. Sara!
Ewww.
- God.
- What happened?
What is that thing?
Hey, is this that Michael Myers thing?
Yeah.
A'ight, cool.
Yeah, OK.
What is this?
Oh. Sorry.
Are you?
You're such a Lothario.
Um...
I don't know what that means exactly, but...
Just go with it.
Hold on.
I just thought of something.
Hold on?
You've got to be kidding me.
What, are you looking for "Playboys"?
This ain't right.
Well, it's obvious that the boy was subject... to emotional and physical abuse.
No, all of this.
It's not right.
It's too easy.
Why is all this stuff still here?
Answer that, Nancy Drew.
Where's Bill?
He's probably still mad at me.
He's gonna jump out of somewhere and scare me.
You watch.
You watch.
Jim? Uh.
You know, if I'm keeping you from something... just let me know.
Look.
- Voilà.
- Clever boy.
See, they're looking for clues.
Something that might explain why Michael Myers went bad.
- Oh.
- Jeez.
Hey, Scott. What's up?
God, nice costume.
Whoa.
Hey, you think they kept him down here?
Maybe. Look at this.
What? What is it?
It's some sort of weird harness.
This whole place looks like some sadistic playpen.
Ah ha ha.
And you know what that makes me think?
What?
There's definitely no cameras down here.
I could be a camera.
Say something smart.
Existence precedes essence.
God, you are sexy.
Whoa! Oh, shit!
That worked perfectly!
Whoa! That is what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! All his victims!
It's a mass grave!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
All of his victims. Oh!
Shit. Look at this.
I don't fucking believe this.
What?
Made in fucking Taiwan.
Oh, shit, man!
Charley, where the fuck you been?
We've been lookin' all over this motherfucker for you!
And why the hell are you dressed like me anyway?
I ain't payin' you to be Michael Myers.
I'm playin' Michael Myers!
If them kids come around... and see us dressed up in the same shit... you'll ruin the whole effect,
God damn it.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What you lookin' at me like that for?
Huh? You don't get it?
Your shit ain't workin' up there?
Take your ass in the back of the garage with Nora.
That's your job.
Go back there with Nora and help her ass out.
Go do your job.
I left the back door unlocked for your ass... to go out the back into the garage.
That's what I did.
You need to get the hell outta here.
Go on, scoot! Skedaddle!
Get the fuck out of Dodge!
God damn. What the hell's somebody gotta do... to get a little decent help up in this motherfucker?
God damn it. Come on.
Let's go find Freddie.
This is bullshit.
Hey, Jim?
You gotta see this.
Gross.
Hey, Freddie.
Is this all part of the setup?
"Laurie Strode, sister of Michael Myers...
"survives Halloween night massacre."
Heh. Nice prop.
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Is anybody else seeing this?
Jim?
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aah! Oh, my God!
No!
Help! Somebody!
Someone help! Oh, my God!
This isn't funny anymore!
Help me! Somebody help!
This is not funny!
Oh, my God!
Stay away from me! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
That was so fake.
No, no, wait.
Wait, you guys.
That really happened.
She was just killed.
Man, you're gullible.
Get outta here.
It's a good thing there's no cameras in here.
We're wearing cameras.
Whoosh.
Aaaah!
Michael's here!
I saw him!
He's in the house!
He's here!
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
What you talking about?
Don't do this, girl.
You're bringing me down on this beautiful evening.
There's nobody here.
You're just bugging out.
It's not funny, OK?
- Stop it, OK?
- He's down in that room.
There is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 people in the house.
There's no Michael Myers here.
There's nobody.
Listen,
I saw him right over there.
He's in here?
Ooh. Michael Myers.
Where's Michael Myers?
Michael Myers!
I don't see nothing.
- He was in here.
- You're bringing me down.
Rudy, I saw... Aaaah!
Rudy!
Uhh! Uhh!
- Fucker!
- Whoa, whoa!
Turn off the cameras!
- Get it back online.
- What's wrong?
Cut to a different camera angle.
It's me. Freddie.
Freddie.
What the fuck are you doing?
Damn, man, you hit me... like I murdered your fuckin' mother.
Relax, man.
I'm only tryin' to give America a good show.
So none of this shit is real, right?
Like the furniture... the photos, all the fucked up toys?
It's all fake.
We've been set up.
You knew you didn't have a show anyone would watch... so you set us all up at our fucking expense, huh?
What expense are you talkin' about?
You ain't contributed a dime to settin' up this shit.
Besides, don't nobody want to see any of y'all... runnin' around no empty house... possibly comin' up with nothing any-damn-way.
America don't like reality, first of all.
Second of all, they think the shit is boring.
They want a little razzle-dazzle... a little pizazz, a little thrill in their life.
And us being the ones that give it to 'em...
I don't see nothin' wrong with that.
I did not sign up for this.
Y'all need to do me a favor, all right?
Go along with this shit.
Don't blow it. Not now.
You really have no idea... of how nicely
I worked things out... so that we all can receive... somewhat of a robust back end when this shit is all over.
I don't know what you want to do about your share... but please don't fuck it up for me.
I want my money, a'ight?
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go... scare the shit out of some more of these motherfuckers... so, I'm gonna get it crackin'.
Y'all do what the fuck y'all gotta do.
See y'all. Ha ha ha ha!
- All right.
- We have it.
- Turn up the sound.
- Where'd everybody go?
Ohh.
There you are, Bill.
So what do you guys want to do?
I don't know.
I could use the money.
No. Fuck that.
I'm out.
Me too. I quit.
Boo!
She must be going for the first internet Emmy.
You can't scare us, Jen.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
You too, Freddie.
Aaaaaaah!
- Eww!
- How'd they do that?
- Digital effects.
- No, it isn't!
Hello. 911?
Oh, my God.
- It's locked!
- Fuck.
Go in there!
Go in there now!
Jim, run! Run!
Ah!
Oh! Aah!
Uhh.
Hey, Michael!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
You want a piece of me?
You should try a little less protein in your diet.
Control some of that aggression, huh?
Want some of this, huh?
I know what 911 is for!
This is an emergency.
It's not a hoax.
Motherfucker, come on.
Trying to fucking kill me?
Come on!
You like sushi, motherfucker?!
You gonna fucking kill me?
Oh, shit.
Somebody... somebody out there, please help us.
Somebody, please help us.
She really is a very talented actress.
Deckard.
Deckard, if you're there, please let me know.
Who's Deckard?
Myles is Deckard.
What do you mean?
Deckard, he's killing all of us.
He's killing us.
There he is!
Upper right!
- Zoom in!
- Go to the other camera.
Tell her he's coming up the stairs.
This isn't funny anymore!
Do something!
Aah!
- He heard her!
- Oh, my God.
He's at the door!
Get her out!
Oh, my God.
- No!
- It's too high!
No!
Aaah!
I can't see you!
Deckard, where is he?
Tell her to go!
- Now's her chance.
- Come on, go!
My God. Everybody's dead.
Where is he?
I don't know.
We got to get the fuck outta here now.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, shit.
Aaah!
So, you want to be on Dangertainment?
Let's see what you got.
Waa... hyah!
Hyah!
Aah!
Yo, Mike, come see me.
Michael, come and see me!
Look at me!
You wanna fuck with me, huh?
You motherfucker.
Haaa-yah!
Let's get outta here.
Come on.
You all right?
I saw his room.
He's been living underneath this fucking house... for who knows how long.
Probably the last 20 years.
Come on.
I swear on my soul...
I had no idea.
I swear.
Aw, shit.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, my God.
He cut the cable.
Where the fuck is he?
This is bad.
Deckard, where is he?
- No!
- Run! Oh!
Aah!
No.
Uhh.
Oh, no.
Aaaah!
Uhh!
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh.
You bastard!
This is for Jen!
This is for Rudy!
For all of them!
Oh, shit.
Aah!
Aah!
Trick or treat, motherfucker.
Aaaah!
No!
No!
Aah!
Uhh!
Aaah!
Ohh!
Burn, motherfucker! Burn!
Sara!
Come on, come on!
Uhh!
Hey, Mikey!
Happy fucking Halloween!
Sara? Sara Moyer?
- Sara?
- Can we get a statement?
Hey, we can go live now.
What happened with Michael Myers?
Thank you, Deckard.
You saved my life.
What's it feel like to be a hero, Sara?
How does it feel now that it's all over?
What makes you so sure it's over?
Excuse me.
- Watch the camera!
- No more cameras!
Dangertainment is off the air.
Why don't y'all show some respect?
Mr. Harris, would you like to make a statement?
What can you tell us about Michael Myers?
Michael Myers is not a sound bite... a spin-off, a tie-in, some celebrity scandal.
Michael Myers is a killer shark in baggy-ass overalls... that gets his kicks off of killing... everything and everyone that he comes across.
That's all.
We're done dancing for these cameras.
Let's get outta here, Sara.
But how are you feeling right now?
Heh.
How am I feelin' now?
You wanna know how
I'm feelin' right now?
Feel this!
My camera!
That's him, isn't it?
I want to see his face.
I want to warn you, ma'am, it's not a pretty sight.
All right.
Come on, back it off.
Let's go.
Wow.
You're lookin' a little crispy over there, Mikey.
Like some chicken-fried motherfucker.
Well, may he never, ever rest in peace.
Hey, how's it going?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Another one?
It's your lucky night.
You got a celebrity.
Ooh, let me get my autograph book.
I'm not kidding.
It's Michael Myers.
What?
Get me a copy of that autograph.
- Yeah, sure.
- Ha ha!
It's cracking me up.

Hey, you guys ever hear the story ofthe Machete Maniac?.
[ All ]
Ooh!
[ Chuckles ]
Let's hear it.
Yeah, I don't know.
It's probably too scary foryou guys.
- No. No, it's not.
- No, come on, Dave.
Please, tell us the story.
All right, what the hell.
This must've been, like,
1 5 years ago, you know?.
We had a kid working at the club named Phil Coletti.
And one night-- it was a night a lot like tonight-- this gorgeous woman comes into the club, asks him ifhe wants to go out to thejungle.
He's like, ""Yeah. Whynot?'"
So they split. And as they started getting out to the jungle... further and further away from the lights ofthe club... she starts asking him these questions, like... does he believe in the local legends ofthe island... voodoo, zombies.
He's not too worriedabout it.
Hejust rolls right over, starts putting the screws to her.
But something doesn't feel right to Coletti.
But he can't see shit. It's pitch black, so he just keeps bangin' away.
But then, boom!
A flash oflightning lights up the whole island, and in that one moment...
Coletti looks around and sees not only is he out in the middle ofthat old Mayan cemetery... not only are all the other guys from the resort standing around watching him... but he sees that he's having sex with a corpse.
A cold, white...
- dirty-from-the-grave dead body.
- [ Girl Groans ]
And they say...
Phil Coletti calmly walked to the groundskeeper's shack... founda machete... and chopped those staff members into a hundred pieces.
And they say he took that same machete... chopped his own dick off and ran screaming into the jungle.
Nobody ever saw him after that.
But from that point on...
Phil Coletti was forever known... as Machete Phil.
Areyou telling me there's some totally deranged, dickless dude running around out there?
All I 'm saying is I don't go into the jungle alone if I can help it.
'Cause you can hear him, and I've heard him... crying out...
""Where's my penis?.
Where's my penis?.
Where's my penis??'
- And that boywas me!
- [ Screaming, Laughing ]
You're an asshole,
Putman.
- Anybody get laid tonight?.
- Hey, Pete.
- I know I did.
- [ Laughter]
Say, anybody seen
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?.
They're probably off screwing around in the jungle somewhere.
Well, shit. I'm gonna needsomebody to run Luau Night tomorrow.
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll run Luau Night.
What, cut up a couple of pineapples, whatever.
- Yeah, great.
Sam, will you run Luau Night?.
- Sure. Can do.
We'llgetsome grass mini-skirts, maybe have a poi-eating contest... and, uh, everyone'll get laid.

One of my songs?.
Yeah, it's offyouralbum
""Sea Shanties and Wet Panties. '"
- Let's see those pinchers, people!
What does this song have to do with all this?.
The name of the song is ""Naughty Cal."
- Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
- [ All ] Naughty Cal!
# Naughty Cal, Bongo and Tokey #
# Got tired oflivin' on land #
# So the three amigos took an undersea trip #
- # Andneverwere seen again#
- [Bong Water Bubbling]
# Bongo, the stoned crab got high as a kite #
- # And fell and cracked his shell #
- Shit.
That's the line that was on the board yesterday.
I didn't know where it was from.
How doyou not know the words toyour own song?
I don't even remember making the album, okay?.
Shit, it was '78.
We were all out ofourgourds.
It was kind ofa crazy time in 1 978.
Oh, man, we had some fuckin' parties.
# Bongo the stoned crab got high as a kite #
# And fell and cracked his shell#
# Tokey was lost in a maze all night#
- ## [ Continues ]
- ""High as a kite"?.
""He fell and cracked his shell"?.
That's like Carlos up in the parasail.
Then ""lost in a maze," exactly like Cliff.
So this guyis killingpeople according to a fucking acid trip song?
- This is insane!
- [Putman ] Peter.
What's the song about?. I s there some sort of special significance?.
Fuck no. I mean, uh,
I don't know.
It's a sea shanty. Naughty Cal's this, uh, underwater cowboy... and Tokeyand Bongo are his buddies.
And they go on this adventure to find, uh, Atlantis or some shit.
- I-I-I--
- Let's listen to the next line andsee what happens.
# La-la-la-la
Lala-la-la-la, lalala-la-la #
Maybe if I play it backwards.
# La-la-la-la, lala-la-la, la-la-la-la #
- # Mango Bay #
- Wait, listen. Listen.
# But a big bad orca anda scary octopus #
# Were guarding the riverbed#
- ## [ Continues ]
- So, what the hell?.
The orca and the octopus?.
I mean, is it the next victims, or is it the killer?.
Our lives depend on us interpreting the dumbest fucking song I've ever heard.
Please, don't hold back.
Just saywhatyou really think.
I'm notsensitive.
You know, I won about five fucking gold records in my lifetime.
H-How many gold records doyou have?.
- Let's see how it ends.
- # I guess it seems #
# That everybody's lookin'#
# To find their own paradise #
# But it ain't on Earth
It's up there in heaven #
# Andsomeday we're all gonna die ##
- [ Laughing Wildly]
-J esus.
Pete!
Yu and Hank are dead.
- Why?. What did we do?.
- No, man.
Yu and Hank are fucking dead.
You threatening me?. 'Cause ifyou are, you little hairless lap dog--
!Ay, puta!
Just come and look!
[ All Gasp ]
[Putman Reading]
""Don't let this be Yu. '"
She was just trying to warn the guests.
- [ Sobbing ]
- Hank!
[Insects Buzzing]
Yu?.
[ Crowd Booing]
Why are we doing a goddamn fashion show?.
Because it's goddamn
Fashion Show Wednesday, that's why!
Lookwhat happened to Yu! Remember the warning: ""Doyourjobs or die"?.
So we're just gonna put little smiles on our faces... and march out there and do our goddamn jobs.
- You got that?. Lars, you're up.
Come on. Let's go.
- You got it, Pete.
[Cheering]
Lars Brunckhorst, everybody.
Lars is sporting the Pleasure Poncho.
Only 1 9.95 at the gift shop.
Thankyou, Lars.
[Sam ] I'm tellin'ya, I got a bad feeling about that new guy.
You are right. It all started when he got here, didn't it?.
- Sam, it isn't Lars or any of us.
- Look,Jenny.
- I know whyyou're defending him.
- Pajamas! Come on! Move!
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.
Oh, ifit isn't
Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Pip, pip! Tallyho!
I got it. In that song...
Naughty Cal sings about the scary octopus.
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.
- Hello?.
- Dave, just go playwith the curtains or something.
No, no, no. We can't dismiss that song. What about Carlos and Cliff?.
What about the fact that
Hankwas buried in the sand like the buried treasure in the song?.
All right, so maybe the octopus... is the way the next person dies?.
How doyou kill someone with an octopus?.
Octopus spelled backward is ""supotco."
Juan, isn't that Spanish for something?.
""Supotco"?. No.
The word for shoe is zapato.
- Hmm. Shoe.
- Am I the only one who thinks his head looks like an octopus?.
- Shh, shh, shh. Here he comes.
- What did I miss?.
- Apparently, somebody's gonna get killed by a shoe.
- Hmm.
Okay, you guys, instead of focusing on the song, why don't we go look for those boats?.
- Good idea.
-Jenny, why don't you and I go search together?.
- Um--
- Putman.
- Why don't you and I go and look for that boat?.
- Areyou daft?
I'm not going out in the jungle with you and your bloody shiatsu.
Ifyou're the killer, you'll snap my neck like a twig.
All right, stick to the shore.
There's no reason to go in thejungle.
The boats areprobably gonna be covered with sticks.
Or branches.
Thanks much, officer.
Aren't you taking any weapons?.
- I have all the weapons I need.
- [ Scoffs ]
Piss on that.
I'm taking a machete.
Thanks for doing this,
Lars.
You're very brave.
Just be careful, all right?.
Good luck, Putman.
Better believe I'll be keeping an eye on you, Mr. Miyagi.
[ Chopping]
I knowyou guys are probably a little intimidated by cooking for the whole resort... but I thinkyou're gonna get a big kick out ofit, okay?.
- [Insect Buzzing]
- I bet you watched Yu and Kelly.
And most of it's just common sense.
Like right now...
I'm making my famous
Coconut Pete's Paella.
Can anyone guess the secret ingredient?.
Come on.
Coconut Pete's Paella?.
The secret ingredient?.
- Coconut... Pete's--
- Eh--
- Coconut?.
- Yes, goddamn it! Yes!
Yes!
[ Yells ]
Jesus! You think Eddie Money has to put up with this shit?.
- [ Chopping]
- [ Yelling, Indistinct ]
Goddamn it!
Coconut Pete's Paella!
Jesus Christ.
Whatyou think?.
I think Pete's under a lot of pressure.
I don't think we can sayfor sure. God, I don't know.
- What areyou doing?.
- Uh,you know.
Just, uh, hanging around, uh, looking through the window.
Calamari?.
- Uh--
- It's an aphrodisiac,Juan.
[ Chuckles ]
- Oh. Oh!
- What's wrong?.
You're not afraid of a little octopus, areyou?.
[ Muffled ]
Thankyou.
When you're done here...
I wantyou to come inside and find me...
'cause I wanna wrap my little tentacles around you.
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
- [ Spits Food Out ]
- No way.
Think about it, the octopus.
Look, she's a weird little chick,
I'll give you that.
But, look, it still doesn't prove that she's the killer.
All right. There is only one way to find out.
## [Romantic Latin ]
- Don't be nervous.
- [ Chuckles ]
Eh, I just want our first time to be wonderful.
[Penelope Chuckles ]
So I would say that ifyou're the killer... just, you know, just maybe don't kill me.
Or at least make it, you know, painless.
With those moves ofyours, I bet you could put me down nice and easy.
-Just, zip, and I'm out, right?.
- Look.
The whole reason we're hiding in this closet is because we think she's the killer.
- Oh.
- [Penelope ] I'm gonna biteyou.
- [Juan ] Well, not too hard, I hope.
- I really like Juan.
I rememberwhen we first met, I was kinda like, ""Who the fuck is this guy?.
Some local guy comin' down here and--"
[ Grunting ]
- Mmm.
- [ Neck Bones Cracking ]
[ Knuckles Cracking ]
- I haven't been entirely honest with you.
- You mean... you don't really go to the Oral Roberts?.
Aah!
[ Sighs ]
I mean...
I just wanted to leave my past behind me when I came here.
What the fuck areyou, a praying mantis woman?.
- [ Yells ]
- I--
I've never been to a place like this.
I mean, it's just so free.
Juan, I have spent mywhole life in a gym.
I just wanted to party like everyone else.
My coach, Orgrav, would kill me ifhe found out.
He would hunt me down like a deranged lunatic.
- He's really scary some--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- You are a gymnast?.
- Yeah.
Oh!
Gracias.
- [Penelope Moaning Loudly]

- [ Glass Shatters ]
I 'l I be right back.
[ Moans ]
Okay.
Eh, I 'm still not sure.
I may need a few more hours to pump her for information.
You asshole!
Now you're just trying to get laid.
How would you like to be stuffed in this closet while I go out there and have sex?.
- That is a great idea.
- [Toilet Flushes ]
Shh! Here she comes!
What exactly are your intentions with Jenny?.
You know, Put... during the Sung Dynasty, there was a great mystic-- MasterTsu Tong Po.
And he once said something verywise:
""Ifyou love something, set it free.
- Ifit comes back toyou--"
- Fuck off.
It's a bloody Hallmark card.
Just trying to helpyou, man.
Well, she has taken quite a fancy toyou, hasn't she?.
But I have some... ammunition of my own.
What kind ofman would I be ifl sat idly bywhileyou stole herfrom me?.
Do not underestimate me, Lars.
I know things you don't.
All right, Lars, let's see whatyou got.
- [ Whispering ] Lookwhat I found.
- [ Gasps ]
- Wow.
- Yeah. Shiny.

[ Grunts ]
- Whoo!
-!Ay Mami! He found the fucking boat!
[Jenny]
Whoo!
Hang on to your kudos.
- Oh!
- She's not going anywhere.
- What did you do to the propeller, man?.
- I didn't do anything.
This is the one that was pulling Carlos.
Well, we couldsenda group to paddle out to the mainland.
- We've got plenty of strong guys.
- No chance.
The riptide'll take you out to sea.
[ Chuckles ]
You'll be drinking your own urine in less than 20 hours.
- Where's Putman?.
- He's not here?.
He left last night.
He ran offinto the jungle.
- Oh, by ""ran off' doyou mean ""got killed byyou"?.
- Ah!
What, did you really thinkwe wouldn't notice Putman was gone ifyou came backwith a boat?.
- Sam, that's ridiculous.
- Whyis that ridiculous?
Hey, look. Putman freaked out in the middle of the night and took off into the jungle.
Look, we went into your room last night, Lars.
Mark David Chapman over here has a shrine to Pete.
- It's unbelievable!
- So I'm a fan.
A fan?.
Man, you're a fucking loon!
Look, nobody here was killed last night... because Lars was in the jungle killing Putman.
Hey, look. I could never hurt another person, okay?.
- I don't believe in violence.
- Mm-hmm.
I touch other people to make them feel better.
Come on. I have an obligation to get to the bottom of that--
Come on. I have an obligation to get to the bottom of that--

Quityour bickering!
Now, we just get through one more night, the boat will be here tomorrow.
We'llbe allright. So, come on, everybody, let'sjust have a drink...
- and... mellow out.
- I don't want to mellow out, Pete!
I want to know what Lars's deal is, huh?. You come here and everyone starts getting killed.
Hey, I don't have to tell you shit,
Fun Pig! You wanna Fun arrest me?.
You get a Fun-fucking warrant!
Until then... stay out of my
Fun-fucking face!
Come on!
Jenny, you know
I'm not the killer, right?.
Look, Lars, it's not so bad in here, okay?.
- I'll bring you some magazine.
- Yeah.
You familiar with the expression ""sitting duck"?.
No.
- You guys, this is totally fucked up.
- Look,Jenny... ifhe's the killer, then we have him in this room.
And if not, then at least we know it's not him.
[BirdSquawking]
Did it stink?.
You bet it stunk.
Oh, shit!
[Laughs ]
- Hey, you guys gonna be hanging around for a while?.
- Totally.
We're just getting started.
Anyway, that's my mom foryou.

I can only assume this means every other man on the island is dead.
We got to get outta here! Dirk's dead!
He just got electrocuted in the pool!
Really?. What was the look on his face?.
He must have screamed bloody murder.
[ Quivering ]
You're scaring me.
I just want to know if smoke came out ofhis ears. Is that so wrong?.
- [ Shudders, Screams ]
- Hey! Oh! Putman, where haveyou been?.
Running in circles through this bloodyjungle, that's where.
Thank God you're not dead. Now, we need to get over to Pete's cabana...
- and get that auxiliary generator.
- Wait, hang on!
If Dirkjust got killed, then Lars couldn't be the killer!
All right now, be on guard.
He might be a little cranky.
Lars!Lars, we're here!
Oh, do give it a rest,Jen.
[Jenny]
He couldn't have.
He's far too large.
We gotta find Pete.

- [ Disgusted Sigh ]
All right,
Lars will probably come after us here.
We don't knowforsure that it is Lars.
And we don't know ifhe got out or if someone else got in.
What is it with you and Lars?.
I'm beginning to wonder ifyou aren't in cahoots!
I mean, let's see.
You had sex with Rolo, and he's dead.
You and Cliff, right?.
He's dead.
Give me a break. I screwed Juan and Pete, and those guys aren't dead.
Bloody hell,Jen!
Am I the only one?.
All right, let's get back to the case.
What we have to do--
Why don'tyou drop the bullshit cop routine, okay, Sam?.
Oh,just as soon as you drop the ""I've got nothing to hide" routine,Juan.
Let me guess. You were in here looking forthis letterfrom the Encarnacion prison facility?
- What the fuck, man?.
- Fuck, why you are doing this, man?.
""J uan shows no signs of the bizarre and horrible behavior...
""that brought him to this institution.
""We believe him to be fullyrehabilitated... and will be an excellent addition to your staff."
- What did you do,Juan?.
- I did nothing,Jenny.
What the fuck didyou do, man?
Costa Rican prison-- that's some hard-core anal action, man.
-Juan, we have to know.
- What did you do,Juan?.
- What did you do,Juan?.
- [Dave ] What the fuck didyou do, man, huh?
-[Putman ] What didyou do?
- Tell us!
- I did nothing! Huh?.
- [Screaming]
- [Juan ] El Chupacabra!
- [Jenny] Hey!
- [Juan ] No!
- [ Sobs ]
- [Juan ] Oh! Oh, my God!
[ Exclaims In Spanish ]
- How could you do that?.
- Wait, wait!
I did not do this. I 'm not a killer.
I did not do this. I'm not a killer.
What the fuck, man?.
Then, what is this?.
You want to know what I did?.
Huh?.
You all want to know what I did?.
Juan Castillo... went to jail... for having sex with a goat.
Allright?
Whatyou want me to say?.
We lived on a farm!
And I got lonely!
[ Sobbing ]
We were--
Oh, we were just a couple of stupid kids.
No, it wasn'tJuan.
It was Dave... wasn't it?
You hated him forwhat he did to your parents.
You see, what none of us did know... indeed, what none ofus could know... was that David's parents... were trampled to death at a Coconut Pete concert.
What the hell's wrong withyou, Putman?
Everyone knows Dave's parents got killed at a Pete show.
- [ Mouths Words ]
- Yeah, way to bring up a sore subject.
- What?. I-- What?.
- [Dave ] You think
I could have killed him?
He's my Uncle Petey.
You all saw him as... a mellow island songster... and a resort owner, but... how many ofyou knew that he-- he was afraid of dogs... and that his favorite spice was rosemary?.
Howmanyofyou knew that... he was uncircumcised and smelled of oranges?. [ Sniffs ]
Yes, that's all well and good, David.
But I'll bet hind to horses... that you inherit the island.
- The island is already mine.
- What?.
Pete signed it over to me last week.
He was going back on the-- on the road where he belonged.
He was forming a supergroup--
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!
Don Henley was gonna play drums!
Fuck, that would've been tight! Fuck.
He was gonna sell the island to the navyfortest bombing.
But I told him I-I could handle the responsibility.

We're all gonna stay together, in one room!
Look, the boat will be here tomorrow.
We'll go to the club, gather all the guests... and wait until the morning, and we're going to do this together.
And we're gonna make it through the night, okay?.
Screw this, man!
I'm not going anywhere with Lars.
[Laughs ]
Well, I'm not going anywhere withJuan.
- [Dave ] Ooh!
- What kind of a man has sex with a goat?.
- Hey, I used a condom.

I can hold my breath... for three minutes and 33 seconds?.
[ Chuckles ]

He's the guy from the campfire story--
Machete Phil, the kid with no dick.
No. That's just an old campfire story.
What doyou piss out of, your asshole?.
It's just a story! I have a dick.
I'm not Machete Phil.
I'm Machete Sam.
- [ Laughs ]
- [Jenny]Sam, whyareyou doing this?
Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday.
I asked Rolo ifhe hadanygrass, and he said he didn't have any.
So then I followed him into thejungle.
- Would you believe what I saw?.
- No.
He had grass. My grass!
- [ Laughing ]
- A huge bag ofit.
And he was smokin' it with those two little hussies... even though he said he had none.
So then--
No, wait, that's not it.
I found out that Pete was giving the island to Dave.
Oh, yeah. That's it.
It wasn't about the grass.
Although that was incredibly uncool.
It was about Pete giving the island to that little shithead!
All-night raving, pill-popping little son ofa bitch!
What about me?. H uh?.
I deserved it!
I 'm the best goddamned employee this place has ever seen!
Dave was gonna run it into the ground.
Not on mywatch!
This is my home.
Pete thinks I'mjust a clown, goodforfun andgames.
Well, I got you guys to do yourjobs, didn't I?.
Pretty good managerial skills, don't you think?.
Settingyou guys up to decipher that stupid ""Naughty Cal'"song.

[radio]: Ah!
- I guess you can't see me rubbing my nipples on the radio.
- It's a great visual, Bob.
Thanks for that image.
- All right, 7:25, CJ92.
You know what day it is today?
- What?
- It's "Start-a-rumour Day."
- Oh, is it?!
- Start-a-rumour day. You got a rumour you wanna start, get on the phone here,
249-CJ92. Start-a-rumour Day, and I happen to have a couple of rumours here...
[radio banter]
- Oh, really?
- Just a rumour! Just a rumour.
- Hell no, we can't go!
Hell no, we can't go!
You want to start your own rumour there, Joe?
- Rumour has it the boss is gonna give me a big raise because of that last rumour.
- I like that.
- Rumour has it Bob's becoming a vegetarian.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- Oh, that's just a rumour.
[mixed radio conversations and background music]
- If there's a rumour you wanna share, give us a shout, 249-CJ92, and we'll get to some more rumours right after these.
- You got a rumour you want to start?
Get on the phone here at 249-CJ92.
Look, the phones are just going nuts.
We'll take a call here. Hi, CJ.
- I heard a rumour...
- When I was a kid, I thought
it was a pretty bad idea to group all the downtown
office towers in one place.
My reasoning then was that it made it too easy for the supervillains
to pick up the whole of downtown in one big clump
and hold it hostage, as supervillains will.
You know, shoot it out into space or make it hover over the city
with all the underground plumbing and wiring
hanging precariously from below.
This left it up to the superheroes to come to the rescue
and put things back to normal.
A scenario most superheroes had to deal with
at least once in their career.
The thing I never understood
was when our superhero managed to save the day,
and plop the city back down to earth,
everything seemed to go back to normal.
As if all the plumbing and wiring
and phone lines would just magically get all hooked back up again.
- So, ready for your daily grind?
- Oh, yeah.
- A pun. That was a pun, man.
- A pun?
- Yeah.
Well, I could go for a coffee myself.
I'm dying for a cup here.
- Knock yourself out.
You're living in the land of plenty.
- Can't.
Not on the job. The boss thinks it looks bad. You believe that?
- Really?
You'd think it'd look good.
- Yeah, well, he's a little...
So I gotta wait till my friggin' break and boot it over to Joe Time.
- Joe Time?
- Yeah.
You know, it's better coffee, and it's cheaper, too.
- Hmm.
- Oh. Hey, listen.
I got a joke for you.
- I gotta go, man. I'm late.
- This is a good one.
- I gotta go. Ha! Ha!
- This is good,
I'm telling you.
- It might be fun to be in your office when the downtown
is picked up and held in space,
high above the planet, under some protective bubble.
There'd be tons of battling, looting and raping and so on.
Not from the supervillain or his henchmen,
but from the inhabitants.
The people I work with.
Under their calm facade,
I think most of these people
would love to get back to the jungle.
Although you gotta wonder
why a superhero would bother saving us, anyway.
Superheroes have morals, a sense of honour and decency.
So he'd be disgusted by our behaviour
and he'd boot the works off into the sun,
which would be a shame,
considering I'm just getting settled in here.
- On course?
- Holding fast.
- In 24.
- Twenty-four.
- Headaches?
- Headaches.
Give me some of that.
- You buying lunch?
- Maybe. Where?
- I don't know. Five?
- I don't like Five anymore.
- You don't like Five.
- I don't know. It's starting to feel like a poor man's Three.
- You buy, you decide.
- All right.
[intercom]: Day 24.
Honour system.
- Honour system.
Will dib, dib, dib, sir.
- Dib, dib, dib.
- Good morning, Todd. I mean Tom.
- Oh, sorry.
- Okay.
Ugh!
Dub, fucking dub.
Good morning, boys.
Dib, dib, dib, dib, dib.
Dib, dib, dib.
Dub, dub, dub. Du...
Hey, hey, hey!
Good morning, Bradley.
Is the field trip today?
Say, Bradley,
I calculated. For me to work here to my retirement in 40-odd years,
I'm gonna have to come down here approximately 10,000 times.
You've worked here for what,
20 years?
That means this is, like, your 5,000th visit.
Guy, you're halfway home.
Guess you can't go halfway home again.
- Sandra West.
- Still in?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?
- I'm in. I'm in.
- Randy's in with a capital "I".
- Yeah. Well, remember whose idea it was.
What about Curt?
- Haven't seen him. What's going on with Vicki? She was all weepy this morning.
- Uh, the usual.
You know kittens, they're vulnerable.
- She still engaged?
- It's hard to tell.
- Hmm.
- Say, are you getting headaches?
- Headaches? No. Why? Should I be?
- This whole building is one big sealed unit.
I mean, the air is recycled.
- Tom! Don't put such ideas in my head.
- You're absolutely right.
You don't want to think about it.
It'll drive you nuts. It's not like they start with fresh air.
They start with polluted downtown air.
- What'd I just say?!
Fuck.
- Looking for something?
- Oh. Brad. I was just... stealing your lunch.
Brad, come on. Come on.
Your pack almost fell off your desk.
I just stood it back up again.
The thing they don't teach you in university -
and it should be a course, it should be mandatory -
is how to work in close proximity
to coworkers that you have nothing in common with. And who you may,
in fact, dislike. Having to work elbow to elbow with someone
like "Sadly, I'm Bradley" here requires training.
You need to appear friendly
and personable,
even if it goes against your natural instincts.
Even if your natural instincts would have you lean toward rudeness.
- Hey, Dinkus.
Found one of your little friends crawling across my desk.
- And so... you killed him?
- Listen, Dinkus.
I want to ask you something.
Just between you and me, okay?
- Sure. What?
- What I'm finding hardest about all this, and I'm sure you're struggling with it too, is, uh...
Well, I'm not getting any.
If you know what I mean.
And I'm having a pretty hard time arranging for any.
- Aren't you engaged?
- No juice until we're married.
- You're kidding.
- Scout's honour.
- Well, how do you... you know, how do you cope?
- Oh. Strictly a one-sided arrangement.
I could never do that.
- Wait a sec. You and her aren't, but you and other women...
- Are. Yeah.
- Well, how do you know she isn't also?
- What do you mean?
All right. Listen, Dinkus.
The way I see it, Randy has absolutely no self-respect.
So he's probably jerking away himself.
Sandra's a block of ice.
She's not even a factor.
But my question is, Dinkus, what are you doing?
Not embarrassing yourself, are you?
- I'm using a little dope.
It takes the edge off.
- Hold on a second. Dope?
That's not allowed.
That's in the rules, right?
- There's no rule.
- That's not fair.
If you're half-baked all the time, you're just gonna cruise all the way to the finish line.
[chortling]
- There's no rule about dope.
- That's fucking cheating.
- Retard.
- Tom. Tom! You got a minute?
- Millions.
- Is he listening to music?
- Mm-hmm.
- You're picking up
Mr. Mather's gift, right?
- I guess, yeah.
- I phoned. It's ready. Birks.
It's paid for.
Just pick it up.
Ask for David in Collectibles.
- Okay.
Why am I picking this up?
- I'm not a trainee anymore.
It's a trainee's job.
- Wait a second.
You're not a trainee anymore?
- Practically speaking,
I'm still in training.
But officially,
I'm no longer a trainee.
- When do I get to be not a trainee officially, but not practically, speaking?
- Ask Mrs. Drysdale.
- Check with the "Clivesdale".
So you don't run errands anymore?
- No, I'll run errands.
Just not gift-running errands.
- Do I have to wait till it's lunch?
- You'll have to ask Mrs. Clives--
I mean, Drysdale.
Mrs. Drysdale!
- Okay. Forget about it.
- No, no, no. It's good to ask.
Tom's running a gift errand during his lunch.
He'd like to know if it's company policy to leave early for lunch to make up for the time lost.
He's picking up Mr. Mather's retirement gift.
- And I was just wandering if--
- Gift! The origin of the word, from "to give".
Mr. Mather started this company from nothing,
56 years ago. He has given over half his life for this company.
He is the sole reason you are gainfully employed by this company.
Are you prepared to give anything beyond the five months you've been with this organization, Mr. Bennett?
Good. You can start by giving up a portion of your lunch hour to pick up a retirement gift for the founder of this company.
How does that sit with you?
- Uh, fine.
- And you know what you have to do.
- Yes, of course.
You should really check with her on your trainee status.
- Yeah, some other time.
- You're going down?
- Hey!
- Hey.
- How are you doing, man...
Vicki Strayhorn.
- Strayhorn...
Yeah, that's an idea.
I don't usually like to dip my pen in company ink, but in this case, I'll make an exception. Right, Dinkus?
- She's vulnerable.
- Really.
- Hmm.
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
I missed him.
- Ah!
[Curt]: What the fuck?!
[chuckling]
- What?
- Is it supposed to show?
- Oh. I don't know anymore.
- So what's with Mather?
- Oh, you know. His thing.
- His thing?
- You don't know?
- No.
- Well, they like to keep it a little quiet.
It's kind of an embarrassment to the firm.
- Yeah?
- He's like a serious clepto.
- What?
- Yeah.
Someone has to keep an eye on him during lunch in case he picks something up, like shoplifts.
- And that's you?
- I have to follow him around to see if he, you know, swipes something.
Today is my first day.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
It's way better than gift errands.
- He founded the company.
- Yes, he did. Yes, he did.
So what if he, like... what if he, like, steals something?
- Well, if you ask him and he gives it to you, you return it.
But sometimes, he gets a bit weird, or a bit weird-violent, so you let him keep it.
And then, you pay for what he took.
And then, they reimburse you in petty cash.
What's wrong?
- You don't know?
- Don't start.
- What are you talking about?
- Remember. Birks.
David in Collectibles.
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck off with that.
- There's the four of us in on the bet.
Randy, Sandra, Curt
and myself.
The deal is who can go the longest without going outside?
The four of us all live in apartments attached to the downtown core.
We stay in our apartments at night and in the office
by day. This is made easy
since the downtown clump is all connected
by walkways.
You could probably
spend years at work without even going down to street level.
In theory, we could go without fresh air till we retire.
We've each got a month's salary on this misguided challenge.
Winner takes all.
Ten thousand dollars.
Plus an odd sense of accomplishment.
Why attempt something this juvenile?
Well for Randy and me, I guess we are juvenile. Sandra?
I think for her, it's a team-spirit thing.
I think she had second thoughts
after she realized the team was just us bottom-feeders.
Now her competitive nature is taking over. Curt?
Curt's got something wrong with him.
And a... and a slice.
- What kind?
- Uh...
Hawaiian.
- We don't have Hawaiian.
- Could I have a straw, please?
- Okay. Ham and pineapple.
- There you are, sir.
Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you. Aloha.
Mm...
- "I'm sick of Five.
It's just a poor man's Three."
-I got a hit.
Look at this.
It's so sad really.
- "I may have lost it as you say, but you're starting to turn the wrong way.
You'll be following me down someday." What's this?
- The guy's fucking pathetic.
- Who's it from?
- "Sadly, I'm Bradley."
- Bradley. He's been acting odd, don't you think?
- Fucked is more accurate.
- He's asking for help.
- I don't know.
I don't think about him.
I don't notice him.
I just share an office with him.
- You're buying, right?
- No.
- You said you were buying.
- You said I was buying.
It's completely different.
- What's gotten into you, guy?
I mean, maybe Brad's right.
- You with her?
- What?
- You know her?
- Yeah. Actually, yes. I do.
She's my girlfriend.
- Your girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- Your girlfriend.
- Hey. Hey.
Guy, hey. Come on.
Hey, I was just kidding.
Okay, run.
Randy, did you see the girl on the phone?
- No.
- You know where she went?
- No idea.
- Fuck.
- Ohh!
- Ohh... Oh, God!
- What's going on?
- Oh, God! Oh, God.
Look!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Who would do something like that?
- Okay.
- Oh, God.
- Some people go just a little too far, don't they?
- That is... so gross.
Oh, God.
- You're not at lunch.
- Uh, month end.
- Month end. Right.
- Oh, God.
I have to go wash my hand.
- Okay, I'll take care of this.
- Curt's done this before.
- What? What's he done?
- In university.
At Carlton, they have a tunnel system that connects the buildings to the residence.
And get this.
Curt Schwin went a full year.
Undisputed champ.
- Who told you this?
- I don't think
I could go a year.
- A year?
- That's what I heard, a year.
Thompson's a couple of years behind him.
Apparently, there's still a bit of a cult of Curt there.
- A year? Fuck that.
He's disqualified.
I never would've gotten into this if I'd known that. He cheated.
- We asked him, remember?
- He lied.
He withheld information.
- Not really.
I'd kind of heard. But not really and... I didn't think it was so wrong.
- You knew?
Are you fucking out of your mind?
A year? A year?
I dunno if I can go 30 days, let alone a year.
- You said Curt couldn't stay out of the pickup circuit for more than a week.
- It's true. Fuck. Fuck!
I just gave him Vicki Strayhorn.
Give me a fucking quarter.
- For you, not likely.
- Randy, the guy is struggling.
If he nails Vicki, he'll be good for months. Years.
Give me a fucking quarter!
Thank you - champ!
[dring!]
- Curt Schwin.
- Curt?
- Hey, Dinkus.
You phoning Vicki to put in a good word for me?
- A year?
- Oh, yeah.
Them's the good old days.
Listen, Dinkus.
Thanks for the pet.
It worked like a "charmsky."
[sniffing]
Oof!
[computer]: One giant leap for man...
and one small step for man,
one giant leap for, for, for...
- Excuse me, Miss.
I was, uh, watching you on the phone. In the food fair?
- Uh-uh. I have a boyfriend.
- Yeah, I know.
You see, that's just it.
I was watching you on the phone and some guy comes up to me and he asks me if I know you.
And I told him that I did.
Even though, of course, I don't
So, uh...
- And?
- He got kinda in a... in a funk.
He had on, like, this blue shirt.
He had curly hair.
I was trying to straighten it out.
Not the hair, but the situation.
- Okay, so you said that you knew me.
- Uh, yeah. Like... like... but joking, you know.
- Yeah. Joking like how?
- Uh, I kind of told him that you were my girlfriend.
- You told my boyfriend that I was your girlfriend?
- I might of, yeah.
- How upset was he?
- I don't know. He ran... he ran away. So...
- Hey, have you seen these?
[muffled screaming]
Okay, it's your turn.
- Is that what this is for?
- Yeah. You gotta try it.
- You just, uh...
- You're supposed to scream.
- Yeah, I don't really feel the need.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Where's that guy?
- Who? What? Oh, despondent boy?
I don't know.
He just got up and went inside.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I thought he might've--
- Jumped?
- Yeah.
- No.
I told him he couldn't lay there, so he got up and went inside.
- Wow. I totally thought--
- He jumped. Right?
- Yeah.
- No. From where, really?
You'd have to get up on the roof or break a window.
That's harder than it sounds.
The roof's all secure, so you can't get up there.
And breaking a window, that's tough too.
You can't really break that glass.
A few months back, a guy used a pop bottle filled with marbles; just broke the window with it and pff...
- I gotta go.
- Sure you do.
- Mather Mather & Mather.
How can I help you?
I wish you wouldn't say sorry.
Please say "pardon me" or "excuse me."
You're using the word incorrectly.
Try and remember for next time.
Do you say "sorry" when you mean
"pardon me" or "excuse me"?
- Sorry. What? Uh, no. I...
Oh, I guess I obviously do, yes.
- Sandwich?
- Sure.
[breathing heavily]
So, uh, how's Pete?
- Pete?
- Fiancé Pete?
Or do you have a couple of fiances waiting in the wings?
- No. No, no. Just... just one.
Pete.
- So how is Pete, anyway?
- Pete... he's... he's fine.
Fine.
- How long has it been?
The, uh, engagement?
- Oh... two years.
- Two years?
It's a long time.
Why so long?
- To save money for the wedding,
I guess.
I don't really know. I guess...
To see if we like it, I guess.
- To see if you like being engaged.
- Yeah. Well, no. No, no.
Not engaged. Married. To see if we like being married.
Sort of, like... a test.
A test run.
- And after two years, you decide,
"Yes, we liked being engaged."
Or, "No, we did not like being engaged."
And if you do like being engaged, then... why shouldn't you just keep being engaged?
Why tamper with bliss?
Now, if you didn't like being engaged, then you'll have to consider moving to a state of...
"non-engagedness."
Get married, or... split up.
[sighing]
Two years.
- Aren't you engaged?
- Well... yeah.
- So, uh...
So we're both engaged.
- Yep.
- How long?
- Two years.
[bang!]
- All right. A guy jumps from a window and kills himself.
So he didn't, but I thought he did.
And I stayed inside because of a bet. That's gotta fuck
with your sense of yourself.
I've only been working down here
for five months. And already,
I'm starting to turn.
Maybe Brad's right.
Maybe I am turning.
God, I think I'm becoming completely desensitized.
Am I some kind of a monster?
An abnormality?
A psychopath of some kind?
They say that a hallmark of psychopathic behaviour is fake charm.
turning it on for stuff you don't like.
Sometimes, I think my job now is saying hello
and making small talk around the office.
I wonder how many times a day
I say hello.
There's all that stuff about kids seeing
8,000 TV murders before they're, like, four.
But hello is worse.
It's become meaningless.
It's a con. A way to trick us into thinking
we're engaged in human interaction.
I could be saying hello to a plant
or my ant farm. Last week,
these two intense suits were walking, like, full speed.
And they knocked heads right in front of me.
They both landed flat on their backs.
It was like I was watching it on TV. One guy was knocked out cold.
I didn't even break stride.
I might as well have said hello.
- Have you seen Mather?
- Uh...
- I found him and I lost him.
This isn't good. It's the day of his retirement party.
What if he gets arrested or something? God, I'm doomed.
- Okay. So, what?
- I think he knows he's being followed.
He's sneaky and he's fast.
Oh! He's fast.
- Where was the last time--
- It'd be just my luck if he got caught.
Where's the present?
- Present?
- Mather's present?
- Right. I'm just... I'm on my way.
- If you spot him, let me know.
Okay? You keep an eye on him.
You call me on my cell and let me know where he is.
. Okay.
- You look kinda out of it.
- Some nasty shit going on.
- How so?
- I dunno. You know,
I don't know if I've been myself lately.
Or maybe I have.
- Hey, shit. Check out this monitor right here.
This'll align your plane.
There we go. Right on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Jesus...
It's amazing how often that happens, you know.
It's like they have a sixth sense or something.
- Is that new?
- Yeah. It's a ton of fun.
- Okay. Listen.
Do I seem different to you?
- I don't know. Like what?
- Cold. Removed.
Do I seem cold or removed?
- I always thought that was in your job description.
- That old guy. Where is that?
- Huh?
- That's my boss.
We've been looking for him.
- Ah. Busted!
- Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no.
Phil. Phil, let me...
Let me take this. Okay?
- Sure.
Slap his hand for me.
- Yeah, I'll handle it.
Il n'y a plus dans cette ville
la joie qu'il y avait avant
Downtown
Je suis perdue dans cette ville sans toi
toi qui m'aimais pourtant
Downtown
je m'en vais seule au long des rues retrouver le passé
d'un amour qui n'existe plus
mais qui a commencé
dans cette ville
j'ai beau chercher
mais plus rien
j'ai beau chercher dans les rues
mais pourtant c'est en vain tu sais
Downtown
comme on s'aimait oh oui...
[dring!]
- Sandra West.
- I found him.
In the men's washroom.
Behind Something Significant.
- Oh, good. Where?
- Something Significant.
The store.
- Where is that? What is that?
- The store.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Fuck.
Mr. Mather?
Mr. Mather, can I have the bag, please?
Look, it's not your bag... sir.
It's not yours.
So, uh... could I... have it?
Please?
- Is he in there?
- Yes.
All you have to do is be polite.
- Is he in there?
- Yes, he's in there. He stole this.
I wouldn't walk around with it or anything.
He took it off some guy in the mall.
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- It's so stifling in here.
- Don't do that.
- What?
- You talked me into this bet.
So don't go playing with my brain, okay?
It's being played with enough.
And where is Mather's present?
- Okay, okay. I'm going right now.
By the way, you're welcome.
So what do you get the boss who's stolen everything?
I guess once you don't have to worry
about the day-to-day monotony of making a dime,
you can get bored. Your mind wanders to other things.
Maybe problematic things like shoplifting.
I guess you could be doing worse things:
dismemberment things, drunk-driving things.
I mean, it's not like you kill someone every lunch hour.
But is that where this leads?
That's my question.
I mean, God!
The fish stinks from the head down, right? Am I the tail?
Am I starting to smell?
- Hey, guy. Listen. You gotta hear this one. It's brilliant,
I'm telling you.
- Hey, guy. Guy. No.
Hey. Hi. How is he?
- Who?
- Your boy--
- I'm so jittery. Do I seem jittery?
I am super hyper-sensitive right now. Can you tell?
- I wanted to apologize. About what I said to your boyfriend.
I mean, it's scary, isn't it?
It's scary what can happen.
I mean, one false move and you can throw a whole lot of things out of whack.
- You know what?
It's not a big deal.
Where'd you go?
I looked all over.
- Uh, I... I lost you.
Son of. Listen. How is he?
- I didn't find him.
God, look at these.
The colours for fall. Yuck!
- Uh, so...
Your boyfriend, how is he?
- Oh, he's fine.
- So... you think he's okay?
- Oh, no.
He's so fine.
Paul is one of the happiest guys.
Around here, anyway.
- Happy. He doesn't seem very happy.
- Oh no. You know what he does for a living?
He delivers flowers.
Everybody loves getting flowers, right?
Your lips are kissable.
Anyways,
I'm breaking up with him.
- You're breaking up with him?
Do you think that's a... a good idea?
- I really need to calm down.
You wouldn't happen to have any dope on you, would you?
- No.
- No.
- No, I don't have any dope.
Listen. I have to run this errand for work.
Afterwards, I could talk to him.
Or right now. What do you think?
- He works at Floral Arrangements.
I really need to calm down.
- Okay. I have some pot in my car.
- Really?
- Yes. In my car.
- Well, let's go to your car.
- I have to run-- get this gift.
- Get the gift.
And then, we'll go to your car.
- Okay, we could do that.
- So what's that worth?
- You know, I read somewhere that infidelity actually is healthy for relationships.
- Really?
- Especially for engagements.
- Where did you read that?
Playboy?
- Actually, I think it was Playboy.
But I'm being deadly serious.
Plus, it's not like
we're married or anything.
- No, of course. We're... What?
- What what?
- What you just said.
- What did I just say?
What did you hear?
- You were getting at something.
- No. No.
Did you hear something?
- No. It sounded like something.
- You know, I'm innuendo-free.
Had all my shots.
- I've... I've... I've...
I'm sorry. I just... I have to...
I've gotta get this to...
- What do you think I suggested?
[dring!]
Hello.
- Curt? Christ.
- Make it fast, Dinkus.
I'm lining up the game-saving play here.
- Okay, listen to me, Curt.
Listen to me.
You're using a coworker in a less-than-honourable way.
And for what? For what?
A stupid bet.
Principles, man.
Think principles.
- Oh, come on, Bennett.
I've seen you work.
You're far less principled than I am.
- So...
So where... where were we?
- Oh. I, uh...
I think you were suggesting something... but you couldn't come right out and say it.
[laughing]
- Did you see that guy?
Those guys never step aside.
It's like you're not even there.
- They ignore--
- The rules. I know.
Oh. Listen first, talk later. Right?
- Are you gonna sit?
- I can't. I'm working.
So, how's that, uh...
How's the bet?
- It's good.
I mean, it's fine.
I'm sticking in there.
I mean, I'm keeping really--
- Focused. Yeah, I can see that.
- Well, as focused as I can be, you know--
- Under these conditions, for sure.
- You're doing it again.
- Finishing your sentences.
Sorry.
- You know, once you settle into the routine, it's easy.
I think I'm doing pretty good, too.
This thing doesn't even affect me.
- I, uh...
I work for
Mather Mather & Mather.
- Three Ms.
- Mm-hmm. Soon to be two.
- Oh, yeah?
You got a degree of some kind?
- Commerce.
- Ah, yeah? You like it?
- I dunno.
I'm just getting started.
- How's the atmosphere up there?
Is it all fresh and clean?
- It's pretty good.
It's... Whoa.
- What?
- Nothing.
- I don't know if this is such a good idea.
- Don't worry about it. Just read the names on the button and transfer the calls to that person by pushing that button.
- Ha. Ha.
- What's wrong?
- I was... just thinking about what happened to your boyfriend,
Paul.
- I don't know a thing about it.
- No, wait. No, no, no.
Listen. Listen.
See, when you went outside, when I lost you,
I didn't actually... I didn't actually, like, lose you.
I'm in this stupid fucking bet with some of the people I work with.
Okay. And I can't...
I can't go outside.
- Oh, that's too bad.
Your lips are so kissable.
Wait a minute. For all you knew,
Paul could've jumped to his death. And you don't go outside 'cause of some bet?
- No, no, no, no.
- What kind of guy are you?
God!
- Hey, no, no, no.
Come on, wait. No.
Ah!
- Where's the present?
- Oh, fuck!
[Kathy]: There are two kinds of people in the world:
good people and bad people.
There's no in-between.
I have the vase.
I'm gonna go talk to Paul
at Floral Arrangements.
Meet me there.
- I can't do this. I... I...
- I know. Me neither.
I... I shouldn't be...
It's just...
- I can't do this.
I can't do this.
- Me neither. Me neither.
Me neither.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, Curt.
Oh! Oh wait. Wait. My foot.
Ah!
[toilet flushing]
- Hey. Hey, you dropped something.
Hey! We all have to live here, you know!
Or work here.
Fuck.
Shit.
[inhaling deeply]
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Uh, I'm supposed to meet someone.
What's he doing?
- He's just... standing in there.
He just had a fight with his girlfriend.
- Do you know where she is?
- She left a little while ago, then he went and stood in there.
I gotta get in there
'cause I got orders to fill.
No, wait.
I wouldn't do that if I were you. He... he can be a little bit... vigorous.
Not vigorous, but violent.
- Violent?
- He's been a little bit like this before. But not exactly.
- Hey, guy.
What's his name?
- Paul.
- Hey, Paul...
Uh, so listen...
Your girlfriend told me I should come up here and clear up the whole... misunderstanding about what... what happened in the food fair.
Because, uh...
It was a misunderstanding, man.
What I said to you, it was a joke.
Just a joke. I'd never met your girlfriend before.
I didn't really know her.
And I still don't... know her.
- You still don't know her.
- No. No, no, no.
I just met her.
Just recently.
You know, trying to clear this whole mess up.
And... and, uh...
Because you ran, man.
You took off.
And then, I looked for you.
And then,
I couldn't find you or anything.
You know what, guy?
You know what? Maybe, uh...
Maybe, uh, this is none of my business, but...
I was thinking that maybe it's time to move on.
I mean, you know, maybe... things aren't really working out between you two.
- How would you know?
- Listen, did Kathy leave this here for me?
'Cause, uh...
Okay. You know what?
That's kind of a present for...
Hey, you know what?
How would I know?
How would I know? You're right.
I mean, I don't know what's going on between you two.
Maybe all you need is just, you know, to work at it a little bit harder.
It's obvious to me that something special is going on between you two, because she really was worried sick about you.
- She told you that?
- I could tell by the way she was acting.
- How was she acting?
- Well, you know, uh... worried.
- Worried?
- Super worried.
Guy... it's obvious to me that she really cares about you.
- She just told me she wants to break up with me to go out with you.
- She said that?
[glass breaking]
- I'm just gonna...
- Cut it out!
Stop!
[sobbing]
- Kathy!
- He's normally not like this.
- Okay. Paul, that's it.
Your break is over!
- Fuck off!
- Ahhh!
- Okay. So basically, you're telling me your insurance doesn't cover this.
- No. Well, sure it would.
If we broke it.
- Right.
I don't suppose we could pretend that you broke it.
- That's not going to happen.
- No. Of course not.
Of course not.
- Sorry.
- I know where he is and I haven't forgotten.
- Tortoise.
- You know, I was reading this book. It was called...
- You wanna sit?
- Can't. I'm working.
Ooh, moose, baby, moose.
I was reading this book.
It was called... Crime.
Well, yeah, it's not the same title. It's Crime and... they get away with it.
They don't get punished.
- Maybe it's called
Crime and Getting Away With It.
- It's not called that. Hey, speaking of small-mall fast...
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm great.
- Great?
- Great.
- You sure you're all right?
- You know, you look a little pale.
- Pale?
- Maybe you should try doing some fast walking.
- Or try doing some stairs.
Yeah.
Oh, that'll help oxygenate your blood.
- You think my blood needs oxygen?
- Just a thought.
- Did Tom tell you to tell me that about my blood?
- No.
- Listen, don't fucking worry about me, okay?
I can hold my own.
[dring!]
[dring!]
Hello. Hello.
Hi, Mrs. Clivesdale.
Mm-hmm.
- I'm not stepping aside anymore.
I'll share the ground. But for those who won't give way, I'm standing firm.
These, these are my rules.
- Do you think there's something wrong with me?
I've been having trouble concentrating lately when I read.
I have to go back and reread pages because... I can't concentrate.
- What was that?
- See, that's the great thing about books.
If you're not paying attention, you can go back and reread what you missed.
But with conversation, you have to pay attention the first time.
- I'm here. Where are you?
- You tell me.
- Okay. I'll write that down.
There's an engraved plaque that needs to be picked up right away from Trophyco.
Here's the address.
- Why me?
- 'Cause Mrs. Drysdale mentioned you specifically.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, where is this?
Hey, this is outside!
- Is that the way it's supposed to work?
- Come on!
It's Tom you want, not me.
Oh, God!
- No. Behind you. Behind you.
- Mather & Mather.
Sorry. & Mather.
Mather Mather & Mather.
Listen, everybody's off at lunch.
Can you phone back when people are here?
- Who is this?
- I'm having trouble with the phone system.
Could you call back in a few minutes, please?
- I don't think I have a few minutes. Where's June?
- She went to the washroom a while ago.
I don't know what she's doing.
Actually, I got a good idea.
I'm sorry.
- The phone system is simple.
I'm gonna tell you what to do. Okay?
- I got it, I got it, I got it!
- Okay. Sorry.
Oh, God! Okay.
- I'm not saying competition is a bad thing. Okay?
Certainly, it's got its good points.
I mean, you don't want to turn out like "Sadly, I'm Bradley" or anything.
- Sadly, I'm Bradley.
- Yeah. It's pretty funny, huh?
- Sadly, I am Bradley.
- Brad, hi. Listen.
The receptionist must've--
- Made a mistake.
- Yeah.
- Well, maybe you'd like to talk to me instead?
- I kinda got...
- Did you, uh, read my note?
- I haven't always been selfish and uncaring. I haven't.
I mean, I was a boy scout.
I cheated on a few badges, yeah.
But basically,
I was a good scout.
It must be the air.
Inside with all these people,
breathing the same air.
The very idea just isn't right.
- Fuck it!
I lost him again!
- Isn't he, like, 80?
- I think he likes it.
I think it's a big game to him.
He ducks down and he runs.
He fucking runs!
But I don't care.
Let him get nabbed.
Is it my problem? It's not in my job description, is it?
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
Forget him.
- Are you feeling okay?
- Fine. Fine.
Can you believe this?
- Staying inside for a month
is sort of like the buzz you have
the day after a night of heavy drinking.
You feel crappy and hung over.
But underneath that,
you're still a little drunk and light-headed.
Which can kind of compensate for the hangover.
- Mather Mather & Mather.
- Hey, guy.
How are you doing?
Listen, I need you to do me a little favour, okay?
- Vicki and Curt.
Yeah, they just went by.
- One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Oh, God.
- It's the ladies' bathroom.
[moaning and groaning]
- Ow!
[toilet flushing]
Curt, wait, wait, wait.
- Sounds like something's going on.
- What kind of something?
- You know, something something.
- I need you to stop them.
- Stop them!
- Make a noise. Do something.
- But it's the ladies bathroom.
- Come on, knock on the door!
- I can't.
- Do it! Knock on the door.
Loud! Knock loud!
[barking]
- It's written here on the bathroom stall, and I quote,
"Curt Schwin is a slut."
- Okay, well, what did he say?
- No can do. He says you have to sign for it.
- So get what I have to sign and bring it back here.
I'll sign it.
You take it back to him.
- I tried. The guy's super stubborn.
- Oh, man!
So this is how I'm gonna go out.
All because a stupid engraved--
- Plaque. I know.
What?
Look. I don't know what to say, all right?
- You don't know what to say?
How would you?
You're a fucking security guard.
Look, I'm sorry.
Honest.
- That's what it said.
"Slutty, slutty, slutty."
[barking]
- Look here, Mr. Mather.
I'm sure you find this pretty fucking funny, scurrying around the aisles on your hands and knees, but I don't
What are you looking at?
Is there an old man crawling all over your feet over there?
He's like eighty-fucking-five years old and he's got this twisted expression on his face.
Like a smirk.
A fucking smirk.
Security, please.
- Glasswares.
They have really nice glasswares.
- No, you don't understand.
I saw myself.
There's blood everywhere.
- You know, you're lucky
I'm a forgiving guy.
- I said I was sorry.
I'm not feeling well.
- I can get in a lot of shit for this.
- You'll be back in two minutes.
- Hello.
- Yeah. What?
- Code 38.
- Yeah. I'll be right there.
- Hey! You're looking a little out of it.
- Thanks.
- Okay, now here goes.
What is the difference between the 15 bus and a bottle of marbles?
- I don't know.
What's the difference?
- The 15 takes you downtown, a bottle of marbles takes you way down town.
A bottle of marbles, man, takes you way down town.
I made that up.
- I don't get it.
- Come on, man.
The joke is not gonna fly if you don't know the reference.
All right?
It's what the workers use to break out of their office windows, you know?
Pfff... splat!
It's like, what, the third time in the last month?
You know what it is?
It's like the new fad for depressed execs.
- They say you don't always see it coming.
But the first time I met Brad,
I thought, "this is the kind of guy that's gonna jump out a window."
Hey.
Hey!
What?
- One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Hi, Todd.
- Tom.
- One, two, three.
- Bradley... Bradley...
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Brad.
Bradley. Come on, Bradley.
Come on, man. Bradley.
Come on, Bradley.
[knocking]
- Phil?
- All right, there you go.
Listen to me.
Guy, I'm so sorry for not seeing the signs.
Why don't we... put some of this... whoa, on your...
Ow. Ow.
How is it? How's your head?
Listen to me.
You're in a bit of turmoil.
I see that. I see that, man.
You know, you got yourself into something... a career, say, that is... that's leaving you cold.
Right? But guy, you're like what, forty.
Forty? I mean, your life is only half over.
I mean, you have half your life to live. Right?
I don't really know what I'm saying here, Brad.
Okay. Listen to me.
I won't pretend I know what's going on in your head.
I'm not saying I have anything to say that would change your mind.
I mean, fuck, who am I to be telling you what you should or shouldn't be feeling. Right?
Or doing about how you're feeling?
Brad, could you... could you hold on one second?
Okay.
Mr. Mather.
Uh, Mr. Mather.
Hi. What do you have there?
Listen. Can I... can I have it?
Come on.
Please?
Okay. Yes. Thank you.
Thank you, sir, very much.
Okay. So where were we?
- Who are you to tell me what I should or shouldn't be feeling or doing about what I'm feeling?
- I know, Brad.
You're absolutely right.
- That's what you were saying.
- What?
- That's what you just finished saying.
- Oh, right. Right.
Okay. Yeah.
So listen to me.
You might've thought this out and figured out that this might be the best thing for you.
And it might be. I mean, how do I know, right?
But all I'm saying is...
I'm not leading up to some really big point here, but I'm just saying that lately,
I've been seeing things in me that have totally surprised me.
I mean, I'm a nice guy.
I'm a nice guy.
But this place... this place has been playing some mean fucking tricks on me.
And I guess what I was thinking is that,
Bradley, maybe all you need is a change of scenery.
I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, uh... things have happened to me lately that have surprised me about myself, and that I have to thank you, Brad, in some small way, or maybe even in a big way,
I have to thank you.
So, thank you.
You're looking at me and you're thinking,
"Why should I be listening to this fuckhead, this selfish self-centred...
- Cruel.
- Cruel. Oh man, really cruel?
- Very cruel.
- Okay. Cruel.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Paul. Hi.
Oh. You brought the...
I'll sign for those.
They're for my boss.
Listen, Paul, I want to thank you for what you did for me.
Earlier this afternoon. You know, straightening me out and everything.
I mean... guy, I deserved much worse than that.
What I did, it was inexcusable.
Those... those aren't mine,
Paul.
They're for the boss.
But you know, feel free to do that if that's, uh... what you want to do.
Guy, you know what you need?
You need to sit down.
You need to sit down.
That's right.
You sit down. Relax.
I'm gonna take these from you.
You know something, Paul?
These things... they happen in life.
But the best way to deal with them is just to move on.
Right, Brad?
Aw, Paul.
Paul, I hear you, man. I really do.
You know something?
You and Brad might have a lot in common.
Can I borrow this?
- Have you seen him?
- Yeah. He just came in a couple of minutes ago.
- Was he clean?
- Uh, yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.
- Here. Sign this.
- Why? He doesn't even know who I am.
- Oh, yeah. I'm out.
- You're out?
- The bet. So's Randy.
- You're out?
- I'd just like you to know,
Tom,
I hope you can sleep at night after all you've done.
Your little mind games worked like a charm.
You got your way.
You're a winner.
- Hey. Hey, you take that back!
You take that back.
I am not a winner!
I guess everyone has those days
that change the way you look at things.
Maybe this is one of those days.
Although usually, you're probably not aware of the mechanics
that have changed the way you look at things that day.
You probably can't put your finger on the exact moment
your life changed in a small or big way.
Of course, in the movies,
lives can change dramatically over a short period of time.
Even over the course of a lunch hour.
- I've been thinking about you all day.
Maybe we've been engaged long enough.
Maybe we should just do it.
Huh?
- Tom.
Get down here and help, will you?
- All right. Farewell.
Good luck.
Brad...
Bradley. You know, that thing that Neil Armstrong said when he went to the moon?
"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"?
Well, if you're thinking about going out a window from up here, it's the other way around.
And I don't think that's your intention.
[computer]: It's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
[Star-Spangled Banner]
- Vicki.
- Yeah?
- These are for you.
- You're giving these to me?
These are for me?
You're giving these to me?
- Thanks, Vicki.
- Is there something...?
- Thank you.
[big tremor]
- Todd.
The elevators aren't working
'cause the power's out.
Phones are out, too.
- So this is it.
We're gonna dangle in space
for who knows how long. Hell, who'd care if I've quit or not.
The basic fabric of civilization is about to break down.
Nobody's gonna be working.
It's probably already started.
People are probably already terrorizing each other.
They'll think it's the end.
The apocalypse. The last blast.
Oh, man, I should've gotten out sooner.
Here I was, turning a new leaf,
making the big change.
And now it's too late.
I guess everyone will handle it in their own way.
Breakdowns. Suicides. Denial.
Some of us will be contemplative, others homicidal.
How do I react? Where do
I stand when it all breaks down?
Am I the voice of reason, or do I start breaking windows?
The air would get pretty stale in the bubble
if the downtown were lifted high above the city.
It would probably become a drag pretty fast,
despite all the wanton- destruction possibilities.
Not that that's the direction
I would take. I wonder
what a superhero would think of my decision to opt out
of this particular career path?
Would he approve of my actions?
I guess you have to trust your instincts. Even if they are
a little cloudy.
Or in my case, really cloudy.
So I bailed on my first job out of college
and there's probably not much chance of getting a reference letter.
A reference letter would only refer me down here, anyway.
Downtown. Too bad
it couldn't refer me to another world, say, or another planet.
Somewhere where everyone behaves the way you think they should.

Guys, settle down.
Settle down, you guys.
Who just threw that?
I'll throw something back at you.
No, no more soda, you guys are crazy.
Taxi, taxi!
No, no, I got that.
I got that.
- Sorry, pal.
- It's okay...
You're stupid!
That's just stupid!
Hey, motherfucker!
Where's the wallet?
Give me that cake.
Where's Paul?
- Maurice?
- Oh shit, Mr. Duncan.
You know this dude?
I had Maurice in my ninth grade bio class about five years ago.
I guess those extra help sessions didn't quite do it for you.
Let's go, man.
This guy's cool.
He's the best teacher I ever had.
Let's go.
Sorry about this,
Mr. Duncan.
Honest mistake.
Got things under control?
Paul, what took you so long?
I ran into an old student,
I got held up.
- Mm-hmm, did you get the present?
- Yeah, yeah, voilà.
Gorgeous.
All right, let's do this.
Clara, get the lights.
- Finally.
- I know.
Ready?
Everybody, everybody!
How you doin', Jeff?
Where is he?
Where's my boy?
- Hey!
- Dad.
# Happy birthday to you #
How, you doin'?
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Adam #
# Happy birthday to you! #
- Hey, kid!
- You made me laugh.
So Dorset Prep, where is that exactly?
- Mars.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
It's in the suburbs, a half hour away.
It's a great offer, but Paul hasn't made up his mind yet.
I bet that's a change from the school you teach at now.
Oh yeah, less crack, better cafeteria selection.
Don't mind Paul. He's still grappling with his conscience.
Mom, Dad, this is the coolest present ever!
Oh-ho, it looks good too, right?
Do you think he needs more sugar?
Yeah I know,
I'm breaking every rule.
- Hello, is Steggie in here?
- Beware.
Hey, cake for Steggie.
- He can't eat that, it...
- Why not?
He's an herbivore.
Oh, oh, he's an herbivore.
Okay, then
I'll just take it back.
- Wait, maybe leave it, just in case.
- Take it back.
- That's what I thought.
- Good night.
- Bye, Dad.
- Good birthday?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
What was your favorite present?
- My jacket...
- Yay!
...You got me.
- You look so good in red.
What's on your agenda tomorrow?
Uh, I have to stop by the gallery.
I have to pick up a lens I ordered.
I have to get a new pair of sneakers for Adam.
Ooh, I have to do you.
I could take care of that right now.
Have you thought about that job offer?
You do realize it'd mean moving, right?
So, we'd move.
You know we used to think we were pretty hip living down here.
I also used to think four Merit Lights and a Diet Coke constituted a meal.
Honey, I love this place as much as you do, but we've got a kid to think about.
And I just don't think any city is a great place to raise a kid these days.
Plus, you'd be making twice what you're making now.
I'm just not sure the timing's right and your photography is starting to take.
This is not about my photography.
Okay, I just can't shake this feeling that somehow...
I'd be selling out.
Right. Listen... you know how much
I respect your ethics.
But this is about Adam.
Sometimes, ethics have to take a back seat.
Okay, your turn.
- Okay, I'm going to a picnic...
- Yeah?
And I'm going to bring an ant, a bagel, a croissant,
- a ding dong...
- Like you?
Mom!
- A ding dong...
- Yeah?
- Uh...
- Shoe store, 3:00!
- Yes!
- Take my hand.
I think if you pump them any more, they might explode.
Really?
Kaboom!
- Do you want 'em or not?
- Yeah.
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna go test these outside, okay?
Okay, but don't go too far, okay?
And how would you like to pay for this?
A credit card, please.
Ma'am?
I need your signature.
Sorry, so sorry.
All right, sorry.
- Thanks.
- Great.
Hello!
You guys!
Where's my greeting committee?
Jess?
I'm sorry, I got stuck at a teacher's conference.
Jessie?
Machine voice:
You have four new messages.
Paul, I...
God damn it!
We'll handle all the funeral arrangements.
- God be with you.
- Thank you for everything, father.
Honey?
Excuse me, Jessie?
Jessie Duncan?
Yeah?
It's Richard,
Richard Wells.
Richard?
Your wife was an undergraduate student of mine. It's been years.
Actually, Richard, it's... it's kind of a bad time.
I know, I read about it in the paper.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- Thank you.
- Actually, do you have a minute?
I'm sorry,
I know this is a terrible time.
I don't think so.
Not right now.
But believe me, if there was any other way...
The truth is, I went to some trouble to find you.
I'd like to help you.
Help us?
I'm a doctor.
I specialize in fertility.
If we could just talk, it won't take long, I promise you.
We can go to a restaurant right over there.
I finished the residency in ob-gyn, but my real passion is research.
- What is it you do, Paul?
- I teach biology.
- You do?
- Can you tell us what this is about?
Yeah.
The truth is, there is... there's no easy way to present this to you, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.
My clinic has perfected a procedure by which a single cell could be used to create a genetically-identical fetus... a fetus which could be carried to term and, in effect, be reborn.
- Do you mean cloned?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes.
This would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head.
This is how you wanna help us?
I used to be affiliated with a hospital here and I had a chance to review Jessie's records.
You did what?
I'm aware of the complications surrounding Adam's delivery,
that it's impossible for you to conceive again.
You looked at her records?
I had to be certain that Jessie's condition didn't preclude carrying a child and it doesn't, so yes, I can help you.
You can have him back, your son Adam, to birth again, to raise.
- Adam's dead, God damn it!
- Paul. Paul.
- My son is dead!
- Paul, please.
You come at me with this?
God knows what hell you've been through.
The last thing I want to do is make this time any harder.
But the truth is I can do this, and I want you to know.
What you're talking about is illegal, not to mention potentially immoral.
Illegal, yes.
Immoral, no.
We're talking about using life to create life, that's all.
And you've done this before? You've successfully cloned a human being?
No, I haven't but only because I've been looking for an ideal candidate.
I read about what happened.
And I hope that if you two aren't interested
- in what I'm proposing here...
- What are you proposing here?
- He's not even sure that he can...
- That's not true... I am sure.
Still, it does come down to trust.
- You'd be...
- Excuse me, your menus.
You'd be gambling on me as much as I'd be gambling on you.
My clinic is some
300 miles from here.
If you were to do this, it would mean moving there and I'll be honest with you, changing your lives entirely.
Paul's right, this is extremely against the law.
You'd have to sever all ties with family, with friends, with anyone who ever knew Adam.
Of course I would help with the relocation, and I can get you a job at the local high school.
- You know what, I've heard enough.
- Paul, please.
- I know how upsetting this is.
- No, no, no, you don't know!
You could never know.
- Let's go!
- You're right.
I'm sorry to have upset you.
- Jessie...
- Jessie!
I can be reached at this number.
- DNA can be saved indefinitely...
- Jessie!
But Adam's cells will only be viable another 72 hours.
So if you do change your mind...
Practically a stranger.
I can't believe you're considering this!
I can't believe you're not considering this.
Any idea how much could go wrong?
Honey, I... listen,
I love you, I love you.
I love you beyond words, okay?
But only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.
But what if it did?
It still wouldn't be Adam.
It would be an identical twin.
It'd be like another kid.
But he'd have the same face and the same laugh.
- In time, we can try again, I swear.
- No, we can't.
- You know we can't.
- We'll find a way. We can have...
I don't want another child!
I want Adam!
I want him back.
You know what I kept thinking while I was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and I was watching him die?
"This is the last time
I'll ever get to hold him. "
My little boy.
- Hello.
- Paul.
L... I just heard.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Sam.
Um... so... how's Jessie taking all this?
Actually, she's... she's not so well.
Right, of course.
Look, would you please just pass on my condolences to her?
Yeah, I will.
Hey, Sam, can I... can I ask you something?
Have you ever heard of a doctor named Richard Wells?
Richard Wells.
Sure I've heard of him. Why do you ask?
He was an old teacher of Jessie's.
Really? He's the stuff of legend.
He was doing really advanced work on gene mapping.
We're talking way ahead of his time.
Anyway, last thing I heard, he sold his findings to a huge firm, made a ridiculous amount of money, and then just sort of dropped out of the game entirely.
Every once in a while I come across an article of his in a journal,
consistently brilliant.
Like I said, he's...
A genius.
Yeah, I know.
- Paul, I'm so very sorry.
- Okay, thanks.
Or you go like that.
One...
Oh, ooh!
Can't you see this?
Three, two, one.
The game is live!
- Then all of a sudden...
- I'm right side up!
Wait a second, you're confusing me.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No, I think we should call it Adam.
- Guess who?
- I don't know.
- It's me, Adam.
- I don't think I know an Adam.
I'm your son.
- Ow! Ow!
- The family jewels.
Are we all in?
- Damn, what a handsome group.
- Yep.
- Hi, Mom!
- Adam!
- Hello...
- This hat.
I've never seen you wear this before.
Bad hair day,
I guess.
I've never seen you wear any hat.
All cells are in essence clones...
identical copies of one original cell.
The key to artificially stimulating replication
is in shocking a specialized cell back to its pre-specialized state...
its stem cell precursor...
The cell as it was before it became a liver cell or a brain cell,
or a relatively simpler cheek cell.
Once in this state, the cell's nucleus is immediately transferred
to a mother's enucleated egg.
The transfer completed, the egg cell will then
ideally accept the donor nucleus as its own.
At which point, we let nature take its course.
She did great.
We just need to keep her here until tomorrow to make sure the implant takes.
But she did wonderfully.
She has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and I'll show you around?
She's in good hands.
So, all these people and no one else knows?
The procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.
So, as far as my staff's concerned,
Jessie's being treated as a high-risk in vitro, nothing more.
- Dr. Wells?
- Thanks, George.
There you go.
Riverton's a great town, I think you're really gonna like it here.
It's a bit secluded maybe, but a wonderful community.
Nice people, lots of families... perfect place to raise a child.
So why don't you follow me?
I'll show you around.
Beautiful country, isn't it?
This whole area has a lot of history.
And the house itself is 100 years old at least.
Sorry, there's no furniture.
So I took the liberty of ordering some.
It should be here sometime tomorrow.
What if this didn't work,
Richard?
What if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
- It'll work, Paul.
- You can't say that with any certainty.
Look, no one can say anything with any certainty.
I mean, even a routine pregnancy is fallible.
But if I can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
Her. Jessie.
She's pinned every hope in the world on this.
And I won't let her down, or you.
You have my word on that.
Is this for real?
For now.
I can't believe this place.
Hey.
- Look at this.
- What is that?
Oh my God, Paul.
You know what we could put down here?
Darkroom?
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
Jessie!
Hon? I'm back.
I'm home to our... big home!
Hey!
Hi.
You said we'd never have a party in here.
Come on.
- Come on, come on, push it.
- I can't!
- Yes.
- No, it hurts.
- Yes.
- You're doing fine, Jessie.
You're fully dilated, the head's already crowning, you just need to now push.
- Something's wrong.
- No, nothing is wrong.
Something's wrong,
I'm telling you.
It's coming out. It's fine.
You can see the head.
Keep pushing. Push, push, push.
- Keep pushing, push.
- Good girl.
- Come on, push, push, push.
- Come on, come on.
Oh, there we go, okay.
All right, all right, we're out, we're out.
That's it.
It's okay.
Let me just hear you... let me just hear you scream.
- You did great.
- Come on, come on.
That's great, honey.
He's all right.
It's great.
I just need some breath from him.
He's all right.
Okay, how long?
30 seconds, 31, 32...
33, 34, 35...
- We're gonna have to bag him.
- What's wrong?
- 40 seconds, 41...
- 40...
- Come on, come on.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, thank God.
This is the same as last time, remember?
It's him. You wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here you go, kiddo.
Good night, Adam.
My little boy.
I still think it's a little strange.
Huh-uh.
It's his name.
It's always been his name... Adam.
#... Birthday to you #
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Adam #
# Happy birthday to you! #
There you go, buddy.
Uncle Richard!
Happy birthday, Adam.
Cake, cake, cake!
Cake time! Cake!
So, how's work going?
It's good. It's good... nice kids, bright too.
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like I'm teaching fish to swim... at a Club Med.
You don't still miss your old school?
No, it's more like
I miss missing it.
Uncle Richard, want to help me fly it?
Let's get it up there.
Keep it away from the trees.
So what was this word you said?
Reeservoier.
It's a science word, Uncle Richard.
We've been learning about natural resources in school.
Oh, you mean a "reservoir. "
Well, that's a lot like a lake, only it's a man-made lake.
But I thought God made everything.
Well, in a way He did, if you believe He created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir, right?
- Bye, guys, thank you.
- See you later, Adam!
- Thanks, Paul, see you later.
- Hey, kiddo!
Bye, Adam!
Why don't you come on inside, say goodbye to your friends?
Thank you, Adam.
Bye, Adam!
- Bye.
- Bye, Paul.
Adam!
Bye!
Hey!
Birthday Boy!
How many times
I gotta tell you, you can't leave your toys around?
Somebody's gonna trip and...
For those of us who don't wear helmets in the house...
What you doing?
Where did you get this?
It was a birthday present from Joey Smoyer.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Why don't you get some sleep?
Dad, I've been thinking...
About what?
I don't think I like you so much anymore.
- No...
- Gotcha!
Ohh, somebody is in some very serious trouble.
Where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?
- I'm gonna smother you now.
- Stop it, Dad!
It's just in... some ways, he's so much the same, you know?
But he's still his own person entirely.
And then... look at him.
I honestly forget sometimes, you know?
And then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.
It's okay, it happens to me too.
- I just worry, you know?
- What?
- If he ever found out.
- He won't find out.
What if he did?
About what it would mean to him.
I just love him so much.
Both of you.
Meow!
No!
No! Help!
Adam!
Adam!
It's okay,
I'm right here.
Who are you?
Dad!
- Adam!
- No.
Mom!
Adam?
Oh my God!
Adam!
Ow!
- Jesus, take it easy!
- Go away!
- It's okay, okay!
- No!
- It's okay, take it easy.
- Stay away! Get away!
- Jessie! It's okay.
- Get away from me!
- It's okay! Okay, okay!
- Get off!
- All right! It's okay.
- Get off me.
- Jessie!
- Honey?!
- Ow!
- Oh, God!
- Adam? Adam?
- What happened?
I don't know, he just collapsed.
- Call 911!
- I'm calling Richard.
Richard, thank God.
I want him in a hospital.
Paul, my staff and I can handle this.
Your staff don't even know about this.
They don't need to.
It's the same as always... we're close friends.
You know our arrangement.
Maybe we need to reconsider our arrangement.
It's five hours, he's still unconscious.
His respiration and color are good and he's responding to low-level stimuli.
He's basically just sleeping.
Except for some reason, he's not waking up.
- He seems to have night terrors.
- Night terrors?
It's a sleep disorder.
A child screams in his sleep.
He may sit up, walk, even talk, but all attempts to wake him are futile.
No, no, you weren't there.
This is something entirely different.
All right... hold on a minute.
I know it's scary, but we talked about this... the possibility that things could change once Adam crossed the age at which he died.
Well, it's been eight years.
As of now, he's crossed it.
You said things could change... you never said anything like this.
Because I couldn't have known.
Look, he is the only one, period.
We are and always have been at the mercy of that fact.
Up to this point, we've had a map...
Adam's first eight years.
But now we're entering uncharted territory.
We have no way of knowing who the Adam of age nine, age 10, age 50, is going to be, what problems he may or may not have.
I promise you, there's nothing more a hospital would be doing for him.
What's happening here, Richard?
That's what I'd like to find out.
My feeling is it's probably nothing.
Let's just give it a little time, okay?
Yeah.
The last eight years... no matter how happy
I've been,
I've always had this feeling that somehow we wouldn't get away with this.
Not that someone would find out, just... somehow, we'd lose him again.
We're not gonna lose him.
It's okay, it's okay.
Boo!
- Oh, Adam!
- Oh my gosh!
- Hey.
- But no, no, no... is he all right?
- He's fine.
- You okay?
I'm feeling hungry!
Mommy!
- Come on, kiddo.
- Everything's okay.
This is fantastic, fantastic.
Come on, come on.
- You feel good?
- Ahh!
My God, you slept enough.
- Richard, thank you.
- I'll see you all tomorrow.
Adam, dinner's on.
Jessie, he's not up here.
Adam!
Hey, come on.
Adam!
Hey!
Adam?
Adam? Adam!
Adam?
There you are.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you hear me calling you?
Hey... are you all right?
I'm talking to you.
Adam?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey!
Answer me.
Yes, Daddy?
Did you hear me calling you?
Your dinner is ready.
Go in the house.
No, Paul just said it was kind of a strange moment.
No, he seems fine.
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping... it's probably nothing.
I don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
All right, take care and I'll see you soon.
All right, well, thanks,
Richard. Take care.
I think we should take him to a specialist.
Richard doesn't think it's anything to worry about.
And his word's gospel?
How long are we supposed to live like this?
When does all this gratitude end?
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Bye, Mom.
Anybody know what this is?
It's a big ugly visual aide.
Let's do it like this.
If you think of DNA as a fuse box, each of the genes are either switched on or off, depending on which cell we're talking about.
So that the genes responsible for say the length of Kevin's...
...nose hair wouldn't be much use in his pinky toe.
So what, the gene isn't present?
No, no, it's present, it's just inactive. It's turned off.
It's dead.
You know what?
Why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
I'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.
So pay me and if you don't,
I'll beat the crap out of you for the rest of your life.
How about this? No.
How about... yes! Ha-ha!
What are you going to do about it, huh?
You're a tiny little boy.
What if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?
Listen, maybe it's significant, maybe it isn't,
But the fact remains that any changes in health or behavior
Could have occurred naturally the last time as well.
- These night terrors...
- If that's what they are.
Paul, it's a common sleep disorder.
If there's anything he isn't, it's common.
What do you want me to say, Paul?
That there's something seriously wrong with him?
- You don't think I'm just as concerned?
- No. No, I don't.
You have every right to worry.
But for eight years, we've known what to expect.
Most parents never have the benefit of hindsight.
From now on, neither do we.
- "We"?
- You know what I meant.
Can I get back to my patients, please?
Ever want to have any children of your own, Richard?
Jessie's always saying how great you are with Adam.
- It seems like such a shame.
- Paul, he's your son.
Believe me, I know what he means to you.
But maybe you can keep in mind what he does mean to me.
- Here they come.
- Oh, hey there! There you are.
Why so glum, chum?
There's this new kid,
Roy Hazen, he's always showing off, like how high he goes on the swings and stuff.
- He's a total ass wipe.
- Hey!
Where did you learn that language?
I don't know.
I don't like it.
Get in the car.
Whoa!
- Oh, God!
- Adam.
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Adam!
- I didn't see you.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I didn't see you.
I came so close to hitting you.
Do you know that?
Do you know you could have been killed just now? Do you?
- How many times do I got to tell you...
- Daddy, you're hurting me!
- To keep your bicycle off the street?
- Paul!
What's the matter with you?
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.
You sure?
Hello?
Yeah, I would, actually.
Let me get a pen.
Dr. Lieber?
Okay. In Beauford?
Great.
Sam, I appreciate this.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
Who's that?
Wrong number.
Adam!
Adam?
Adam, open the door.
Open the door, son.
Open the door!
Adam?
Open the door.
God damn it!
Open the door, son.
What... why is the door locked?
- What?
- How... the curtain.
- What?
- The curtain. He was under there.
No, no, no, no, look.
What are you talking about?
- Look, it's fine.
- No, no.
Don't let him hurt me.
Shh, there's nobody going to hurt you.
Look, look, look, it's okay.
Shh, calm down.
It's all right. I think you just had a bad dream.
- No.
- Huh?
- I saw it.
- What?
What did you see?
Adam, talk to me.
Please.
Please, you got to talk to me. I can't help you if I don't know what this is.
I just... I know something.
Okay, what?
What is it?
Something bad is going to happen.
No, it's not.
I'll never let anything bad ever happen to you.
Not to me.
Listen to me, you're my son, you understand that?
Huh?
- Say it.
- I'm your son.
That's right.
We're gonna be okay.
We're going to be okay.
So, how many eggs did you retrieve?
I only retrieved three.
I thought that would be enough...
- Richard, hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
No, it's fine.
- Excuse us.
- Sure.
What's the matter?
You look...
I need to speak with you about something...
I have to stop off at home for some papers.
Why don't I fix us some lunch?
Hey, hey, how would you like that?
I just got an idea.
How about we have a swinging contest?
- Yeah!
- You guys will be the judges.
- We'll make it very fair.
- Yeah.
Ladies first.
Ha ha.
Don't go too high, you'll start crying.
Don't break a nail, oh, no!
Come on, you chicken.
- Oh, what's that for?
- Nasty monkey.
Adam Duncan, you stop that at once!
No spitting.
Come on, come down from there.
Come down.
Come down right now.
No... hey!
Hey...
Adam?
So what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
Or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.
Yeah, well...
Paul is convinced that somehow Adam's cells have...
Retained memories of his first life?
There's an often cited experiment... a rat was trained to run a maze, killed, then ground up and fed to a second rat.
The second rat, when presented with the same maze, completed it in record time, proving that memory lived on in those ingested cells.
It's fascinating, really, also a bunch of nonsense...
an urban legend.
So, it's not possible he's remembering?
No, no.
Thank God.
Frankly, I'm more concerned about Paul's working up these strange theories.
Paul is just having a tough time right now.
It's good.
He's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
No.
You don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
Jessie, that can't happen.
Out here in the middle of nowhere, it's easy to forget the consequences of what we've done.
But if anyone ever found out,
you might never see Adam again.
I know.
I can trust you to rein Paul in?
Yes.
Okay, well, I'll go ahead and see if the auditorium's available.
Right.
Sorry, I just got the message.
They called me at the high school.
Apparently, they couldn't reach you?
- I was out. How's Adam?
- He's fine, Mrs. Duncan.
I have him waiting in my office right now.
I don't know exactly how to say this, but...
his behavior has distanced some of the other children.
And the thing is, he could have seriously injured himself.
Let's go in and see him, okay?
Is that wine on your breath?
- I was having lunch.
- With who?
Why are you so upset?
It was just lunch.
I just wanted to talk to him about Adam.
God, Paul.
Wait, where are we going?
To get a second opinion.
Are you kidding me?
Am I smiling?
About these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
I see it in a number of kids Adam's age.
Scares the bejesus out of the parents, but the kids outgrow it.
As for Adam's recent changes in behavior, well, he's poorly rested...
No, you don't know him.
This is something else.
He won't leave me alone.
- Who?
- Zachary.
Zachary?!
Mr. Duncan, who is Zachary?
Is he a boy in his class?
I don't know.
Honey, who is Zachary?
He's the boy who lives in my dreams.
Talk to me, pal. This boy told you his name was Zachary?
Not really,
I kind of just know.
And you've never seen his face?
He doesn't like to show it, but I know because of his jacket.
What kind of jacket?
Just let him answer.
It's red with white sleeves.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where's who going, Adam?
- Adam?
- Zachary.
Zachary?
- And where are you?
- Where we live.
I don't want to do this.
This is crazy.
According to who?
Richard?
Listen, there's something he's not telling us, Jessie, I know it.
The way he is handling this, the way he stays so close to us.
- He cares about us.
- I don't...
Zachary, Zachary, where are you?
- Tell me about Zachary.
- He's never even known a Zachary.
What are you trying to tell us, Adam? Say it.
Say it!
- That's enough, stop it.
- Tell us what you're trying to say.
If you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
- I don't want to understand it.
- You're dead!
Paul, watch out!
Are you okay?
Honey, you okay?
- Is he all right?
- He's okay.
You're all right, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, kiddo, there you go.
You're home now, all right?
You just go to sleep, all right?
Dad... did I die?
Of course not.
You've been right here with us.
Go to sleep.
Oh my God, that's what this is.
He's remembering his first life in his dreams.
- Kids say things like that.
- A boy? In the city?
Jesus, it's possible.
If certain genes from the cell used in the procedure managed to retain certain memories...
- He's not remembering.
- How can you say that?
Because he can't.
Honey, wake up.
We're at school.
Okay now, I want to see everyone in your family outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
Take your time.
Lots of colors.
And don't forget to write your name on it.
Nice and big. I want to put these up around the classroom.
Beautiful.
You can put pets in your pictures...
dogs and cats.
Have some fun.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Jessie.
I just thought I'd stop by to see how the stuff's doing.
Come in.
Very well. Richard Wells was in yesterday.
He bought this big one and these three small ones on the spot.
That's great.
Excuse me a second.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Richard, hi.
I just thought I'd see how Adam's doing.
Not so well, actually.
He had another night terror last night.
Paul even managed to get him talking this time.
I'm wondering if we can use his ability to vocalize in that state to our advantage.
I don't know.
What would that entail?
Well, for starters, I'd like you to bring him in again.
I'm not sure Paul would be comfortable with that.
But I thought we agreed you're gonna try to rein him in.
- I know we did. I'll talk to him, okay?
- Please do.
I need to go, Richard.
Good bye.
Come on, you guys, let's go!
Come on, you chickens!
Wussies! Let's go!
I'm doing it!
You can too!
Are you afraid of something?
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Jeez, buddy!
Let's go!
Come on, come on!
Come on, I'm doing it!
You can!
What are you, babies?
You want your ba-ba? Let's go!
Who's there?
Oh, no.
Please be okay.
Please don't touch this.
Jessie?
You down there?
- Did you hear me?
- Huh?
- You okay?
- Are you hungry?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Yeah.
You hungry?
Hello?
No, I'm sorry, Tanya, he isn't.
Tanya, slow down.
Hold on, I'll ask him right now. Hold on.
Adam, roy's mother says he hasn't come home from school yet.
- Do you know where he might be?
- No.
Wait, wait, wait.
What were you doing down at the river this afternoon?
Just playing.
With who?
I'm not supposed to say.
Adam, can you answer me?
Go to your room.
Now!
I'm sorry, Tanya, he doesn't know.
Yeah, good luck.
You said Richard mentioned using his ability to vocalize to find out more.
Call him.
We'll bring Adam in tomorrow.
Adam, what's the name of the school?
Can you tell me the name of the school?
Pius...
S- s-street.
Could it be
Saint Pius?
Are you sure this can't hurt him?
It's a mild tranquilizer.
We're just poking around to see what we dig up.
Right Paul?
Yeah.
Adam... is Zachary in there?
In school?
They all are.
They all are.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Z- zachary.
Clark.
Z- zach...
We know this name?
Zachary Clark?
Who is Zachary Clark?
They think I'm him.
Are you him?
Are you Zachary?
Who are you?
They think I'm him.
They think I'm him!
They think I'm him!
They think I'm him!
- No!
- Adam!
- Adam?
- Richard, release him.
- It's hurting him.
- Adam? Wake up.
- Hot! Hot!
- Wake up, honey. Adam?
Goddamn it, do something! Adam?
- Hot! Hot!
- Adam, wake up. Adam?
Zachary?
Honey?
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
You're okay. You're okay.
Hey, why'd you call him Zachary?
Answer me, Richard.
Because he wasn't responding to his own name.
That's bullshit!
I want the truth.
- You set me up!
- It's okay, it's okay.
You needed my okay to push him, but you wanted him pushed. Why?
- Paul, you've gone completely...
- Stop telling me what's wrong with me, and tell me what's wrong with my goddamn son!
Paul...
I wish I could help you.
Adam's changing.
He's getting worse.
Sometimes it's like there's two of him.
He's destructive.
He's tried to harm himself.
The other kids at school are scared of him, Richard.
There's something you're not telling us.
There have been times
I've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
Don't push me, Richard.
Adam's all I care about in the whole world.
I'll go public if I don't get some answers soon, you understand that?
You understand I'll go public?
I'm not kidding.
I swear to God, I'll tell the whole goddamn world what you've done.
What we've done, Paul.
What we've done.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is remembering.
Or maybe it's something else.
Why that name,
Zachary Clark, or the school?
Look, I have tomorrow off,
It's a few hours drive into the city.
- I'm gonna look into it.
- No, Paul, absolutely not.
- If Richard found out...
- He won't. I'll leave in the morning.
- I won't be back until afternoon.
- Paul, no.
Hold on.
No! No!
Let me go! Let me go!
Nooo! No!
My baby!
Let me go! Let me go!
No! My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
No! No! My baby!
Jessie, can I see you? Now?
I told you.
What? It doesn't mean...
You're the one who said he never got along with that boy.
The twins said they saw Roy playing down by the water, that he'd been showing off.
They're all but sure he fell in. You're not?
I'm not sure of anything right now.
No matter what he does, he's still our son.
Do you find that comforting right now?
Huh?
What are you saying?
You wish we'd never done this?
Good night, baby.
Mommy loves you.
You scared me.
It's okay, Mommy.
Shit.
Sorry, there's nothing here.
Are you sure this is the only Saint Pius?
Well, it's the only one in this city.
Like I said, they've been closed for some time now.
What about past student records, like a search by name?
I'm looking for a Zachary Clark.
Well, by name could take a while.
I can wait.
A few weeks?
- Hi.
- Yes?
Sorry to bother you.
My name's Paul Duncan.
I know this sounds crazy, but I'm here about Zachary Clark.
Does that name mean anything to you?
- He's a young child, a boy.
- No, I'm sorry.
What about the previous owners?
Did they have any children?
Melinda.
I'm sorry.
No, there were no previous owners.
My husband and I bought this place about six years ago
when it was just a burnt-down shell.
And he's an architect, so we restored it.
- So, it was just vacant?
- Well, for a few years, yeah.
But I don't know anything about its previous owners.
- Right.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I just...
- I'm sorry to bother you.
Sorry, the nanny... we interviewed quite a few nannies, mostly by phone, but I remember speaking to one who
I could have sworn said she used to work for the family who used to live at this address.
I think that I saved her contact information, if...
Great, thank you.
Cora Williams?
You don't know me, but I need to talk to you.
It's about Zachary Clark.
Come in.
Machine voice:
You have no messages.
Damn it!
I had hoped I'd never hear that name again.
What did he do?
There had been incidents at school.
He never had any friends, used to come home with all sorts of scrapes.
Once they locked him in an empty classroom.
A teacher finally found him, terrified and shaken.
But that was before he started acting up.
Pretty soon, those kids got wise
and just left him alone.
Then there was the fire.
The fire at Saint Pius?
Cora: They never found out how the fire got started, but I knew.
And when Zachary came home,
I asked him about it.
He just gave me this smile.
Adam?
I swear, when I looked into those eyes of his,
I didn't see anything but evil behind them.
I kept my distance.
I was scared of what else he might be capable of...
all these terrible thoughts running through my mind.
It was just the two of us at home that day.
He was taking his bath
when it suddenly became clear to me what I had to do.
He never even heard me come in.
I tried to go through with it.
I swear I tried, but...
I just... I couldn't.
I just couldn't.
When his mother came home,
Zachary didn't say a word about what I'd done.
Are you here?
I was at home the next day,
when I was struck by the most awful premonition.
I hurried right over.
Two blocks away, I could already hear the sirens.
Then I saw all that smoke.
I rushed into the house, blinded by all those flames, praying I wasn't too late.
But you were.
It turned out his mother was already dead by then.
Cora: I remember it was freezing cold that day.
It was always cold in that big house.
Adam?
Cora: So she went down the stairs to the basement,
to check on the water heater.
Are you down there?
And that's where he was...
just waiting for her.
So you're saying
Zachary killed his mother.
He used a hammer he took down from the wall.
And when he was done, he set a fire.
Then he went upstairs
and finished playing.
That's where they found his body.
Where was his father?
Oh, he was at the hospital like always.
The hospital, he was a doctor?
A baby doctor, yeah.
Only, he seemed more like a scientist to me.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Goddamn it!
Are you home? Jessie?
Pick it up if you're there, please.
Listen, I gotta talk to you right away, it's important.
Call me as soon as you get this.
I love you.
Adam?
Honey, you shouldn't have opened that.
You shouldn't have touched that box.
Adam?
Is this me?
Honey, let me explain.
Adam.
Zachary.
What?!
I need to speak with Richard Wells.
I'm sorry, but Dr. Wells is at the Hazen funeral today.
A funeral where?
Honey, don't be scared. It's okay.
I'm right here.
Just be careful, okay?
What was that?
Honey...
Mommy?
Adam, where are you?
Adam?
Adam can't come out to play right now, Mrs. Duncan.
Wait.
Wait!
Let me explain.
Adam.
You couldn't use him, could you?
Zachary.
You couldn't use him.
Maybe it never even occurred to you to try.
No, it occurred to me.
But the fire destroyed him, right?
You didn't even have a viable cell.
His genetics I could salvage, but it was no more than pieces of a map.
I saved what I could, but after that...
I was this close to perfecting the procedure, you can't possibly fathom that kind of torture.
To have this knowledge, this power, and know there's nothing more you can do about it.
But you did do things about it, Richard.
Once you had Adam's cell, you could preserve his physical characteristics and manipulate certain genes... intangibles, like cognition, personality, his memory.
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Except for one thing.
There was no way to predict the results.
I could only wait and hope for a glimpse of him, the mere indication that something had lived on.
Lived on?
Do you have any idea what you've done to my son?! To my family?
I'd think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing. I just wanted him back.
You experimented with a human life!
So did you.
So did your wife.
No, I would say there's a huge difference...
Is there, Paul? Do you think you can just open Pandora's Box and then just close it again?
We trusted you, goddamn it!
We had no way of knowing.
What you did goes way beyond...
Beyond what?
Societal standards?
You name me a single medical advancement that didn't.
Tell me something.
If I'm not supposed to do this, Paul, then how is it that I can?
Because you're a scientist.
Only this isn't about science or evolution... it's about moral trespass, about your ignoring what's right and wrong.
And what about you, Paul?
Have you trespassed?
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe this is my punishment for wanting something that I never should have had.
And if that's the case, then so be it.
But believe me when I tell you,
I'm gonna do everything in my power to save my child and see that you pay for what you've done.
- Paul...
- No, this is over, you understand?
We're gonna go to the police, and then we're gonna find someplace, anyplace that can help him.
- You're not going anywhere...
- Like hell I'm not!
That was an experiment.
That experiment failed.
We can always terminate and try again.
Terminate?
That's my son you're talking about.
Our son! He's yours because I gave him to you.
You stay away from him!
You hear me?
You stay away!
You were lucky to have him as long as you did.
You had nothing when I found you.
I gave you a child, a house, a job.
Anything in your life that you value, I provided.
You remember that, you... you ungrateful piece of shit!
Why, why, why didn't he listen?
Adam!
Adam?
Are you in here?
Adam, where are you?
Let go.
Let go of the axe.
Adam.
Adam.
Yes, Daddy?
Who are you?
Who are you right now?
I'm your son.
Come on, Max, throw it.
Throw it, come on.
Man:
Goes upstairs.
All right, if you guys can paint that out by Thursday, that'd be great.
- Mr. Duncan, that's gonna look great.
- Great.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
These are going downstairs.
Go, go, go!
Hey, how do you like your new room?
It's not finished yet.
Hey, kiddo, look...
It's a big change, we know.
But those doctors you've been working with, they all say this change could be really good for you, right?
Sweetie, you've been doing so great.
And I bet... in a new town, with new friends, you're gonna do even better.
I know.
Mrs. Duncan?
Coming.
Hey...
I got three boxes downstairs
And they're all labeled...
"Toys. "
How about you give me a hand unpacking 'em?
Yeah?
Man:
Where would you like these?
Oh, careful with that, it's going downstairs.
Hey, kiddo,
I thought you were...
Adam?
Ahh! God!
I thought you were coming down.
Are you all right?
You'd tell me if there was anything...
Nothing's wrong, Daddy.
I'm fine.
All right.
Trust me.
This is gonna be great for us.
Hey.
It's a place we can start all over.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural. None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?!
You never know.
Sam. My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
...but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lembas bread. And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves. The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
...haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us! Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
...to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on...
...on the precious.
Gollum. Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
...on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey! Come back now! Come back!
There! What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry? Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water. Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See? I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it? What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food. No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
...and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
...and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain! Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
...is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
...and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing. That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
...until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
...and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
...talk to each other...
...even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful...
...a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
...what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
...and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
...into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees. Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
...because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
...and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See? See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.
I found it. I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place. It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished! Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us...
...it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead. All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes. Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
...and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.
Gollum. Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide! Hide!
Come on, Frodo. Come on!
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them. No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
...and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire...
...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy...
...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back...
...until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
...at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
...in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming...
...quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas...
...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
...and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head
How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest...
...near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning...
...we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it...
...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...
...in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed...
...and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed? Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No! No, master!
They catch you! They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No! There's another way.
More secret. A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes. There's a path...
...and some stairs.
And then...
...a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then...
...you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something... Treeish.
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back. Merry!
What's happening?!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die? No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
...whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
...he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
...to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
...in the bitter watches of the night...
...when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
...still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
...Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
...Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
...in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
...son of Thengel...
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
...from the spell.
You have no power here...
...Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
...you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
...if they grasped your sword.
I've only...
...ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord! No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
...to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
...but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
...Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
...the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves...
...but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell...
...for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable. He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
...the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
...what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine! My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
No. Not master.
Yes, precious. False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening. I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me. We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
...and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone! Gone! Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look. See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender. They are nice.
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
...behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters? Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
...and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait! We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is...
...where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there...
...in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway, we have a multiple vehicle...
multiple injury accident.
An absolute mess from VineStreet to the valley.
If you're in it, expect a long commute.
If you're not, seek alternate routes.
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate, we can talk about a weekly rate.
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation... as the host of this country's number-one... nationally syndicated talk show to do a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.
I mean, why can't these guys write me a fuckin' decent part?
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.
By the way, did you talk to Cathy about that Navy SEAL script?
Hang on a sec.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.
Wait a minute. I know your voice.
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.
I think he's got a really sexy voice.
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.
You got me. Look, I've...
I've got someone on the other line.
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.
So, um, why don't you tell me who you are?
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?
I know you do.
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.
Let's come in for a closer look.
She's very pretty, Cotton.
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.
Speaking of which, let's play a little game.
Answer right, your girlfriend lives.
Answer wrong, she dies.
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?
Somebody who'd kill to know where Sidney Prescott is!
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!
- You just hit me!
- Move!
Christine, if you're there, pick up the phone!
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls...
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!
Shit! Shit!
Cotton, is that you?
Cotton?
Honey?
Okay, Cotton.
You know I don't like your Stab games.
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?
Hon, you all right?
- I'm home.
- Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.
- You're not gonna believe what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?
I was... I was just, you know, trying to take the game to the next level.
- I'm sorry. Come on, open the door, Chris.
- The game?
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much fun it's gonna be to rip your insides out!
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!
Christine?
Hon?
The recent epidemic of roadrage in Los Angeles.
- Innocent commuters mercilessly terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?
- By these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?
We're gonna make them confront their victims face-to-face, mano a mano...
right here on 100% Cotton.
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.
L.A. drivers fight back.
The news is next on channel six with our exclusive entertainment report live...
from tonight's celebrity premiere in Hollywood...
followed by...
Oh, shit.
Chris?
Is that you, babe?
Chris, if you're in there, open the door. Okay, honey?
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.
Stay back.
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.
Gimme the club, please.
Christine, get outta the way!
Behind you!
Shit!
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.
Now, you lose.
Come on.
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Cherokee.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting to work. Can you patch me in?
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?
No, you don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
- How can I help?
- Um...
I'm 18 years old, and I have a boyfriend.
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.
So, in closing, as the future journalists of America... there is one thing that you need to remember.
Being the best means being willing to do what the others would not.
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.
Be willing to have the world hate you, because that is the only way... that you'll get the story, the facts and the fame.
Thank you.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?
So you're saying that we should be ready to go out... and cut each other's throats because that's what you did.
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.
Thank you very much!
There is a young man outside who wants to see you.
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.
I assume you're not here for an autograph.
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.
Someone who left something he wanted us to see.
I'll show you this because you're the Woodsboro authority and because you knew him.
But I promise you, if you share this with the world, it's you I'll be arresting.
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?
Oh, my God.
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.
Hollywood is reeling today from news...
of the murder of controversial talkshow host Cotton Weary.
Weary had only recently finished shooting a cameo as himself...
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...
the third and final part of the famous horror series...
based on the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders.
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...
and was later exonerated for the murder of Maureen Prescott, his former lover...
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was shooting here at Sunrise Studios...
his first cameo in a feature film, Stab 3.
Security here is tight, but we'll see if we can get a statement. Excuse me.
Always a controversial man...
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.
No press beyond this point.
Alone at night he crosses flames
Ashe makes a fist with his red right hand
Look, you're worried about the movie, then protect the movie, okay?
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard. Just don't kill the movie.
Violence in cinema is a big deal right now, Roman.
This is not the kind of news this studio is after.
So if we stop making scary movies, what?
All the psychos in the world will retire? Come on.
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.
Detectives, there's no reason to presume that Cotton's death... had anything to do with this movie, is there?
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.
Probably some psycho fan pissed off they killed Randy in Stab 2.
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next, wouldn't it?
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.
Named Ricky, who works at the video store.
It's an homage.
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?
I mean, what the hell ever happened to her? She's probably off in the woods... livin' like the fuckin' Unabomber, man.
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer didn't want to come back.
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.
"We are not in any danger," says Candy, page 15.
I don't see you leavin'.
You think serious black actors my age can just throw away jobs?
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.
Not meant to be? You win that talent search for the new Sidney.
50,000 girls and they pick you. You gotta be praying this movie keeps going.
Of course I am, but not at the expense of people's lives.
Oh. Cue the violins, right?
Jesus.
Deja voodoo.
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.
L... Listen, l-l... I know we've never met... and I don't mind you never returning my calls, but I have to tell you... after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.
Well, that would explain my constant headaches.
You know, I'm sorry things didn't work out on 60 Minutes II.
- But Total Entertainment, that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt... but being single, that's a pretty good fallback.
Gives me more time for my work.
After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character.
Oh, and to be played by an actress with such depth and range.
Uh, Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to...
Gale.
Dewey.
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate my character work in this one.
- Someone's helped me understand the real you.
- Someone?
Your ruthless ambition, your private self-loathing... and that lost and lonely little girl inside.
Lost and lonely what?
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.
Lost and lonely what?
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were supposed to be in Woodsboro.
Well, I'm surprised you thought about me at all.
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.
The movie needed a technical advisor.
Someone who went through the real experience, knew the real people.
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.
Real from top to bottom.
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.
You're so right. Pop culture is the politics ofthe 21 st century.
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did... last month on me crashing my car?
- Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
- Right, uh...
I especially liked the way you implied that it was caused by drinking and drugs.
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.
Tom, sometimes in journalism you have to...
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure... that nobody's messed with your brake line.
Who's he supposed to be?
He's playing you? Him?
What?
I did not come here to fight with you, Dewey.
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?
Listen, Sidney doesn't need you and your camera in her life.
Do you see a camera?
Right. You bought me this purse, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.
- I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
- What the hell is this?
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.
Now, does anybody need a potty break?
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?
It's happening again.
Cotton had a lot of enemies, Sid.
The police aren't saying it's related to us.
Do you ever think about her?
Your mom?
None of this would've ever happened if she hadn't... if she hadn't...
Why'd she have so many secrets, Dad?
Listen, maybe it's time you came home.
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here by yourself. You never see anyone.
The only people you talk to don't even know your real name.
It's as if you don't exist.
That's the idea. Psychos can't kill what they can't find.
Sid, come here.
Mother needs to talk to you.
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!
You're poison.
You're just like me.
You're just like me.
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?
They'll do it to you.
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?
Roman?
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.
Roman?
Someone here?
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?
Look, everyone in the office has gone home already.
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.
Oh, shit!
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just lookin' at your music video awards.
Since I got you on thephone, let's... let's talk about your character, okay?
What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.
I'm not happy that I have to die naked.
And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid to have a gun in the house... after her boyfriend's been cut into fish sticks.
Great, okay.
So let's... let's run the lines.
Fine.
Page28.
Candy's big moment.
Page 28.
Ring-ring.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.
See? I don't understand why I have to start the scene in the shower.
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?
Why don't we just read the scene?
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?
Whatever.
Come on.
Who is this?
I think you have the wrong number.
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman, that's not the line.
It is in my script.
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck... are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.
- What? What movie?
- My movie.
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!
Still in character, Sarah?
Shit.
Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.
If you'd like today's commissary menu, press one.
Mr Bridger?
If you'd like to hear previews of upcoming Sunrise Pictures'releases...
press four.
If you'd like information about
Sunrise Pictures' merchandise...
- Come on. Come on.
- Press five.
If you're trying to reach Lot Security or you have an emergency, press six.
Shit!
Oh! Fuck!
Look, I wanna get something straight.
I only got into this because the police asked for my help.
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write... the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.
I'm sure you just can't wait to write another one.
- What about you?
- What about me?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."
But now you're here.
Not with me.
Dewey, I took care ofyou.
I waited until you were well, but I couldn't stay there.
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.
- I couldn't say no. I could've been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
- Well...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second-rate K-Mart... straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?
- Off the record?
- Always.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman... who said she was with Stab 3.
She wanted to see the file on Sid, "for research."
- And?
- The boys said no.
And she wouldn't give her name.
A month later, the station gets broken into.
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?
I already removed it.
I think someone on the film is tryin' to find Sid.
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."
Right.
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.
- Jennifer?
- Gotta run.
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.
Stop following me.
I happen to be working for the police, damn it!
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want a picture, they want a conversation.
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.
- Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.
Like I'm ever going to win an award playing you.
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?
- At the studio.
- Where? Nancy Drew wants to know where.
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?
Someone's killing them in the order they die in the movie.
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?
You do.
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?
I have to get something from my trailer.
Your...
You live here with her?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
I needed a place to stay, and she said she liked having me around.
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned with pretensions and appearances... you'd be able to appreciate the positivity and emotional centeredness...
I provide a woman.
Stone, I'm headed to the crime scene.
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?
Just so it can be straight. I'm the professional celebrity guard here.
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.
'Cause you're just no good as a cop any more.
Your resume reads like the obituaries.
So how about you take suggestions from me? All right?
Whatever you say.
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.
Ten more murders and we can publish a calendar.
The old "killer playing with the cops" routine.
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.
Doesn't the killer come after the cops in those movies?
Usually one cop makes it.
- And?
- One cop doesn't.
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.
Terminal Entertainment, this is a crime scene, okay?
Wallace, Miss Weathers is working with me now.
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased police presence around Jennifer?
- She's the next one to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.
And besides, the producers told us that there were three different versions of the script.
Something about trying to keep the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.
You're the technical advisor, right?
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.
And we don't know which one the killer read.
Hey, hold up.
All I ever wanted to do was make a real classic lovestory.
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do a scary movie for them first.
And now we're shut down, and I am fucked!
God, it's not the end of the world, Roman.
That is so easy for you to say. You can always go back to, to MustSee TV.
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it looks like I'm now the next target.
- What?
- You? Why you?
Do you think this wasn't a message?
- Roman Bridger?
- What?
Mr Bridger, you didn't tell us... you spoke with Sarah Darling before she was murdered.
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?
The guard said she was here for a meeting with you.
- What meeting? I don't...
- We talked with her roommate too.
Says you called Sarah, told her to come down to the studio.
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.
Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr Bridger.
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.
Someone wants to kill my movie!
All right, we'll talk about your movie down at the station.
- All right.
- This is the scene where you come with us.
Dewey, Jennifer...
Wait a minute.
She wasn't talking with me on the phone. I'm coming!
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley, do you have a cell phone I can borrow?
Yeah.
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.
Remind me not to sleep with him again.
Come here, Cherokee.
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.
Okay, well, whatever it is, you can tell me.
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.
- Well, then, um...
- I did.
Then the people you need to call are the police.
No, I need to call you!
Just you.
I'm sorry, your-your voice...
Don't you wanna know how you can help, Laura?
Are you listening to me?
Huh?
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.
Now, be a good girl and turn on the news.
Do as Mother tells you!
You're not my mother. How did you get this number? Who is this?
You know your mother's voice when you hear it!
Now, turn on the news!
And with a second cast member murdered, Stab 3...
has been officially shut down, prompting those involved...
to hope and pray that these killings maybe over.
Just one question.
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?
The sky was dark this morning
Not a bird in a tree
Is this a wrap party or is this a wrap party?
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.
Scenes 40 through 47.
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.
Scaring you?
Give the sweet, young ingenue act a rest.
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.
I bet she fought and clawed for that Sidney part.
I bet she stepped on any poor girl that got in her way.
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.
Right.
Come on, Dewey.
Scene 50.
"Dewey Saves the Day."
She's so focused on success that she never thinks... about who she's hurting to get it.
And you saved her life, like, how many times?
Gale wants the whole world to love her.
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.
- No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
- No, she's not.
She's got a good heart.
She does.
She just hides it away because she thinks people see that as weak.
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.
God, Dewey.
You make it sound like you're still in love with her.
And I left out the part that she's cruel... and selfish, obsessive and annoying.
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.
Hey, Dewdrop, got your girlfriend out here.
Look who I found slinkin' around the yard. The nightly news.
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.
You were eaves dropping at the bedroom window.
Yeah, a bedroom that you seemed awfully at home in.
All right, let's talk.
Come on.
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?
Sarah's call didn't come from his cell phone.
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought, so I checked it out.
I cannot find any information about her at this age. I mean, nothing.
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.
Almost her whole life.
Two years before... she met Sidney's father, she left Woodsboro.
No one has any idea where she went or what she did.
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!
- So?
- So?
Why is the killer leaving pictures of-of Maureen?
And why these pictures at-at... at that point in her life?
I don't know! If I thought like a homicidal maniac... then I'd know how a homicidal maniac thinks.
What?
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer?
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.
Steven Stone
Protection Services.
Stone, where are you?
I'm just checking your tin can, Dewdrop.
Well, come back inside and stay with Jennifer.
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?
I'm just checking to make sure there's no killer in here... waitin' to off you like he did your little sister.
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.
That makes me... angry!
Fucker!
Gotta call Kincaid.
Dewey, where is everybody?
- Oh, God.
- Jennifer?
Angelina?
Tom?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.
Dewdrop?
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God, Stone!
Oh, God!
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.
Everyone back inside!
It's all right.
Don't panic.
Okay, outside. Everyone, stay together and try to remain calm.
A phone!
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.
Shit!
It's the fax.
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living room, night." It's a script page.
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death, the five stand trapped.
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside... suddenly the fax machine sends news of their fates."
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!
- Outside where he can pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!
"The killer prepares to grant mercy to only one of them."
Don't you get it? The killer says he's outside because he wants us here inside.
- Which one is it?
- Come on!
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?
- The killer will give mercy to..."
- Everyone outside!
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.
- What's it say?
- "And the... killer will give mercy to...
- whoever..."
- Whoever?
Whoever?
Piece of shit.
"Whoever...
Whoever smells the..."
I can't stop rolling down the hill!
Gale! Jennifer!
- Dewey!
- Dewey!
Dewey, where are you?
Over here, Dewey!
- Dewey!
- Gale!
Gale, behind you!
Dewey!
Are you all right?
Yeah, never been better.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.
Is he back there?
- No.
- No?
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Thanks for saving me.
Ah, it's habit.
Oh, God.
What the fuck happened to you?
- Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?
- Who are you supposed to be protecting?
- Jennifer!
Hey!
My lawyer liked that.
Not as much as I did.
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?
Wait a second!
Another picture.
Whoever it is is now taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.
- I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken... you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.
She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother.
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.
Sidney might know something.
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain... why there are three dead celebrities and a bodyguard.
And a very angry mayor.
Okay, look, we all know this has something to do with Stab 3.
But what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving pictures... of Maureen Prescott taken over 25 years ago.
And the photographs taken at the same studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you, and he was married to Maureen.
What's your problem?
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?
Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.
Why don't we compare our gun calibres later?
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.
And either Mr Riley is going to obstruct justice or he's going to put me in touch with her.
So, where is she?
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're... okay.
- Sid!
- Dewey!
What are you doing down here?
Actually, what was I doing up there?
- Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.
It'd take a direct hit.
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.
I'm no more safe there than I am here, and at least here I'm not alone.
Okay, come on.
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.
There's someone here who wants to help.
Oh, my God.
Sidney.
Is the man fast or what?
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
- The killer called her.
- What? When?
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
He could have monitored her calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
- No.
- Do you have her number stored in your memory?
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
- Just Jennifer.
And you.
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.
The killer leaves a photograph after each murder, Sidney.
They were taken in Hollywood at the same studio that they're shooting Stab 3.
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.
Something to, you know, trick you out of hiding.
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot like publicity stills.
I, uh, don't know.
Detective, I wanna see this place in the pictures.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.
Watch the fuckin' aliens.
I'm gonna go talk to the studio brass about those photos.
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.
You're gonna get her some flowers and candy, huh? Huh?
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.
Just keep your eye on her.
That stairwell over there, that's where one of the pictures was taken.
God. I can't believe she never mentioned any of this.
- She probably just...
- Dewey!
- Sorry.
- Martha!
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.
We do?
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.
Told ya I'd make a movie someday. Huh?
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...
it means, as I feared, I did not survive these killings...
here at Windsor College, and that giving up my virginity...
to Karen Kolchakat the video store was probably not a good idea.
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?
We were workin'late. We were puttin' away some videos in the porno section...
and, you know, shit happens.
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.
I'm leaving my legacy.
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...
the reason I'm here is to help you so that my death will not be in vain.
That my life's work will help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.
If this killer does come back and he's for real...
there are a few things that you gotta remember.
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...
with an unexpected back-story and ap reponderance...
of exposition, then the sequel rules do not apply.
Because you're not dealing with the sequel. You are dealing with...
the concluding chapter of a trilogy.
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's a rarity in the horror field...
but it does exist, and it is a force to be reckoned with.
Because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning...
and discovering something that wasn 't true from the get-go.
Godfather, Jedi, all revealed something...
that we thought was true that wasn 't true.
So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with...
here are some super trilogy rules.
One: You've got a killer who's gonna be superhuman.
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.
Basically, in the third one, you've gotta cryogenically freeze his head...
decapitate him or blowhim up.
Number two: Anyone, including the main character, can die.
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs by the time this thing is through.
Number three: The past will come back to bite you in the ass.
Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it.
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...
were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you.
So in closing, let me say...
goodluck, Godspeed...
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.
'Cause the rules say some of you ain't gonna make it. I didn't.
Not if you're watching this tape.
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.
You be careful too, Sid.
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.
Why don't you try to figure out where those other pictures were taken.
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.
Oh, shit.
Hello!
- Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.
I've got no house, no bodyguard, no movie, and I'm being stalked.
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.
That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you.
And since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.
- Make sense?
- None.
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.
For you, that must be quite a stretch.
- That's funny.
- Ha!
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Bitch. All right, wait. Just...
Don't tell me what to do.
Basements, wow.
Basements creep me out.
You'd make a fascinating interview.
Hello?
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers... and I'm here researching with the police this photo.
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.
Back then it was probably Roberts.
- Hey, are you...
- No.
- But you look just...
- Like her?
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up a-a sore subject for you.
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.
So, how can I help you? Or do you want me to tell you who you look like?
How about some information on Maureen Roberts?
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.
Really? Well, would you work for... the president?
The president of the studio.
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?
It's worth two grand.
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?
I know every face in here.
I got a respect for the unknown actor.
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts, they're never gonna find her.
Rina Reynolds they will.
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.
You should talk, Judy Jurgenstern.
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.
Horror pictures back in Milton's heyday.
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
- John Milton.
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.
Come on, Sid.
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.
I mean, I was.
I-I thought... Well, if there's no movie... then no one would care if I took some souvenirs.
Souvenirs?
I may never win another role, so these may be... my only memories, you know, of Hollywood.
I-I know it's weird 'cause it's your life and all, but...
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.
The real Sidney.
The real person.
I wish...
I wish it would've worked out.
Hey...
Angelina?
Hello?
Close call.
What are you doing here?
It occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
See what you do to me?
What have I done to you?
About the, uh, sex stuff?
You know, I'm not trying to rush you at all.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Dewey!
Dewey!
Sidney, I'm in here.
Over here.
Yes. Mother will protect you from the bogeyman.
Come into the bedroom.
Hide in Mommy's bed.
I lied, Sidney.
I can't protect you at all.
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...
who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone.
'Cause let's face it, Sidney, your mother was no Sharon Stone.
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss and we'll make up.
- No!
- Sidney!
Sid!
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.
- And my mother...
- Let's go, let's go.
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.
You weren't supposed to go in that house.
It's all set up for the murder scene.
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.
There's nobody up here.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.
Whatever. I didn't know you got the gas chamber for that.
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.
- You took the mask or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.
We're gonna take you back to the station, keep you under watch.
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.
Come on.
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.
- Horror movies.
- Wanna know who produced all three?
- Who?
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they... did they kill the film, but they killed my cast.
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work with me. Variety called me a pariah.
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone have killed the cast from Stab 1?
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What... John, what did we do wrong?
Hollywood is full of criminals whose careers are flourishing.
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.
- That's good for your mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?
Roman. John.
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut the cake without me.
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.
Shut the doors behind you, please.
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?
Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.
I remember. She was a bit player in a couple of my movies.
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.
You have made millions off the story of her murder.
You're obsessed with her, and you're obsessed with her daughter!
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.
The studio came to me with Stab.
They came to me.
Check it out.
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.
I mean, as Rina.
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.
- That would make me a suspect.
- Just because you knew her?
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.
Just what did happen to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.
How would you like to see it dug up on national TV?
Why don't you tell me what happened?
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts... if they made the right impression.
Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite... in one way or another no matter what she said afterwards.
- Are you saying she...
- I'm saying things got out of hand.
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is... this is not the city for innocents.
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...
Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?
You gotta play the game, or go home.
What do you know about trilogies?
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is that in the third one... all bets are off.
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me... on the ones that deal with the business.
I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Huh.
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me, Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
I'm a homicide detective, remember?
And when you see what I see day in and day out... the violence that people do to each other... you get haunted.
I think you know about that.
What do you mean?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't go away.
To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not.
Watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.
Can't arrest ghosts.
But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.
You're here, you're not hiding.
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.
What did you know about your mother?
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.
Perfect family.
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um...
She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and, um... soon as I thought that I had, more secrets.
I don't know who my mom was.
You know who she was to you.
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.
- How is that good news?
- Because that means... that we're dealing with an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.
- And I know how to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?
Catch him or kill him.
Hey, Detective.
What's your favourite scary movie?
My life.
Mine too.
We have to think.
Strategize.
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.
We're gonna go back to the precinct and we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney... what we found out.
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.
- My Gale would...
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said he had something to tell me.
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.
- We're on our way, but still, Sid...
- Thanks.
- What?
- Looks like we're going to that party after all.
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.
Yeah, well, actually, we're here to see Sidney.
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.
God, this house is incredible.
- It's old Hollywood.
- Yeah. Could the dude have more money?
Supposedly, Milton has a secret screening room... that was like the scene back in the '70s, you know.
It was, like, drinks and drugs and girls and movies and shit.
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.
Big old screening room shouldn't be too hard to find.
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go check this place out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.
And you want to go traipsing around this gigantic mansion?
Have you ever actually seen the Stab movies? Every time... this dude enters a room, he ends up a goddam shish kebab.
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.
- You're not stickin'. Wait up.
- We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.
We'll be right back!
If-lf you were a screening room... where would you be?
I bet in the basement.
I don't like basements.
Ooh, it's spooky.
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy... and he's gonna jump outta his screening room with a sling blade or something?
- He won't.
- You sure about that?
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.
You know, what you look like without make-up, Jennifer.
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!
Roman?
Roman?
- Any sign of her?
- No.
This is so strange.
It sure is.
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
On your cell phone?
- Yeah.
- All right, use it and-and press "send."
What the hell?
What is this thing?
Is this what he...
What the hell?
Dewey, he's got our voices.
He's got Sid.
He's got us all.
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.
All right, take the gun.
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.
- Be careful.
- You too.
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?
- Roman!
- Tyson!
Angelina!
Damn it!
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3 is back in production.
Roman!
Jennifer!
Jennifer!
Roman!
Jennifer!
Roman?
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.
Dewey! Dewey!
Dewey?
Dewey!
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?
- Come on.
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!
Listen to me!
I did not fuck that pig Milton to get a leading role... just to die here with second-rate celebrities like you two!
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.
It's crazy to still be here.
- Wait!
- Come on!
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.
- We'll be safer if we stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why...
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!
- Hey!
- Dewey!
Dewey!
No!
Help! Police!
Help! Help!
Police! Help!
Oh, you motherfucker!
Damn!
Dewey! Dewey!
Behind the mirror, Dewey!
Gale! Get away! Dewey!
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.
You can't kill me. I'm the killer in Stab 3. I'm the killer!
Gale, cover!
Dewey!
- Tyson!
- Tyson!
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.
Okay.
Tyson!
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.
Dew...
Gale!
Gale!
Gale!
- Dewey?
- Gale!
Gale!
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.
Gale, where are you?
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.
Hurry.
Wait. How do I know this is you, Gale, and not the killer?
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.
Well, don't you think that's what the killer would say?
Come on. He's out cold at the bottom of the stairs.
Hey!
Dewey. Dewey.
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?
Hey, Morgan, what did you pay?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.
I only hear you too, Sidney.
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.
The question is:
Who's with me?
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!
Don't do it. If you do one thing to attract attention to yourself...
one thing,
I'll kill them both.
Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.
Oh, it's hard being friends with you, Sidney.
When you're friends with Sidney, you die.
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.
- How do I know their voices are...
- Are real?
How do you know you're not hearing things?
How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere you know.
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!
- Or do you?
- You're dead.
I don't want them.
I want you.
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!
Don't you wanna know, Sidney, who killed her?
Don't you wanna know who killed your mother?
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Holy shit.
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.
Now, welcome to the final act.
See that metal detector?
Use it.
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
The other leg too.
Show it to me.
Throw it in the pool.
Now, come inside, Sidney.
No fucking way. How do I know they're not dead already?
They're right inside, waiting for you.
Look for yourself.
Now that we're all here, the party can begin.
- Dewey.
- Sid.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He's right there!
Oh, shit.
Think again.
It's your turn to scream, asshole.
Yeah!
- It's okay. Just give me a second.
- Okay.
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?
Where is he?
Be careful!
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.
Tyson said there was a party here tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.
Alone?
Where's your partner?
Hey, Miss Prescott.
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
No!
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!
- Wake up!
- Sidney!
Sid, shoot him! Sid!
Shoot the fucker!
Shoot him!
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.
Run!
Sid.
Sid.
Come in here, please.
It's just me, Sid.
Oh, I was so pretty.
Everybody loved me.
Have you missed me, Sidney?
Would you like to hold me one last time?
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?
Don't you remember your mother?
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.
It's time you came to terms with me and with Mother.
Maybe you never knew her at all, Sidney.
Maybe you just can't get past the surface of things.
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.
I searched for a mother too, an actress named Rina Reynolds.
Tried to find her my whole life.
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.
Knocked at her door, thinking she'd welcome me with open arms.
But she had a new life and a new name: Maureen Prescott.
You were the only child she claimed, Sidney.
She shut me out in the cold forever.
Her own son.
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child... and Rina was dead.
And it struck me.
What a good idea!
So I watched her.
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.
It seems Maureen...
Mom...
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.
Everybody knew about that.
But Billy's father?
That was the key.
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my film too much.
He didn't like it at all.
But once I supplied the motivation, all the kid needed was a few pointers.
Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame.
It was like he was making a movie.
You. This is all because ofyou.
I'm a director, Sid.
- I direct.
- Oh.
I had no idea that they were gonna make a film of their own.
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?
I mean, introducing Sidney, the victim.
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.
Let's go.
Fine, you got what you wanted, hero and villain face-to-face.
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.
Here he is, the man who gave away your mother's innocence.
Huh? What he did to her made her a slut.
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from that night, right here in this room.
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.
Ruined yours too, didn't it, Sid?
You hate him, Sid?
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!
That's what the police are gonna find on Milton's answering machine... right next to his lifeless, mutilated corpse.
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.
- Final cut!
- I already have it.
No!
God! You spineless bastard!
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.
Living in total isolation, the pressure ofanother movie about you... the discovery that Milton destroyed Mommy dearest... you finally just snapped!
One, two, three!
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one... who bravely faced down the psychopath and killed her with her own knife?
You're gonna pay for the life you stole from me, Sid.
For the mother, and for the family, and for the stardom and...
Goddam it! Everything you have that should've been mine!
God! Why don't you stop your whining and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take some fucking responsibility?
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
Sid? Sidney?
Sidney?
Sidney!
Sidney!
Leave her alone!
Dewey, do something!
- Stand back!
- Dewey!
Sid! Sid.
Sid?
Where is he?
Hey. Lose something?
Found something.
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!
- Dewey!
- Down this way. There's another hallway.
There's another door down here.
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.
- Go that way.
- Okay!
I shot you.
I guess we think alike.
Mother's dead.
And there is nothing you can do about that.
I still got to make my movie.
Stab 3, right?
Kincaid, hang in there.
Roman? It was Roman?
Be careful, Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Yeah, well, he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.
He wasn't superhuman at all.
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?
Head!
Shoot him in the head.
Thanks.
No problem.
Look.
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.
Look.
What are you doing with that?
Um, will you sign it for me, Gale?
You hate that book.
Besides, I'm-I'm done with that kind of reporting.
For me.
Will you sign it for me?
You're a nut.
Okay.
- Will you?
- Dewey.
I know it'll never work, and you know it'll never work.
But what I'm asking is just to see ifwe're wrong.
We don't know everything, Gale.
I mean, you thinkyou do, but...
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.
I'm really scared right now.
Inside.
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Now, spread your wings and fly
Don't the lights of the city look so damn pretty
When you're flyin' so high
It's hard to know about there down below
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood
It seems to make me groan and cry
You really wanna know what's wrong with this land
Just scratch your head with your red right hand
I'm talkin'about blood, babe
It's in your veins
Your mommy and daddy
They've got the same
You're under the mirror day after day
You see a pretty face crumblin' away
As you become your mom and daddy
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again
Cover that face with your red right hand
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
Well as though we rise
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh, the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow
Now it'sgone
Now it'sgone
Now it'sgone
So, is this the end
Forus, my friend
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away
Hitched on a rocket ride into the sun
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California
Just take a look around at all you've done
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away
So I found a holiday behind the sun
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood
Hit up on a climate everyone
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
You could save the world
Could be shining on my pearl
You could save the world
Just might find your way mypearl
Shine
Shine
You're automatic like a burnin' gun
You're a star like everyone
You could save the world
Could be shinin' on my pearl
You could save the world
Could be shinin' on my pearl
You could save the world
Just might find your way my pearl
Shine
Shine

{1796}{1832}This one was thrown from the car.
{1834}{1849}I can't move!
{1850}{1913}Caucasian male, mid-thirties.
{1916}{1990}Open wrist fracture,|massive head trauma.
{2003}{2050}I'm not getting a pulse here.

{6976}{7012}How can you|listen to that stuff?
{7014}{7054}"Cutting up my ho".
{7057}{7083}It's just words.
{7085}{7123}It's not like anybody|takes them seriously.
{7125}{7165}That's what I'm worried about.
{7168}{7219}Besides, it's the only way|I'll ever get to hear them.
{7222}{7282}Please don't go on about|that concert, okay.
{7285}{7309}It's a music festival.
{7310}{7358}Whatever it is,|you're not going.
{7362}{7411}But all of my friends|are going.
{7500}{7549}You've never let me do anything|I wanted to.
{7552}{7643}That's not completely true.|You got to do what you wanted today?
{7648}{7746}While I sat waiting in front of your|father's house in the car for two hours.
{7871}{7943}You're listening on|your favorite radio station WSNP.
{8128}{8236}"You're an easy target.|Don't make him your pimp."
{8242}{8272}What is he going on about?
{8916}{8971}What is going on up there?
{9126}{9160}It's a delay or something.
{9162}{9196}Thank you, Nat.
{9198}{9253}What am I?|Like X-ray Vision Man?
{9748}{9780}Oh, shit.
{9782}{9811}What?
{9812}{9852}Oh my God, is somebody dead?
{9854}{9895}I don't know,|I don't wanna know.
{9897}{9917}I do.
{10056}{10076}Sorry.
{10937}{10982}Come alone, move it!
{14160}{14184}What is it?
{14258}{14279}It's nothing.
{14280}{14310}God, mom!
{14317}{14391}It's all right,|somebody must have put a little doll...
{14502}{14550}You're half asleep.
{14553}{14586}Pull in. I'm not, I'm fine.
{14589}{14636}Look,|there's a rest stop coming up.
{14645}{14719}It's late, I wanna get home.|You've got school tomorrow.
{14723}{14762}Not if I'm dead I don't!
{14787}{14851}My one and only prayer

{14940}{15004}My hopes, my dreams come true
{15018}{15084}My one and only you
{15093}{15154}No-one will ever know
{15168}{15236}How much I love so
{15250}{15311}My only prayer will be
{15325}{15385}Some day you'll care for me
{15388}{15493}But it's only make...
{15526}{15611}...believe
{15619}{15660}Praise the Lord.
{15685}{15733}Only a Christian|could be that happy.
{15751}{15793}White coffee, please.
{15796}{15830}A Red Bull.
{15896}{15994}Leave it to your father to move six|hours away to make my life easier.
{16063}{16130}Look, I'm sorry.|At least you had a weekend.
{16134}{16168}I had to spend mine,|all day yesterday, in the office.
{16170}{16215}It's not our fault your job's|not going well.
{16218}{16246}Who said it's not going well?
{16265}{16288}You do.
{16484}{16501}Thank you.
{16699}{16737}You're gonna keep on seeing things|in the middle of the road
{16739}{16781}if you keep talking those.
{16783}{16863}I had n sleep all last week.
{16954}{16984}You've changed.
{16986}{17052}Good. Who wants to be|the person I used to be?
{17064}{17097}The person who had me, you mean?
{17162}{17185}Where are you going?
{17202}{17246}To phone Geena. Am I allowed?
{17248}{17273}Can't you do that here?
{17275}{17334}I can't get a single.|Any other questions?
{17370}{17386}No.
{19773}{19796}Mom.
{19846}{19876}You ready?
{20480}{20509}Hey, buddy.
{20666}{20689}Let's go.
{20714}{20743}Let's wrap it up.
{21730}{21761}Jerk-off!
{21851}{21879}Hey, mom.
{21880}{21939}I told her we wouldn't mind|giving her a ride.
{21943}{21967}Hi.
{21998}{22050}She's going the same way as us.
{22214}{22242}GAME OVER
{22671}{22697}SERIOUS ACCIDENT
{22785}{22825}Have you got|your belly button pierced?
{22828}{22870}Yeah,|I got it done in Rajasthan.
{22873}{22906}Seat belt, Nat, please.
{22975}{23022}I'd love to go to India.
{23025}{23070}It totally turned me around.
{23073}{23092}Really?
{23093}{23134}Yeah, the people there are cool,|you know.
{23137}{23179}They don't worry about|material things.
{23182}{23272}Not like here, where traveling's|about what kind of car you drive.
{23276}{23320}It should be about|broadening the mind.
{23323}{23386}That's fine, as long as you've|got somebody to do the driving.
{23390}{23427}I can never wait to get home.
{23429}{23452}To your husband?
{23453}{23479}She's divorced.
{23480}{23502}That's too bad.
{23504}{23537}Not necessarily.
{23652}{23732}So what do your folks say about|you going to all these places?
{23736}{23837}It's funny, isn't it? In India they|have religious icons in their car.
{23843}{23900}What do we have?|Air fresheners.
{23935}{24013}I picked up this really amazing CD|out there. You wanna hear it?
{24018}{24049}Yeah, sure. Fuck me.
{25382}{25427}So, do you see him? Your dad?
{25442}{25456}Sometimes.
{25458}{25506}What kind of music|is this anyway?
{25531}{25563}Sometimes.
{25595}{25631}What about yours?
{25636}{25666}Your family?
{25668}{25707}We parted ways|a long time ago.
{25709}{25757}You know what they say,|you can choose your friends,
{25760}{25794}but yu can't choose your family.
{25803}{25828}Who says?
{25992}{26047}Sometimes family chooses you.
{26109}{26194}You can just drop me off at this|picnic area coming up on the right.
{27079}{27104}Here.
{27128}{27180}A very wise person|gave that to me once.
{27202}{27272}He said "nobody in|chains soared up to the sun".
{27331}{27381}Are you sure|we can't take you any further?
{27393}{27417}No.
{27418}{27454}Where are you going?
{27457}{27489}I'm not sure...
{27507}{27560}...but I never get lost any more.
{27643}{27671}So long.
{27910}{27944}Nice move.
{27947}{27973}What?
{27999}{28048}Oh no, mom, her CD.
{28057}{28090}Okay, don't panic.
{28838}{28864}She's not here.
{28865}{28914}She must be. Look for her.
{29320}{29360}Forgot your CD.
{30623}{30653}EAST
{30654}{30678}WEST
{31526}{31545}She's gone.
{31558}{31597}Mom,|what are you talking about?
{31606}{31673}How could she|just disappear in thirty seconds?
{31676}{31738}Don't worry.|She never gets lost.
{35277}{35301}Hello?
{35325}{35440}Oh my God, you're kidding?
{35459}{35507}Yeah, yeah, of course I do.
{35564}{35627}Yeah, but what happens|if it doesn't arrive in time?
{35675}{35699}We just passed some picnic area
{35700}{35788}with a grizzly|bear statue beside the road.
{35797}{35828}Are you sure?
{35849}{35890}Okay, we'll do that.
{35900}{35947}Thanks. Bye.
{36034}{36061}Anything to report?
{36062}{36107}Yeah,|I forgot my birthday present.
{36130}{36184}But dad said he can bring it|to the next rest stop.
{36206}{36235}You're kidding?
{36257}{36302}Call him up and tell him|to send it in the mail.
{36305}{36373}Don't be a drag, he said he could|meet us in thirty minutes.
{36377}{36436}After offering a ride to|Ms Barefoot Bombay?
{36440}{36506}I don't wanna stop again.
{36941}{36969}Thank you.
{37354}{37392}So what did your dad get you,|anyway?
{37426}{37503}I don't know why you're asking.|It's not like you're interested.
{37800}{37838}Who are all these people?
{37901}{37939}What are they all doing here?
{38019}{38062}What are we doing here?
{38455}{38536}It's natural to be afraid|of failure.
{38564}{38633}But it doesn't have to|limit us.
{38643}{38730}Or keep us from realizing|our own potential.
{38756}{38850}From creating opportunities for|success in the boardroom...
{38856}{38936}...on the playing fields|and in the bedroom.
{38947}{39067}We are bombarded with answers,|but are we asking the right questions?
{39073}{39159}Now, I want you|to do something for me.
{39170}{39203}Close your eyes.
{39240}{39270}Go on...
{39280}{39308}...just for a minute.
{39326}{39352}Close your eyes.
{39427}{39477}I want you to visualize...
{39515}{39543}...a door.
{39585}{39621}Now...
{39623}{39671}...reach into your pocket...
{39706}{39749}...where there is a key.
{39781}{39822}Feel it?
{39840}{39948}That key in your pocket...
{39953}{39995}...unlocks the door.
{40014}{40084}Only you can open the door.
{40118}{40208}Behind the door is the truth.
{40224}{40249}Go on...
{40281}{40329}...unlock the door.
{40343}{40380}Look inside.
{40398}{40460}Face the truth...
{40468}{40491}...Senga.
{40544}{40570}Hi, dad.
{40655}{40712}Yeah, okay, I'll see you outside.
{40768}{40836}Stay here.|I'll be back in a minute.
{41986}{42032}Senga, thanks for waiting.
{42035}{42059}Which time?
{42085}{42116}Let's see it then.
{42172}{42213}Come on, show me the present.
{42325}{42357}Well, this is great.
{42358}{42380}Not only do you lie to me,
{42381}{42429}but you go straight to your father|and sweet-talk him.
{42432}{42526}I didn't lie.|He asked me what I wanted.
{42531}{42616}Hold on, I didn't realize that|you two already talked about this.
{42621}{42637}If you had,|do you think she's old enough
{42637}{42705}to go off on her own for|a whole weekend in the wilderness?
{42709}{42736}She's not a kid any more.
{42739}{42802}She's not exactly|an adult either.
{42805}{42852}If you spent more time with her,|you'd understand that.
{42855}{42917}If you wanna go with her,|I don't have a problem in the world with this.
{42921}{42965}It's not about you|and me any more.
{42968}{43038}If you want to make a scene,|do it without me, okay?
{43042}{43086}This is something you two|have to sort out.
{43088}{43123}God, how familiar this sounds!
{43124}{43211}Dad, we talked about this.|Tell her what you think.
{43266}{43297}I'll call you, sweetheart, okay?
{43317}{43337}See you.
{43352}{43384}We'll do something special.
{43418}{43439}Dad!
{43537}{43578}I'm going and you can't stop me!
{43581}{43603}You want a bet?
{43683}{43706}Dad!
{43722}{43758}Get used to it, Nat.
{43759}{43824}Bailing out is the only thing|your father knows how to do well.
{43828}{43879}I'm not fucking surprised,|with you!
{43882}{43972}Why is it only your way is right|and nobody else has a say in the matter?
{43977}{44030}No wonder you screwed up|your marriage.
{44034}{44055}Stop it.
{44056}{44144}You're afraid I might get pregnant young|and screw up my life like you did?
{44148}{44189}Well I'm not that stupid.
{44192}{44202}Get in the car.
{44204}{44223}No.
{44242}{44305}Nat, get in the car now!
{44309}{44327}No.
{44328}{44365}Fuck you. I hate you.
{46864}{46900}Nat?
{47038}{47079}My daughter, she has long hair...
{47081}{47160}...we were staying right over there|a few minutes ago. Have you seen her?
{47165}{47181}Miss?
{47201}{47227}Pretty face, long hair?
{47228}{47254}Yes, yes, that's her.
{47256}{47284}I'm sure she went that way|with her friend.
{47285}{47302}What?
{47420}{47443}Natasha.
{47516}{47556}Natasha.
{47997}{48016}Nat?
{48126}{48154}Nat.
{48224}{48251}Oh God.
{48252}{48277}Nat.
{48483}{48498}Nat.
{48657}{48685}Nat.
{49030}{49085}You gotta help me.|It's my daughter.
{49089}{49160}These people, they took her. I don't|know who they are but she's gone.
{49164}{49189}Jesus, she's only fifteen!
{49190}{49226}Ma'am, you gotta take it easy.
{49228}{49274}They just took her.|You've gotta do something now!
{49277}{49373}I can't help you I if I can't|understand what you're saying.
{49392}{49450}Now, what does your daughter|look like?
{49454}{49566}She's tall and skinny with|medium brown hair to here.
{49575}{49638}I've got a picture. Here.
{49732}{49756}What was she wearing?
{49757}{49798}Denim jacket and blue jeans.
{49801}{49835}Please get out there|and do something.
{49837}{49875}Bear with me.
{49878}{49948}I need to ask these questions|in order to be able to help you.
{49958}{49981}What's her full name?
{49982}{50050}Natasha Wilson.
{50203}{50258}Was she upset in any way?|Has she done this kind of thing before?
{50262}{50333}No, no. Took her, okay?
{50340}{50440}It was a backpacker|and a couple in an RV.
{50503}{50590}Okay, Mrs. Wilson, you stay put,|so we know where to find you.
{50594}{50650}A local unit will be coming|shortly to get your full statement.
{50654}{50693}What if they leave the freeway?|What if they get away?
{50695}{50761}Ehicle out there does one hundred and fifty miles per ho
{50765}{50794}They won't get away.
{51759}{51828}Are you familiar with the words|of Jesus Christ?
{51844}{51929}Are you familiar with the words|"fuck off"?
{52790}{52824}Shit!
{56396}{56429}Nat?
{57027}{57052}Nat?
{57985}{58062}I don't like talking about|my past life...
{58066}{58136}...because it hurts me.
{58140}{58180}Really,|do we have to talk about this?
{58183}{58212}And your father?
{58213}{58280}I don't even know|who my dad was.
{58284}{58358}Not that my mother|even knew his last name.
{58395}{58433}And my mother died...
{58481}{58506}CHRISTINE
{58524}{58606}My parents... they were nice.
{58611}{58662}But, there were fucking boring.
{58665}{58740}I mean,|really fucking boring, okay.
{58754}{58862}And my brother, we were close.
{58870}{58966}We got along but we seemed, like,|totally different, I mean...
{58971}{59117}...he's a mechanic, and he's|gonna be that his whole life.
{63884}{63944}Touch it and|I'll rip your fucking neck off.
{63995}{64053}Put your foot down, bitch!
{64057}{64099}What have you done|with my daughter?
{64102}{64160}Shut the fuck up|and put your fucking foot down.
{64258}{64292}Faster!
{65736}{65817}Forty-five three four seven,|civilian call on nine 0 two.
{65821}{65899}Possible crashed or abandoned|vehicle by the side of the freeway...
{65903}{65970}...approximately three miles east|of junction thirty-seven.
{65974}{66046}Described as a dark SUV|or similar.
{66062}{66166}Vehicle remains upright,|unknown if persons inside.
{66562}{66651}Relax. You get any stiffer,|rigor mortis will set in.
{66757}{66805}Come on, Nat, relax.
{66808}{66881}I know how you feel.|I had to go through it myself.
{66890}{66982}You see, Nat, there's this|whole community of people...
{67001}{67035}...just like us.
{67038}{67098}You know,|it's like an extended family.
{67111}{67142}Only better.
{67165}{67222}It seems like ever since|I met The Father...
{67226}{67295}...my old life feels like it|belongs to someone else.
{67299}{67338}He makes us feel special,|like...
{67340}{67436}...we finally fit in or belong to|something bigger than ourselves.
{67451}{67508}He's the reason|we're all here together.
{67612}{67687}"No time for criticizing"
{67697}{67774}"Music hypnotizing"
{67790}{67874}"Everybody's temperature's rising"
{67881}{68068}"So get back"
{68639}{68680}How do you feel?
{68694}{68766}I feel...
{68770}{68805}...different.
{68815}{68854}Do you wanna look different?
{68883}{68906}Yeah.
{68913}{68945}Then come on.
{69857}{69894}You all right?
{69926}{69980}I just ran my car off the road.
{69984}{70006}Really?
{70078}{70128}There are a lot of|maniacs out here.
{70172}{70214}You're alive...
{70222}{70259}...that's the main thing.
{70439}{70501}Look, could you just...
{70505}{70553}...please get my car on the road?
{70563}{70604}Why don't you come with me?
{70628}{70677}It's not safe out on the freeway.
{71199}{71231}Should see to that cut.
{71550}{71585}Who is this?
{71586}{71621}That's my sister.
{71623}{71649}What's her name?
{71668}{71729}Christine. She's dead.
{72043}{72115}Do you wanna use my phone?|Call your husband?
{72119}{72139}No.
{72168}{72199}Maybe he's worried about you.
{72201}{72251}I said no.
{72728}{72764}I'm gonna make the next stop.
{72765}{72826}And there you can report|your accident to the police.
{72834}{72880}They can help you|find your daughter.
{73744}{73775}It's the Bradford district.
{73897}{73920}Right.
{73946}{73997}Thanks a lot. Right.
{74343}{74419}There's no record of|a reported abduction.
{74423}{74489}In fact, there's nothing matching|your daughter's description.
{74493}{74544}Of course not,|she's not a real police officer.
{74558}{74593}Do you have a photograph|of your daughter?
{74595}{74641}No, that woman took it.|I told you.
{74644}{74711}But I saw a picture of|another girl in the pick-up truck...
{74715}{74778}...and then I saw a cassette|of the very same girl...
{74782}{74814}What has this got to|d with your daughter?
{74816}{74861}If you stop|and think about it for a minute...
{74864}{74904}you'd see that|they're all in it together.
{74907}{75004}The recovery man, the backpacker,|the couple with the RV!
{75009}{75033}We have no record of|an officer responding.
{75034}{75091}No radio broadcasting,|no...
{75095}{75146}Why aren't you calling the|FBI right now
{75149}{75191}and reporting|my daughter missing?
{75194}{75227}These people are deranged!
{75228}{75250}Is that what they are?
{75279}{75307}Deranged?
{75510}{75555}That's her father.|My ex-husband.
{75558}{75618}That's his cell phone.|Call him.
{75811}{75855}Sorry to trouble you.
{75858}{75917}Detective Stephens here,|from Bradford Police Division.
{75929}{75945}I'm sitting here with a woman,
{75947}{76039}Senga Wilson,|she says she's your ex-wife.
{76068}{76132}Look, Detective,|before you go any further...
{76136}{76204}...there's something you|need to know about my ex-wife.
{76207}{76295}This isn't exactly the first time|I've gotten a call like this from the police.
{76300}{76334}Especially at this hour.
{76337}{76435}She's been on medication since|the divorce. She's delusional.
{76440}{76515}I understand you have a fifteen|year old daughter, Natasha, is that correct?
{76519}{76580}Yes, my daughter's|here with me now.
{76584}{76618}She's been with me all weekend.
{76619}{76645}Okay.
{76646}{76700}I'm afraid Senga's wasting|everyone's time.
{76734}{76771}I'm sorry I can't be|of more help, Detective.
{76774}{76819}Thank you for your time,|Mr. Wilson.
{76854}{76956}Your husband has just told me|that your daughter is safe at home with him.
{77006}{77046}Mrs. Wilson?
{77060}{77108}You know,|you're obviously very upset...
{77111}{77159}...but filing a fraudulent police|report is a crime.
{77163}{77203}You do realize that?
{77212}{77231}Now, look...
{77255}{77304}...if you're in a|domestic situation...
{77312}{77333}...that's okay.
{77345}{77384}Talk to one of|our female officers.
{77626}{77658}God damn it.
{80127}{80176}Come on.
{80179}{80213}Hi, you've reached|Lois and Marek.
{80216}{80243}Bastard.
{80245}{80340}It's natural to be|afraid of failure.
{80362}{80440}I remember what you remember.|I remember what you remember.
{80444}{80494}But it doesn't have to limit us.
{80497}{80604}Or keep us from|realizing our own potential.
{80623}{80698}From creating the opportunities|for success in the boardroom...
{80703}{80790}...on the playing fields|and in the bedroom.
{80826}{80935}We are bombarded with answers,|but are we asking the right questions?
{80993}{81016}Now...
{81017}{81059}...I want you to...
{81062}{81106}...do something for me.
{81234}{81272}Close your eyes.
{81309}{81341}Go on.
{81411}{81446}Just for a minute.
{81468}{81515}Face the truth.
{81530}{81578}She's gone.
{81622}{81668}She's with me now.
{81694}{81753}I know your secrets.
{81783}{81849}I remember what you remember.
{81859}{81893}Senga.
{82249}{82296}What have you done|with my daughter? Where is she?
{82349}{82389}What have you done with her?
{82392}{82425}Tell me where she is?
{82426}{82497}Ma'am, you have to leave|the restaurant right now.
{82588}{82632}I know what you're doing.
{86469}{86514}Before I met The Father...
{86527}{86615}...the only thing that|ever gave me a rush was joyriding.
{86649}{86712}He's got this amazing power to...
{86716}{86787}...work out all the|fucked up shit in your life.
{86818}{86844}Yeah...
{86865}{86985}...don't get me wrong,|I still got a soft spot for jacking cars.
{88249}{88292}He's gonna love you.
{91400}{91444}He's ready.
{91475}{91540}Wait, wait, I don't know,|I mean, what's gonna happen?
{91544}{91602}Nothing,|unless you want it to.
{92478}{92541}Wait, no.|I feel weird.
{92552}{92623}No, weird's good.|You're gonna be fine.
{92627}{92652}Just have fun, you know.
{92692}{92728}Come on.
{92783}{92808}It's okay.
{92838}{92862}Come on.
{94041}{94165}NO ENTRY TESTING NO ENTRY
{94449}{94567}Nobody in chains.|Ever soared up to the sun.
{94656}{94690}I read that.
{95076}{95128}Cast off those chains.
{95286}{95314}You know...
{95333}{95420}...love's the warmest place|to be in when it's cold outside.
{95463}{95497}I wore that.
{100689}{100826}PRESSURE LOCK OPEN CLOSE
{103117}{103142}What the fuck?
{103239}{103268}Get out of the car now!
{103269}{103307}Come with me now!
{103309}{103323}Let go of me.
{103323}{103366}There's no time...
{103392}{103428}What the hell|are you doing here?
{103429}{103462}Listen to me,|you have to go now.
{103464}{103490}Let me go!
{103557}{103576}Hurry up.
{103590}{103609}Mom.
{103610}{103657}Nat, run.
{103690}{103741}Nat, leave now, please.
{104536}{104620}This time kill her.
{106931}{106972}It's all right, Nat.
{106997}{107042}You don't have to go with her.
{107072}{107138}You don't have to do anything|you don't want to.
{107200}{107232}You're free now.
{107318}{107383}Nat, where are you?
{107457}{107492}Say something.
{107530}{107571}Nobody's gonna hurt you, Nat.
{107611}{107672}She's just terrified of|letting you go.
{107685}{107725}Having your own life...
{107752}{107798}...your own dreams...
{107827}{107906}She just wants to take you away|from the ones who understand you.
{107910}{107954}Don't listen to him, Nat.
{108043}{108103}You always knew she was crazy,|didn't you?
{108112}{108188}Unhinged. Illogical.
{108205}{108271}A fantastic... liar.
{108320}{108375}We wanna give you a real family.
{108407}{108442}With no lies...
{108460}{108501}no pills...
{108517}{108554}...no restrictions...
{108564}{108604}...no screaming matches...
{108638}{108696}...just... love.
{108699}{108734}That's bullshit, Nat.
{108744}{108791}I'm here. I can see you.
{108799}{108832}They wanna kill you!
{108835}{108889}Funny you should mention that.
{108906}{108960}Isn't that exactly|what you tried to do?
{108994}{109029}She tried to kill you.
{109078}{109113}Did you know that?
{109115}{109135}No.
{109136}{109168}Before you were even born.
{109191}{109252}She wanted an abortion, Nat.
{109277}{109312}Tried to flush you away.
{109488}{109507}Sorry.
{109545}{109560}I'm sorry.
{109603}{109653}I remember what you remember.
{109803}{109862}You gotta hang on.
{109946}{110034}Because the truth is with us|in the house tonight.
{110108}{110149}Close your eyes.
{110220}{110278}See that door.
{110319}{110391}Hold that key.
{110452}{110539}You don't have to fight any more.
{110568}{110609}It's over.
{110647}{110673}Come on.
{110733}{110777}Come into the light.
{112335}{112367}Nat...
{112420}{112457}..."m sorry you had to see it.
{112458}{112542}But I had to show you through|the hypocrisy and the lies.
{112578}{112650}Pain is all in the past,|not in the future.
{112728}{112805}All you have to do|is meet me halfway.
{113061}{113125}Where's my daughter?|I want my daughter back.
{113129}{113162}What have you done|with my daughter?
{113163}{113182}Listen.
{113211}{113240}You've got to trust me.
{113290}{113348}Nat was the only way|I could find them.
{113623}{113669}There's something|you should see first.
{113874}{113933}They kill people by knocking|them off the road.
{113970}{114041}Your husband didn't even|get five miles past the rest stop.
{114248}{114350}Come on, Nat,|don't lose your faith.
{114355}{114383}Join us.
{114583}{114617}What did you do with her?
{114933}{114959}Nat?
{115039}{115081}You just don't get it, do you?
{115084}{115141}This man is not|who he says he is.
{115144}{115173}Don't listen to them.
{115186}{115218}They're full of lies.
{115347}{115382}I'm calling Marek.
{115427}{115466}He killed your father.
{115499}{115526}Wait, Nat.
{115551}{115578}Hey, Senga.
{115579}{115621}See you on the other side.
{115685}{115739}You stole my sister.
{115755}{115800}She was my sister too.
{116032}{116058}Hey, Senga...
{116076}{116135}..."m only here to|fill the void.
{116139}{116178}The void you created...
{116180}{116278}...by not listening to|who Nat really is.
{116298}{116347}Get him out of your head.
{116350}{116406}This is how he works.
{116409}{116490}He's got them so fucked up|they're killing people for blood.
{116595}{116634}I was too late for Christine.
{116657}{116743}I had to kill her to stop|her from killing anybody else.
{116883}{116930}You're lucky you're alive.
{117488}{117553}Why can't you|just leave me alone?
{117684}{117711}I'm your mother.
{117725}{117766}I don't always get things right.
{117788}{117849}But please, Nat,|you have to trust me now.
{117953}{117985}Let's get out of here.
{118046}{118068}Let's go.
{118259}{118286}In here. Now!
{118535}{118551}Come on, Nat.
{118553}{118581}Wait.
{118666}{118690}You killed Christine...
{118704}{118728}...now I'm gonna kill you.
{118751}{118807}She was already dead|when I found her.
{118810}{118863}Not dead... free.
{119309}{119420}The day you tried to murder|your daughter is the day you let me in.
{119456}{119515}Truth is in the house tonight...
{119529}{119548}...Senga.
{119851}{119891}Fuck you.
{119921}{119953}Fuck you.
What have you got there?
God!
Baxter?
He got our dog!
He got Baxter!
Shut up, Norman.
Can this happen to a normal woman?
Baxter's fertilizer.
And everyone's just standing there like... staring.
Why don't they just catch that thing?
How hard could it be in a place full of dead ends?
Fuck!
Wrists are for girls...
I'm slitting my throat.
You should definitely hang.
Maybe even your final moment is a cliché around here.
Not ours. B, ours will rock.
You don't think our deaths should be a little more than cheap entertainment?
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.
It's the idea of everyone staring at me just lying there.
I mean, what if they just... laugh?
They'll be in awe.
B, suicide is like the ultimate "fuck you".
Come on it's so us. It's the pact.
See, it's easy for you.
You don't care.
We swore we'd go together, one way or another.
- When we were eight.
- So?
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene, but together forever.
Together forever.
United against life as we know it.
Us dead will be the shit, B. Trust me.
Too much blood.
- And I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.
All right, all right... uh.
Well that was completely...
..disturbing, wasn't it?
You know, the Fitzgerald sisters clearly worked very...
God!
I mean I, I...
I am completely sickened.
Sickened... by that, wasn't I?
Look, see me in the guidance office, after class, you two, separately.
Can we see the ones of Ginger again?
Enough!
Hey!
Life in Bailey Downs, huh?
Who's next?
Oh yes, ladies, run. Run for daddy!
Bounce.
I bet she's good to go.
- You wanna do a Fitzgerald?
- You're kidding?
Not the little dweeb, you goinks.
The one with the rack!
The redhead.
Odd.
I think McCardy just checked me.
Like you care, right?
High school is just a mindless little breeders machine.
A total hormonal toilet.
I'd rather wait it all out in our room.
- What is with your back?
- I don't know.
Hey, 'Search and Destroy'. Go.
OK, Trina Sinclair.
Excellent selection. Continue.
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A. at the hair dye aisle.
Perished while seeking matching barrettes on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.
Likes her shorts stuck up her ass crack.
Favorite homework excuse: my nail glitter ate it.
Basic pleasure model.
Your standard, cumbuckety date bait.
Good one.
- Line change. Let's go, girls.
- Fucking Bitch!
Uh oh.
Let's do this again.
I'll cover you.
Good.
Bounce, babies, bounce! Keep running.
You want it baby.
C'mon, honey!
Oh yeah, baby!
- You want it, baby.
- Fuck off!
'The Beast of Bailey
Downs' strikes again.
That's four dogs this week.
Oh! Wow... Bonus!
I guess you're D.O.A. on a dog. Huh, Fitz-face?
That's enough.
- Are you OK?
- Terrific.
That is one mother-fucking mad dog.
Brigitte, go get cleaned up.
Don't ever touch my sister again.
Stop me, freak.
Enough! Break it up!
Hey, that janitor was looking right down your shirt.
Sure.
Want me to kill her?
I'll kill her for you, B.
Whatever.
No, not whatever.
This isn't whatever.
Seriously, what about torture?
Anything you want.
Or... she has that dog.
We could kidnap it, make it look like he got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'.
We got all that blood and fake guts from the slide show.
Yeah, that's wicked. Let's do it.
She screws a drug dealer; she's begging for negative attention.
So, Sam are you... are you gonna call me?
OK, you have my number, right?
Remember when I gave it to you, before?
Sam.
OK, bye...
Let's get up.
Such a dickhead.
See...
You'd let idiots get away with fucking you up.
That's why the big Buddha made me.
To stop them.
Yeah, so far you're really kicking ass.
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.
- Don't humor me!
- So, Fitz...
I think we should get together.
No.
Bitch!
Jump, Norman. Come on.
B...
Just say you won't go average on me.
Just 'cause some gonad gets his zipper going?
Rather be dead.
- I'd rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you're not, you big suck.
Ginger, don't push your sister.
God, I hate our gene pool.
Look, girls.
Come on. Let go. Let go.
You're ruining it!
Ginger, why are you rubbing your back?
- It hurts.
- Why?
Well, pain flows up your nerve endings to the synapses in your brain...
She's not funny.
- How did you hurt it?
- Being dead.
Does it hurt down by your tail bone, or is it up higher?
- Is it tight throughout here?
- Maybe.
Does it ache back here?
- Might...
- Oh my god.
Do you think it's cramps?
Give it a rest... for two seconds?
Pam, we're eating.
Henry, the girls are both three years late menstruating. OK?
It's not normal. If it's finally happening...
It's not!
Honey, it's nothing to be scared of.
It's the most normal thing in the world.
- Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger-Ann...
Or tuberculosis.
- See what your attitude does?
- Or spondylitis.
- Spondo... what?
- Fuses your vertebrae together.
- Nice.
- Brigitte, stop it.
Have a fit!
I've had just about enough of that tone.
- That makes two of us. Fuck!
- That's it. To your room!
Gladly.
Brigitte, you are not connected at her wrist.
Your father and I have counseling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.
The news says there's still some wild animal on the loose.
They never go out.
Well, you're a big help.
As usual.
- Ginger.
- What?
- We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.
- The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.
People don't leave their dogs out alone anymore.
Then you will just have to distract her while I nab the pooch and make with the gore.
I can't distract her.
The fuck, B. This is your idea. If you don't like your ideas, stop having them.
Sorry.
I've just just had it with eating all this shit, OK?
Check it out.
Now we can even leave a body. She'll freak.
Oh, wicked.
Take his... leg?
He's still warm.
Oh, gross.
Shit!
Leave it then. The drag.
You got some on you.
Nice.
What?
B,
I just got the curse.
Eww.
Well, it's not contagious!
I know that.
God!
I mean, kill yourself to be different and your own body screws you.
But if I start simping around tampon dispensers and moaning about
PMS, shoot me, OK?
Let's get out of here.
Ginger?
Ginger!
Ginger?
Ginger!
Ginger!
Oh God. He's right behind me.
Oh, my God!
Ginger!
Ginger!
Ginger!
Get up. Come on, get up!
Oh, fuck me.
Shit!
Mom!
Dad! Help!
Let me see.
- No, it hurts, it burns...
- I have to see it, Ginger.
- What was it? What was it?
- I don't know. A big dog, maybe.
That's not...
What did I do? What...
Shh.
I saw this thing once, on bears.
Said a bear will like, come after a girl on the rag, because of the smell.
It wasn't a fucking bear!
There wasn't any fucking bears anywhere near here.
- Does that hurt?
- No.
That's impossible.
They're already healing.
No, this isn't right.
I'm calling 911.
No! No!
B, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right?
I mean... just... spare me Pam finding out.
OK? I'm OK. OK?
- OK.
- I'm OK.
- I thought you were gonna die.
- I'm OK.
Preying upon normal healthy cells, the intruder gradually devours the host from within.
Eventually the invader consumes its host completely, and finally destroys it.
Complete meiosis involves two successive division sequences, which result in four new cells, each of which is haploid.
This one comes with a free calendar.
Are you sure it's just cramps?
Just so you know... the words 'just' and 'cramps', they don't go together.
OK, you're really girling out here.
One day, you too will know my pain.
Hey, diss me or whatever, but I got three sisters... and nothing quite takes the edge off like a good toke.
Well, maybe I like my edge, thanks.
Or maybe you're just chickened to lose it.
Just pass it, fag.
- That a girl.
- Yeah.
An eighth's fifty.
- I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.
I was just wondering what you hit.
Well, officer, it looked like a lycanthrope to me, sir.
- I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.
Think you see werewolves a lot?
Why, do you?
Is it working?
No... but now I just don't care.
- What the hell are you guys doing in here?
- Sam, the Man.
Sam, man, we just needed a place to come and smoke.
Hey, you know, I have an idea.
Why don't you guys get the fuck out of my van, assholes!
No, I'm serious. Get out!
Get out. Get out!
- Samuel, what happened to your truck?
- I tapped a tree, all right. Good bye.
Ginge, let's go.
Yeah, why don't you stick to your own species Fitzenstein?
Trina, stick my fist.
Oh you bitch! It's OK, baby.
Ginge, what's going on?
Something's wrong.
Like more than you being just... female.
Can you just say something, please?
Wow!
'Wow'? That's it? 'Wow'?
I can't have a hairy chest, B. That's fucked!
No way.
The fuck? What the fuck?
- This isn't...
- What?
- No way, like...
- What?
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy?
I know, but think about it.
Well thank you for taking my total fucking nightmare so seriously!
Oh shit!
What if I'm dying or something?
We gotta see the nurse.
I'm sure it seems like a lot of blood. It's a period.
But really it was like a... geyser.
Everyone seems to panic their first time.
Neither of you have had a period before and you're how old?
I'm almost 16, she just turned 15.
She skipped a grade.
A thick, syrupy, voluminous discharge is not uncommon.
The bulk of the uterine lining is shed within the first few days.
Contractions, cramps, squeeze it out like a pump.
In three to five days you'll find lighter, bright-red bleeding.
That may turn to a brownish or blackish sludge, which signals the end of the flow.
- OK, so it's all normal?
- Very!
Expect it every twenty eight days, give or take, for the next thirty years.
Great. Thanks.
What about hair that wasn't there before, and pain?
Mhm, comes with the territory.
Thank you. Let's go, B.
Wait, you'll have to protect against both pregnancy and STDs now...
Play safe!
Wish this where babies' legs.
Ginger's very favorite.
Congratulations sweetie. You know you can ask me anything.
You're so dead.
I didn't.
Our little girl's a young woman now.
- I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off!
- I want you to be OK.
- I am! I just got my period, OK?
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what?
That means I've got hormones, and they may make me butt-ugly, but they do not make me a monster.
So you got bit by a great big hormone.
Well not by what you think. They don't exist!
Norman, shut the fuck up!
Maybe he's barking at you.
Did I change last night?
Howl at the moon, kill shit and change back this morning?
Huh? No!
Did it take a silver bullet to stop that thing? No!
It got killed by a fucking truck.
You always blow off anything you don't get.
Yeah, when it's bullshit!
You're doing drugs with guys. Something is definitely wrong with you.
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.
Yeah, it's got these little green eyes.
Oh yeah, like I really wish I was hemorrhaging and hairy, and sucking off Jason McCardy.
- Well you always wanted to be me!
- Well this isn't you, so.
Oh, poor B.
I'm growing up and obviously you're not, huh?
- Well don't let me hold you back or anything.
- Oh, well, don't worry, I won't.
Only one creature on earth destroys for pure pleasure.
It's a werewolf.
Oh my god, there it is.
It's hideous!
Get the fuck outta the bathroom!
I'm trying to get ready!
Ginger? Oh my god.
Oh babe...
Check it out.
Hello, hello, hello...
Hey!
Kid, you got a smoke?
No.
You got a light then?
Oh, thank you.
I just spent a week of my life looking for you. Give me a sec.
You dropped this - in my truck.
OK, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it?
- It's what you hit.
- Hmm! I know, but what the fuck was it?
See, I flattened an animal. Furry, all-fours, could be anything.
But here I am, thinking 'lycanthrope'.
That's crazy, huh?
Book me into the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right?
What if you're not?
Well, that would explain the human circumcised dick, and why you were running for your life from it.
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.
What's your name?
- Bullshit.
- Thanks.
No, hey, bullshit?
What do you say?
Swear you won't call a freak show.
Yeah, I swear.
I'm changing, like right now and full moons have nothing to do with it.
You're serious?
And everything I look at goes silver bullet, in a gun, to my head, the end.
Wow.
Let's not panic here. I mean... for one, that thing on the road, my van did a pretty good job on it, without the benefit of silver bullets.
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.
There's got to be a cure, right?
Otherwise, there would be a hell of a lot more of them.
It's like an infection, it works from the inside out. It's like a virus.
Biology, there's something you can sink your teeth into.
So to speak.
You're real, your problem's real, the solution's real.
Not bam, death by morality call.
Then again when I started piercing shit, I got infections, girl says try pure silver, cleared up like that.
The ancients thought pure metals purified their blood.
- They thought leeches did, too.
- They do.
Hey, why don't you get your slut-bitch sister a leash?
What a freak.
Nice bird necklace.
Ginger, a word?
- Is it sorry?
- No.
Come on Jason, let's go.
Oh yes.
Ginger!
Ginger!
Hey. She's ovulating!
See you, freak. Bye bye.
This is a very exciting, confusing time for your sister.
Boys, her body, trying to fit in.
Maybe if she felt that she could share more with you, you'd both be a lot happier.
You know, Brigitte, your turn's coming, too... one day
My stomach.
Hey, take it easy, all right?
We've got all night.
Sorry, you just taste really good.
Just lie back and relax.
You lie back and relax!
Who's the guy here?
Who's the guy here? Huh?
Who's the fucking guy here?
Don't we need protection here?
Stop it!
Wait a second!
You're fucking hilarious, cave boy.
Ginge?
What happened?
Did he hurt you?
If he hurt you, you should tell.
Oh, my god!
- Get out! Get out!
- What happened?
Something is really, really wrong with me, B.
What happened?
I get this ache and...
I thought it was for sex, but it's to tear everything into fucking pieces.
Where is he?
Next door.
Oh, my god!
You killed Norman.
He barked and he barked and he kept fucking barking, and...
I just... I just...
I couldn't stop myself.
B, what am I supposed to do?
It wasn't at all like I thought it would be.
There was just all this squirming and squealing.
And than he's done, and you're like 'Oh?'
Just probably out there telling everyone what a freak I am.
We'll say the same thing about him.
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.
I'm just a lay.
He's a hero and I’m just a lay, a freaked mutant lay.
Did you use something?
No.
You really think this will work?
We have to try something.
Where did you get that, that ring?
I found it.
Too bad.
You should have one too. I mean, for being with me on this.
Ready?
Yeah.
Shit, it's stuck!
Hold still.
- Fuck! Hurry up!
- Sorry, sorry.
It's almost there.
How do you feel?
Wicked.
Norman?
Hey, Norman.
Hurry up!
- Hold still.
- I am, hurry up.
Come on, hit it, baby.
- Oh, McCardy what happened to you?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.
What, did you get your rag, too?
Oh, shit!
It must be ink, all right? Fuck!
Hi!
Brigitte!
Brigitte, come here.
What the fuck, B? Did you get a boyfriend or something?
No, we just...
I'll be right back.
Oh my god.
Hey, what's up? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.
Are you on drugs, like right now?
I'm in class here.
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.
- I'll come see you later, OK?
- Whatever.
The Fitzen sister are really getting around.
- OK, line change. Let's go.
- He thinks I got bit.
I trust you, and you blabbed to the first fuck-up who comes along.
He knows stuff, he wants to help.
He wants to get down your pants, stupid!
So, sluts run in the family... quel shocker!
- Knock it off!
- Ginger, no!
Ginger, no! Stop!
Fight, fight, fight...
- You started it.
- Ginger, to the office.
This school has a 'zero tolerance for violence'-policy.
I mean a temper like that is inexcusable barring substantial extenuating circumstances.
What are you looking at? Huh?
My pen exploded, OK. My red pen.
That was fucking incredible.
Get your camera, don't you have a camera? This is wall-worthy. Come on.
You gave it to Jason. You had unprotected sex, and you infected him.
Oops!
- I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- I bet he does. Well, let's go.
If you come, you can't be weird, Ginger.
If he gets I lied. If he gets that you're really the one who's really... a what? ...A monster? Huh, a freak?
If he thinks I dicked him around, he'll blow this off.
I'll behave.
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry about before. I was just afraid someone would hear us, that's all.
Yeah, she is just a little moody lately.
That whole silver thing didn't quite work out, did it?
I wasn't expecting company.
My sister, Ginger. She knows.
If you two come in here, you see sweet fuck all. Understood?
Jesus!
Wicked! Smoke us up!
Yeah, wicked huh? Get the fuck out!
All right, Brigitte, it brakes down like this.
I compared homeopathic treatments of infections to the folklore of all this. Take a look.
Aconitum di lycotonum.
- 'Lyco' as in wolf?
- Right.
It's called Monkshood.
It's a cousin of wolfsbane, except this stuff is safe in small doses.
It's a super oxidant breed, radical detox.
It promotes white blood cell growth.
Which fight infection.
Do you have some?
Well, it's perennial.
It grows everywhere, but only in the spring.
Fuck! This is bullshit, OK?
- I seeded some, I'm growing it.
- She doesn't have time for that.
She's killed a dog already.
She's fucked. She's growing a tail. Did you tell him that?
Ginger!
You're growing a tail?
Yes.
Look, he's just another wank job. OK?
What the fuck do you think you are? Give me that.
What the fuck are you?
Pervert, she's 15!
Ginger, wait outside!
Fine, if he rapes you, don't come crying. I'll be at home.
She's just freaking.
I do not think of you that way.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Your dad's battery is dead again.
He's stranded at the supermarket.
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Jesus, can't you knock?
Don't you 'Jesus' me.
You don't have anything
I haven't seen before.
That's what you think.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing, I'm just, I'm fat, all right. Get out!
Ginger, you are not fat.
These fashion models are all on speed to look like that.
Get out!
OK. Gosh.
I'll be back soon.
Give me back my dog.
- Trina, I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.
You know, I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't like you.
He's a cherry-hound.
He's into virgins.
Trina, you're bleeding. Go home.
If you are so fucking smart, you won't give him the satisfaction.
Somebody just once shouldn't give that fucker the satisfaction!
- Trina, go now.
- You are as big a cunt as your sister.
I am not.
- Hey, meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?
I don't know, B. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the pro.
What?
You play with your new friends, and I'll play with mine.
Ginger, what the hell are you doing?
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus or antiseptic? I'm not sure.
Are you crazy?
- OK, that's enough. Just let her go.
- Shut up. Shut up, shut up.
OK, let's just chill. Right, Trina?
You know what, Trina?
She's doing your boy, now. I wouldn't be so quick to get so friendly.
- Stop it, it's not like that.
- I think she's scared for you, love, huh?
She's an asshole.
She's not worth it.
You asked for this!
You picked Sam over me. Whatever happens now, it is your fault!
- This is not you. Just let's cope.
- Oh, with what? With this kind of shit.
He's wrong, moron.
You can't fix this!
You don't know that.
Just give me a chance.
What, another one?
God gee, I don't know, B... see I'm going way way out there... way way far from where you live, which you pretty much fucking rule.
Oh god, that's disgusting, you fucking gross, fucking...
Back!
Don't touch me, you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.
Trina, we were just...
Uh-oh.
Get up!
Get up now!
Henry, what on earth are you doing out there?
Come on, don't eat it until we get inside.
Jesus Christ on a bicycle! What the...?
Girls, I told you, no more deaths in the house!
Don't be mad, it's for extra credit.
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.
Corn syrup. Dad, d'you want some?
Well I better get this meat away.
I'll do that.
- Mom.
- What?
What do guys want?
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.
And that's what men want.
Some of them might seem cool or different, but they're all pretty much the same.
- Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.
Oh, honey, that's what we're here for.
Bed time. It's a school night. Beauty rest.
This is just great.
Yeah, field hockey will suck now.
Get me a screwdriver.
Oh, god!
Way to go.
Here it is: 'Why your daughter dates dummies?'
I'm so glad I hung on to this.
- I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.
Then why are they suddenly so interested in what you have to say?
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.
Shit. Look at all the worms.
Remember when I used to make you eat them just to get in here?
Shallow grave? Oh well, seems appropriate.
You dig for a while.
Look, no one ever thinks chicks do shit like this.
Trust me, a girl can only be a slut, a bitch, a tease, or the virgin next door.
We'll just coast on how the world works.
Think she's pretty?
If I wasn't here, would you eat her?
No.
- God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.
Well I can't stay in,
I'll go mental.
We'll make Pam think you're at school.
We'll make school think you're home sick.
Just till there is no doubt about us in this.
Then we blow, as far away from here as possible.
Your attention, please.
Starting immediately certain students will be paged to the office to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's disappearance.
She is dead, man.
When your name is called, please come to the office.
Is Ginger avoiding me?
'Cause I'm feeling pretty good right now.
I just got a few questions for her, like uh...
I'm growing a goddamn tail outta my ass, and I thought she might have a few tips on how to deal with keeping that quiet!
Hurting me won't help.
See? I'm up to some whack shit right now.
I'm way out on the corner of 'Fucked-Up and Evil'.
You wanna know what I did for fun last night, huh?
I killed my own freaking dog, OK?
What am I supposed to do about that?
- You're gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right with you on deep shit, and I think you know why.
What's going on here?
Thanks.
- Ginger, how was school today?
- I don't know, I didn't go.
- We had a field trip.
- Really?
I didn't sign any form for a field trip.
Daddy, will you teach me how to drive tonight?
Next year. Maybe.
So where did you go?
- What if next year never comes?
- Ginger.
Mr. Wayne called today.
He wanted to know if you were feeling any better.
When you might be coming back to school.
The police wanna talk to you. Something about a fight with a missing girl?
- Daddy, may I be excused?
- No, you may not.
- Ginger, wait.
- For what, B?
Oh no, you don't.
I want to know what's going on. Right now.
- What are these?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...
Where did you get them?
From a craft store.
Now, I want an answer.
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,
'cause Jason McCardy liked us better, so Ginger beat her up. That's all.
That's all?
Beating up other girls?
Cutting classes?
- I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.
You just do whatever she wants you to. You always have.
I really wish you'd start thinking more for yourself.
Do you think I should talk to her?
Check in?
She thinks it's cool you let us figure stuff out for ourselves.
Oh?
Really?
I wondered if that approach was working.
Look what Pamela had.
- What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll just take it off.
No!
I killed their pets, B.
And nothing helps except tearing live things to pieces.
I can't be like this.
This is monkshood.
First thing tomorrow we find out how to use it and we take off.
If you give up now, you leave me here alone. I would never do that to you!
I'm sorry. I'm scared.
BCX radio wishes you a happy Halloween...
B, what the fuck are you doing?
Hey... B, let me out!
I have to deal with the cure.
This way, you can't hurt yourself or anybody else.
Fuck. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going rat me out?
Just shut up and wait for me.
You little bitch! Fuck you!
I hate you!
B, let me out. Come on.
B?
B!
Let me out!
Holly shit, that's monkshood.
Where the fuck did you get that?
I don't know if you smoke it or eat it or what, but I need to try it now.
Well, you got me but... to be sure, I'd have to say direct route. Inject it.
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because neither of us know what this stuff does.
It can't be worse than being road kill.
The dosage will be a guess. I mean...
It would have to be, there is no way to match for... metabolism, body weight, there could be side effects.
- You can not try this alone.
- My sister will be there.
Understand you may kill her trying to save her.
What?
It's for Ginger, isn't it?
Look, worst-case scenario, you put her out of her misery.
Just as long as you're prepared for that, and I mean sure.
Try to come tonight.
Hey, have you seen Jason?
Umm... you got a little...
You're going to the greenhouse bash tonight?
- Erm, yeah.
- Good.
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be winner.
Ginger. My office. Now.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Let me go.
Let me go!
Let him go, McCardy.
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.
Come to papa, baby.
Come and get some candy.
I have to go. Um...
I have a class.
Attention please.
Brigitte Fitzgerald, please report to guidance.
Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
B, and tell her we needed help.
So, I stopped him.
You see how that works?
How I do not betray you?
I didn't betray you.
You locked me up.
You need to get this fixed.
Why? So I can go to jail, for the rest of my life?
We wait till everyone leaves, then we clean this up, somehow.
I think you've fucked up enough.
Oh my god!
- Henry?
- Oh g...
What is it?
Henry, for Pete's sake. It's only the girls' death project.
They're fake, you big baby.
I'm gonna find something to clean this up.
Stay here and lock the door.
Oh my god!
Hello, Brigitte.
- Stop it!
- Can I touch your boobies?
I like little girls.
Leave him alone!
Ginger. Stop! Stop!
Ginger, fucking stop!
Please stop!
Ginger, stop!
He hasn't done anything!
I don't like how he looks at you.
Oh my god!
He found me. Brigitte.
- The mess. I had to...
- Go to hell!
He's not dead. You've infected him.
Let me call help for him.
Oh fuck!
Fuck!
You like it.
It feels so... good, Brigitte.
It's like touching yourself.
You know every move... right on the fucking dot.
And after... you see fucking fireworks, supernovas.
I'm a goddamn force of nature.
I feel like I could do just about anything.
You know we're almost not even related anymore.
You're fucked!
You'd love it. Should come for the ride.
A little scratch. Swap some juice.
We'll be our own pack, like before. It's so us, B.
I'd rather be dead than be what you are.
We have a pact!
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene, but together for fucking ever!
I said I would die for you!
No. You said you'd die with me.
'Cause you had nothing better to do.
Fuck you too.
You think I wanna go back to being nobody?
You're fucked!
Stay the hell out of my way, Brigitte.
And I'll tell Sam you said hi.
Stop! Stop!
Where is your sister?
County greenhouse.
Get in the van.
All right, Fitz.
Wicked costume, baby.
Where is Sam?
Shit!
Hey.
- Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte?
- She couldn't make it.
- Yeah, why is that?
- Cramps.
She says hi.
You wanna buy or something?
Or something.
- Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...
You've done a terrible thing.
But... you're my tiny babies.
It's one thing if you leave, it's almost normal, but no one is gonna take you from me.
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house fill up with gas, and light a match.
What?
We'll start fresh. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
What about dad?
He'll just blame me, they all will.
This isn't your fault, mom.
Yes it is.
Lock the doors, OK?
- Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.
- What are you doing?
- I know you want to. Everybody does.
Really, what would I be like?
What would I do?
- What would I feel like inside?
- Ginger, stop.
- Make me.
- Ginger, your sister...
This is fucked.
Ginger, get off me. Get off me.
Ginger, get off me!
Jerk!
What? I told you to stop. Oh Jesus.
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.
Get up, Ginger.
You bitch!
You want me? You want me?
Stop hurting everybody else and take me. Take me!
I don't want you!
I don't even know you!
Brigitte, don't.
Brigitte, don't!
You wrecked everything for me that isn't about you.
No.
Shit.
Now I am you.
I know you are. But what am I?
We got to go.
B, I can't. I'm turning too fast.
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I won't let you do this, Brigitte.
You both need help.
You fucking idiot!
The cure works.
I had to use it on somebody else, but there is more at the house.
This is the only way I could get her to come back with me.
Oh shit!
What? How was I supposed to know that?
Just help me, OK? Just get her in your truck and drive us home.
Fine, but she rides in the back.
This is nuts, you need a doctor.
Oh!
Jesus.
She could have killed you, Brigitte.
She needs me.
Get home. Cure her, cure me.
And then what?
Run.
You know you're kidding yourself.
I'll be right back.
Give me the syringe.
Dad? Hello?
Oh shit!
Yeah, I've meant to fix that.
- Did she get out?
- Oh god, I hope not.
I can't see anything.
Pass me that flashlight.
Fuck!
That was your god damn sister!
Oh fuck.
The monkshood's in there.
Oh, you're out of your mind.
Not yet.
Be quiet. I gotta get this stuff.
Great.
Fuck! Where the fuck is she?
Shh.
- Let's do this fast.
- Hell, yes.
All right, bowls.
Alcohol, alcohol.
Brigitte.
Could I have your lighter?
I can't feel my hand.
Jesus Christ.
Oh fuck!
Go! Go!
- Alcohol.
- What?
- Alcohol!
- Oh shit. Yeah.
Start grinding up the buds.
All right, pour it in.
Easy, easy, easy...
What was that?
Shit, keep going. Go, go.
All right, hold this.
- Right, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.
How about you take this and we blow?
How about no?
Then let me do it, you can hardly move.
No!
You can't do this by yourself.
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the living room, you lead her in, bam we're done.
- OK.
- OK.
- I'm going.
- Be careful.
Sam?
Ginger?
I can't.
I won't.
The fuck.
Fuck off!
Leave me alone!
Ginger?
Come on. It's me.
OK?
Ginger, please, it's me!
You want this?
You want this?
I'm not dying in this room with you!
I'm not dying!

What's wrong with my eye, Mama?
The doctor says it's lazy.
But... we're going to make you look perfect.
It itches.
Do you want make friends?
Then keep it covered.
Are you a pirate?
# Happy Birthday to you. #
I've always said,
"If you can't find a friend, make one."
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Now it's ruined.
Her name is Suzie.
Suzie was the first doll
I ever made.
She was my best friend.
And now she'll be yours.
No, no, no, you can't take her out.
She's special.
What do you think of my pirate patch?
I bet you're wondering what I'm making.
Okay, I'll tell you.
I saw someone today.
A boy.
You know how when you meet someone... and you think you like them, but then the more you talk to them you see parts you don't like.
Like that guy on the bench.
And sometimes... you don't end up liking any parts at all.
But... the boy I saw today is different.
I like every part of him.
Especially his hands.
They're beautiful.
Don't be mad.
You've been my friend my whole life.
And you see me, you always have, but...
I need a real friend.
Someone I can hold.
I'm going to give you some cardboard shades you can wear over your regular glasses until the dilation wears off.
Will my contacts be ready by Friday?
Should be.
You look awfully excited.
I have a date.
You're sure my eye won't cross with the contacts?
Positive.
The contacts will pull your good eye forward just like your regular glasses.
Your lazy eye just needs a little help.
I need all the help
I can get.
This boy is perfect.
Oh, slick shades.
What the hell is a scupel?
- Scalpel?
- Oh!
Your dog's going to be fine, ma'am.
Scalpel!
Thanks for the heads up, doll.
Scupel.
Wait! Hold 'em up!
Moy, I need a big scupel for German Shepard surgery tomorrow.
No forget it.
Prep it up for me.
Hey, May, hold up.
I want to ask you something.
What are you going to be for Halloween?
I've just been wracking my brains, you know, trying to come up with something original.
Do you got any ideas?
You have a beautiful neck.
Thank you.
You should call me one of these nights.
You know, we'll hang out and... eat some melons or something.
Okay.
When I left for vacation, my dog had four legs.
Okay?
Then I came back... now she only has three.
You know,
I looked everywhere.
I can't find her leg.
What do I do?
May?
May, would you help this gentleman?
You got to help me here, May.
I got a serious situation here, okay?
I got a dog, it's missing a leg, okay?
I'm throwing it a stick and nothing.
Nothing happens.
Hello?
Jesus, what are you doing?
Relaxing.
Doesn't it hurt?
No.
Ow!
You crazy bitch!
Why did you do that?!
Actually...
I kind of liked it.
Do me again.
It was in the rose bushes.
You can't just... sew it back on... can you?
I could.
Hello.
You can use me...
I mean, mine.
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- May.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Adam.
You want to smoke a smoke with me?
You got to puff.
So, do you make your own clothes?
Yes.
That's cool.
Thank you, Adam.
You're welcome, May.
I love your hands.
I think they're beautiful.
I used to be a hand model.
- I could see you doing that.
- I'm kidding, May.
Whoa!
Oh!
Well...
Race cars.
What's that?
Oh, yeah.
My, uh... girlfriend bought me these.
Anyway.
You know, I meant, my ex-girlfriend... bought them for me.
Practice.
I'll see you around, May.
"Hey, see you around, right?"
I'm so sorry that...
I tripped in front of you at the coffee shop.
Maybe we could... we could do something.
"See you around."
"See you around, right?"
Hello, happy!
Dr. Zarkizein needs you to do a fecosam on the miscitta.
Does that make any sense to you?
Fecal exam on Miss Kitty.
No problem.
Oh, excuse me.
Hey!
What's up, May?
I was just about to... about to have lunch.
Wow, you look great!
You hungry?
I will cut.
And you pick.
Good choice.
So what do you do, May?
I work at the animal hospital.
And I sew.
Okay.
Animal hospital.
Some people think it's kind of gross.
I love gross.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Disgust me, please.
Okay.
A couple of weeks ago, this old man comes in and says his dog is dying.
And he begs us to save it.
A 90-pound black Lab named Seymour.
We take him in and run some tests and we find that he has a twisted bowel.
And he needs to be operated on immediately.
So, we shave Seymour's tummy, we cut him open and we take out a piece of intestine about, about the size of a hot-dog.
Everything went smooth, but... when we went to sew
Seymour back up, we realized we were out of the heavy sutures that you're supposed to use for large dogs.
So the doctor decided if we tripled up on cat sutures that should do the trick.
Well, a few days go by and the old man calls up hysterical.
The cat sutures had burst when he was at work.
And by the time he got home,
Seymour was sprawled out on the back porch with his guts spread all over the concrete.
And the fence was soaked in blood all the way around the yard.
It was a mess.
I had to sew that one back up.
So, I guess your job takes lots of guts.
Lots.
Why are those kids touching everything like that?
They're blind kids.
They're from the day care center around the block.
Dang, I got to go.
There's an Argenta playing at the Beverly in 15 minutes.
I took the afternoon off.
They're showing "Trauma."
- Is that a movie?
- You've never seen "Trauma"?
Don't go.
What?
Nothing.
I should probably get back to work, anyway.
Thank you for the sandwich... and the cigarette.
I got to see this movie, but maybe I can see you again sometime.
How about tonight?
I got this thing tonight, but...
- maybe after.
- Great!
All right.
I look forward to it, May.
You want to take it with you?
Thanks for the advice, doll.
So... what were you doing to me that day at the coffee shop?
I'm so embarrassed.
Why?
I've never had a boyfriend before.
Do you like me, Adam?
Sure, I do.
You don't think I'm weird?
I do think you're weird.
- I knew that.
- I like weird.
I like weird a lot.
You are perfect, aren't you?
Nobody's perfect.
You're perfect.
You want to see my room?
Does this stuff freak you out?
Nothing freaks me out.
That's right, it wouldn't, would it?
You're on to me.
I'm a psycho.
Got you.
It's pretty cool, huh?
Whoa! Jesus Christ!
Who taught you how to kiss?
Suzie.
Who taught you how to kiss?!
Ah!
What's the haps, doll?
What happened to your hand?
Scupel.
You're funny.
You want to watch me file?
Hey.
We got the whole place to ourselves.
Let's dance.
Listen, they're serenading us.
We have to dance now.
Oh.
Please, please, please.
Please.
So, are you going to dance with me or what?
- Do you like pussy?
- What?!
Cats?
Do you like pussycats?
Jeez, you're a nasty little thing, aren't you?
Do you like Lupe?
My landlady's a real bitch.
I have to get rid of her.
Your landlady?
No, dummy, the cat.
You're her only hope.
Oh, come on.
Lupe will keep you company when you're all alone.
Besides, she'll remind you of me.
- Okay.
- Wonderful!
Oh, look at the time.
I have to go.
It's girls' night out tonight.
You want to come?
I know.
You need your beauty rest.
Not much of it, though.
Please leave a message after the scream.
Hello, Adam, this is May.
I was just wondering if you would like to be together again...
Get together again sometime.
I had such a good time last night.
That's my number.
Call me.
Anytime.
I look forward to seeing you again.
Whoa! Jesus Christ!
May, you scared the hell out of me!
What are you doing out here?
Nothing.
How long have you been standing out here?
Since about 2:00.
You haven't really been standing out here for two hours, have you?
What do you think?
Look, I got your message.
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.
I've been really busy with this movie.
You made a movie?
In college before I dropped out.
I just finished putting it together.
Can I see it?
I'll make you macaroni and cheese.
Go to a movie, huh?
Sounds like a date.
I dig your place.
It's really... neat.
Is this Gatorade?
Cool.
You'll never believe what I had to do at work today.
You ready?
Roll 'em.
Roll 'em.
So?
What did you think?
It was sweet.
It was sweet?
I don't think she could have gotten his whole finger in one bite, though.
That part was kind of far-fetched.
Okay, okay, breathe
Oh, God damn it!
What the fuck is that?
- Oh, fuck, I'm bleeding.
- I know.
May, what are you doing?
Please.
I need a towel.
I think...
I think I'm gonna go.
What?
I'll see you around.
But it's just like your movie.
May, this is weird.
You like weird.
Not that weird.
I told you to face the goddamn wall!
Oops!
It fall down.
Moy, you help me.
Doctor, this delivery guy is insisting that you sign for this.
I'm in surgery, Polly, please!
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
Kitty live now.
- What are you doing?
- What?
Take it outside, man.
So, what's up, bro'?
What do you think?
Fuck, she's pretty.
I don't think she's playing with a full deck.
- That's not what you wanted.
- True.
At least you know she's not out of her mind.
You know what, we're not talking about May anymore.
I've successfully escaped that lunatic.
Who's May?
Some weird chick
Adam just dumped.
How's your lip?
Stow it, all right?
Would you, please?
I see. May I?
So what if she likes your hands?
Just keep them away from her face.
You're a prick, you know that?
- Yeah, do some more pushups.
- Fuck you.
What's up, doll?
This is Polly.
I'm just sitting here in my nightie.
I wanted to know how my little puss-puss was.
Come on over if you get this, okay?
What's giving you the sads, doll?
Oh.
No frumpy faces allowed in this place.
I wanted to kiss you since I first saw you.
Is this what was bugging you?
I wasn't bugged.
Just angry at someone.
Not me, I hope.
No, not you.
Do you feel weird doing this?
I am weird.
I love weird.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
About me?
Dead.
Can you help us with something?
I saw some kids playing in the park and I was wondering if I could volunteer to help watch them.
What kind of kids were they?
Retarded, deaf, crippled, dumb?
They were blind.
So you want to work at the day care center?
Would it be the same kids?
What's the difference?
You only like a certain type of blind kids?
May Kennedy?
Lucille.
Let's introduce you to the kids.
Do you think
I could meet her first?
Who, Petey?
We can try.
She usually likes being left alone.
Nobody likes to be alone.
Hey, Petey, I got someone here who wants to meet you.
Go away, sniggel-head.
You are so mean to me, Petey.
Good luck.
What are you making, Petey?
Ashtray.
You smoke?
No.
Then who are you making the ash tray for, Petey?
You smoke.
Yes, I do.
Then you can have it when I'm done.
How you doing, May?
Great, actually.
Making new friends.
Right and left.
Lovely.
Lupe, this is Adam.
It's cute.
How are you doing?
Aw, man, this thing is broke.
I'm gonna have to go down to the Fluff and Fold.
Call me sometime?
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you around, May.
May!
What's up?
Who is it, Polly?
Who is that?
An opportunity
I just couldn't pass up.
Oh.
You want to join us?
Well, then can we do something tomorrow, May?
I got to hit this.
I don't understand.
You're jealous!
- What's going on out there?
- Shut up, hooker!
Oh, May, look.
I can kick her out if you really want me to.
You know you're my main mama.
Come here, Lup.
Come here.
Come on.
Come on, girl, it's been a really rough couple of days.
Shut up!
Thank you.
Hello?
- Is Adam there?
- Hey, what's up?
Not much.
How did you know it was me?
Hello?
Who is this?
May, silly.
What are you doing tonight?
Hello?
Why?
I was just thinking we could get together and do something.
I have plans.
Oh.
Quiet!
Hello? Who are you talking to?
What about tomorrow night?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Okay, what time?
I'll wait.
Don't do that.
No, no, no. It's okay.
I'll wait.
I got to go, May.
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you tomorrow then.
Goodbye, May.
I hate you.
Who can tell me what this is?
We don't know,
May, what is it?
Petey, come here and see if you can figure it out.
I don't know.
Come on, Petey, you can try harder than that.
I don't know.
All right,
I'll tell you what it is.
What, what is it?
This is my best friend.
My best friend.
And I didn't even realize it until just last night.
It's just a box.
- Her friend must be inside.
- That's very good, Deirdre.
Take it out.
I can't.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
Come on, May, let it out.
We want to meet your friend.
No, I...
I can't. She's special.
She doesn't come out.
She always stays in.
She's very fragile.
Petey.
Stop it!
- She's out!
- No!
- The floor!
- Glass!
Don't!
Glass! Ow!
This is May Kennedy.
Please leave your numbers.
Hello.
Where are you, doll?
I think Dr. Zarkizein is upset.
Either that or he has a kidney infection.
I'm not sure.
Either way, you need to get your cute butt in here.
You've missed two days in a row.
Are you all right?
I miss you. Kisses.
Call me, okay?
Ah.
Oh, Lupe.
I'll miss petting your pretty fur.
Are you okay?
So many pretty parts and no pretty holes.
No shit.
What's your name?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, you want to go get some Jujubes with me?
What's the point?
I'm just trying to be friendly.
Sorry.
Hmm...
Shit, man,
I can live off of these.
It's getting hella hot.
You mind if I take off my shirt?
- Do what you want.
- All right.
I love your tattoo.
Thanks.
Ah.
Fuck!
I'm still burning up.
Do you have any ice cubes
I can rub on my nipples?
Freeze!
That's the idea.
Stop!
What the fuck is that?
- A friend.
- Whoa.
This is some sick shit.
So... are we best friends now that you've seen what's inside my freezer?
You fucking freak.
I'm not going to be your friend.
I need more parts.
Hey, May.
Hey, dude, what's up?
Not much.
What are you reading about?
Amputation.
- Is that for work?
- Nope.
It's just for fun.
Listen, May,
I'm sorry things didn't work out between us.
L... you know.
It just didn't feel right.
It doesn't feel right, you know?
I understand now...
Adam.
I understand.
Friends?
Okay. All right.
I really have to go.
Later hands.
Right. All right.
See you around.
How's Lupe?
- In pieces.
- Is she sad about something?
She does get depressed.
- She doesn't seem happy.
- Oh.
Can I ask what you're doing?
I want to make a blouse for you.
Kind of an apology present for the other night and my behavior.
Oh, May, that is so sweet.
Polly, are you back there, sweetie?
Back here.
Did you bring my lunch?
Oh...
May, I would like you to meet a new friend of mine.
Her name's Ambrosia.
Nice gams.
Aren't they?
Can I get a few more measurements?
Have you ever thought about having this removed?
My grandma said it's imperfections that make you special.
What do you think?
Freak.
Hello, Polly, this is May.
Happy Halloween.
I was thinking about popping by later to bring you your new blouse.
Show you my costume.
Give me a call if that's cool.
Miss you.
Kisses.
Call me, okay?
If you can't find a friend, make one.
Hello, May.
Hello, Polly.
Slick duds.
Thank you.
I was going to call you tonight, but...
I've been so busy.
What are you doing right now?
Nothing.
I'm starting to understand what the doctor's saying
20% of the time now.
It's funny because I always thought it was the doctor's writing that was supposed to be incomprehensible.
Maybe it's different with animal doctors.
Ah, that's better.
Are you expecting someone?
Did you forget my blouse?
No?!
You're not sore about me and Ambrosia, are you?
I'm not sore.
You understand it's not serious, right?
It's just a piece of ass.
Whoa!
Whoa.
Oh, please don't hurt me, May.
Pleasey-please.
I trust you.
I know you would never hurt me, May.
What are you doing here?
Where's Polly?
In the head.
Polly, hurry up in there!
I've been drinking vodka all night and I have to piss like a racehorse!
You have really beautiful legs.
I thought they were gams?
Gams, stems, wheels, whatever.
Give us a little spin, doll.
Huh?
Turn around for me.
You are so fucking weird.
I don't know what Polly sees in you.
Polly doesn't see anything.
Turn around, Miss Grable.
Okay, doll.
How was that?
Beautiful.
Sweet costume.
You got any cold ones in there?
Yes, I do.
What are you doing here?
Hello.
Anyone home?
I need them, Adam.
Listen, sister,
Adam's taken for the evening.
I like your earrings.
Thanks.
Nice costume.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
Just like one of your movies, Adam.
May... what are you doing here?
This is May?
Do you want to come in for a drink or something?
Thank you.
You should have called.
Would you have answered?
If I was home, yes.
Doesn't matter.
I didn't come here to see you.
Vodka okay?
Sounds great.
Did something happen?
Touch me.
Touch my face.
Go on, Adam, touch my face.
- Stop that!
- These hands are mine now, honey.
No, they are mine, quagledoo.
Fuck you. What is that,
Russian or something?
Touch my face.
Yeah, fucking go on, asshole.
Fucking touch away,
I don't give a shit.
Um...
Okay,
I'm pretty drunk and I'm feeling queasy and I just wish you would leave.
Fine, you know what,
I'm out of here.
Not you, dumbshit.
Dumbshit?
I guess that would be me.
You're not going to touch my face?
Fine, I'll touch your face.
You're going to look perfect.
You have all of the parts.
Words can't describe.
But I don't have to talk to you, do I?
I can just... feel.
And you'll feel it right here, too.
Right.
You can't see me.
Can't see me.
See me!
All I want... is see me.
What...
# Bring us all the children #
# Because they are sweet #
# Toss them up into the air #
# They come down and swing their feet #
# Twirling all the while #
# Tumbling in a pile #
# They are good #
# What a treat #
# Bring us all the children #
# Just when they are sweet #
# Wanderlust and packed with pride #
# When they laugh and go inside #
# Echoing all the while #
# Tumbling in a pile #
# They are good #
# Good to eat #

# I was made to love you #
# The things that I see #
# Don't know what they mean #
# But this I threw in #
# Good to be all dolled up #
# The things that we see #
# You never come clean #
# But you know what we mean #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be broken #
# Good to be. #
Bingo!
Fucking hell.
Fucking hell.
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.
If you wanna get 'em out of here.
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...
I know who you are.
I know what you think...
If you don't wanna get hurt, keep your mouth shut and don't move.
The chimps are infected. They're highly contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.
- Infected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.
Infected with what?
Rage.
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.
No! No! No!
Listen, you sick bastard, we're taking your torture victims with us.
We'll get you out of here.
The animals are contagious. The infection is in their blood and saliva. One bite...
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!
Get it off! Help me!
Get it off! Get it off!
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!
Oh, my God!
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!
Oh, God...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Father?
Father, are you OK?
Oh, shouldn't have done that.
Shouldn't have done that.
Shit!
Over here!
- Over here!
- Come on!
Go, go, go!
Keep going!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?
Let's go! Let's go!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!
Come on!
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.
The giraffe falls over.
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there. "
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".
He's completely humourless.
You two should get on like a house on fire.
So who are you?
You're from the hospital.
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
I'm a bicycle courier.
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...
I'm hallucinating or I'm...
What's your name?
Jim.
I'm Mark. This is Selena.
OK, Jim.
I've got some bad news.
It started as rioting, and right from the beginning you knew this was different.
Because it was happening in small villages, market towns.
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.
It was a virus.
An infection.
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.
It was the blood.
There was something in the blood.
By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.
The infection was everywhere.
The army blockades were overrun.
And that's when the exodus started.
The day before broadcasting stopped, there were reports of Infection in Paris and New York.
We didn't hear anything more after that.
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.
Of course there's a government!
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...
No, there's no government, no police, no army.
No TV, no radio, no electricity.
You're the first uninfected person we've seen in six days.
Where's your family?
They're dead. Like Selena's.
Yours will be dead too.
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?
You'll go and come back, yeah?
- You won't.
- Yes!
No one ever comes back.
So lesson one.
You never go anywhere alone unless you've got no choice.
Lesson two.
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.
We'll take you tomorrow.
We'll all go and find your dead parents together, OK?
Eat.
If you want her to slow down, you'll have to say.
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.
- Anyone...
- I understand!
OK.
Jim...
Wait!
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.
I'm not grateful.
My... parents and my sister, we went to Paddington Station, hoping maybe we could get on a plane, maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.
I remember my dad had all this cash, even though cash was completely useless.
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.
Crowd was surging.
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.
I remember the ground was soft.
I looked down and I was standing on all these people.
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...
Somewhere in the crowd there were Infected. It spread fast.
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.
And I got up on top of this kiosk.
Looking down, you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't.
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.
My dad.
His face...
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.
We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.
Jim.
- You're back.
- Yeah.
- How was it?
- Fine.
Give me a drink of that, will ya?
- It's empty.
- Ha!
Here.
I'll start working on them, then.
Mark! Mark!
Selena! Help!
It's clear.
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?
And his daughter. From four doors down.
- Were you bitten?
- No.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
No.
Mark?
Wait...
Get that cleaned off.
Do you have any clothes here?
Um... I... Yes.
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.
How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.
If someone gets infected, you've about 20 seconds to kill them.
It might be your brother, your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.
Just so you know where you stand, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?
Do you want us to find a cure and save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?
Plans are pointless.
Staying alive's as good as it gets.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Let's go.
What is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys?
Stop talking. It's a long way up.
Do you need a break?
- You?
- No.
Now I do need a break.
What's up?
Nothin'.
I got a headache.
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.
You've got no fat on you and all you've had to eat is sugar.
So you're crashing.
There isn't a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar. As for sugar,
Pepsi or Lilt?
Do you have any Tango?
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.
Quiet! That's an Infected.
Oh no, they're in. Move!
Wait up, Selena!
Wait for me, please!
Please, Selena! Please!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Run!
- Wait!
Please! For fuck's sake!
Selena!
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!
Thank you. Thank you.
Open the door!
Open the door!
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?
What?
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.
Go in. Go in!
So, I'm Frank, anyway.
Jim.
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.
This is my daughter Hannah.
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
Come on.
So...
This is great. Just great.
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.
Why don't you all sit down and...
Hannah, what have we got to offer?
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.
Great. Crème de menthe.
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.
Get comfortable.
- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.
Top cupboard.
So this is your place?
It's nice.
There.
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.
Cheers.
You OK in there, Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.
You'll have to use the bucket.
Have to empty it each morning.
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.
It's fine.
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.
We have a spare room.
In there.
Are you and Selena...?
No. No, no, no.
Um...
I'll take the living room. It's fine.
Right.
No, I mean, yeah.
So, um...
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.
Very spruce.
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.
Probably need us more than we need them.
I think they're good people.
- Good people?
- Yeah.
You should be more concerned about whether they're gonna slow you down.
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.
I wouldn't.
Then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Selena...
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.
And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.
Sure.
No, look...
I mean, thank you.
And I mean, sure.
Goodnight, Jim.
Goodnight.
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.
I thought we'd be OK with the water from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.
But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe.
You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant.
They're all empty.
Hasn't rained in ten days.
You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation.
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.
You'd never think it.
Needing rain so badly.
Not in fucking England!
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.
If you can hear this, you're not alone.
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.
We are soldiers and we are armed.
Oh, my God. Soldiers.
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.
- It's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.
But this is where it's telling us to go.
Just there.
The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
"We"?
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.
But with other people...
If it's a recording, the soldiers who made it could be dead.
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!
Or die here.
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.
We need each other.
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.
So we have to try and get there.
Get there how?
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.
- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.
Let's just get it done.
No, no.
No. See, this is a really shit idea.
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars...
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!
Hold on!
Dad!
Fuck!
The world's worst place to get a flat.
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?
Hear what?
Right, I've done it.
Dad?
Jesus Christ!
Fucking rats!
They're running from the Infected.
Move it!
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!
Lift, lift!
- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!
Come on, Hannah!
Almost.
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.
Three, two, one, drop it!
- Get in the car!
- Come on!
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!
Whoo!
Goodbye, you fuckers!
Frank, stop the cab.
Let's shop.
You...
You...
You...
Anybody seen any buns?
Hmm. Irradiated.
Don't take anything that needs to be cooked, OK?
I think you can eat that raw.
Decaffeinated coffee...
Put that back.
Can't just take any crap.
If I never see another chocolate bar again, it'll be too soon.
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.
Warm but not aggressive.
Peaty aftertaste.
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.
Either we do this now or we're walking.
Not you.
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?
You heard.
Where are you going?
We've got enough food, Jim.
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
Like going on holidays with your aunt!
Oh, Jesus.
Hello?
I hate you!
Find anything?
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.
OK, we're done here.
OK, Hannah.
Easy. Brake!
Brake, brake!
Out.
Mmmm! Oh my God!
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.
What did you say?
The raisins. They're so moist.
Look over here.
Like a family.
Do you think they're infected?
No.
They're doing just fine.
Come on. Let's eat!
Know what I was thinking?
That you'll never hear another piece of original music again.
You'll never read a book that hasn't already been written, or see a film that hasn't already been shot.
Um... that's what you were thinking.
No.
I was thinking I was wrong.
About what?
All the death.
All this shit.
It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because...
Well, she's got her dad and he's got his daughter. So...
Cheeky monkey!
I was wrong when I said staying alive is as good as it gets.
See, that's what I was thinking.
Was it?
Mm. You stole my thought.
Sorry.
That's OK.
You can keep it.
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.
I can't sleep.
Me neither.
Doesn't feel safe, does it?
Outside like this.
I think we're safe enough.
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Hey, Selena...
What? What is it?
How'd you get to sleep?
Bloody hell. Must've needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.
Oh, great. Valium.
Not only will we be able to get to sleep but if we're attacked in the middle of the night, we won't even care.
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.
Can I, Dad?
I don't think so, sweetheart.
Please?
- No.
- I can't sleep.
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.
Night-night.
You're a big softie, Frank.
Frank?
Hannah?
Frank?
Hello? Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Shh...
You're having a bad dream, that's all.
Thanks, Dad.
Come on, sleepyhead.
Come on, Babe Ruth.
Hurry up.
- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.
- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!
Our location is the 42nd blockade, the M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us. Please!
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.
Must be Manchester.
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.
No fire crews to put it out.
42nd blockade.
This is it.
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.
Nothing.
I can't believe it.
Frank...
Frank!
- We have to go.
- Yeah.
Go fucking where?!
Get out of it.
Get out of it!
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Sorry I lost my temper.
Hannah...
I love you very much.
- What?
- Keep away from me.
Stay where you are.
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!
What's wrong? Dad!
Jim! Jim, he's infected!
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!
Kill him!
Stay away from him!
Keep away from the body!
Dad?
Three survivors. One male, two female.
I repeat, one male, two female.
ETA, 15.
Put the kettle on.
I'm Major Henry West.
- Welcome.
- Jim.
Hello, Jim.
Hello.
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water.
So you can all have a shower.
You look like you need one. Please.
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do, you fucking Doris!
Run him over!
How is she doing?
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.
It's all fucked.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, don't do that.
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough, strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.
I want her to be OK.
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.
Now it's all just fucked.
So you heard our broadcast?
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base with helicopters and a field hospital.
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.
Yeah.
As I said before, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined.
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.
The fire drove hundreds of Infected out of Manchester.
The surrounding area's teeming with them.
But don't worry.
You're quite safe here.
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights which we've rigged up to a generator.
High perimeter wall which helps.
And we've been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines.
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild. Start again.
The belly of the house. The heart.
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot water. The first step towards civilisation.
The kitchen.
Here you are. I'll swap you.
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.
Jones, our resident tin opener.
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.
I can't wait.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim.
Jim, Mailer.
Got infected two days ago.
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck.
Keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something about Infection.
Have him teach me.
And has he?
In a way.
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.
Farm crops, raise livestock.
He's telling me he's futureless.
And eventually he'll tell me how long the Infected take to starve to death.
? You'll have to wait and see
? Hope it's chips, it's chips
? We hope it's chips, it's chips
Hat.
So, what have we here?
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...
- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well.
- To new friends.
- New friends.
Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off?
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
Get rid of it.
Doris, you twat.
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?
I can't tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen.
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.
You muppet! Look at him, eh?
He's still waiting for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.
If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, Man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye.
So if the infection wipes us all out,
that is a return to normality.
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.
Have you met our New Age sergeant?
Our spiritual guru.
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why did you join the army in the first place?
This is what I've seen in the four weeks since Infection.
People killing people.
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...
As far back as I care to remember, people killing people.
Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now.
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.
He's one of the people you're talking about.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Enemy in front!
Mick, I fucking got one!
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!
Fucking hell! He bounced!
Cease fire!
I ain't never seen that in my life!
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!
- Clear.
- Clear.
Yeah, yeah, clear.
Oh, hello!
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't gonna be needing this any more.
Cos you got me to protect you now.
You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper, you just come and see me.
Fuck you!
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.
How about right now?
Mitchell!
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go picking a fight with me, son.
Sergeant Farrell!
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Slow down.
- Sergeant?
- Sir.
Clear the bodies off the lawn.
The rest of you, go with him.
My apologies.
Drink?
Look, we're grateful, OK?
We're very grateful for your protection but if we're gonna stay here...
- Who have you killed?
- No one.
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody.
I killed... I killed a boy.
A child?
Yes.
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.
Survival.
I understand.
I promised them women.
What?
Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in his mouth.
He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future.
What could I say to him?
We fight off the Infected or we wait until they starve to death and then what?
What do nine men do except wait to die themselves?
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio broadcasting and I promised them women.
Because women mean a future.
Selena! Hannah!
- What is it?
- We have to go.
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!
Come on!
We get in the car and we go!
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!
You can't do this!
Right, get him!
I want to give you a chance.
You can be with us.
But I can't let them go.
OK, Jim? OK.
Him too.
Smithers says
"Women and semen don't mix. "
And Mr Burns says
"We all know what you think, Smithers. "
And that was my favourite joke in The Simpsons.
That's what they're doing a few hundred miles away, across the Channel,
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner and watching the fucking Simpsons!
They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives.
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator because the OC has gone insane!
Starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even stopped.
Just imagine, just think about it.
How could Infection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? It can be stopped.
Right now TVs are playing and planes are flying and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal.
Think! Actually think about it.
What would you do with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us.
"There is no Infection.
It's just people killing people. " He's insane!
Time to go.
Quarantine?
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.
Mitchell, I swear to God it's gonna end badly for you.
Move.
Come on, move! Get up!
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!
Get up!
Move your fucking arse!
Come on then, you fucking pansies. Do me first.
No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.
- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em!
- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!
Is that how you'd let your sergeant go out, Jones?
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?
I'm gonna enjoy this.
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!
Where are you?
- Can you see him?
- Through there!
Oh no. We're fucked.
We're fucked!
Relax.
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.
And no shooter.
He's dead.
The first thing we're going to do is make you look more presentable.
The lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe which she certainly has no use for.
You can't do it to Hannah.
Go to the master bedroom, pick out a wide selection.
Yes, sir.
No...
Ladies...
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.
Selena!
Whoa, whoa, relax!
Selena!
Selena! Selena!
You need to leave me alone with Hannah. OK?
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.
If you want us to get changed, you have to leave the room. OK?
It's just polite.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.
Are you trying to kill me?
No, sweetheart.
I'm making you not care. OK?
What you doing?!
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!
Move!
Stay here and put the dresses on.
Let's go! Go!
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.
Davis?
Fuck it!
- What was that?
- Lightning.
I heard something.
It sounded like a Claymore to me.
All right, I'll go and hit the floods, take a butcher's.
Girls, keep an eye on him, will ya?
Those pills,
I think they're having an effect.
I can feel them. And...
I don't feel sleepy.
But...
They've been a long time.
What are you gonna do if they don't come back?
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?
Is that the way it works?
Shut up.
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...
They're dead.
And you're gonna be next.
- Get up!
- Whoa!
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.
Get him off me!
Get him off me!
It's Jones! It's Jones!
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?
Don't just stand there, you soppy cunt! Get after them!
You two, in there! Move!
Come on, then!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
Come on up!
Col!
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!
Sorry...
- Sir...
- Shh.
Shh.
Hannah?
Hannah?
Selena?
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!
Don't fucking leave me!
Come on!
Move!
Move! Move!
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place somewhere. Just you and me.
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.
It's gonna be OK.
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.
But I thought he was biting you.
I was kissing her. Are you stoned?
It's a long story.
We have to get out of here. Come on!
Come on! Move!
You killed all my boys.
Wait...
Hannah!
Hannah? Hannah!
Hannah!
Get in.
They're locked.
The gates are locked!
Fucking do it!
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!
Not the curtains as well.
You looked all right in this, you know.
It's coming!
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!
- I can't hear anything!
- I told you, I heard it!
Go.
Do you think he saw us this time?
Of all the haunted places in the United States,
St. Francisville, Louisiana, has the highest number of reported hauntings.
As a filmmaker and a fan of horror,
I decided to take four people with video cameras, teach them to hunt ghosts, and lock them in a St. Francisville estate overnight.
The events that you are about to see take place in one evening, and everything you see is real.
I'm qualified for this experiment because...
I'm a filmmaker, and they need somebody who's quick on their feet, with a good sensibility of where the camera should go, and what kind of feelings you should give the audience, what kind of camera angles
I'm gonna throw at you guys, so that's why I'm qualified.
I know I qualify for this experiment because I've had a long history of interest in the paranormal and the metaphysical world.
I think I'm qualified for this experiment because I've had my own ghost experiences.
I've never actually chased them, but... if I'd known there were ways to do it like I do now,
I definitely would have, so...
Well, I think I'm qualified for this experiment because I was a history major in college...
I thought maybe we would start out with the basic stuff, motion detectors.
We'll have them ready for you before you go into the house.
The idea behind them is, when all of this first started, back in the '20s and '30s, when people really started to do investigations, they used to keep jars of flour with them all the time, and the flour would be sprinkled on the floor.
If anybody passed through the area, ghost or otherwise, they would leave footprints behind.
This is probably the simplest meter to use.
It's a digital meter.
All you do is turn it on, you get a readout on it... so that it tells you exactly what it is you're looking for.
The only problem with a meter like this is that it does not tune out... natural or artificial sources of electromagnetic energy.
This is a standard tri-field meter.
This one doesn't do a combination of electrical and magnetic, it only does magnetic.
Now, these "phaser-like" devices-- this is an infrared non-contact thermometer.
We call them "thermo-scanners," because it's easy to remember.
What this does is, you push this button, you fire it like you would a gun, and it takes instantaneous temperature readings from the air.
The theory is that ghosts, when they're disrupting the electromagnetic field, because that's what they're comprised of-- to be able to manifest, they need energy.
To get energy, they pull it from the atmosphere around them.
When they do, it makes the temperature drop.
That's why when you hear, or read anything about ghosts, you always hear about "cold spots."
That's the scientific explanation of a cold spot.
To get proof would be awesome.
It would kinda prove... my own ghost stories in a way, you know?
So... and whether or not we can get the ghosts to move on, or whatever it is to leave the house alone,
I guess that's great for the people who live there.
If I lived in a haunted house,
I wouldn't want the ghosts to leave.
It would be nice to have them.
How do I feel about going into the house?
I feel really nervous,
I feel really anxious.
My stomach's been on edge this morning, but I feel excited 'cause--
I'm excited because it's totally new, and it's gonna be this real challenge for me, because
I get really scared.
I'm not exactly too sure whether ghosts exist or not,
I think it gets a little bit more deeper than that, because if there are ghosts, then that means there's gotta be something else... outside this life.
That's something
I'd like to believe in, so I hope that going in there,
I will see something that will confirm any beliefs... that I've had as a child, or right now-- about what happens after death.
I think that my curiosity will probably outweigh the fear...
At least, I'm hoping.
I think that one of my main goals that I personally set for myself was that I wanted to face my fears now.
If you know very much about St. Francisville at all, it is kind of a cluster-- a historic cluster of haunted houses--
I'll be honest with you.
Almost every plantation around here has a ghost story of one sort or another, a lot of them.
You've got a lot of violence, history, the Civil War, slavery, all combined.
Something about this area seems to attract that kind of thing.
The house was chosen, mostly, for the reason that it may be connected to these murders in some way.
That's all I want to tell you.
I don't wanna give you particulars.
I don't wanna tell you about ghost sightings that have taken place.
I'd rather you guys go in cold, and investigate on your own.
Sarah, tell me about
Madame Lullory.
Madame was the crème de la crème of New Orleans aristocracy.
She lived on Royal Street, in the most modern house in New Orleans, the first with gas lighting, with her third husband, Dr. Lullory, and her two daughters from previous marriages.
One night, Madame was having a Mardi Gras ball, and she once again excused herself from the room.
She left... people heard muffled sounds, and things like that.
Madame came back, and she was very excited.
Shortly thereafter, a fire broke out in the kitchen.
As it turns out, when the fire department arrived, there was an aged slave in the kitchen, and she had deliberately set fire to the house rather than continuing to live in the conditions she was living in.
She was chained to the wall, with no more than two foot of chain.
Over a year she'd been chained there.
She couldn't leave the kitchen.
All she did was cook and sleep on the kitchen floor.
So she deliberately set fire to the kitchen, hoping to escape.
When the fire department saw this, it piqued their interest about Madame.
They'd heard the rumors, but never really knew if it was true.
So with the excuse of looking for burning embers, they searched the house room by room.
This was a 40 room mansion.
It was tremendous, three floors.
It was half of a square block-- it was a beautiful house.
They searched room by room, painstakingly looking under every piece of furniture and every closet,
Iooking for anything that would validate the rumors about Madame.
They finally got into the attic, and there was a room that seemed to be locked from the inside.
They called more people and forced the door open.
When the door opened, they were immediately sent back by what they thought was the stench of death.
But on further examination, it seemed everyone was alive in the room.
The first person they saw was a small 12-year-old boy who, half of his face had been peeled away, his skin removed, and his muscle tissue and his veins and his bones were exposed.
The wound had since been infested with disease and insects.
And he was kept alive.
He was force fed.
He was taken care of well enough so that he stayed alive.
Another woman, they believe his mother, was forced into a cage no bigger than that the size of a medium dog so that all her joints were broken when she was forced into the cage.
When they took her out, her joints had reset at obscene angles so that she looked more like a crab than a human.
There was a gentleman tied down to a table.
It appeared that Madame attempted to perform a castration on him.
Not a simple castration, it looked more...
Iike an early attempt at a sex change operation.
All about the room there were blood encrusted knives and devices that looked like medical equipment.
There were red-stained drinking cups and saucers.
There were bottles filled with red substances.
Later on, people examined them, and they did believe it was blood.
At the time that the firemen were searching the house,
Madame knew, "I'm busted.
They're gonna find me out."
So she was collecting some of her things into a coach below.
She had her coachman,
Arstesus, assisting her.
There was an angry mob gathering on the street below.
Arstesus drove the coach through the gate doors, through the angry crowd of people, and fled away.
Since then, nobody's had any actual proof of where Madame is.
Many people have their theories, though.
Some people believe that Madame may have fled to St. Francisville.
So, Priestess Jones, we're here in St. Francisville at a plantation that we feel the Lullorys might have come to when they fled the French Quarter.
We're sending in four young people into this house to investigate the possibility that the Lullorys did come here.
What kind of things do you think they should expect, or what kind of activity do you think they might find?
Maybe a heaviness.
People may sense that there's something in the room, but they just don't know what.
How dangerous could this be?
How much is there to fear from spirits?
The thing that one must be cautious of is that these energies will attach themselves to the people who may be leaving.
But it's a simple thing of just doing a cleansing, a prayer of protection...
So wait a minute, you're saying that they might bring out-- they might bring out spirits with them and take them with them?
You have a friend who actually lived in there?
Because it--
Tell me about that.
Yes, back in the 1960s a family bought the home.
They're some friends of ours and they grew up for a number of years in that mansion.
And they told some fascinating stories.
On dark, stormy nights, they could hear a young girl screaming out in the courtyard.
Oftentimes, as children, they would see a dark figure of a man walking up and down the balconies and it looked like he was covered in blood and chains.
They also saw the figure of a woman carrying a bullwhip who was screaming in French.
Who else could it be, but possibly
Delphina Lullory herself?
Throughout the years there's been newspaper documentation of occupants of the home experiencing the same type of things.
What types of activities might they expect if the Lullorys had been there continuing these practices?
If they were conducting the same sort of experimentations you'll have a high concentration of negative energy.
You're gonna have a lot of pain that's been left there, a lot of sadness and fear.
But more importantly than that, a lot of anger, particularly if, as in the case with the New Orleans location, there were bodies that were not found until many, many years later.
There's possibly even bodies that haven't been found yet.
So you're saying this could be dangerous?
I'd certainly think that... if there's some bodies that were never recovered, that those spirits are probably very, very angry.
They're also probably very anxious for people to know their story.
There's no telling what could happen.
Come on, everybody!
Look at that!
Oh, my God!
I think I need to tell everybody something.
When we get in there, we need to talk to that house.
I don't know if anything's in that house, but we need to tell it why we're here, what we're planning on doing, and asking for its permission.
It's for protection.
Hold up.
I gotta get my stuff.
Madison's creeping me out, dude.
She's not gonna hold up.
She's totally not gonna hold up.
I'm gonna smack her.
I'm serious.
- She's spooking herself out.
- Yeah.
A few things before we go in-- you guys are in here for the night.
You guys can come out when the dawn breaks on the horizon.
We shouldn't even go out on the balcony?
No, all the doors and windows are locked.
Are we going to have to separate?
No, at this point you guys don't separate.
- Can we open windows?
- The whole house is locked tight.
- The windows are shut?
- Yeah, the windows are-- the place is all barricaded.
You can get out through the front door, all right?
You are free to explore the entire place, okay?
So let me hand this to somebody.
Ghost hunter.
- I'm handing it to you.
- I hardly have hands.
How stuffy is that place?
Is there a lot of ventilation?
I guess you'll find out.
I brought a tank top, if I get hot.
You guys all set?
All right, there you go.
Where's the other camera?
- I have one.
- I'll give it to you now.
Bye, guys.
I cannot believe we're doing this.
It's so insane.
Let's check this place out.
Did anybody ever hear about how old this place is?
Let's not forget the food.
Oh, is this our food?
How nice of them.
One of us walks in, we'll hand it in.
- Are those Girl Scout cookies?
- No!
- We can't come out.
- We need to go in and talk first.
We gotta bring this food in.
We can't come out.
I'll go in and you can hand me the stuff.
No, it's not that.
We need to make peace with the house.
We gotta get all this stuff in, too.
Guys, come here.
It's so awesome.
What do I do with this food?
This is so awesome.
Tim, it's rad.
You know what?
I'm not a psychic, but I'm feeling kind of scared suddenly.
Guys, check this out!
It's so cool!
I've got hair standing on my arms.
Guys, I feel like there's no air in here.
It stinks.
- What's wrong? Madison?
- What?
What's wrong?
- Talk to me.
- I don't know, okay?
I don't know.
I've never felt like this.
- Like...?
- It just feels... it feels heavy, like there's something in this room.
I feel like there's something here.
That's what we're here for, so that's good.
You guys...
- What?
- What?
Where's Tim?
- He was right behind us.
- He came in with me.
Tim! Tim!
Hey, Tim!
Tim!
Boo!
Oh, my God!
I'm so gonna kill you!
My God!
Tim, you suck!
That was so funny, dude!
- That's not funny!
- It's perfect!
Guys, this is really serious.
We are in this house, we gotta take it seriously.
- It was a joke!
- My God! That's it!
- It wasn't funny.
- It was a joke.
That is it, Tim!
If you do that again...
Can we turn the lights on?
Like I wasn't freaked out enough!
Uh!
Tim, you're all right?
Tim, are you okay?
- Calm down, all right?
- Oh, my God!
It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, man!
- Tim, are you all right?
Oh, God! That's crazy!
- Tim, you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- Ryan, we're here for the night.
It's an electrical thing, okay?
It's an old house, this stuff happens.
Guys, can we get out of here?
I think this is the perfect time to make peace with the house.
Yes, let's go.
Let's make peace somewhere else.
- Come on, deep breaths.
- Something did that.
I know something did that.
I would like to say that myself,
Madison, Ryan,
Paul and Tim-- we're all in this house, and we would like to surround this house with white light.
We would like to surround ourselves with white light for protection.
White light, the protection of the universe and God.
We ask permission to be in this house we come in peace and we come to help.
We may not be able to understand everything, but we want to try.
- Amen.
- Okay.
Communication.
Hugely important. Got it?
Whatever you're feeling, keep it, all four of us.
There shouldn't be things between two or three people.
Nobody should be left out.
I promise to communicate everything.
I felt like I need to say a prayer.
We just had one.
- I need to say my own.
- Okay, say it, but I don't want this to be a prayer meeting all night.
Maybe you should say it out loud.
No, she needs her own.
Okay.
How do you guys feel?
I feel more afraid of my own fears than anything else.
- Really?
- Yes.
I was fine until chandeliers started falling out of the sky, and almost got me electrocuted.
It's weird when you walk into a place and suddenly get terrified.
I got this scared feeling,
I'm not even sure of what.
We need to make a home base.
So we should probably at least look at the first floor.
The kitchen obviously is not--
- This is a really good home base.
- This middle section?
I need to find an outlet.
We have to test the outlets.
There's one on the floor.
Let's set up our home base and find out what our missions are.
That's the most important thing.
First things first. Let's see if this light thing works.
Paul, be careful!
There! Beautiful.
- Oh, my God! There's light!
- Don't get too excited.
Don't get too excited, it's not going to stay this way.
Before we go further into the house exploring, let's stick together...
The light just worked but I know it's not going to stay on.
We don't know what to expect.
I gave a blessing for the house.
Actually, it was for me.
You see, I don't like being closed in.
But I really don't want to talk about that.
I don't think you should say what you don't like.
Don't even say what your fears are.
I'm feeling better now.
- You feeling better now?
- Just slightly.
Ghost Log One... narrowly escaped death by chandelier.
"Instructions.
Getting settled.
Locate the living room and set up base camp."
"Designate a team leader."
- Okay. You.
- I agree.
- Tim?
- I know...
You're behind the camera, you seem right.
Because, you know, your position here is that you have a gift we don't have.
You're feeling things we don't know.
So it's up to you to tell us if a room feels a certain way to you.
- We have our own intuition.
- Exactly. She's here for that.
- This is the temperature meter.
- Okay.
Just point it, like at the door, like that...
It says 75 degrees.
- So that means...
- That door is 75 degrees.
So that wall, too.
Every room we walk into, I'd like you to hit all four walls.
It's like a guest room,
I guess?
We'll call this one the Right
Room and that one the Left Room.
- Let's call it The Woodpecker.
- The men's parlor and the ladies'.
- The Woodpecker Room.
- The Woodpecker...
All right, that's cool.
Woodpecker Room.
Got that?
- The Woodpecker Room?
- Do you see why?
Turn around.
Okay, I see.
Did you guys notice that clock is not working?
No, it's not, no.
It says three minutes to 7:00.
- Hold on, I can't see
- What?
What was the meter reading in the last room?
It all averages to about an eight.
What was that?
- Who was there?
- Uh, something made a noise.
I thought it was a person.
I thought I saw something.
I thought I saw something, too.
Here, there is a noise.
I heard it.
Let's get the job done.
Here. Right here.
All right. This wall, reads 74 solid.
- I felt a cold spot.
- It's not cold here.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, there was a cold spot.
I don't feel anything.
It's 74.
- It's not cold over there.
- I don't feel it.
Here. Right here.
- It was creepy in there.
- Yeah, I felt that cold spot.
That scared me.
My adrenaline's been going.
I've never felt a cold spot.
I wish the girls would tell me.
Oh, there you go!
I felt another cold spot when I walked in.
- I was gonna say something.
- Yeah, say something.
Yeah, right here. Whoa!
Way up, way up over 100.
I'm feeling something right here.
It's just spiking.
- Look at that 70 on my wall.
- I'm creeped out, man.
It's that weird cold spot.
That and everything making noise...
You're creeping me out with that cold spot thing.
I'm serious, I wouldn't lie about that.
It was weird, wasn't it?
It was like on my skin.
You think all this is real?
- What do you think?
- I don't really think so yet, but it's scaring me, but I don't really think it's for real yet.
Yeah.
I'm scared because I'd be scared of the carnival haunted house.
I'm scared because we don't know the place, it's dark, and everybody's freaking me out with all these things.
Like every noise is freaking me out.
Maybe I should borrow a bowl, my stomach is like explosive, really powerful.
Everybody's watching your stomach.
- I'm serious!
- Can I throw up?
I feel like this thing can totally get me!
I haven't touched skin in years!
Is this haunted room actually stretching, or is it your imagination?
- Hey, yo!
- What?
- Get down here!
- What?
Did somebody call my name?
I heard somebody call my name.
Get down here!
I swear,
I've got goosebumps.
I really heard somebody whispering my name.
A man or a woman?
A man, in my right ear.
He said Madison.
Come on, you guys!
Hurry it up!
Oh! The door just opened.
- I saw it open.
- What happened?
I was in there, putting a battery in this thing,
I started walking in through that doorway right there...
- This doorway, right here...
- ( Ryan laughs )
She's getting nervous, that's all.
- You guys...
- Let him talk.
- I heard that.
- It's the kitchen.
It opened on its own!
- Yes, we just watched it.
- Camera wasn't on.
What? The camera wasn't on?
- I was putting the battery in.
- That's why it happened!
Do you know why ghosts-- people get so frustrated...?
'Cause people scream and say whatever they want.
Those people get really...
Listen, people get so frustrated because they go into a house and nothing happens.
It doesn't matter if the house flies if we don't get recordings.
This is an old house, and old houses creek, old houses do weird things, and I'm saying that every little thing... we cannot jump and freak out and think there's a ghost here.
Nobody's even listening.
I feel something by my right arm,
I feel something by my fingers, and I don't think it's a bad thing.
Can you appreciate that it's here to communicate?
- I appreciate it.
- Absolutely!
I'm saying that every little thing in the house, you cannot jump to a conclusion,
- "Oh, my God"!
- That is so funny!
There's no open windows in this place.
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell, but it's true, there's no open window.
I've got a really neat question.
It smells like oldness.
- The house smells like that.
- Let me smell it.
Let me smell it.
- Now you can smell me.
- It does, you guys.
- It totally does.
- It's an old man.
The one that said
Madison's name.
No, it wasn't an old man that said my name.
But it's the smell of an old guy, right?
But the guy that said my name sounded very young.
It's all right, we're in a haunted house.
It's bound to happen.
Okay, let's go.
I love all the ghosts.
That's the right attitude to have.
He's got it!
I don't love the ghosts.
No, you don't.
How would you like it if someone told you your house is haunted?
I'd love it!
I'd be so willing to live there.
- I felt another breeze go by me.
- Yeah, I feel it.
I did too.
- Whoo! Look at that!
- I was looking at that.
Oh, my gosh!
There was a light there at some point.
I've got a bad feeling something's gonna come out of that.
A good feeling.
- No, I don't have that feeling.
- You must hate ghosts tonight.
- Here... oh!
- I'm not sure of anything.
What?
There was a huge roach!
Don't freak out. I'm sorry.
It's huge!
But it's gotta be icky if there's no lights in here.
Can't you kill them?
Go! Move! Go away!
I love ghosts!
There's a draft in here...
I think it's a draft, too.
These were open so that we notice things.
What's that?
- That's not to the outside.
- That's a bathroom, I bet.
- It can't lead to outside.
- It's a bathroom, I bet.
- Want me to open it?
- I don't know.
Think someone's gonna jump out?
- It's not a bathroom.
- What is it?
Looks like a basement.
This is where the draft's coming from.
- I'll check it out.
- Let me go, too.
It's cold down here.
- ( step breaks )
- Ah!
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Check this out!
Ugh.
- Oh, my God!
- Let's see what's in there.
- This is medical shit.
- Oh, jeez! There's blood.
- Oh, put it back, please.
- There's blood on it.
Careful.
Just put it down.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hold on.
Wait, don't leave me alone back here!
You don't have to be afraid.
- Oh, like you're not!
- I was!
I'm writing dining room door opened.
I'm writing this down.
My heart's pumping...
We still gotta go into the attic.
So what are we calling this room?
Looks like a girl's room.
"Girl Room."
She's on the wall.
- Oh my God!
- Follow us this way.
- Stop, please!
- I didn't mean to scream.
You guys, I'm scared.
The door just went like this... and I saw it.
Do you understand?
It happens when the camera isn't in motion.
Do you understand it happens when-- it happens when the camera isn't on it.
Nothing happens when the camera's on it.
Could somebody turn the lights on, please?
It's not a bad thing.
I love all the ghosts.
I love...
Hey, guys, come here.
- I love all the ghosts.
- Listen.
I wanna show you what happened, so that you know.
It went like this.
It made a noise, and it scuffed, and you know what?
There isn't any...
There's a mark on the floor from where it scuffed.
No, there's not.
But it scuffed, it made like... a scuff noise, and it got my attention.
It did it because it wanted my attention.
I know it.
Great, no electricity up here, bro'.
Look, that door's open.
It has to be a closet.
- I ain't going in here.
- It's open?
- No.
- I'm holding out.
We're holding hands on bathroom duties.
We're going to the bathroom together, and you guys got to go.
- You want to hold my hand?
- Yeah.
I don't wanna go in there.
I wanna go now.
- Go ahead.
- I'll go in there with you.
You guys stay out here.
- You need a camera.
- No!
I'm not taking a camera.
No, we're not taking a camera in there.
We are not taking the camera in the bathroom.
No. Hell, no!
But it's for science.
- We are not taking it.
- It's for biology.
Come on.
- What?! What?!
- Come here, come here.
- No, no.
- You didn't hear it?
- I heard something.
- What was that?
I smell something bad.
What is that?
- That was me!
- That was him. I told you...
She's right, don't do that.
You guys,
I smell something.
- I smelled it right there.
- I did too. What is it?
What is that?
It was me. I farted.
- Don't do that!
- I was trying to scare her.
- Tim...
- Gross!
Look at this, you guys.
It's cold in here.
Something feels really strange in here.
Looks like a kid's room.
- I'll try to turn the light on.
- Be careful!
Hmm, it's nothing.
It's freezing.
What is up with this room?
I'll look under the bed.
Huh!
Hey, did you hear that?
- Huh? What?
- Shh!
- That!
- That what?
That music!
- There!
- I hear it!
It seems to be coming from over here.
I hear it too.
Paul, check this out.
What?
Paul, come here...
Please...
No, we shouldn't go in there.
- It's a cat!
- Oh, my God!
- Where did it come from?
- Aw, here, kitty, kitty!
- How did the cat get in here?
- Where did it come from?
See anything, Tim?
It's a music box.
- Wait a minute, wait!
- What?
There's something else down here...
- What?
- There's a hole in it.
There's something in here.
Tim...
Tim, talk to us.
What is it?!
Ugh.
- He's making me nervous.
- What is it, Tim?
Oh.
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
- Ugh.
- Uh...
What... is... that?
Here, set it down.
What's that?
Be careful!
- Careful, Tim.
- Don't do it.
Don't do it.
- It's a doll!
- It's a...
No, it's a doll!
It's a doll, okay?
- It's a doll.
- Can we get out of here?
Can we go?
- Just forget about it!
- Let's move on.
- It's a doll, all right?
- It's a doll.
- Sure?
- You know, let's just go.
Guys, we are headed to the attic.
I love all the ghosts.
Oh, my God!
- Hold hands.
- Did you see "Blair Witch"?
Welcome.
Ryan, nothing is there.
Ryan, nothing's happening.
Chill.
Did you see
"Blair Witch"?
Everything is okay.
You listening to me?
We're okay.
We come in peace.
It's okay, we're fine.
I know we're fine.
- These things are all right.
- Big, scary room.
I find this one small attic.
Okay, the meter isn't reading.
- There's not much of a reading.
But this room's another story.
I don't want to be last, guys.
Okay, listen.
- Let me say something.
- Goodbye.
Can I say something?
We're all protected by white light.
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath.
Listen, if there's anything here, it needs us.
- Is that...
- Do you know that?
- Yeah.
- What is that noise?
If there's anything here, it needs us. So we're here for it.
Okay. Right.
Is there a light? What's this?
Can I flip it?
- Okay, good.
- You watch that way.
- Yeah, I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come here.
You gotta shoot this.
There's shit moving.
Listen...
Okay, Ryan, calm down.
Get in here, Tim.
- Okay...
- God.
We know you're here, and you know that we're here.
But we're here in peace, and we're here to help.
- We need your cooperation.
- I love ghosts.
We need your cooperation.
We ask that you don't harm us.
And we're covered by white light.
You can't harm us. We will wish to communicate with you.
What are you saying?
We will wish to communicate.
Okay, why don't we go downstairs and get some sage?
Let's go.
There's no need to be here.
- All right.
- Let's go.
We'll see you later.
We really want to help.
- Please let us.
- Yeah, I'm with her.
We're going downstairs.
Ryan, hold up.
Ryan, wait. We're gonna sit down and we're gonna talk.
I think I got that on film.
Don't start laughing because I'm scared and afraid you'll start laughing.
- Ryan...
- Holy shit.
- Ryan, weren't you listening?
- Come on.
Come on.
When you go down--
Hey! Hey!
When you walk down the staircase, use the wall.
- I don't wanna go last.
- Come on, use the wall.
I feel good right now.
I feel clearing.
Home base, home base, home base.
Okay, let's sit down.
Let's regroup.
Oh, my God.
You jumped... you jumped like a bitch!
You fucking missed it.
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude...
You missed it.
Whenever the camera's not on, that's when it happened.
No, the camera caught it.
What fell? What fell?
Listen, do you understand?
I think it's me.
When I go into a room, something happens.
- You weren't in the kitchen.
- You weren't there for that.
The chair.
They don't know--
A chair. A chair like that flew across the room.
- What?
- It didn't fly across the room!
- It did, too!
- What?
It lifted up and tossed itself over.
No, it moved six feet!
It's on film, we'll see it.
I hate this place.
Can you hold that right here?
We're going to open that up.
I was looking right at it through the camera.
- Tim, did you see it?
- No, I was still inside.
You'll see it right now, watch.
Watch this...
Right there, see?
- See that?
- Oh, my God!
I got it on film, it's a straight shot.
Tim, come here.
Let me rewind this.
You got the whole thing on there.
All right.
Okay.
Here it is--
See, it starts there... watch... and see that?
There's something here, and we've got proof!
I have it on film.
That's all I need.
It's gonna be a long night.
We have to really work as one mind, almost.
I know it sounds crazy, but we have to work like that.
We're gotta get together, to really trust this process, and we're going to have to--
Because four of us will be okay together...
But I'm not equipped to deal with... anger, that kind of anger.
We'll have to work on it.
- I am.
- Okay.
All right, and I know that.
- I trust you.
- You should.
I gotta deal with this infrared thing?
Just point and click.
- Can I please say this now?
- God, do we have to?
Yes, it's important.
It's gonna help us.
We just need to get this done.
We'll do all the neat spiritual rituals we can.
No, I wanna do this now.
I asked for...
It's from a sister.
I asked for it and placed the complete protection of the fiery white light over myself, Madison, Ryan,
Paul and Tim, all around me, this house, this attic, this staircase, the fiery white light with the indigo...
- I can't even talk.
- "Dingoes"?
...everyone I come in contact with at this hour to expel, repel and reject everything harmful-- negative or evil--
I should have memorized this.
And I give thanks for this complete protection, let's go!
I'll do it better later, let's go.
- Don't be scared, guys.
- I am fine.
I am fine. I love all the energy that's in this room that is all positive.
We are here to help and do nothing else.
Use the wall on your way down the stairs.
Everything is okay.
- You watch that way.
- Yeah, I am.
Everything's perfectly okay.
We're here to help.
Everything's all right.
Are you okay?
My God, did you see that?
No, it's in here.
- What did you see?
- It jumped up when we walked in.
- What jumped?
- Just the meter.
The meaning?
Can I get in here, because I have a camera?
- I don't want this door closing.
- Come in with me.
Stay there so the door don't close.
I'm right behind you, brother.
Everything is okay, Madison.
Stay there, we're all right.
Every five feet we talk the talk, this is huge up here.
- No...
- What if this door closes?
...it's dangerous!
It could fall through.
- The floor could fall through.
- It won't fall through.
- There's nothing to block it with.
- Block it with this.
Move this over.
You guys...
- It might close.
- It closes, we'll open it!
It has a door handle-- four hinges.
I don't wanna be last.
Do I have to be last?
- Oh shit!
- Come on!
Ryan, please!!
- Okay, all right.
- Pull yourself together!
Okay, okay. All right.
Please!
- Nothing can hurt us, okay?
- Don't yell at me.
They're cooperating.
It's actually a low reading.
What is it?
Right now it's at six, which is the lowest.
No, no, it's huge over here.
Come on.
- Madison, I need you.
- This door could close.
- The door won't close.
- Okay, 73 is cool.
- I'm cooperating, you guys.
No, not you. I'm talking to the people that are here.
Don't be afraid, brother.
The thing is, a string would have to be strong to pull it.
Well, you know, leverage, distance...
What the fuck is that?
Dead bird.
- There's a dead bird.
- How badly is it dead?
It's dead!
Can we please hurry?
- We're here to find a ghost.
- Walk all the way there.
Let's go, let's do it.
We're going, but I'm not going alone.
Let's go.
Let's just do it.
White light, white light...
- It's high. It's really high.
- What is that?
Why's that shoe sitting there?
Listen, Paul...
- What is it?
- Paul, I don't know.
Paul, can we please hurry?
Can we please walk fast and do it?
Relax, nothing's wrong.
I can't believe how huge this attic is.
What if these floors slip?
What if it falls through?
There's a couch over here.
How did it get so big?
We're going back and we're getting candles.
- No, stop it!
- Come on, knock that off.
Are we getting meter readings?
What are we doing right now?
My meter don't work any more.
- I think we're done.
- It's cooling off over here.
Guys, come here.
It's 98 degrees.
I feel a breeze.
Is it just a breeze, because it's not as hot?
It's just a breeze.
Dude, go there, grab that chair and you check it out.
No strings?
- I knew it!
- Hold on, hold on.
- Positive energy.
- White light.
Hold the wall.
- Come on!
- No, you have to stay with us.
They're just trying to scare us.
Let me sit down.
The thing that scares me, and I'm being really honest right now, is that I think that ghost is really disturbed and angry, and just like an angry, disturbed person you gotta be very, very cautious,
Iike with anybody that's a little mentally off.
I wasn't prepared for a poltergeist-- angry activity--
I wasn't prepared for something that could hurl something at us.
But we have to believe that we're protected, and that we have guides, and we're alive and nothing's really going to happen to us.
God, I am hungry!
Lunch is here, or dinner, whatever you want to call it.
- What's going on?
- I think we should eat.
I thought we were gonna do our ritual now.
Let's eat, if that's all right with you.
Nothing else seems to be all right with you.
Paul, come on! We've been going about this all day.
I thought this is really important...
- Tim, sandwich?
- Yeah.
Listen, I really think we should get down to business, you guys.
What do you mean?
I don't think we should be eating right now.
I think there's something really intense going on here, and I think what we should be doing instead of eating is getting together, forming a circle, and trying to communicate with this thing.
We've got everything that we were supposed to get.
- What do you mean?
- We have proof that there's ghosts.
- We can leave.
- We cannot leave.
We did what we're supposed to do.
- We should leave.
- Tim, we're not leaving.
We need to get more on camera.
Tim's right.
We came here to do a job.
- We did it.
- This is great!
Do you know how many people would love to be in this position?
- We have proof!
- Madison, I agree with you.
You promised we could get down to the spiritual stuff.
You're getting on Madison.
You don't need to do that.
Thank you.
I'm glad you're here.
- Let's eat.
- Don't have an attitude.
I don't have an attitude.
We'll do whatever you want, after we eat, Madison.
It's not all about you.
We should just chill out.
Is it that time of the month for you?
- Paul, give me a break!
- She's been a bitch all night!
- Oh, my gosh! Typical.
- That is really not fair.
It's true, isn't it?
It is.
You didn't deny it.
It's obvious.
- Paul, what is it with you?
- It's full moon. That's it.
Come on, you guys.
Stop fighting.
There's something up there trying to communicate with us!
I started to talk to you about it before.
The four of us should be sitting together. We should--
There was a bug in my mouth!
Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!
Paul, will you kill it?
- It's dead. You bit it.
- No, it's not!
There's stuff coming out of it.
You bit it.
- You ate a bug.
- That is so gross.
- Oh, I hate it here!
- I'm sorry, Ryan.
I'm telling everybody she ate a bug.
Give me a flashlight.
Let me see.
No, you got it all.
That's so gross.
We're joined together as one, one intention and one focus, and we ask that only the good be brought in today, only the good and only that which is of the light be brought forth, so that we can help and heal and unite with justice and truth.
Is there somebody here that wishes to speak with us and are you of the white light?
If you are, you may go to the "Yes."
It's getting very cold under my hands.
Is it cold under your hands?
Yeah, it is.
But I'm not worried about it.
Is there someone here who really needs help?
Is there someone here who wants us to help them?
You know what it wants over there?
- Tell us what you want.
- Is this a number?
It might just be getting started.
- They go back and forth.
- It takes time.
- Please be of the light.
- It is. You asked it to be.
Oh, yes.
Did you live in this house a very long time ago?
"Yes." Okay, so...
God, this is so cool.
Oh, my God, that is so cool.
Okay, this is Tim.
Would you agree to talk to Tim?
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll give you a new question.
What's the first letter of your name?
He doesn't spell.
But he knows the first letter of his name.
"Yes."
"C."
He's gone to that before when we asked him his name.
Is your name Christian?
He goes to a bunch of consonants after that.
"No." Maybe, is your name
Charles?
What is it?
I just thought of the name
"Charles."
- And he went to "Yes"?
- What?
- He went to "Yes"?
- Yeah.
Are you still there?
Okay, you're still there.
- It's cool, Ryan. This is fine.
- Ryan's really, really great.
She's here on the project with us.
See, isn't it easy?
Are you the only one here?
Is there anybody else with you?
Is there anybody else with you?
Do I know you?
Do I know you?
Do we know each other?
- They don't understand past lives.
- He says he knows you.
They don't know they're dead.
Or he doesn't understand that concept.
He keeps going back.
He knows you.
How well did we know each other?
Can you tell me?
Can you show me a picture?
- What?
- I don't know.
I don't want him coming in the room, showing us things.
I just meant like on the board.
God, I knew this person.
I knew this person.
He's happy?
He's happy that I made the connection.
Oh, my God.
I knew this was gonna happen.
I mean, it did.
I didn't understand it.
Is it possible for us to clear this space?
Is it possible for us to help move the spirits out of here?
But do you think that they will go?
Do you believe that the spirits will go if we send them away?
Oh my God!
- What was that?
- Oh my God!
- Where did that come from?
- What was that?
What is that?
What is that?
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God, you guys!
They had somebody shackled up here!
How did that get in the chimney?
She had somebody chained up in here!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- Be careful.
- Don't stick your head in there.
- Come on, Get back.
- Tim, you got this?
- Yeah, I'm getting it.
- What is it, Ryan?
- I think I see something.
- I don't know what that is.
- Ryan, get out.
You shouldn't put your head in there.
Paul, what is that?
- Oh, God, what was that?
- Are you all right?
What is that?
- Oh, God!
- You're all right.
What the hell's going on?
Okay, I think Paul's right.
It would really work if we can somehow synchronize...
- when we all say this.
- That's the point.
If we were to go all together at the same time is not as powerful as spreading out and taking the whole house at the same time.
We ask for divine guidance as we venture through this house.
We ask for cooperation and help.
So now I want you to cover yourself with white light.
See it starting from the crown of your head and I want to see it showering over all of us.
We're all covered with white light and we're all protected.
Relax.
There are fucking chairs flying around up there.
- Go sit in that chair.
- Oh, yeah, right!
Harness it. Let it know who's the dominant being up there.
- We're not gonna play dominant.
- I got your back.
Thanks, you're a whole floor below me.
Why do we have to split up?
It's the only way to cleanse all the rooms at once.
All right, bro'.
It's judgment day.
- Hey, it's not about that.
- Let's go.
- Do you wanna yell from the attic?
- No, I don't.
I think we just get in our spots and start.
Okay, I'm here.
But it could be...
You'll know I'm in the attic.
When you guys hear him in the attic, then we'll start.
We'll be able to hear him walking.
You totally tell I'm in the attic from the staircase.
Are you all right?
- Shit.
- You gonna be okay?
Guys?
Anybody wanna cover my back while I go up for a minute?
Go ahead, cover my back real quick.
- Did you start it already?
- No.
Good, you could probably watch the staircase and my back.
You got Charles in there, don't even worry about it.
Stop it with ol' Charlie!
I don't wanna go up there.
Look at it!
God damn it!
Yeah, wait until you look at it!
It's so scary.
I think I got it from here.
Go back, get to your spots.
No, bro',
I'll walk you in.
No, 'cause if you leave me,
I'll feel weird.
Let me go in.
I'll feel so abandoned if you leave me.
- You sure?
- Yeah. It's something weird...
I don't wanna go in there.
It's like walking straight into hell.
Okay, you guys go to your spots and I'm gonna be right here.
I'm gonna go to my spot last.
In case you guys start and finish early, you can come save me.
I want you to understand why I'm doing this.
Why?
I chose to be leader and volunteered to take the attic for you.
At least I'm doing this for you.
I didn't chicken out and have you do it.
Paul, you have to remember, without fear, we have no heroes.
Damn it!
Paul, say your prayer now.
- Do you have your incense lit?
- Yes, hold on.
And remember, you're gonna help.
We're meant to help.
Remember the word was "Now."
What is all this shit about?
Oh, my God.
What?
Hey, don't leave me! Wait!
No, I'm just talking to myself.
Jesus Christ, don't run off like that yet.
Motherf--
Oh, Jesus!
- Hey, Madison,
- Yes.
What are you doing right now?
What am I doing?
I'm watching Paul.
Where are you, Tim?
What? I'm just checking on my room.
Why, what do you think?
I want you to help me out, checking behind the doorways.
Yeah, but we have to go in separately.
Nobody's going in the attic to check my doorways.
I offered to, you said you wanted to go by yourself.
But then you'd leave me and that'd be really scary.
Well, I don't mind anybody leaving me.
All right, it's time to do this!
Paul,
I know you can do this.
Fear's what makes heroes, right, boys?
Down here in Louisiana.
Fear is just in our head.
Tell them that they can go and they don't have to stay, and be very nice.
Surround yourself in white light, and nothing can happen.
I wish there was sunlight.
It would make a difference.
We could do everything then, but they're not active then.
Oh, God. Be a good leader.
Be a good leader.
Just say it.
Words are very powerful.
- Tim!
- What?
I need you to like just be around.
30 minutes till countdown.
I'm staying here for a little while.
You could not believe how dark and scary it is in there.
Go ahead and shine that shit in first.
Shine your light... and talk to them outside of there.
Oh, man!
I've never been anywhere this scary!
Never, ever have I been so scared.
- This is ridiculous.
- I know.
Have you ever gone into something like this?
- No.
- I'm not writing shit!
I can just read stuff.
I'm not writing anything.
Write it, write everything out!
No, I'm dropping the book.
Look out.
Get outta the way. I'm dropping the book. I don't want it.
Goodbye, book.
- Would you be this scared?
- Yes.
I'd be freaking out if I were you.
You would'nt believe how scary the attic looks with no light.
Shine a light in.
Ghosts, turn on the light.
Just turn on the light.
Come on, Charles!
- Charles, turn on the light!
- Charles!
Make an agreement that you'll go in, you can talk--
Charles, if you turn on the light, Paul's gonna go in.
Charles would turn on the light.
Charles can't turn on the light!
- He turned it off!
- He didn't. That wasn't him.
- Who turned it off?
- We need to go in our rooms!
Come on.
Ghosts? Ghosts?
Say your prayer now.
Get to the first camera you see and sit!
Oh, no!
I am not sitting down!
I ask for...
Go ahead, Paul, say it.
Words are very powerful.
It's cold up here.
It's cold.
Okay, I ask for... and I place complete--
Guys, come on! You're yelling!
I can't think!
I ask for and I place the complete protection of the fiery white light of love...
- Good, Paul.
- Hold on.
Guys? Come on.
Oh, man, it's not very nice in there. It's not nice.
- Is it ice cold?
- Yes, I'm freezing.
They're listening to you!
But it's not nice.
They're listening.
Please, just say it.
All the hairs are standing on end.
Good!
They're listening!
We've separated, each going into our haunted room alone to recite the prayer of cleansing.
I feel more scared than
I've felt all night.
Can you hear this?
I'm going into the front room, where we found that cold spot.
It seems colder in here now.
Come on, Charles.
You have me believing in you, buddy.
I love ghosts.
Did you hear that?
I think there's something in this closet.
Tim, are you okay?
Yeah,
I just scared myself.
Okay, here we go.
Is everybody okay out there?
Yeah! Come on, let's get this over with!
Hurry up, you two!
It's dark up here!
Okay.
Let's start!
I call upon the power of the fiery white light to cleanse, protect and purify this house of evil, to heal the wounds of the past and free these earthbound souls to find peace in the white light of heaven.
Are there any ghosts in here?
I call upon the power of the fiery white light to cleanse, protect and purify this house of evil, to heal the wounds of the past and free these earthbound souls to find peace in the white light of heaven.
You guys!
Stuff's moving down here!
You guys, help!
Madison!
I ask and I place the complete protection of the fiery white light of love around this attic, and
I don't want this door to shut.
No, don't shut the door. Ah!
There's stuff--
The fiery white light of love--
What's that?
Okay, I call upon the fiery white light to cleanse, purify and protect this house, and to-- and to free all the house of evil and all the spirits to--
What was that?
Who's up here?
Is somebody up here?
If you wanna communicate, talk to Madison.
Shit!
What the hell?
What the hell?
Oh, my God!
What the hell is this?
Is there something down there?
What the hell is this?
Ow, ow! Shit!
God damn it!
Shit.
Come on. Shit.
Come on.
God! Ow!
There is something in this room with me.
I can feel it in the air.
If there's someone or something here, please communicate with me!
Let me hear you!
And know that we are here to help you!
- ( door creaks )
- Ah!
Charles, are you still here, buddy?
You never were here, were you?
You're just a figment of my imagination.
Hey, you guys?
Hey, you guys, I'm getting some action in here!
Fucking rats!
Charles, this isn't funny.
That's where the sound's coming from, the closet.
Come on, Charles, don't-- with me now.
There's a cold spot here.
It's really cold.
Okay, you heard it that time.
It's like it's here but it's not here.
Oh, God...
What the fuck?
What the--?
Oh, Jesus.
What the--?
There's some kind of secret passageway down here.
It's cold.
It's really cold.
I don't wanna know what's in there.
What the--?
Hey, somebody help me!
Please, you can't leave me down here!
There's spiders down here!
Somebody help me!
There is definitely something in this room with me.
The air has gotten colder.
Charles?
Charles, is that you?
If you're here Charles, if you can hear me, please give me a sign.
I want to help you.
I want to free you from this place.
Oh, my God, you're not Charles!
You're the one who threw the chair!
Oh, God!
I know you were a victim of Madame Lullory but that was a long time ago!
You are free to go now!
You need to leave and find peace on the other side!
Aaaah!
What's going on?
Madison!
Madison!
Madison!
Madison!
Madison, come and open the door!
Maddy!
Madison!
Oh, my God!
We gotta get out of here!
- Tim and Ryan!
- Tim! Ryan!
- Oh, Tim!
- Ryan!
Where are they?
Did you see that?
I don't know!
Listen, I hear that again.
They're yelling. Come on!
- Paul, I wanna leave!
- We're out of here. Come on.
Please take me home!
I don't want to...
- Come on!
- I want to leave!
Come on, I hear them.
Ryan! They're down there.
They're here!
Tim! Ryan!
She's here!
Madam Lullory is here.
- Oh, my God!
- Hurry!
Tim!
Ryan!
My God!
- Help me!
- I'm coming.
- Get me out of here.
- Wait! Somebody's coming!
Hurry! Hurry!
Come on!
I was dreamin'.
Dreamin' my dick was out and I was checking to see if that infected bump on the head of it had filled with pus again.
If it had, I was gonna name that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla and bust it by jackin' off.
Oh, man.
Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do.
Dreams let you think like that.
Truth was, I hadn't had a hard-on in years.
Oh, man.
My God, man.
How long have I been here?
Am I really awake now, or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?
How could my plans have gone so wrong?
When the hell are they gonna serve lunch?
Considerin' what they serve, why the hell do I care?
If Priscilla discovered I was alive, would she come and see me?
Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?
Is there, finally and really, anything to life other than food, shit, and sex?
Well, goddamnit.
How could I have gone from the "King of rock and roll"to this?
Old guy in a rest home in East Texas with a growth on his pecker.
And what is that growth, man?
Cancer? Nobody's talkin'.
No one seems to know... or wants to.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it, what kind of life this old guy had?
What kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.
Look at him now.
Oh, who gives a shit?
Well...
Make you comfortable.
No.
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!
Help me.
You know, I was thinkin'...
What? You gonna get all weepy on me again?
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you use some of this here deodorizer and spray it on that corpse because she's smellin' pretty ripe.
Good idea.
Excuse me, miss?
You gonna throw all that stuff out?
Yeah.
Could I have one of them pictures of Bull?
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?
I mean, he was pretty proud of that.
And maybe that... that tin of chocolates there?
I suppose.
The revealin' of her panties wasn't intentional or unintentional.
She just didn't give a damn.
She saw me as so physically and sexually non-threatenin', she didn't mind if I got a bird's-eye view of her love nest.
It was the same to her as a house cat sneakin' a peek.
I felt my pecker flutter once like a pigeon havin' a heart attack... then it laid back down and remained limp and still.
'Course, these days, even a flutter was kind of reassurin'.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Say...
Bull your kin?
My daddy.
Never seen you here before.
I've only been here once before.
When I checked him in.
That's three years ago, wasn't it?
You and him friends?
No, we just roommates. I mean, he never felt good enough to say much.
I just hated to see what was left of him go away so easy.
Seemed like an all right guy.
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?
Yeah.
Well... he was all right.
But not enough so you'd come and see him, though.
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid or Medicare... whatever that stuff was... he'd have been in some ditch somewhere.
And I sure didn't have the money to take care of him.
My own daughter...
Lost long ago to me... if she knew I lived, would she come and see me?
Would she even care?
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.
Mind your own business.
I was busy.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?
I'm all right.
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.
Good morning, Elvis.
Did you know we have a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?
Elvis Presley. You know, the rock and roll singer.
I thought he was dead.
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.
Yet.
Now, Mr. Haff!
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."
But you're a little confused and you like to play sometimes.
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?
You fell off the stage and broke your hip... when was it?
Twenty years ago.
It got infected and you were in a coma for quite a while.
You came out with a few... problems.
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.
I don't have any problems.
You're tryin' to say my brain's messed up, aren't you?
Why would you wanna be somebody else?
I got tired of it.
I was hooked on pills, you know.
I wanted out.
And this boy Sebastian Haff... he was an Elvis imitator.
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.
Problem is, he had a bad heart.
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.
But why would you want to leave all that fame, Mr. Presley?
All that money?
I don't know.
'Cause they got old.
The woman I loved... Priscilla... she was gone.
The rest of the women... were just women.
I mean, the music wasn't mine anymore.
I wasn't even me anymore.
Just this thing they made up.
And my friends...
Well, they were suckin' me dry.
So I took a little road trip down to Nacogdoches... to check out this Sebastian Haff.
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think you'd really...
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.
Let's split.
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.
It's all yours, baby.
So I signed everything over to Sebastian.
Except for enough money to sustain me if things got bad.
I was determined to make myself a new life.
A better one.
But me and Sebastian, we had us a deal.
If I wanted to trade back, he'd let me.
It was all written up in the contract.
The thing was...
I lost my copy in a barbeque accident.
But that wasn't so bad, either.
I was makin' new friends and enjoyin' myself.
Cheers!
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?
It just went up like that.
- Now, Elvis.
- Yes?
Don't carry it too far.
You may just get way out there and not come back.
Oh, fuck you.
Shit.
Get old, you can't even cuss someone and have it bother 'em.
Everything you do is either worthless or sadly amusing.
Well...
I've got what I want.
The clothes can go to Goodwill or Salvation Army.
Very well. And I'm sorry about your father. He was a nice man.
Yeah.
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.
I'll be back later to do that little... thing that has to be done. You know.
Elvis!
Poor Bull.
In the end... does anything really matter?
No one here ever listened to me.
Except this one guy... only, he was certifiable.
That's where they took a piece of my brain.
They got it back in D.C. in that goddamn jar.
I got a little bag of sand up there now.
Jack... no offense, but...
President Kennedy was a white man.
That's how clever they are!
They dyed me this color.
All over!
Can you think of a better way to hide the truth than that?
I was livin' simple.
The way Haff had been.
Going from town to town doin' the Elvis act.
Only, I felt like I was really me again.
Can you dig that?
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.
Women were throwin' themselves at me
'cause they could imagine I was Elvis.
Only, I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis.
It was all pretty good.
I didn't mind the contract being burned up.
Didn't even try to go back and convince anybody.
Then I had the accident.
I was gyratin', see, takin' care business, and then my hip went out.
I'd been havin' trouble with it.
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.
No more piss or crap in the bed.
Shake it out...
There we go.
Man... that is one big bitch cockroach.
All right, man. Let's go.
Damn.
Hot damn!
Got you, you six-legged bastard.
Even a big bitch cockroach like you should know...
Never... but never fuck with the King.
Hey! Is anybody out here?
I think we got some major bug problems in this place, man!
Oh, man...
Hey, Jack?
Hey, man, you okay?
What the Sam Hill is that?
Mr. Kennedy?
Hey, man... you're on the floor.
No shit.
Who are you?
Look, I'm...
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.
Did you see him go by in the hall?
He scuttled like.
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you know who.
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.
Lyndon Johnson.
Castro, maybe.
They sent somebody to finish me off.
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.
Get his feet.
So, you say you heard a... a noise?
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.
Were you awake or were you in bed when you heard this noise?
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.
You got bugs all over this place.
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind of bugs have you been seeing?
Look, do I look like an ichthyologist to you?
Big damn bugs, all right?
The size of my fist. The size of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
What do I care?
I got a growth on my pecker.
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow and we'll take care of the problem.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's time for that little thing again.
A doll like this handlin' me without warmth or emotion...
Twenty years ago.
Just twenty, man.
I could've made with the curly-lip smile and had her eatin' out of my asshole.
Doctor says this cream ought to do the trick.
Corticosteroids.
Should heal the inflammation, stop the pus.
Where'd my youth go?
Why didn't fame hold off old age and death?
Why the hell did I leave the fame in the first place?
Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?
And if I could... would it make any damn difference?
Mr. Haff!
Lord almighty.
You old rascal.
I think you better take a cold shower, Mr. Haff.
There'd been two presidential elections since I had a boner like that one.
What gave here?
Then I realized what gave.
I was thinkin' about something that interested me.
Not my next meal or goin' to the crapper.
I'd been given a dose of life again.
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.
You silly thing.
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?
You ought to be ashamed.
Where at? Where at?
I haven't seen my kids.
It's an ambush!
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!
That's my friend Kemosabe.
We used to play cards together.
- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am.
Daddy.
Baby?
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!
What's loose?
It. Listen.
Jesus Christ. What's that?
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson, but I was wrong.
I've come across new evidence to suggest another assassin.
Assassin?
He's after another target tonight.
Come on, I wanna show you something.
I don't think it's safe if you go back to sleeping.
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas, and look where they got my brain and me.
I'm thinkin' with sand here.
I mean, I pick up some waves, maybe, from my brain, but someday, who knows.
Somebody might just disconnect the battery at the White House.
Oh, yeah. That's something to worry about, all right.
Listen here. Listen.
I know you're Elvis.
There was a rumor, you know, that you hated me.
But I thought about that.
If you hated me, you could've finished me off the other night.
What I want from you is that you look me straight in the eye and assure me you had nothing at all to do with that day in Dallas, and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.
Look, man...
I had nothing to do with Dallas.
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.
Good. May I call you Elvis instead of Sebastian?
You may.
Excellent.
You wear glasses to read?
Well, I wear glasses when I really want to see.
Get them. Come on.
Come on.
Right down the hall.
The walker was swingin' along easier now.
Not even like I needed it.
Damn, this here Jack was a nut.
Maybe I was nuts, too... but there was an adventure goin' on.
It's in here.
In here.
That's it?
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall, trying to figure out who attacked you, and you bring me here to look at stick pictures on the shit house wall?
Look close.
It's Egyptian.
Right-a-reen-o.
Hey, you're not as stupid as some folks made you out.
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.
I came in here to take a shit because they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.
Saw that on the wall, took it back to my room, looked it up in my books, and I wrote it all down.
Now, this top line translates roughly into,
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."
Say what?
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.
All right, so, one of the nuts in here... present company excluded... thinks he's Tutankhamen, comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?
Well, I don't know what the connection is, exactly... not yet.
But that thing caught me asleep last night.
And I came awake just in time.
He had me on the floor.
I had his mouth over my asshole.
A shit-eater?
I don't think so.
He was after my soul.
Now, you can get that out of any major orifice of a person's body.
I read about it.
Yeah? Where, man? Hustler?
The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David Webb.
And they got pretty good movie reviews in there about stolen soul movies in the back.
Come on. I'll show you.
I think that there might be some sort of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.
That light... looks like it's shortin' out.
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.
But you don't have to think about that.
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin' on her enema.
All right. All right. I'm comin'.
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.
God.
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.
Damn! Hey, Jack.
What it says here is that you can bury some dude, and if he gets the right tanna leaves and spells said over him and such bullshit, that he can come back to life thousands of years later, man.
But hold on, now.
To stay alive, he has to suck on the souls of the livin', and that if the souls are small, his life force doesn't last long.
Small.
What's that mean?
Read on.
No, never mind.
I'll tell you myself.
But first, would you like a Ding Dong?
I don't mean mine.
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.
Of course, mine would be chocolate now that I have been dyed.
You got Ding Dongs, man?
I got Paydays and I got a box of Baby Ruths.
Oh, mama!
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.
I'll take a Baby Ruth.
All right.
Now... small souls... are those that don't have much fire for life.
You know a place like that?
Man, if souls were fires, they couldn't burn much lower than in here.
Exactamundo.
What we have here at Shady Rest is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.
You know, a mummy hiding out.
Coming in here, feeding on the sleeping.
It's perfect, you see?
We're small souls, so we can't provide him much.
But if that thing comes back two or three times in a row and wraps his lips around some elder's asshole, that elder is going to die pretty soon.
And who would be the wiser?
Asshole.
A mummy can't be getting too much energy from all this... not like with big souls... but the prey is easy.
With new people comin' all the time, he can keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.
That's what they brought us here for... to get us out of the way until we die.
And those who don't die first from disease or just plain being old, he gets.
Look, that's all well and good, Jack, but there's one thing that still throws me.
How does an ancient Egyptian wind up in an East Texas rest home, and why is he writin' on the shit house walls, man?
Well, he went in to take a crap, got bored, started writing on the walls.
He probably wrote on pyramid walls centuries ago.
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.
Well, he eats souls.
So, I assume that he would crap soul residue.
By that, I would mean that if you die from his mouth, you don't go to the other side where the souls go.
He digests souls until they don't exist anymore.
And you're just so much toilet water decoration.
And speaking of toilets...
This is how I figured that whole thing out.
He's just like anybody else when it comes to taking a dump.
He wants a nice, clean place with a flush.
They didn't have that in his time.
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.
"He" my ass. There isn't any mummy from Egypt.
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.
Asshole.
Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart before he hit the floor.
Gone down and out with both guns blazing.
Soul intact.
Once again, we got scolded.
This time, we got quizzed about what had happened to Kemosabe, but neither of us told the truth.
I mean, who was gonna believe a couple of nuts?
Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining that Kemosabe was gunning for a mummy in cowboy duds?
Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?
So, what we did was... we lied.
Life sure is fleetin', you know?
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.
One minute you're here, and the next minute you're gone...
Shit! Shit! Come on!
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.
Nonchalant.
Get it in there.
You are one fuckin' idiot.
Mr. Haff?
Mr. Presley?
Now, now, Mr. Presley.
You are looking much stronger, but you shouldn't be out here too long.
It's time for your nap.
And it's also time for us to do that little... you know.
You fuck off, you patronizing bitch!
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube my own crankshaft from now on.
You treat me like a baby again,
I'll wrap this goddamn walker right around your head!
How in the hell did that mummy do that?
Well... what the hell.
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?
Where did he come from?
How the hell did he get here?
Wait a minute.
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
Come on, mama.
It's a cancer.
They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old, and to them, it don't matter.
They think age will kill me first, and they're probably right.
Well, suck them!
I know what it is, and if it isn't... it might as well be.
Station KROP is proud to present the Elvis Presley movie marathon.
It's 24 hours of Elvis in the roles he made famous.
Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog out-strum, outrace, out-fight, and outwit the bad guys.
And at the same time, watch the King slay the girls.
Shitty pictures, man.
Every single one.
Here I was complainin' about loss of pride and how life had treated me, and now I realized...
I never had any pride.
And much of how life had treated me had been good.
The bulk of the bad was my own damn fault.
Should've fired Colonel Parker by the time I got in the pictures.
Old fart had been a shark and a fool, and I was an even bigger fool for following him.
If only I'd treated Priscilla right.
If I could've told my daughter I loved her.
Always the questions.
Never the answers.
Always the hopes... never the fulfillments.
I had the woman who calls herself my niece come get me.
She took me downtown this morning to the newspaper morgue.
She's been helping me to do some research.
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.
You know somethin' about him?
I know plenty.
Now, one of the lesser mummies, on loan from the Egyptian government, was being circulated all over the United States.
You know, museums, stuff like that.
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?
No, more like King Tut's brother.
His mummy was flown or carried by the train from state to state.
When it got to Texas, it was stolen.
Stolen?
Evidence points to it being stolen at night by a couple of guys in a silver bus.
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!
Anyway, the thieves broke into the museum, stole it in hopes of a ransom, when in comes the worst storm in East Texas history.
Let me guess.
The bus was washed away, see?
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.
The mummy was imprisoned by the debris.
Look here... how'd it come back to life?
And how did I end up inside its memories?
Speculation broadens here, but from what I've read, some mummies get buried without their names... a curse put on their sarcophagus.
Hey, now, maybe our boy's one of them.
I mean, when he's in the coffin, he's just a dried-up old corpse, but when the bus got washed away, maybe it overturned or broke open, and now he's free of coffin and curse.
He's free from imprisonment, but he still needs souls.
Now he's free to have them.
He can just keep on feedin' unless he's finally destroyed.
So, what do we do, Jack?
Changing rest homes might be a good idea.
I can't think of much else.
But I will say this...
Our mummy is a nighttime kind of guy.
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.
I'll set my alarm for just before dark, then I can get myself a couple of cups of coffee.
Damn straight.
If he comes in here tonight, I don't want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.
Yes. Consider it.
He's got the proverbial bird's nest on the ground here.
What do I really have left in life but this place?
It ain't much of a home... but it's all I got.
Well, goddamnit.
I'll be damned if I let some foreign, graffiti-writin', soul-suckin', son of a bitch in an oversized cowboy hat and boots take my friends' souls and shit 'em down the visitors toilet!
In the movies,
I always played heroic types.
But when the stage lights went out, it was time for drugs and stupidity and the coveting of women.
Now it's time.
Time to be a little of what I had always fantasized bein'... a hero.
Hello?
Mr. Kennedy?
Ask not what your rest home can do for you.
Ask what you can do for your rest home.
Hey, you're copying my best lines.
Then let me paraphrase one of my own.
Let's take care of business.
Just what are you getting at, Elvis?
I think you know what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.
We're gonna kill us a mummy.
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.
Look here.
Found this in the storage room.
I thought they kept it locked.
They do. I stole a hairpin and picked the lock, baby.
Great.
Matches.
Check. Even scrounged up a cigarette lighter.
Good. Uniform.
Big check on that, baby.
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes to go with this.
Check.
Scissors.
Check.
All right.
Now, I got my chair oiled and ready to roll.
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.
And I picked some words of power from my book of magic.
I don't know if they'll stop a mummy, but they're supposed to ward off evil.
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.
All right, 2:45 a.m., we hook up right back here.
No, at the rate we travel, maybe we ought to start at 2:30.
Say, Jack?
Do we know what the hell we're doin', man?
No. But they say that fire cleanses evil.
Let's just hope that they... whoever they are... is right.
Check on that, too.
All right, synchronize watches.
And... mark.
Now, the two key words for tonight are "caution" and "flammable."
And also...
"watch your ass."
What's that you got hanging around your neck?
That's my medicine bag.
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.
See here?
Mucho mojo.
That's my daughter.
I know.
We weren't there for our kids when they needed us, were we?
Man, if I could just talk to her again... tell her I love her... try and make things right somehow.
No time for regrets, Elvis.
We were the best fathers we could be under the circumstances.
Yeah, I guess, no time for regrets.
We got business to take care of.
Look here.
Top it off with this.
I stole it from the gardener when he wasn't lookin'.
It's gonna be one hell of a barbeque.
Let's do it, amigo.
Hey, Jack?
I just got one last question.
Marilyn.
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?
What was she like in the sack?
That is classified information.
Top secret!
But between you and me...
Wow!
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.
Gotta hump it.
Shit... when Bubba Ho-Tep comes out of that creek bed, he's gonna come out hungry and pissed.
When I try and stop him, he's gonna jam this paint can up my ass and jam me and that wheelchair up Jack's ass.
Shit.
Hey, Jack.
Don't make me use my stuff on you, baby.
Damn!
Where did he go to?
Hey! You stay put!
I'll flush him out!
You be careful, man.
No, Jack!
Oh, man.
Come and get it, you undead sack of shit.
Sorry, man.
Mr. Kennedy?
The President is soon dead.
So, now... it's up to you, Elvis.
You got to get him.
You... got to... take care of business.
That's right, man.
T.C. B...
It's just you and me.
Mr. President.
"You nasty thing from beyond the dead...
"No matter what you think or do, good things will never come to you.
"And if evil is your black design,
"you can bet the goodness of the Light Ones... will kick your bad behind"?
For chrissake...
That's it?
That's the chant against evil from the Book Of Souls?
Yeah, right, boss.
And what kind of decoder ring comes with that, man?
Shit, it doesn't even rhyme well!
This is dog shit.
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.
Come on, baby.
Here we go.
I was goin' out.
And if I did, not only would I be one dead son of a bitch, but so would my soul.
I'd be just so much crap.
No afterlife, no reincarnation, no angels with harps.
Whatever lay beyond would not be known to me.
It would all end right here for Elvis Aaron Presley.
Nothin' left but a quick flush.
T.C.B., baby.
Your soul-suckin' days are over, amigo.
I felt somethin' inside gratin' against somethin' soft.
I felt like a water balloon with a hole poked in it.
I was goin' down for the last count.
And I knew it.
But I still have my soul.
It's still mine.
All mine.
And the folks up there at Shady Rest... they have theirs, too.
And they're gonna keep 'em.
Every single one.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
At the beginning of the 21st century the Umbrella Corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the U.S.
Nine out of every ten homes contain its products.
Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere.
In public, it is the world's leading supplier of... computer technology, medical products and healthcare.
Unknown even to its own employees, its massive prof韙s are generated by... military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry.
All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags... at all times.
All radiation badges... will be collected at 5 this afternoon.
Thank you!
God!
Some people.
- Don't show me.
- Why not?
Because I'm busy.
It's nothing. Fire drill.
- What is that?
- Fire drill.
- Shit!
- What's going on?
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- I'm trying!
Move the experiments!
Shouldn't the doors open or something?
It's supposed to take us to the nearest floor.
Hello?
Hello?
What's happening?
Line's dead.
Is that a drill? Come on!
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.
- The ones at the back?
- Locked as well.
There's no fire here!
No fire!
- There's no fire here! No fire!
- The code doesn't work!
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!
- And this water isn't going anywhere.
- What?
It's a sealed room.
- Help me with the door!
- Fuck the doors!
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!
Quiet!
Quiet.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Halon!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!
Let me see.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building.
Here, give me a hand.
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through.
I'll get help.
I'm stuck. You'll have to push.
That's it. A bit more.
What was that?
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes!
- Get out! We have to get out!
- I can't move!
I can't move!
Oh, my God!
- Push her out of the way!
- Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
Today all your dreams come true.
Today all your...
Hello?
Hello?
Who are you?
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!
Down!
What are you doing? I'm a cop!
I told you. I'm a cop.
You're breaking my arm.
Report.
Report now.
What?
I want your report, soldier.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sir, the house's primary defenses were activated.
She's probably suffering side effects.
- What are you doing with us?
- What about the cop?
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.
Who are you?
I just transferred. They probably don't have me on file yet.
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.
Should I secure him here?
No. We take him with us.
You can't do this.
Blow me.
Prep for entry to the Hive.
- Power's down.
- So fix it.
I'm on it.
Are you done yet?
Jumpy!
Stand clear!
- You got a pro blem?
- How's that door?
- Sealed shut.
- Let me.
Jumpy?
Lie still.
Lie still!
Watch this light.
Follow it.
- How many fingers?
- Three.
Good. Tell me your name.
I don't know.
He's fine.
Memory loss, like the other one.
Let's open that door.
I want to know who you people are and what's going on here.
Now!
You and I have the same employer.
We work for the Umbrella Corporation.
The mansion above is an emergency entrance to the Hive.
You were security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
What a bout this?
Your marriage is a fake.
Just your cover to protect the secrecy of the Hive.
And what is the Hive?
Show them.
Accessing schematic of the Hive.
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.
The mansion, where we found you and gained access to the train... which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.
The Hive is located underground... deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.
A secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation...
The Hive houses over 500 technicians, scientists and support staff.
They live and work underground.
Their research is of the highest importance.
Its nature is classif韊d.
Our position on the map is indicated by heat signature.
Why can't I remember anything?
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms, all computer-controlled.
A nerve gas was released into the house.
Primary effect of the gas:
Complete unconsciousness lasting up to four hours.
Secondary effects can include acute memory loss.
- For how long?
- Subjective. An hour, day, week.
So, this place was attacked?
I'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that.
Sir, we've breached the Hive.
J.D.
Got it.
Halon has dissipated.
Easier to work underground, thinking there's a view.
Looks like we're taking the stairs.
Status.
Red Queen's locked on to us.
She knows we're here.
Who's the Red Queen?
State-of-the-art artificial intelligence.
The computer that controls the Hive.
This will slow us down.
Our route to the Queen takes us straight through these labs.
Rain, J.D., see how bad the flooding is.
Kaplan, find an alternate route.
What happened here?
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.
Sealed the Hive and killed everyone here.
Jesus.
When we realized what happened, we were dispatched to shut her down.
- Why did she do it?
- We don't know.
But outside interference is a possibility.
Jesus!
You okay?
Here.
- No, I'm fine.
- It's cold in here.
Are you...?
Do you remember anything from... before this?
No, nothing before the train.
And you?
Nothing.
I found an alternate route but it will cost us time.
If we double back, cut through
Dining Hall B, we're right on track.
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.
All right, we're behind schedule.
So let's move it.
Come on.
Poor bastards.
Kaplan?
Dining Hall B.
That's what's on the map.
Maybe you're reading it wrong.
May be the Corporation keeps secrets here, something you're not supposed to see.
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit.
Halon levels are nonexistent.
I think the system malfunctioned.
There may be survivors. Give me a search line but keep it tight.
Move it.
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.
I'm not sure I want to remember what went on down here.
I don't blame you.
- What the hell do they keep in these?
- How do I know?
What's taking so long?
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.
Let's pack it up.
You. Stay here.
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.
Running a bypass.
Checkmate.
Move up.
What is that?
That will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.
Forces the mainframe to re boot.
Kaplan!
A dormant defense mechanism.
We must've tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.
- Working on it.
- Open that door.
- I'm trying.
Hold your positions.
Stay calm.
What's that?
- Get them out!
- Something's happening in there.
- Come on.
- Help them!
Down! Get down!
- Something's killing them!
- Don't do this!
Medic! Medic!
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!
Almost there.
It's coming back!
- Open it!
- I'm trying!
Try harder!
It's coming back!
Oh, God!
- Do it!
- Almost there.
Come on!
- Shit.
- Got it.
All right.
Let's do it.
- Do what?
- We have to complete the mission.
No way I'll go down there.
Her defenses are down.
D閖a vu, anyone?
Keep going.
Give me a hand.
Get out!
You can't be in here.
Don't listen. She's a holographic representation of the Red Queen.
Get out!
Modeled after the programmer's daughter.
She'll deceive us, confuse us.
I wouldn't advise this.
Disabling me will result in loss of primary power.
She'll say anything to stop us from shutting her down.
I implore you.
- Implore away.
- Please?
Please?
You're all going to die down here.
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.
After that, if I don't have her boards, he can re boot.
They're late.
I'm on it.
J.D., we got a survivor!
We're here to help.
You seem to be in some sort of...
Get off!
Get off of me!
Get her off me before I stab her ass.
You okay?
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk right out of me.
Stay back.
I'm warning you, stay down!
She's crazy.
Come any closer and I'll fire.
I mean it!
Damn you!
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?
Bitch isn't standing now.
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.
She's gone.
She's gone!
Bullshit!
She fell right here but she's gone!
Look at this.
There's blood, but it's not much.
Looks coagulated.
Yeah.
It's not possi ble.
Why not?
Blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.
Can we go now?
Not till the rest of the team get here.
There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Wait.
Quiet.
- Fuck!
- Don't come any closer!
They're behind us!
Jesus!
They're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.
I said stay back!
Why aren't they dying?
Watch the tank!
The tank!
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- Wait!
- Come on! Move!
Come on!
Move.
I can help you get the virus.
I have security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
Shit.
- We lost the others.
- Keep moving.
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.
Come on.
- Shit!
- Come on!
- Hurry up.
- Shit!
- Come on.
- Shit!
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!
Come on.
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry, I'm running out of ammo!
0-43-2... No, fuck!
- What?!
- What is the code?
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?
Shit!
Grab my hand, man!
Don't let go!
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go? Fuck!
Whatever they are, there's too many.
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.
La b coats, badges...
Those people used to work here.
All the people working here are dead.
That isn't stopping them from walking around.
Where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?
When you cut the power, you unlocked the doors. You let them out.
We're never gonna make it to the surface.
You are security operatives... placed there to protect that entrance.
Lisa.
I've got one in the breech.
And an extra mag.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
But?
- But there will be a price.
- Name it
- Who was she?
- My sister.
Corporations like Umbrella... think they're above the law.
But they're not.
There are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same all over the world.
Some of us provide information.
Others give their support.
Some take more direct action.
Like you.
If your friends had been more thorough, they would've seen through my false I.D.
Then all the red flags would've gone off.
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP, all the rest.
There's no way I could've infiltrated the Hive.
So you sent your sister.
We needed something concrete, anything to expose Um brella to the press.
Proof of the research going on down here.
What kind of research?
The illegal kind.
Genetic.
Viral.
My sister was going to smuggle out a sample of the virus they were developing.
How was she going to make it out?
She had a contact within the Hive, someone I never met.
They had access to security codes, surveillance, everything she needed.
So why didn't she make it?
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.
Maybe they set her up.
Kept the virus for themselves.
Do you have any idea what the T-virus would be worth on the open market?
Worth all this?
Yeah.
To someone.
- Don't shoot!
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!
- Close that door!
Get off!
Son of a bitch!
You okay?
Yeah.
Right behind us.
What about this door?
They're waiting there too.
And that way?
Dead end. There's no way out of the Queen's chamber.
So we wait.
Someone doesn't hear from you... they'll send backup or something.
Right?
What? What's wrong?
- We don't have much time.
- Those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion, they seal shut in under an hour.
If we're not out by then, we're not getting out.
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.
Containing the incident is the only fail-safe plan they had... against possible contamination.
And you're telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
We have to find a way out of this room.
What are you doing?
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.
- That's not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.
That homicidal bitch killed my team.
That homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here.
Considering the way she's been treated,
I'm sure she's real happy to help us out.
That circuit breaker you were talking about. Can you bypass it?
- Yeah?
- So do it.
Circuit breaker's disabled.
This time, if I hit the switch, she won't shut down. She'll fry.
The charge must've damaged her boards.
There you are.
Things, I gather, have gone out of control.
Give me that switch right now.
I'll fry your ass!
I did warn you, didn't I?
- Tell us what's going on down here.
- Research and development.
What a bout the T-virus?
The T-virus was a major medical breakthrough.
Although it clearly also possessed... highly profitable military applications.
How does it explain those things out there?
Even in death, the human body remains active.
Hair and fingernails continue to grow.
New cells are produced.
And the brain holds a small electrical charge that takes months to dissipate.
The T-virus provides a massive jolt, both to cellular growth... and to those trace electrical impulses.
Put quite simply, it reanimates the body.
It brings the dead back to life?
Not fully. The subjects have the simplest of motor functions.
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.
They are driven by the basest of impulses, the most basic of needs.
- Which is?
- The need to feed.
How do you kill them?
Severing the top of the spinal column... or massive trauma to the brain are the most effective methods.
You mean shoot them in the head.
Why did you kill everybody down here?
The T-virus escaped into the air conditioning system.
And an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.
The virus is protean, changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission... depending on its environment
It's almost impossible to kill.
I couldn't allow it to escape from the Hive.
So, I took steps.
- Steps?
- You must understand... those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.
- We're not infected.
- Just one bite... one scratch from these creatures is sufficient... and then you become one of them.
A check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker... has been disabled.
May I ask why?
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.
If you refuse to help, we flip the switch.
Understand?
After you.
What the hell is this place?
The utility tunnels.
They run underneath the Hive for water, gas and power lines.
- Been in here before.
- Keep moving!
- Going round in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave.
- I don't know why you listen to her.
- Enough!
We have no choice but to keep moving because those things are behind us, got it?
That mesh won't hold.
Keep moving.
Jesus Christ!
- Hold it!
- There's too many of them!
Fuck!
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!
Quickly, everyone, up on the pipes!
- Let's go!
- Come on, there's a way up!
Keep them back!
Go on up, move it!
Look out!
Get over here.
There's too many of them!
Go, go, go!
Go on!
I can manage!
Go!
JD?
What?
We have to do something a bout your wounds.
I'm fine.
I said I'm fine.
You like that, don't you?
You like the way it tastes, don't you?
Like the taste of that?
She was right.
- We're all going to die down here.
- No.
We're getting out.
All of us.
You okay?
God!
Get away!
- Hold on!
- Come on!
Help him.
- I can't.
- What are you waiting for?
I can't focus.
I can't see!
- Go up!
- Clim b up there!
You gotta keep going!
- Come on!
- Go!
- You can do it! Move!
- You got it!
- Stay there.
- We'll get you.
We need to cut this wire and throw it to him. Then we'll get him.
Hold on.
That's lucky.
I want you to go.
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.
You can't kill all of them.
I'm not going anywhere.
I want you to go, now!
Please, just do it.
Just do it now!
Please!
Go!
You'll have to work for your meal!
Come on.
Give me your arm, okay?
Over my shoulder.
Ready?
Here we go.
When I get out of here...
I think I'll get laid.
You might want to clean up first.
Wait.
Are you okay?
Blue for the virus, green forthe antivirus.
Blue for the virus, green forthe antivirus.
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking a bout?
There's a cure.
The process can be reversed.
There's a cure!
You'll be okay.
I was beginning to worry.
This is where they kept the T-virus.
How do you know all this?
Because I was going to steal it.
I was your sister's contact.
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.
- You caused all this.
- I can't remem ber.
- The truth.
- I don't remember the truth.
I don't understand.
It's gone.
It's gone. It's not there.
I can't.
I just can't. It's over.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
But there's a price.
Name it
You have to guarantee me that you'll bring this corporation down.
Today all your dreams come true...
Spence?
Spence?
Thank you!
Spence?
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.
We can have everything we've ever wanted.
Money's out there waiting.
You wouldn't believe how much.
Is that how you thought all my dreams would come true?
Please.
I wouldn't want to shoot you.
Might need the bullets.
Back off!
I won't take any part in this.
Okay, but you can't just wash your hands of this.
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.
I was trying to stop them.
You really believe that... people like him will ever change anything?
Nothing ever... changes.
Where...
Where is... the antivirus?
It's on the train... where you found me.
Couldn't have been standing more than three feet from it.
I so nearly made it out.
I didn't realize that bitch of a computer... had defense systems outside the Hive.
In or out?
In?
Or out?
I don't know what we had.
But it's over.
Back... the fuck off!
I'm missing you already.
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.
He shot the locking mechanism out.
I can't believe that son of a bitch is going to get away with this.
I don't think so.
I've been a bad, bad girl.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?
One of the Hive's early experiments.
Produced by injecting the virus directly into living tissue.
The results were unstable.
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA... it will mutate... becoming a stronger, faster hunter.
Great.
If you knew it was loose, why didn't you warn us?
Because she was saving it.
For us.
Isn't that right?
I didn't think any of you would make it this far.
Not without infection.
Why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
This long after infection, there's no guarantee it would work.
But there's a chance.
Right?
I don't deal in chance.
Fuck it.
No pressure, guys.
You require the four-digit access code.
I can give you the code. But f韗st, you must do something for me.
What do you want?
One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.
The antivirus is right there on the platform!
I'm sorry, but it's a risk I cannot take.
She's right. It's the only way.
You'll have to kill me.
Otherwise, we all die down here.
The glass is reinforced, but it won't hold forever.
Do it.
- Get up.
- Just do it.
- Please.
- Do it!
You don't have long to decide.
- You have no choice.
- Kill her now!
- Get off!
- You don't have any choice.
- Just do it now!
- I can't!
- Kill her now. Do it.
- Please.
- Kill her. Kill her now!
- Just do it.
Kill her!
Kap?
The bitch wouldn't open the door, so I had to fry her.
Move!
What the fuck was that?
It's a long story.
Start it up.
I'll get the virus.
I'm missing you already.
We're in business.
Full power!
We're leaving!
I don't want to be one of those things... walking around without a soul.
You won't.
When the time comes... you'll take care of it.
No one else is going to die.
Here.
Rain.
Rain.
Rain.
I'm not dead yet.
I think I'll have that back.
I could kiss you, you bitch.
What the hell's going on back there?
- Get us the fuck out of here.
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails.
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Now!
I failed all of them.
I failed.
Listen to me. There is nothing else you could've done.
The Corporation's guilty here, not you.
And we finally have the proof.
And that way,
Umbrella can't get... away with this.
I mean, we can...
What is it?
You're infected, but you'll be okay.
I'm not losing you.
- Help!
- Help him! What are you doing?
He's mutating.
I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Get off!
What's happening?
I want her quarantined.
Close observation... and a full series of blood tests.
Let's see if she's infected.
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility.
Then assemble the team.
We're reopening the Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
Just do it
Who's in there?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Do you know fear?
Do you know what it's like to feel your heart beating so intensely...
...that you can't even breathe?
This is a story...
...of monsters. Creatures.
Hideous nightmares that crawl in the night.
I've seen them.
I've seen them in visions.
And you will too.
I know you're saying to yourself:
"What is this brother doing in this godforsaken place?"
The truth brought me out to the only place...
...where I can speak the truth and they can't get me.
That's right. Right here at KFRD,
freedom radio.
The source for the inside dope
on conspiracies, aliens...
...and up-to-the-minute reports
on when they'll invade.
It's morning here
in Prosperity, Arizona...
...and it's time for America
to wake up, people!
Wake up before it's too late!
But no.
Of course you're still asleep.
You still think we landed
on the moon...
...that Oswald killed Kennedy, and that
a black man's vote in Florida counts!
Wake up!
Look to the skies.
Look to the skies, my friends.
Unless you're driving.
I don't want nobody suing.
Got enough government problems.
Can barely pay for this damn trailer.
Keep talking, buddy.
Say something that has caffeine in it.
It's a hard life spreading the truth.
Never made Gandhi rich.
Never made Mother Teresa rich.
L. Ron Hubbard?
Actually, he did pretty good
for himself.
Interesting.
Joshua?
Joshua?
You're a big fella.
Joshua! You trying to scare me to death?
Hello, Mike.
The Lycosa narbonensis looks different today. It's bigger.
It's their diet.
I made a discovery.
These have been in the pond for the past three days.
Crickets?
They're like...spider steroids.
I see dead people.
I see dead people.
He loves that movie. I don't...
There they go! Look, look!
-He was hungry!
-As they grow, their appetites do too.
I've never seen spiders this big.
It's because of those crickets?
I'm gonna make a fortune.
Jumping spiders!
Yeah, Habronattus orbus.
Look, look how they kill.
I call this an arach-attack.
-Get it?
-Yeah. It's good.
Have the orb weavers come in?
Took me forever to get that mating pair.
I had to bribe every customs agent from Santiago to Tucson. But here.
That is too cool.
See, the male orb weavers compete for the female's attention.
They all try to give her the best present. Like bugs...
...or, you know, rats or the occasional parrot.
Let me show you something.
You see, the prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest.
You know how women like breakfast in bed.
Look at it.
Look at this, look at her.
The female is three times as big as the male.
Say hello to Consuela.
She fills her prey with digestive acid...
...to liquefy it so she can drink it from inside out.
While it's alive.
Man...
...am I in trouble.
I have to go.
I'll call you later, okay?
Next week, I bet they're twice as big as today.
Bye, Josh. See you next week!
Where did you go, little fella?
I see dead people!
I see dead...!
Sorry, sonny. We aren't hiring.
You sure? I'm a pretty good engineer.
Do I look like a woman who isn't sure?
Yeah, well...
-I used to know my way around here.
-We aren't hiring.
We're laying off. We're three months from a going-out-of-business sale.
-Got the picture?
-Yeah, I got the picture.
But my name's not Sonny.
It's Chris.
Chris?
Aunt Gladys.
Welcome home.
Bad dog! No!
-Pete, what are you doing out here?
-Well, we got a...
No. Question is, what are you doing out here?
-You were supposed to stay home.
-What did you find, Mom?
Some jerk tossed a barrel of chemicals off the road.
Looks like it's been out here a couple of weeks.
Who knows how much contamination it's caused.
The water is contaminated?
Pete, send a sample down to the EPA lab in Phoenix.
Let's see what they come up with.
-I have to tell Joshua!
-That's where you were going?
I told you no more visits to that spider farm, didn't I?
-You're grounded.
-But I have to tell Joshua about this.
I don't want you hanging out with him.
Those spiders are dangerous.
They give you nightmares, and you keep me up all night.
You know what happens when I don't get enough sleep, right?
Bad mood?
Put your bike in the truck.
-Can you help him with his bike?
-Yeah, okay, sure.
Hang on, Mike.
Party's over, gentlemen.
Off the bikes.
Great, this is all I need.
She is the sexiest sheriff in the country.
I know, it's weird.
-You bought yourself a reckless, Bret.
-Give them a break.
-Get in the truck, Ashley.
-Mom!
Now.
-Give me your license.
-Come on, sheriff.
-Anything you say can be used against...
-Shut up!
You have a right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney...
Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall who might be able to take care of this?
Bret, isn't your stepfather the mayor?
Put my daughter in danger again, I'll show you how little that means to me.
We're cool, sheriff.
-Do you think G-string or underwear?
-Definitely thong.
-You're kidding. Gonna pay for this?
-No.
-Sweet.
-That was really sweet.
-I heard that!
-Whatever.
Bret, I can't believe my mom gave you a ticket. It was humiliating.
-I need the phone.
-You don't. You have no friends.
I can't get any privacy around here, you know?
Hello?
My God.
Anybody know what's going on with the phone?
Come on, Joshua. Pick up!
-How much?
-lt don't make sense.
Wait. This is a town meeting, not the WWF.
Mayor?
Why can't those of us that want to sell, sell?
Viroanol wants all of our properties or none of them.
Let's face it, the town's going broke.
They'll pay us to relocate.
How do we know this isn't another one of your get-rich schemes...
...like building this ridiculous mall out here?
They scrapped plans to run a freeway here...
-Or that stupid ostrich farm of yours.
-lt's good meat. It's healthy.
Everybody here is having some financial problems.
I want to get out from under this.
The rest of you should too.
This is a government cover-up, isn't it?
-What are you talking about?
-Why they giving so much money?
Just to get to the mines?
They want to put the empty mines to use. It's safe.
The only reason that we've kept this town going...
...is the hope the McCormack mines could turn their selves around...
...and put everybody back to work.
It is not happening.
Old man McCormack, God rest his soul...
...he's dead.
-As dead as those mines.
-Well, Mr. Mayor...
...before he died...
...he claimed he'd seen that vein.
Let's be honest, Leon.
The man was hallucinating.
Those mines are filled with methane gas.
You're gonna load that gun with toxic waste?
-This is for landowners only.
-I am a landowner, Wade.
Chris McCormack!
I didn't know you were back.
My father said he'd found the Agua Mesa lode. I believe him.
He said a lot of things near the end.
I'm not selling the mine.
Chris! Wait up!
-You're being foolish.
-Back off.
Your father was delusional.
Shut the hell up about my father.
I'm warning you.
Since when did you care about the mines? You've been gone 1 0 years.
Wade...
Don't make the town suffer...
...because you feel guilty you weren't around when your father died.
I'm talking to you.
I warned you!
-What the hell are you doing?
-That's it!
I'm pressing charges.
I want him arrested.
Go home, Wade.
Put some ice on your nose.
Curve around 20 feet away from the scene of a misdemeanor. Thank you.
Ten years and you have not changed a bit.
-Lay low for a couple days, all right?
-Good to see you again, Sam.
Just like old times.
Everything will be sorted out in the morning.
-So you still like men.
-What are you talking about?
Nothing. I just saw you staring at his butt when you handcuffed him.
Who said it's okay to talk to me like this?
He's pretty cute for an old-fogy kind of guy.
He just needs a shave.
Okay, folks. Show's over. Move along.
Night, Sam.
Nothing to see here, folks.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Honey, give it a rest. It's so late.
It's almost midnight.
You told me to finish the job.
I'm trying to actually finish the job.
Let's give Zekie his snack and go to sleep. Where is Zeke?
Well, he's just...
Don't tell me he went into the dry wall again.
I was meaning to get a grille.
They don't have the right size...
You were gonna finish remodeling this place. Over a month ago.
I don't think you know what you're doing.
We'll have to give Zeke cat food, and he hates that.
God forbid a cat should have to eat cat food. That cat is spoiled rotten.
If he was a kid, we'd send him to military school.
Poor Zekie.
-Let's lie and say it's tuna.
-Okay.
You won't trick him. He's smart.
Zekie-doodle.
Look what we got for you.
We got tuna.
Get your furry cat ass out of there!
Zeke.
What's going on?
Oh, my God!
She's divorced now, you know.
I don't want to talk about Sam Parker right now.
Man in a flea circus don't wanna itch, but he still does.
Something on your mind, Gladys?
-I know why you left town 1 0 years ago.
-I left for a lot of reasons.
You wanted to avoid telling Sam why you beat up her husband.
That was a long time ago.
I'm a changed man now.
Prove it.
March down to Sam Parker's and tell her everything.
Why you broke her husband's nose.
Why you left town without so much as a fare-thee-well.
And tell her once and for all how you really feel about her.
Lose the face fuzz before you do.
Makes your mouth look like a stripper's crotch.
That's disgusting.
Hello?
Hey, Pete. What's up?
-Can you talk?
-I can talk. What's the matter?
-Something ate Zeke.
-What?
-He got in the dry wall.
-Something ate your cat?
Oh, my God. What do you think it was?
Unbelievable.
-How is Emma taking it?
-Well, she left me.
-She's gone to stay with her mother.
-I'm so sorry.
-You okay?
-I'm fine.
-You sound like you're crying.
-No, no.
I just...
I have an intolerance to dairy.
I'm just a little bit mucousy right now.
That's it.
Sam, I need to tell you something.
-lt's Bret. I'm gonna get it.
-Wait. Hang on a second. Come here.
I'm worried about things you've been doing lately, Ash.
This bad-girl thing you're going through could get you in trouble.
I have something that I want you to keep with you, okay?
-I really don't want to do this now.
-Just a sec!
I'm a man. You're a woman.
What am I doing?
-Take this. Protection.
-ls that a stun gun? Are you kidding?
-I knew guys like Bret at your age.
-Mom, I'm not you, okay?
I'm not gonna get pregnant at 1 6.
I'm not gonna stay here for the rest of my life and be a trailer-trash sheriff!
Thanks for the flashback.
I didn't deserve that.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.
Can I have the stun gun, please?
-Be careful with it, all right?
-Okay. Thank you.
Get out of here.
Oh, it's you.
-I was wondering if your mom was home?
-Mom! It's for you.
-Morning, Chris.
-Morning, Sam.
I wanted to come by and apologize for yesterday.
I can handle Wade.
Don't worry about it.
Great.
And since I'm back in town for a little while...
...I thought maybe I could...
Sam...
...before I left...
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Do you think we could...
...meet somewhere? Hook up?
Not hook up.
I mean, meet somewhere and catch up on things?
Sure, Chris. We could do that.
-Great. All right. I'll be in touch.
-Okay.
Who are the flowers for?
Well, they're for you, actually.
I picked them myself.
-Nice.
-Nice.
All right, bye.
Picked them myself.
Come on.
Joshua?
There's no sign of Joshua...
...his parrot...
...or any of the arachnids.
Just these huge, intricate webs they've left behind.
I've discovered several arachnid tracks outside.
From my initial estimate, the spiders have doubled.
No...
...more like they're five times their original size.
I found this map in my dad's study.
Leon, is this the section he was working on when he died?
I thought so.
I want to concentrate all our energy in these tunnels here.
Those mines have the highest concentration of methane gas.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake my dad did.
I want all men to wear masks at all times.
If you feel disoriented, get to a higher chamber as soon as possible.
It's nice to know you didn't forget everything we taught you.
-Can you give me a ride into town?
-Sure. Hop in.
Great, thanks.
What's that?
I think it's an exoskeleton of a male orb weaver's pedipalps.
Okay.
It's a spider's leg.
That seems awful big to be a spider leg.
That's the problem.
But nobody's gonna believe me.
Believe what?
Do you really want to know?
-Try me.
-Okay, the situation is this:
My friend Joshua sells spiders.
They've been growing bigger and bigger.
Now they've broken out of their cages and headed down to the mineshafts.
Joshua is nowhere to be found.
They might've killed him.
But you won't believe me. I'm the kid.
They never believe the kid.
Let me see it.
It does kind of look like an old piece of cactus.
See?
So...
-...where were you?
-I went to Joshua's.
-What did I say about that?
-His spiders are gigantic!
The town could be in danger.
They could destroy everything!
People could get killed.
Just hear me out.
I swear to God it's the television.
This is exactly your problem, right here.
I don't want to hear any more of your media-induced nightmares.
Mom, listen to me!
Add a week to how long you're grounded.
-Please.
-And no TV.
I know, I thought it was a slam-dunk.
Who knew Chris McCormack would suddenly get gold fever?
I'm trying my best here.
Do you know what people would do if they knew...
...we were storing toxic waste without their consent?
Wade, I'm going out now.
Now, look. I let you guys run tests...
...putting that stuff in the mines under my property.
-I'll be back late.
-You owe me on this.
Going off to get wasted, have an orgy.
Might steal a car, want one?
Bret, I'm on the phone. Go have some fun. I'll see you later.
-We stand together or we fall together.
-Thanks for caring, man.
I'll do what I can.
What the...?
Good Lord.
I've been warning you for years,
but you wouldn't listen.
Now it's emerging as a trend in our sleepy little town.
The police wire says Bob Stuck's dog Skippy's missing.
It's the fourth missing-pet call we've had today.
It's strange. It's strange.
People are saying it's coyotes, it's wolves. But we know the truth.
We all know about those cows and the probe.
The anal probe.
Let's talk about the probe. Let's talk about the anal probe. What is that?
What are they looking for?
That's just wrong.
Skippy didn't do anything to anybody.
He doesn't deserve that!
What will you find in a dog's...?
It's just wrong!
You're all ostriches with
your heads in the dirt.
Which just leaves your ass
up in the air!
You're inviting the aliens in! They
have no choice but to probe your butt.
Aunt Gladys, how can you listen to this wacko?
I think he's very informative.
Do Floyd and Leroy still have that barbershop?
Good idea. People are talking.
You can't light those matches?
Maybe it's a sign to quit.
If the aliens come
and try to anal-probe me...
...l'm telling you,
I'm not taking that!
If you want a piece of me, don't take that piece!
So how much is a shave these days?
-Four bucks.
-Four bucks?
-lt's a good deal.
-Got to give a good deal.
Can't charge around here what a barber can charge in other places...
...where they got money.
And jobs.
Of course, some people don't know a good deal when they see one.
-Maybe I don't need a shave.
-Hold still.
I wouldn't want to cut you.
Bret, slow down.
-I thought you loved me.
-I do. I do.
-But, I just...
-But, what?
I don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a truck.
Why didn't you say so?
I got a blanket in the back.
No. That's not it.
I just don't think I'm ready.
-Tammy and Larry do it every night.
-Fine, call them.
Have a ménage à trois if you want.
-That dirty talk just drives me nuts.
-Bret, no.
Bret, please.
-I'm warning you, okay?
-I can't help it.
You just bring out the beast in me.
Back off!
My balls!
God, my balls!
Damn it! I pissed my pants!
Don't you think you're overreacting?
-I was just copping a feel!
-Overreacting?
I can't believe my mom was right about you.
Do you have any idea how embarrassing that is?
Ash, wait. I'm sorry!
Check out Bret.
Let's go! They're coming.
Come on, let's go! Get on your bikes!
-Dude, did you piss your pants?
-We gotta go.
They're coming!
Looks like the only thing going is you, dude.
Holy crap!
They're getting closer! Move it!
We have ostriches, cats and dogs disappearing all over town.
Last time I checked, cats and dogs
are not fish.
And ostriches farmed are not game.
There has to be somebody at Fish and Game who can help.
Hey, watch it!
Yes.
What the hell are these things?
Here we go again.
The phone lines are down.
They'll tell you it's a technical error.
But you know what it is.
They're shutting us down!
I know what you're saying to yourself.
"He's paranoid. He's crazy."
But you know, there's an old saying:
Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean people aren't following me.
All of a sudden there's
a communication blackout.
At the bottom of the bag.
It's where they always put the food.
Here it is.
Here we go, Bruisie.
Bruisie?
Bruiser?
Aunt Gladys?
Bruiser?
Oh, my God.
Oh, Lord.
Are you in there?
Oh, my God!
I'm coming, baby.
I'm coming.
Aunt Gladys, I lost the face fuzz.
Bruiser?
Aunt Gladys?
This ain't no cactus.
Mike!
Mike! Sam!
-Can I talk to Mike?
-Why?
I can't explain now.
-Look what I found in my basement.
-That thing is huge!
Give me a second!
Hold this.
What's going on?
So check this out.
After taking careful measurements of the exoskeleton I found at Joshua's...
...I calculated the spider was the size shown here.
-What spider?
-The hole in the basement was bigger.
What hole?
Let's input the measurements from your exoskeleton and see what happens.
That's more like it...
...unfortunately.
-What the hell is this?
-lt's my media-induced nightmare.
Oh, God.
So you're telling me a giant spider ate Gladys?
-Maybe not. Was there webbing around?
-Yeah, lots of it.
She might have been attacked by a male orb weaver.
What's the difference?
Males compete for the female by bringing her presents.
The prey is cocooned alive so she can feed on it in her nest.
-Women like breakfast in bed.
-So Gladys might still be alive?
That's Ashley! Come on!
Look out!
Keys. Keys, keys, keys!
Mike, get out of here!
-Throw me the scissors!
-Scissors?
Scissors! Here you go!
Sam! Help!
Hey, spidey!
Thank you.
Pete! Come in, Pete.
Hold on to your shirt.
Is that you, Sam?
I don't know what's going on, but the phones are down.
I know. Take the weapons and get to my house.
Guns? Why would we be needing...?
Just do it!
Okay. All right. Okay.
Winchester, 30.06...
...Mossberg pump...
...and the Lee Harvey Oswald rifle.
Why we have that, I do not know.
Why don't you stomp them hills out
and get some room to grow...
-...before you start making brags!
-Brags, is it?
I'm closing up.
You're always talking at me about something.
Can you turn that thing down?
You're already deaf from it.
I said, turn that thing down!
What did you say?
Bob?
First Emma leaves, now Sam's got me doing spring-cleaning.
Can't get any worse.
So, what happened with you and Brian anyway?
He wasn't exactly the faithful type.
I've been trying to tell you this for a long time...
You can handle one of these, right?
-Ashley, Mike, you guys ready?
-Just a minute, Mom.
-How many spiders did Joshua have?
-I don't know. 1 00, maybe 200.
-Two hundred? Are you kidding me?
-Hurry up, guys. Time to go.
Joshua's spiders are nocturnal hunters.
They're coming out to feed.
-We have to warn everybody.
-The phone lines are down.
To spread the word,
to look into the dark places...
-...our government-controlled media...
-We could broadcast a warning!
Who'll believe that lunatic?
What was that?
What the...?
What the hell is going on?
It's Pete. He's waiting.
Come on, let's go.
See you, Ash.
I don't think that was Pete.
Oh, my God.
Holy moly!
Everybody get in the car, now!
Ashley, go!
Come on!
Look out, Sam!
Come on!
What are you waiting for? Go!
Habronattus orbus.
The jumper.
Stay in the car.
Pete, honk if there are any problems.
You got it, Sam.
-Mom.
-Stay in the car!
Guys, stay.
-What are you doing?
-I need to make a broadcast.
-You can't oppress me...
-Show me how this thing works.
Consider this a government conspiracy to take over your station.
Here.
Friends...
...our local authorities have...
...an emergency message for our little community.
This is Sheriff Parker.
I have an important announcement.
Pete, turn on the radio.
This is not a prank or
one of Harlan's crazy stunts.
We have a crisis situation
on our hands.
The town is being overrun by giant spiders.
I know how this sounds, but you must trust me on this.
I want everyone to arm themselves immediately.
I repeat:
Giant spiders are all over the town.
-Did she just say giant spiders?
-That's just Harlan's show.
Giant spiders? What the hell kind of bullshit is that?
Aliens you believe, this you have a hard time with?
Why didn't someone say something?
Look at me. God.
I gotta warn Sam.
No! Noise will just attract it.
-What should I do?
-Give me the walkie-talkie!
-Mom, are you there?
-Yeah, Mike.
-ls everything okay?
-Don't make any noises.
There's a giant tarantula headed your way.
Copy that.
Oh, my God!
They're here!
You're just food to that thing!
Attention, people.
Everyone meet at the Prosperity Mall.
I repeat:
The Prosperity Mall!
-Why the mall?
-Concrete walls, steel doors.
Did you see that thing?
Come on!
I have four more payments on this shit!
-Come on! Hurry!
-lt's coming this way!
Go! Go!
Come on!
-Can I get a refill, Carol?
-Help yourself, sweetie.
-That was an excellent ostrich burger.
-Well, thank you.
Kind of slow today, huh?
It's always slow here, Wade.
There's no way you're telling me that thing back there is from Earth.
All right! They're spiders from Mars.
You happy?
No.
It's the invasion!
I'm telling you, it's the invasion!
I told you!
Everyone, just get to the mall as quick as you can!
Get to the Prosperity Mall
as soon as possible.
Arach-attack.
If you build it, they will come.
Get everyone inside and get the gate down.
Kids, go with him.
Oswald's gun.
This is the weirdest day of my life.
What is going on?
Look behind you!
-How do you lower the gate?
-Key.
-Do you have it?
-Yeah.
-Hurry up!
-Okay.
-That's the back gate. The lavatory.
-Come on!
-You're making me nervous!
-I'm making you nervous. Give me that!
-Could it be the "front gate" one?
-Yeah, front gate.
-Come on!
-Come on!
Get inside! Hurry!
Mom, hurry up! Come on!
Mom, hurry! Hurry!
Mom, come on! Hurry up!
Mom, are you okay?
What exactly is that?
Spider, man.
How's the lock-down holding?
This one's pretty good.
They're holding, but we don't have much time.
Okay. All the doors are locked and secured.
No breaches out front. I haven't heard a sound. I think the doors will hold.
-Someone ought to get back there...
-Go.
We have a right to know what's going on!
Those things killed Leroy.
Bob Miller, my best customer, was hanging from my ceiling.
What am I doing on the radio?
I've been telling you about the invasion for months.
Am I talking to myself?
I'm here for you.
-You saying those things are aliens?
-You're not listening...
Mom, they have to be quiet.
Those were big-ass spiders!
Really big ones!
Shut up!
Let's listen to the kid. For once.
Go on, Mike.
First of all, the spiders are attracted to vibrations. That includes:
Loud noises, movement and talking.
So everybody needs to stay as calm and quiet as possible.
-Why didn't you call in the Army?
-Where have you been, Wade?
-The phones are dead.
-Does anyone have a cell phone?
Use mine. You have to climb a mountain for a signal.
Use the antenna on the mall.
That's how I get my broadcast out.
-Have someone climb and get a signal.
-That's a great idea.
Be a hero.
I'll do it.
No, Sam. Let me.
I got your back.
-Great.
-I've fought aliens my whole life.
About time I busted up a few of them.
Face to face.
They're not aliens. They're spiders!
Those of you without weapons, arm yourselves...
...with anything that you can dig up.
Then we'll meet back here.
Norman?
-Show me the way to the roof.
-Where?
-The roof, Norman!
-The roof. The roof!
-How's it looking?
-Roof's clear.
Be careful, Chris.
Thanks, Sam.
I've been trying to say something to you, so I'll just say it.
-Okay, take these. You'll need them.
-Perfume?
Spiders have a developed sense of smell. The perfume could confuse them.
-Great. We die, we die smelling nice.
-Nobody is dying, okay?
That's the one who busted up my trailer!
I bet you he's their leader.
Come on.
-You have the phone?
-I thought you did.
You said you had it.
Yeah, I got it. Sorry.
I got confused.
Damn it.
-I got a signal!
-Great. Now, how about dialing?
91 1 emergency.
I'm calling from Prosperity, Arizona.
My name is Chris McCormack.
I know how this sounds, but believe me.
It's the truth.
Our town is being attacked by giant spiders. We need military intervention.
-This is not Dial-a-Joke.
-This is not a crank.
-I'm hanging up on you.
-Don't hang up. Please!
It's an invasion!
They're here! They're here!
That's what I've been telling you!
I don't know if those gates will hold.
I have to find Wade.
Has anyone seen Wade?
He went through a door back there.
Between the Sewing Center and the Cinemaplex?
He's going into the mines through the storage room.
Take everyone who's hurt and the kids to that storage room.
Norman, show them.
Now! Go!
Here we go!
Get ready.
-Get ready!
-Oh, yeah!
Got one!
Everybody get to the basement, now!
Hurry!
Pete, come on!
Go, Sam! Get downstairs!
I'll find another way out!
Guys, go!
Come on!
-lt's locked!
-What?
He must have locked it.
We're trapped.
Get back! You eight-legged freaks!
-My God! There's so many!
-Harlan, get up here!
I'm afraid of heights.
Heights? Are you afraid of spiders?!
-Come on, Harlan!
-I'll try to lead them away.
You'll what?
Defend the human race.
What are you, insane?
You'll never get that anal probe near me!
Harlan, no!
You know what?
Let's just go back inside.
Locked.
Plan B?
I tell you what.
We're just gonna run away.
Yeah?
Okay.
Bret?
Wade?
-What are you doing here?
-I can't find my way out.
You won't believe me, but
I've been chased by giant spiders.
Down here?
A second ago they were right behind me, but I think I lost them.
No, you didn't.
Go! Go, go!
Sam!
-Chris, where are you?
-Sam, I'm up here!
What the hell are you doing up there?
-Just chilling. Get me out of here!
-Back up.
Wait. You push and I'll pull.
Ashley?
Mom?
Wade locked the door.
-They're all around us!
-Everybody hide. Take cover!
Bret?
Behind you!
-Bret?
-Ashley.
-We better hurry!
-Everybody, let's move. Come on!
Into the mines. Hurry!
There's gotta be flashlights or something.
Grab one of these.
Cool, a miner's helmet.
I always wanted to try one.
-Can you lead these people out of here?
-You bet. Come on, everybody! Let's go.
This should hold him.
I hope.
How do we get out?
We follow the power lines to a generator. They're always near an exit.
-Come on! Not that way. Hurry!
-This way.
Follow the kid!
Hurry up!
You went back for that?
Lose that thing. It'll slow us down!
This saved my ass so many times today!
What's that smell?
Wasn't me.
Methane gas. A lot of it.
Listen up!
The slightest spark or an open flame can blow us all to hell.
So be careful. Let's go.
Cables lead to a generator.
Follow the cables.
Cables.
Way to a generator.
You guys!
It's this way!
Follow the cables.
The cables lead to a generator.
Follow the cables.
Norman! Somebody save him!
No gunfire! No gunfire!
It will set off the gas!
Catch!
Come on, hurry!
Into the tunnel. Follow the cables.
Let's go!
People, hold on!
What the hell is this?
-What's going on?
-I don't know.
That spider back there, was that the female?
No. That was just another male.
The female is three times as big.
So she's probably still close by, right?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Go back with your sister.
Go back with your sister!
-Why are you here?
-Mom sent me.
-Why?
-You don't want to know.
We have to do it.
It's the only way out.
Oh, my God.
What the hell?
What is it?
I think it's alive.
Don't touch it.
Don't...
It's Wade.
Bret, just go, okay? Just go.
Let's get him down.
Wade.
-I don't feel so hot.
-Hold on a second.
Look at the size of that!
What the hell is this place, Mike?
-lt looks like an orb weaver den.
-Get us out of here.
-I can't.
-Why not?
Is there a chance that Gladys is still alive?
-lt's possible.
-Are you crazy?
You'll have to get out without me.
Follow the wires.
There's a shed outside with a generator.
-Start it quickly.
-What are you up to?
I got an idea.
I get it. Everybody, come on.
Follow the cables. This way. Come on.
-Bret, I'll need your bike.
-My bike?
-Just do it.
-All right, kids, come on.
Leave it there. I've been trying to say this for a while.
-Now?
-Yes, I may not get another chance.
-I should've said this a long time ago.
-I know.
You beat up my ex because you found out he was cheating.
You couldn't tell me because you didn't want to break up my family.
And you've always loved me.
And if you'd said something, maybe our lives would be different.
Exactly.
Your father told me.
My dad told you?
Now, get moving so you can make it up to me later.
Go on.
That was easy.
Gladys.
This way. Follow me. Come on.
Breathe.
You're alive.
You look like an angel.
All that gold.
Gold?
Right behind you.
The Agua Mesa lode.
He found it.
We need to find the generator.
Mark, get everybody away from the mines.
Hurry up. Get away from the mines.
Get up there.
Mom, what about that one?
Come on.
I knew he wasn't crazy.
What are you doing?
No, no. No smoking.
We gotta get out of here.
Stand back.
Shoot it! Shoot it!
I'll set off the gas! I can't!
Get back.
Mike, you saved us.
I need this more than you.
-Damn it. Why isn't it working?
-lt needs fuel.
-See?
-All right, find gas tanks.
Anything you can find.
We need gasoline.
Hurry! Hurry!
-What are you doing?
-lt'll set off the gas.
Hurry!
-All the gas cans are empty.
-We just need one electrical surge.
Keep looking, everybody.
Don't give up.
Here, will this work?
Ashley, you're a genius.
Switch. Put this on.
Mom, it worked.
Adiós, Consuela.
Fire!
Aunt Gladys, are you okay?
Not my mall. Not my mall.
Not the mall. Please, not the mall.
I hope the insurance pays for this.
Let's go! Let's go!
I thought you said 91 1 didn't believe you.
They didn't.
They listen to my broadcast.
We never miss a show.
We drove from Tucson.
It sounded like you needed help.
Where are the aliens?
How many times do I have to tell you?
They're not aliens, okay?
They're spiders who grew because they ingested toxic waste.
That's a more believable explanation.
I had to drag that barrel out of the water. I got covered in it.
-And your point is?
-Point?
See this? All brand new. Brand new growth. Check it out. Brand new.
Are you all right?
-Do you smoke?
-No.
Good.
Dangerous habit. Disgusting. Causes explosions. Wish I'd never started.
-Any more people down in those mines?
-My aunt was the only one alive.
I checked the other cocoons, but nobody made it.
We got cocoons! Told you it would be worth the ride!
Glad you came back home?
Yeah, I am.
Me too.
That is the story of how the aliens attacked our sleepy town.
To this day, people refuse to believe what happened here.
They'd lead you to believe
I would embellish this story.
But we know the truth.
Two things I forgot to tell you.
One: They never did get that probe near me.
And two: As far as Chris McCormack reopening the gold mines...
...and putting everyone back to work...
Well, that, my friends...
...is another story altogether.
[ENGLISH]
No!
Damn.
Thanks for the present, Benn¡e. l guess we're ¡n the same bus¡ness.
Okay. l'm on my way.
Don't want to keep the roaches wa¡t¡ng.
-Hey, M¡ke. Watch your step.
-Yeah, yeah.
-These tracks are st¡ll l¡ve?
-W¡ll¡ams, over here.
Jesus Chr¡st.
What happened to h¡m? l don't th¡nk he got electrocuted.
What's go¡ng on w¡th h¡s eyes?
Don't know yet.
We'll have to wa¡t for the autopsy.
What d¡d th¡s guy see to leave an express¡on l¡ke that?
Any w¡tnesses?
Not to the acc¡dent. A guy went to grab a paper out of the newsstand.
When he came back, the v¡ct¡m was l¡ke th¡s.
Accord¡ng to th¡s guy, h¡s eyes were bleed¡ng pr¡or to the swan d¡ve.
-Must have been ¡nto computers.
-H¡s name's Pol¡dor¡.
He and another guy wrote the book.
Must have tr¡ed to stop the tra¡n w¡th
¡t. Had to pry ¡t out of h¡s f¡ngers.
Now all we need ¡s the lead¡ng lady.
-You want one?
-No, thanks.
G¡ve ¡t up, M¡ke. The Feds are cover¡ng that now. lt's over.
The Feds haven't done sh¡t.
Not hear¡ng from h¡m doesn't mean he's stopped.
You're p¡ssed off because th¡s Doctor guy keeps send¡ng you love letters.
Everyone has cases they can't crack.
Don't let ¡t fuck w¡th your head.
What now?
Get h¡m out of here. Put h¡m
¡n a hold¡ng pen, an empty one.
And get someone to translate whatever language he's speak¡ng.
Jesus Chr¡st.
Check h¡m for a passport, an lD, someth¡ng ¡n fuck¡ng Engl¡sh. lt says he's a German exchange student,
D¡eter Schrader.
L¡ves over ¡n the V¡llage.
Here's the address.
Call the health bunn¡es, DOH.
F¡nd out ¡f there's some bug go¡ng around, someth¡ng w¡th bloody eyes.
They can send someone to meet me at h¡s apartment.
Sykes! Leave the doughnut shop here.
Let's go! Come on.
Johnny!
Know any German?
-l can s¡ng ''She Loves You'' ¡n German.
-Great. That'll help.
Pol¡ce!
Anyone here?
Art¡sts.
-l wouldn't touch her just yet.
-Jesus.
Actually, Terry Huston,
Department of Health.
-Detect¡ve Re¡lly. You got here fast.
-Yeah.
Goddamn ¡t.
God!
-What do you make of th¡s?
-Th¡s ¡s really fasc¡nat¡ng.
She's d¡splay¡ng poss¡ble s¡gns of a hemorrhag¡c v¡rus. Someth¡ng l¡ke Ebola.
Excuse me.
-Re¡lly.
-Reilly, we got a problem.
Sykes! Hello? Sykes? What are you do¡ng? Call the coroner.
Yeah, r¡ght.
Jesus.
What ¡s ¡t?
You better get back to the station. l got a dead g¡rl, a woman from DOH say¡ng we have a ser¡ous problem.
-l'm not go¡ng anywhere.
-I think you better get back here.
And bring the DOH with you.
Do you have a plast¡c bag?
-That's ev¡dence.
-Yeah.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-That's German. lt means ''murderer.''
-l got that. What's w¡th the 48?
Don't know.
Barlow, what happened here?
The guys sa¡d he was talk¡ng to h¡mself. That's ¡t.
We'll know more when we get h¡m to the morgue.
All r¡ght, stand back.
Great.
Should we be ¡n one of those su¡ts they're wear¡ng?
-We're probably already ¡nfected.
-So we could all just be dy¡ng here?
What ¡s ¡t w¡th you people?
You just let th¡s sh¡t run w¡ld?
Thanks.
Serum panel ¡s all clear. lt's not a v¡rus.
So we're back at square one.
We've got the camcorder.
Sorry about the space patrol, but we had to be sure.
No problem. l love needles stuck ¡n me. lt's a hobby of m¡ne.
So you l¡ke work¡ng w¡th bugs and v¡ruses?
Someone's got to do ¡t. Otherw¡se, d¡sease spreads out of control.
You do the same th¡ng.
At least l can see what l'm deal¡ng w¡th.
Th¡s other sh¡t creeps me out. l hate germs and....
D¡seases.
What about bugs? l pretty much hate them too.
-You know you sleep w¡th bugs?
-What?
You sleep w¡th bugs.
No, l don't, actually.
Yeah, you do. Everyone does.
Dust m¡tes. They're ¡n your carpets,
¡n your bed.
They look l¡ke l¡ttle lobsters. ln fact, they're d¡stant relat¡ves.
-You're enjoy¡ng th¡s, aren't you?
-l just don't get out much. l can see that. l'm sorry. l'm be¡ng ¡ncons¡derate, mak¡ng you uncomfortable. l'm so used to see¡ng through a lens, l forget how ¡nt¡m¡dat¡ng a camera can be. l'm do¡ng a l¡ttle f¡lm at the W¡lton Theatre, and....
You know, l can't say th¡s w¡thout ¡t sound¡ng l¡ke a l¡ne, but.... l was f¡lm¡ng you because you happen to be the perfect lead¡ng lady.
Do you mean that? l can't prom¡se anyth¡ng...
...but come by the theater ton¡ght...
...l'll put you ¡n front of the camera, see what happens.
You have to punch this button.
Then you can record us.
Hard to bel¡eve that's the same guy.
Wait!
-l can watch th¡s later.
-Wa¡t a second.
The guy's los¡ng ¡t.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The sun's out.
Another storm com¡ng.
Sh¡t! l got a t¡cket. l th¡nk l can take care of th¡s for you.
Really?
So l'll see you later?
Thanks.
Terry, could you come ¡n here?
Mr. Turnbull?
D¡d you want someth¡ng?
No.
Yeah.
What happened w¡th the German k¡ds? ls ¡t Ebola?
No. l don't even th¡nk ¡t's a v¡rus.
-What, then?
-l don't know.
Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm just t¡red.
Let me know ¡f you hear anyth¡ng, okay?
Sure.
-Where d¡d your computer go?
-Broke. l sent ¡t ¡n for repa¡r.
-Play¡ng on the lnternet too much?
-Yeah.
Well, l'm gonna go f¡n¡sh my report.
Hot!
Cause of death appears to be a stroke brought on by a surge of adrenal¡ne.
No s¡gns of v¡olence except the bleed¡ng.
H¡, you must be Terry Huston. l'm Thana Br¡nkman.
One moment.
Severe ruptur¡ng to the ocular blood vessels. l can't account for ¡t.
Heart ¡s completely engorged.
There's a mass¡ve hemorrhage to the cerebral cortex.
Death was ¡nstantaneous.
End report.
-So ¡t was a stroke.
-Unless lab tests f¡nd someth¡ng else.
There's no known v¡rus, bacter¡a or v¡rulent prote¡n.
Excuse me.
Br¡nkman.
We have another one.
Oh, my God. lt's Edd¡e Turnbull.
D¡d your husband have any med¡cal problems?
Any cond¡t¡on that would contr¡bute to h¡s sudden death?
Other than the cha¡n-smok¡ng and the chron¡c stress? l tr¡ed to warn h¡m. lt never bothered h¡m unt¡l these last couple of days.
He got k¡nd of s¡ck, started see¡ng th¡ngs.
-What k¡nd of th¡ngs?
-Crazy th¡ngs.
Sa¡d someone was watch¡ng h¡m.
Kept talk¡ng about a l¡ttle g¡rl.
There was no l¡ttle g¡rl. l th¡nk he worked h¡mself to death.
Always work¡ng.
Always on h¡s computer.
You know what's odd, though? lt was l¡ke he was afra¡d of ¡t.
Mrs. Turnbull, do you m¡nd
¡f we take th¡s?
Now, you and l share a great respons¡b¡l¡ty...
...to them.
They've come to watch but also to learn.
We w¡ll prov¡de a lesson...
...that reduc¡ng relat¡onsh¡ps...
...to anonymous, electron¡c ¡mpulses...
...¡s a pervers¡on.
But here, we offer ¡nt¡macy.
So tell us about yourself, who you are, where you're from.
Do you have brothers and s¡sters?
D¡d you dream of be¡ng a baller¡na when you grew up?
You're gonna k¡ll me, aren't you?
Of course l'm gonna k¡ll you.
The lnternet offers b¡rth, sex, commerce...
...seduct¡on, proselyt¡z¡ng, pol¡t¡cs...
...postur¡ng.
Death ¡s a log¡cal component.
An ¡nt¡mate exper¡ence made more so...
...by know¡ng the v¡ct¡m.
So, Karen...
...tell us your hopes and dreams.
Noth¡ng. Noth¡ng ¡n common.
Pol¡dor¡ had a bad ch¡ldhood, some juven¡le stuff.
Cleaned up at tech school.
German k¡ds seem clean. One was arrested for weed, b¡g surpr¡se.
Turnbull d¡dn't even have a traff¡c t¡cket. l don't know.
Let's start over.
We gotta be m¡ss¡ng someth¡ng.
They all had the same pattern of bleed¡ng, r¡ght?
They all had burnt computers.
Maybe th¡s guy was try¡ng to tell us someth¡ng.
We gotta get these computers checked out. l know a forens¡c programmer, Den¡se
Stone. She's worked w¡th me before.
She m¡ght be able to help.
We need to f¡nd a common l¡nk on these computers.
-They look pretty fr¡ed, and th¡s one....
-You th¡nk you can do ¡t?
The data should st¡ll be retr¡evable.
Unless the f¡les have been corrupted. l'll see what l can do.
-You're the best.
-l know.
Turn around, Benn¡e. l don't want you watch¡ng th¡s.
Forty-e¡ght hours. 48.
Do you like to watch?
Okay, l th¡nk we get the ¡dea.
I'm waiting for you.
Denise.
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play with me?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
How ent¡c¡ng the smell of cheap perfume can be.
Or ¡s that fear? l'd l¡ke to say l can feel your pa¡n...
...but l can't. l can't feel anyth¡ng. l've been depr¡ved of that somehow. l know what l should feel. l just can't feel ¡t.
You can end th¡s lesson whenever you w¡sh. S¡mply ask me to k¡ll you.
She wants to l¡ve.
Very well.
Let the lesson commence.
-Den¡se!
-lt's you.
-H¡.
-What's wrong? l'm f¡ne. l just came to g¡ve you th¡s.
-Where d¡d you get th¡s?
-l was there.
What do you mean?
Den¡se, tell me.
The one th¡ng all the v¡ct¡ms have ¡n common...
-...¡s the Fear s¡te.
-That doesn't make any sense.
-He wouldn't use the same s¡te tw¡ce.
-Who?
The Doctor.
-Who's the Doctor?
-A skeleton ¡n my closet. lt's a l¡ve-cam death s¡te.
That's not l¡ke Turnbull.
Why would he watch that?
People love to see death.
Why do you th¡nk the rat¡ngs are so h¡gh on real¡ty d¡saster shows?
Maybe ¡t's a way to f¡nd out about death before ¡t's your turn. l gotta go.
Wa¡t. Do you th¡nk you can trace who's runn¡ng the s¡te?
-Sure.
-Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, l'm f¡ne. F¡ne.
Den¡se....
Be careful. We'll see you soon.
-Hey, come on.
-Where we go¡ng? l d¡d some read¡ng last n¡ght.
-We're look¡ng for Frank Bryant.
-Over there ¡n the back, hon.
-Last table.
-Okay, thanks.
Frank Bryant?
Are you Mr. Frank...
...Bryant?
-How can l help you, off¡cers?
-How d¡d you know we were cops?
Nobody ever says my name that way except cops.
We're not here to cause you any trouble.
We read your book, the parts we could understand.
Really? l d¡dn't real¡ze my book was st¡ll be¡ng sold.
-We found ¡t on a dead man.
-A guy named Pol¡dor¡.
Pol¡dor¡?
Pol¡dor¡ ¡s dead?
What can you tell us about h¡m?
A good guy.
A decent fr¡end.
Why would he be clutch¡ng your book as ¡f ¡t were the Holy Gra¡l? l couldn't make much sense of ¡t myself.
That's because ¡t was a load of sh¡t. l needed a new car, so l wrote the book. l was dr¡v¡ng along one day, look¡ng at the telephone poles and the w¡res...
...and l came up w¡th th¡s ¡dea.
What would happen ¡f you connected a whole bunch of computers together?
You'd get one b¡g computer.
L¡ke a supercomputer.
A neuronet.
Pol¡dor¡ and l used to spend long n¡ghts talk¡ng about ¡t.
He came to bel¡eve that the Web could rece¡ve energy...
-...store ¡t, send ¡t out.
-Energy. What k¡nd?
-Here you go.
-Thanks, doll.
Fuck ¡f l know. l mean, you know....
Negat¡ve energy, magnet¡c f¡elds...
...psych¡c energy steal¡ng your soul. You know?
-And?
-Pol¡dor¡ bel¡eved he knew...
...where that s¡te ex¡sted.
But then aga¡n,
Pol¡dor¡ was fucked up.
And now...
...he's dead.
Do you remember the name of the s¡te?
-No ¡dea.
-Do you th¡nk he was r¡ght? l never bel¡eved a word of ¡t.
But then, l'm drunk by 8 p.m. lt's noon.
Hey, l'm ahead of the game.
Thank you for your t¡me,
Mr. Bryant.
-lf we need to reach you....
-l'll be here.
-l have no reason to leave.
-Okay.
Oh, my God.
She was the f¡rst. Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
He k¡lled her on the Fear s¡te.
He tortures h¡s v¡ct¡ms t¡ll they beg to d¡e.
-Th¡s ¡s the Doctor, r¡ght?
-Yeah.
H¡s name's Al¡sta¡r Pratt.
He was thrown out of med¡cal school.
N¡ne months, he fucked w¡th me. l never even got close.
How come?
After every k¡ll¡ng, he'd change the s¡te. We couldn't trace ¡t.
What t¡me d¡d Pol¡dor¡ d¡e?
-Three a.m.
-Turnbull was later, about 6, r¡ght?
Based on that, these v¡ct¡ms d¡ed two days to the m¡nute...
...after they logged on to the s¡te.
The German k¡d was try¡ng to tell us.
Sh¡t. Den¡se.
Come on, Den¡se.
-You try¡ng to get ahold of Den¡se?
-Why?
She was supposed to drop someth¡ng off.
She d¡dn't show--
Get un¡ts over there now!
-What you talk¡ng about?
-l sa¡d get un¡ts over there now!
-She's not there. She's not answer¡ng.
-Keep try¡ng.
-Just d¡al ¡t aga¡n.
-l am. l just tr¡ed. She's not there. l should never have gotten her ¡nvolved. l should have fuck¡ng warned her.
-lt's not your fault.
-l st¡ll don't get one th¡ng.
Everybody d¡ed 48 hours after they went on to that s¡te, r¡ght? Everybody.
Den¡se doesn't f¡t the pattern.
Maybe ¡t was eas¡er to d¡e than face whatever ¡s on the webs¡te.
What do you mean?
Edd¡e Turnbull was terr¡f¡ed of car crashes. lt was a ch¡ldhood th¡ng.
He was man¡c about ¡t. l d¡d some research. D¡d you know the
German g¡rl was terr¡f¡ed of drown¡ng?
-But she d¡dn't drown.
-She d¡ed ¡n water.
Maybe she d¡ed of her greatest fear. l don't know, Terry. l don't know, l th¡nk you're reach¡ng.
-Maybe.
-Den¡se got too close.
Someone k¡lled her. lt's as s¡mple as that.
Can you prom¡se me one th¡ng?
That you won't v¡s¡t that s¡te?
God, Den¡se.
Do you like to watch?
Do you want to see more?
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?
Jeann¡e!
I know who you are, and I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
How do l play?
Find me.
You have 48 hours.
Me.
What happens ¡f l lose?
You die.
Do you want to play?
What are you afraid of?
God!
Jesus.
Sorry, d¡d l scare you?
M¡ss, your glove.
M¡ke?
The webs¡te. l saw her.
-Who d¡d you see?
-The dead g¡rl.
-What dead g¡rl?
-Jeann¡e R¡chardson. l saw her.
Bryant was only half r¡ght.
-What do you mean?
-lt's not just energy.
-l don't understand.
-She's out there, al¡ve ¡n the w¡res. lf the w¡ll ¡s strong, ¡t can l¡ve
¡n the objects around ¡t.
You don't go there, all r¡ght?
Prom¡se me.
Tell me you won't go there!
Don't go there!
Prom¡se me you won't go there!
Forty-e¡ght hours.
Hello, Terry. Are you ready to play?
Why are you k¡ll¡ng M¡ke?
Guilty.
Gu¡lty of what?
Watching.
Are you ready to play?
Yes.
Sh¡t!
-Hey, Sykes.
-Hey. l need to take a look at the Doctor f¡les.
Let's go ¡n here.
Look.
The Feds are cover¡ng th¡s now. l suppose you th¡nk you can do better?
M¡ke doesn't l¡ke people fuck¡ng w¡th h¡s-- Stop! All r¡ght!
Jesus-fuck¡ng-Chr¡st.
Knock yourself out.
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
Yeah, she was beaut¡ful.
Yeah, Jeann¡e. l checked out her addresses. Sh¡t holes.
Art¡stlmodel, my ass.
You, though...
...you're a d¡fferent story.
W¡ll you shut the fuck up?
Oh, my God.
Joseph Stal¡n sa¡d that the death of one person ¡s a tragedy...
...the death of a m¡ll¡on: a stat¡st¡c.
Your death w¡ll g¡ve mean¡ng to all us sad, l¡ttle l¡ves out there.
See? The aud¡ence ¡s never wrong.
They smell death.
Mrs. R¡chardson?
Do you have a moment to talk about your daughter?
Th¡s ¡s Jean Mar¡e on the day of her F¡rst Commun¡on.
Th¡s ¡s the Jeann¡e l know, not what they sa¡d. They d¡dn't know her.
So beaut¡ful.
She was a happy ch¡ld desp¡te her cond¡t¡on.
-Are you okay?
-Yes, l'm f¡ne.
Cond¡t¡on? D¡d you say, cond¡t¡on?
Jean Mar¡e was a hemoph¡l¡ac.
W¡thout med¡cat¡on, she could bleed to death from just a scratch.
Left her scared to death of anyth¡ng sharp.
-Sc¡ssors or kn¡ves.
-Yes. That ball....
She always had that th¡ng w¡th her.
W¡llful ch¡ld, wouldn't g¡ve ¡t up. lt wasn't unt¡l she d¡scovered boys that she f¡nally left ¡t beh¡nd.
Could you take a look at these p¡ctures for me and tell me...
...¡f there's any places that you recogn¡ze ¡n them? lt's the old Poelz¡g steel m¡ll two m¡les down the road.
Jeann¡e used to play there as a ch¡ld.
What are you watch¡ng?
You seem l¡ke you were expect¡ng me.
Where ¡s she?
No.
M¡ke Re¡lly, where ¡s he?
Excuse me? Can l help you?
Just tell me where he ¡s!
Please calm down, or l'll have to ask you to leave.
Yeah, okay, l'm sorry. l'm sorry, l just-- l really need to see h¡m r¡ght now.
Okay. F¡rst door on your left.
Hello?
Hello, Terry.
Are you ready to play?
-Goddamn you, what do you want?
-Play the game. Find me.
Where are you?
Time is running out.
Leave me alone! Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Do you like to watch?
I am waiting for you.
Jeann¡e?
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
Oh, my God. l found you. l found your body. l d¡d what you wanted.
I know who you are.
And I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
Find me.
Oh, my God.
What t¡me ¡s ¡t?
You shouldn't leave your front door open.
-Oh, my God.
-lt ¡nv¡tes ¡llegal entry.
M¡ke.
Terry.
What d¡d you do?
Why?
-You just ran out, d¡dn't you?
-More l¡ke a slow trot.
You gotta go back.
No, they can't help me now.
-l'm dr¡ft¡ng ¡n and out more and more.
-Okay.
-l'm runn¡ng out of t¡me.
-We gotta go.
-Where are we go¡ng?
-The morgue.
Are you two okay?
You don't look good.
You should see ¡t from our s¡de. l just thought once we found the body, that would be an end to ¡t.
No, there's got to be more to th¡s.
She had a reason.
Someone performed an autopsy on th¡s body a long t¡me ago.
-Look at the ¡nc¡s¡ons.
-lt's Al¡sta¡r.
He cut her open wh¡le she was st¡ll al¡ve.
Textbook procedure.
He cut out her v¡scera.
Then he bagged them and sewed her up.
What's that?
She must have swallowed ¡t before he k¡lled her.
''The gu¡lty must be pun¡shed.''
So she d¡dn't want a bur¡al.
She wants revenge.
B¡ngo.
Two days.
Two days ¡s how long Al¡sta¡r tortured Jeann¡e before she d¡ed.
Kn¡ves, M¡ke.
She d¡ed her worst n¡ghtmare.
Sh¡t, Terry, l'm los¡ng ¡t.
-l'm hav¡ng trouble stay¡ng here.
-Hold on, okay?
Wa¡t here.
Come on.
Electroshock, as it is sometimes called....
Electrodes are attached to the patient's head....
Oh, my God!
M¡ke. l found h¡m.
Are you ¡n, or what?
-Two.
-One.
-lt better be ¡mportant.
-Sykes, I need your help.
What? l'm w¡nn¡ng here.
-Look, I found the Doctor.
-So? Call the Feds.
There's no time for that.
I need backup.
All r¡ght.
-Where ¡s ¡t?
-A cooling tower. Poelzig steel mill. l love watch¡ng these old tapes.
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
She was my favor¡te.
You see, l bel¡eve death should be repuls¡ve...
...so we don't grow too fond of ¡t.
But...
...all th¡s could be avo¡ded...
...¡f you're ready.
No tears. Take joy ¡n the fact that you've done great good here.
You asked for death...
...so l'm no longer your murderer.
The t¡me has come, Karen.
Drop ¡t now!
-Drop the fuck¡ng kn¡fe now!
-Bless my soul.
Re¡lly, so glad you could make ¡t to the party.
-You brought a date.
-Get away from her. l'm not gonna f¡re a warn¡ng shot!
Guns are so ¡mpersonal and artless. lf you want to hurt someone ¡nt¡mately, you have to get up-close and personal.
You already tortured her. Shoot¡ng her would be do¡ng her a favor.
You won't shoot.
You suffer from the curse of hope.
Yeah, l got hope. l hope my f¡rst shot blows your fuck¡ng head off! lf you k¡ll her, you'll have no one to h¡de beh¡nd. l don't want to spo¡l th¡ngs, but ¡f you're...
...expect¡ng the cavalry to save the day, you're gonna be d¡sappo¡nted.
The cavalry's r¡ght there.
Oh, my God!
Fuck!
Not a very n¡ce person, Mr. Sykes.
Appall¡ng eat¡ng hab¡ts.
Too bad th¡s show always has the same end¡ng.
No, not th¡s t¡me.
Someone wants revenge.
No! l guess the fans love a comeback.
M¡ke.
Look at me. Stay w¡th me.
Hold on. Hold on.
Stay w¡th me. M¡ke.
M¡ke, look at me.
Hold on. Hold on! Look at me! No!
Attract¡ve women l¡ke you sell through the roof.
Just l¡ke Jeann¡e.
Al¡sta¡r.
Al¡sta¡r!
You're dead! l k¡lled you!
Al¡sta¡r.
Al¡sta¡r...
...t¡me to feel.
Gu¡lty.
Gu¡lty.
T¡me to d¡e.
Oh, my God.
No, M¡ke.
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
I said, "Who's there?"
Oi, sir!
Sir?
Ah, dear, dear, dear.
Sir?
- I have it. Take me to her.
- Yes, master.
She's been waiting.
As have I.
Hmm.
Oh, Van Helsing, that last target was a civilian.
You know, one of those innocents... you Knights of the Holy Order are sworn to protect from the dark forces.
Oh, I don't know, Carl.
I thought I detected... a hint of demonic influence in its beady little eyes.
Beady?
Van Helsing.
Carl.
CardinalJinette.
You are needed.
Next tableau.
And there, the second victim.
Next tableau.
Victim three, what they could find of her. And again.
The latest victim.
Those women died at the hands of a monster.
But from eyewitness accounts, one who was once a man.
Keep in mind that this man's soul can still be saved.
Not every soul deserves to be.
Van Helsing, since time immemorial,
the Knights of the Holy Order have served and sacrificed...
as humanity's protectors from an evil so ancient... all have forgotten it but we few.
That monster showed no mercy to those women.
To remain true to our calling, we must believe all souls are worthy of salvation.
Stop him? Save him?
First someone's gotta find him.
And London's a city of almost four million people. Shouldn't be a problem, Carl.
The murders were committed in the same small section of the city.
And all with a surgeon's scalpel.
Now that suggests the murderer resides in the area and is involved in the study of medicine.
Of course. A scientist. We see this all the time. We do?
When their studies exhaust them, they're tempted to take the easy way out... to find whatever it is they're looking for.
The unholy way, you mean.
Using the dark arts to change from man to monster.
No doubt calling forth demonic familiars to serve him.
And would you have it any other way?
Oh, this I like.
Put her down!
Happy to oblige.
Oopsie.
It's him, I tell ya.!
He's the killer.! Get him, lads.!
Tell the hangman
Mr. Hyde says hello.
Don't let him get away!
Bloody hell! He's gone.
Like a blooming ghost.
Perfect. A monster that stops to wipe his feet.
Clever, whoever you are, but not clever enough.
Mum, Dr. Jekyll has arrived.
He may enter.
You're late this evening, Doctor.
We grew concerned. Your Majesty, you should know by now... that nothing and no one shall ever keep me from you.
We are comforted by that.
We do look forward to your visits.
Whatever medicinal miracle it is... you conjure up from your concoctions,
we feel better and better after each of your visits.
As do I, Your Majesty.
Truly, we do not know...
what we would do without you.
Oh, my.!
Everything is so... twirly.
I'll take care of her now.
Yes, master.
After you.
Careful, Your Majesty.
I wouldn't want you to fall.
To have you so close to me,
I cannot help but recall the first time I gazed upon you... so many years ago.
You were the very flower of womanhood.
Newly on the throne.
I was a mere youth.
An impoverished student of the medical arts.
And though I was just one of thousands in the crowd that day,
I knew you saw me too and shared my love.
Don't fret, my dear.
You'll soon remember everything as I do.
But I do remember... something.
I'm... I'm the queen.
And you, my brilliant doctor, you've been treating me for that horrid illness that makes me feel as if... as if I were a doddering old relic.
How better to prove the depth of my love for you.
Now welcome, dear heart, to what will soon be our new home... away from prying eyes, after our marriage, of course.
Marriage? But am I not still ill?
You shall have your medicine every night... to keep you young and mine forever.
Could you stop squirming?
If you bought me the proper-sized corset,
I wouldn't have to squirm.
There. A vision of loveliness.
I told the cardinal when he got your cable I am not a field man.
There's not much danger of you being mistaken for any kind of man, Carl.
Oh! You put on too much powder.
And this lip rouge with this scarf?
No real lady would be caught dead with...
Perhaps not the best choice of words.
Carl, for a friar, you know an awful lot about lip rouge.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well, even being demon bait.
Well, it's not as if
I could put an innocent life at risk.
What about my innocent life?
If you truly believe this is beyond the scope of your calling...
Don't worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
That's what worries me.
Come on, ducky. What do ya say? Let us buy you a pint.
Oh, I don't know.
Would you happen to be a gentleman of medicine?
If that's your fancy, girlie,
I can play doctor with the best of'em.
Physician, heal thyself.
Men, they're all the same.
Should we try another street corner?
Van Helsing, where are you hiding now?
- It's about time you showed up.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, milady.
I am not a lady!
That's all right.
I'm not a gentleman.
You've only got one way out of this.
I know.
You're no priest, man.
You don't miss much.
Ah, the fetching lady friend.
Stay there.
Don't shoot! I have no money!
I beg your pardon.
Can you guess what happens next?
This is where you get off.
Van Helsing, how did you get here?
I, uh... I put on the brakes.
How did you get here?
Well, according to the map, after 9:00, the Marelybone line...
Let's go see what's left of our friend, huh?
I don't understand. How can I keep losing the trail of something so big?
And what's this?
It's my new invention.
La santa pistola de agua.
The holy water pistol?
Mm-hmm.
I thought it might come in handy sometime. It might.
It's as if the holy water made contact with something...
Unholy.
Wherever he's going, he's following this sewer line.
We've reached the end of the line.
Decaying flesh and sulfur.
This is his lair.
Exactly how do you propose we cross that flaming moat of certain death?
The same way
Hyde must have.
Those stepping stones.
I'll go first, shall I?
I could have been a Franciscan, but, no!
I had to travel. See the world.
Well done.
Carl, look out!
Elizabethan. Sixteenth century.
I know those uniforms.
- They're beefeaters.
Of the dead!
Carl, in our line of work, there's dead... and there's dead.
All right, that's settled.
They're really dead.
Van Helsing!
Get up the stairs.
What?
Carl, the pistola.!
Of course.
That'll work.
That'll work.
Van Helsing, listen.
I'm truly sorry... for calling you an arrogant, reckless popinjay.
You never called me an arrogant, reckless popinjay.
Well, not to your face.
Dr. Jekyll, are you there?
Who are you?
Gabriel Van Helsing, miss.
And I'm...
You should not be here,
Mr. Van Helsing.
Hmph.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm not certain you should be here, miss.
Very humorous, sir.
But you please me.
So you may address me as mum.
All right, mum.
Who's Dr. Jekyll?
My physician. I've been very ill.
Ill? With what?
You look fine to me.
I'm... not sure.
Well, that's something we can talk about later. Right now, you have to leave this place.
- Are you giving me an order?
- Pretty much.
Sir, since it is obvious you do not recognize me,
I am Alexandrina Victoria Wettin, by the grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, queen, defender of the faith.
Queen Victoria?
Seriously?
Carl, meet Queen Victoria.
Van Helsing, Queen Victoria is a worthy matron of a certain age.
And this is an unholy lair where all manner of enchantment is possible.
Whatever are you two speaking about?
We know we're looking for someone trained in medicine.
So why not consider the doctor who's been treating the queen?
- The royal physician?
- His name is Dr. Jekyll. And we are to be married.
When?
Tonight.
And once we are wed, he can give me my medicine every night.
So I shan't ever be ill again.
It fits, Carl!
A man of medicine in love with the queen... driven to restore her youth looking for the easy way.
If Dr. Jekyll has concocted a potion that uses the life he stole from his victims to give youth to Victoria...
Then if they marry, these murders will never stop.
I have no idea what you're prattling on about.
What murders? Why would I need someone to give me youth?
- I'm only 20 years old!
- Your Majesty, you're 70.
And you were married for... for decades.
You also have nine offspring, all grown, and more grandchildren than any man can count.
I think you and your friend should see a doctor of your own, or...
Dr. Jekyll.!
Stand back, Victoria.
I'll save you.
Come, Victoria.
Where?
Where we can be safe together.
I admit,
I don't have much experience,
But this is not going well, is it?
That way!
A dumbwaiter shaft?
How are we supposed to use it without someone up there to pull the rope?
Fly?
Good idea.
Carl, grab hold!
Of what?
That worked.
Oh, maybe for you.
Please, Doctor.! You must explain.!
Oh, my goodness!
This is Buckingham Palace and that's the Golden Jubilee balloon.
Your Majesty! Victoria, stop!
You're in danger!
Wait, Doctor!
They said the strangest things... about you and me.
Lies! All lies!
Into the basket with her.
Cut the rope!
Don't wait for me!
We are carrying extra weight!
Whoever that meddler is, I won't let him take you from me.!
- I won't!
- Doctor, what are you doing?
You're safe now.
Why are you doing this?
For your... love.
No! He'll never take you!
Not from me!
- Victoria.
- Forgive me, my love.
- I have no other way to keep you with me.
Stay behind me.
- Who are you?
- What you fear most.
You had your chance.
I'm not here to kill you.
I'm here to save you.
- Too late.
- Good.
No.!
Victoria!
Ah, damn you!
Van Helsing, I can't!
Just lie back, close your eyes and think of England.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
I agree. It was awful.
Your Majesty, as I understand such things, the light of day will lift the enchantment and restore you.
So I will bid you farewell.
But wait.
There's so much more...
I mean, I...
I must reward you.
That's really not necessary.
A vow of poverty and all that.
Not all rewards must be material.
For your reward, you may kiss your queen... on the royal cheek.
I would be honored, mum.
Huh? Hmm.
Psst!
Psst.!
We are not amused!
Guards.!
Oh, dear. Let's go, Carl!
Guards! Guards!
You'll need to report to the cardinal in person. What do I say?
This isn't over.
Hyah!
(woman) 911. What is your emergency?
(distorted) I'm tired of the way things are,
as opposed to the way they should be.
(woman) Is this an emergency?
Where are you located?
(distorted) That really doesn't matter.
- Can we have your name?
- Of course.
(distorted) Common denominator.
Your man on the street.
Now don't ask another question,
or I will be obliged to do bad.
And you would have to assume
responsibility. No interruptions.
Natural selection.
Natural selection.
Born to win.
Born to lose.
Born to die.
Three situations that make up
everything in the world.
No interference is necessary.
But interference happens.
People interfere with an important task
I enjoy doing.
I don't believe people are not good
by nature, not at all.
So if you remove the authority, the police,
then you'll see life
as God intended it to be.
A world of pandemonium.
Without police, the weak
and diseased would be gone.
Streets red with blood.
The way nature intended it to be.
There will be another body found tonight.
Thank you for your time.
April fool, right?
- You're kidding, right?
- You've picked a very fine diamond.
I'll tell you what, throw in a car and I'll take it. Throw in a hand, I'll take it.
Perhaps a lesser gem would be more appropriate?
Nah, it's perfect.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
What's up, Malloy?
You're losing your touch.
He'll get you in the rematch.
Don't you worry, buddy.
I got plans tonight and they don't include you guys. I'll get killed if I don't go.
She'll be pissed anyway. One more round isn't gonna make a rat's ass difference.
I forgot I was dealing with the stable-relationship brain trust here.
You guys ever heard of quittin' while you're ahead?
You got a little drinking problem in this area over here.
Give this guy another pop.
You feds any closer to nailing that son of a bitch?
What d'you wanna hear? I got him gift-wrapped out in the trunk.
- We're gettin' close.
- That's bullshit.
- No, we're getting close.
- I hope so.
- Tucker didn't deserve that.
- No cop does.
He's puttin' bodies on display like trophies.
Son of a bitch knows we're the ones who have to look at 'em, that's why.
Look, I'd love to tell you we got this guy ready for a toe tag and a slab.
But we're dealin' with a different kind of street logic here.
It's a whole different breed.
There's no repeatable patterns.
There's no identifiable method.
He's targeting cops, different precincts, different times. Every site's clean.
But he's gonna fuck up. They all do.
When he does, we'll nail him.
Come on, Malloy. We've had nine dead cops inside of six months.
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin' about, that would be a different story.
A different story? You really think I give a shit what kind of badge a man wears?
I think you're feelin' guilty because you and your fed friends are droppin' the ball.
What happened to you, Malloy? You used to be one of us before you became a fed.
Ease up. We're all on the same team here.
Yeah, ease up.
You finished?
Oh, yeah, everyone here knows I'm an asshole.
(laughter)
- You got that right.
- You are an asshole.
Everyone knows that. That's a fact of life.
Bring these guys anything they want, please. Just keep their mouths full.
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.
You wanna tell me why you were late for dinner?
- Very funny.
- Got an excuse?
Sorry.
- How was Donovan's?
- How do you know I was at Donovan's?
- Cos I called.
- No, you didn't.
No, I didn't.
- That was my imitation of your ex-wife.
- Ouch.
Come on, don't go there.
What happened to our date?
These guys are goin' through a bad time, so I was just talkin' to them a little bit.
It's always gonna be somethin'.
If not this, somethin' else, Mary.
What is this? The beginning of a "you're just too good for me" speech?
- Is that what this is?
- Stop bustin' me already.
Lucky for you, I've been checking out the competition, and the pickings are pretty damn slim, so I was thinking, what the hell?
Why not stay with me?
Are you tryin' to tell me somethin', huh?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I have a surprise. I got this great surprise, but it's gonna have to keep for a while.
I'm gonna give it to you, but I wanna have a clear head when I do.
Whatever happened to roses?
Roses? Obviously you haven't been reading Cosmopolitan.
Obviously.
Romantically speaking, roses are totally obsolete and monkeys are the new language of love.
I didn't know that.
Well, if that's the case... why don't you and your little friend come to bed?
I think we just got lucky.
Forget it. I work alone.
- I could have made it myself, you know.
- And you would have gotten another DUI.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, Jimmy, are you gonna tuck me in?
Christ.
Jimmy?
(pager beeps)
What the hell is this? A treasure hunt?
Everybody make sure you step on every damn thing you can.
You see anything you want, just take it on home.
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah. A long time.
I can't find any sign of gunpowder tattooing.
The shooter was most likely several feet back.
He was in whispering distance.
See the starburst splitting of the skin here, Doc?
Gun was pressed directly against the head.
The killer wanted him to feel the barrel.
Nine dead cops inside of six months.
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin' about, that would be a different story.
Let's cut him down.
How long do you plan to have him hang there?
Junior hasn't finished analyzing the body.
What do you think you're gonna find? Why don't you get that club out of his throat?
- He's a cop!
- Let me handle this.
- Fine.
- (phone rings)
- Hello?
- Let me speak with Agent Malloy.
It's for you.
Thanks.
It's Malloy.
- You and your friend were out late.
- Who is this?
Tell me, Malloy, what do you see
in that dead cop's eyes?
Do you see recrimination?
Because it's your fault.
Who is this?
They've all died because of you.
- What are you talkin' about?
- We'll get to that. But first things first.
You know, she's got a lovely place here.
Nice neighborhood.
It almost looked safe... until now.
You really should have stayed home and played house, instead of playing hunter.
He's at my house.
(doorbell)
Her name is Mary, right?
I'll bet she has nice eyes.
- He's at my fuckin' house!
- 1311 Oak! Westside. Go! Go!
Come on, Mary.
(rings)
(screaming)
- Pick up the goddamn phone!
- Send all available units.
(rings)
I'm sorry, but Mary can't come to the phone right now.
What do you want?
You're the agent in charge
of my case, aren't you?
That's right, so whatever you gotta do, do it to me!
I am doing it to you, Malloy.
And I'm doing it to her.
You still haven't told me what you want.
Four years ago you were in charge
of an investigation of a series of murders.
Atrocities against prostitutes.
I call it removing diseased filth.
You got very close to getting me.
You'd rather protect them and remove me.
You made my life hell.
So now I'm returning the favor.
- Keep him talking, Jake.
- Hunting the hunter.
I won't live long.
The odds are against that.
So what time I have left,
I will dedicate to you.
I'll always be close, like hide-and-seek.
Now, about Mary...
To kill a man is easy, but kill what
he loves and he dies a thousand times.
Please don't hurt her.
Please.
I'll see you, but you won't see me.
(drilling)
Mary! Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Where is she? Mary! Mary!
Oh, jeez.
Agent Hendricks!
We got him.
Hey, Tommy!
What's the story?
Security guard spotted him covered in blood, dressed in SWAT gear.
Son of a bitch didn't say a word, just opened fire.
- Guard OK?
- He took one in the leg.
Lost a lot of blood.
Called for backup before he passed out.
(Malloy) I see you, you see me.
(helicopter pilot)
You on the roof, identify yourself.
Identify yourself now. This is the police.
(clanging)
You buyin' shares in this place?
Hey. Kill me again.
Listen to me. I...
I've been diggin' around.
There's this place out in Wyoming.
It's a detox center.
Just hear me out this time.
It's run by a former cop for cops.
You know... if she'd never met me, never knew me, she'd still be alive.
I'm where I wanna be, where I should be.
That's where I am.
OK. I'll make you a deal.
You blow your brains out like a damn man and stop pissing on Mary's memory one sorry-ass day at a time, and I'll take care of your tab.
What the fuck is...?!
What's the matter with you?!
It's all right, everybody.
A little accident. Everybody relax.
What's the matter with you?!
Whether you like it or not, you still got a life to live.
It doesn't end here.
(house alarm)
(Mary's laughter)
(distant siren)
(Hendricks)
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Transmigration of the soul?
Any of that stuff?
I do believe I was a shitkicker in a previous life.
Well... nothing a few nice curtains couldn't fix up.
Hey, look, partner, if you ever need to return the favor, make it Miami.
We run a dual diagnosis program here.
A fancy way of saying we're gonna detox your ass and then tackle your demons head-on in group sessions.
I was a cop for 12 years before
I took a shot at drinking myself to death.
So I know what keeps you up at night.
Gonna make it all go away, huh?
Not even gonna try.
No magic wands here.
The shit you swallowed doesn't digest.
You carryin' a weapon, Mr Malloy?
I'll have to confiscate it.
Need the shield, too.
We don't allow crutches here.
Thought I'd stick around awhile, burn up a little vacation time, maybe even rent me a cabin.
Do some ice fishing?
Yeah, why not? See if I can't catch more than a shot glass.
Hey, this is gonna be a piece of cake.
Doc.
The man's my better half.
I sure as hell don't intend to lose him out here in Jerkwater, Wyoming.
Do you follow me?
Jack.
See if you can't find some boots and a parka for this man.
Anything to serve these fine officers, Doc.
You might run into more than a cool breeze up here.
Come on. Let's get you checked in.
The place was built in the 50s as a command control center for Strategic Air Command.
Satellites made the facility obsolete, so they converted it to a military asylum.
Uncle Sam put it on the market last year.
It's isolated as hell and that's why I chose it.
You're the last of our patients to arrive.
You know the rules, Slater.
No smoking in the rooms.
I'd like you to meet Jake Malloy.
We got nothin' to hide here, including our names.
Slater, Metropolitan Police
Department of London.
I know it's a long way to come to quit the shakes.
Club Med was fully booked.
Ain't exactly Betty Ford, huh?
Last place I was at was a Twelve Step health spa.
Mud baths, nature walks.
We don't got TV here.
Convicted felons, Doc, get TV.
- Jaworski here's a narc.
- And a hell of a sharpshooter.
Shut up, limey! Nobody's talkin' to you.
This is Jake Malloy, FBI.
Hey, we got a fed gracin' our presence.
Hey, Malloy, any idea of the three most overrated things in the world?
Home cookin', home fuckin' and the FBI.
Let's get your blood and urine sample, see what we're up against.
(Doc) Our resident psychiatrist was an
Air Force consultant here for four years.
When the facility shut down,
she signed on with us.
She's pulling double duty as a nurse,
till we get fully staffed.
We used to take care of almost 100 patients here.
There's only ten of you cops.
But judging from your case files,
I don't think anyone's gonna be bored.
This is Jack Bennett, one of our orderlies.
Jake Malloy, new arrival.
If you need anything, ask Jack. He knows the place like the back of his hand.
That's what they say.
I know every inch of this nuthouse.
Anything else, ma'am?
I don't think so.
Manny, this is Jake.
See if you can fatten him up.
Hey. Hope you ain't a vegetarian.
- Gilbert, say hi to Jake.
- Hey, Jake. How you doin'?
You wanna hear about the generator?
Don't worry. I'll keep her hummin' with spit and balin' wire if I have to.
- And the boiler's about to go, too, Doc.
- Then fix it. You're the caretaker, Hank.
Have you managed to get settled in?
First night's a bitch.
- How long you been here?
- Couple of days.
No one's been here more than a week.
Don't have to meet them to know them.
Take Noah there, all buffed out like a fag.
Completely paranoid.
Back-to-the-wall type.
Got SWAT written all over him.
Fuck!
Fuckin' motherfucker's motherfucked!
Lopez. LAPD.
Reverend Jones. Worked homicide before he found Jesus at the bottom of a bottle.
Check out Jaworski. This guy couldn't even swallow a bullet.
Stupid fucker missed his brain and blew half his cheek out.
See the old guy? McKenzie. Member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Word is he froze up, let his partner get shot.
They put him on the rubber-gun squad.
All right, let's get started.
This is what I call the witchin' hour.
No lessons, no Twelve Steps.
This is your time.
They told me to put 'em in the bag.
The pieces.
They were so tiny.
Little fingers.
Every once in a while
I'd get a whole hand or... part of a leg.
Mostly blood. It was everywhere.
Their little fingers were just... rolling around.
I dropped it. I...
I tried to gather 'em up, but there was so much blood.
I can still smell it.
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces.
Some of their fingers still had paint on 'em.
They were finger-painting when it happened.
You got somethin' to add, Noah?
This ain't the Boy Scouts. This ain't about helpin' old ladies across the street.
- He's just a kid.
- Oh, bullshit.
He's just weak, like the rest of you mamsy-pamsy motherfuckers.
If you can't stand the smell of trash, why are you workin' in the garbage business?
Maybe he's not as strong as us.
Maybe he never learned to like the smell.
(sniggering)
You laugh it up, smiley. You sure as shit won't see me swallowing my gun.
So what do you swallow?
A fifth of gin? Maybe a little speed?
- It ain't the same.
- Yes, it is.
Let's be clear about somethin'.
You people landed here for a reason.
It's not just your careers you're killin'.
Booze may be a slow burn, but it's still suicide.
(coughing)
Deluxe cabin, my ass!
How'd it go? The first session.
I don't know. What do you wanna hear?
I got no more demons, no more monsters?
We all have demons.
But I stopped believing in monsters when I was 12.
That's cos you never met any.
Don't be naive, Jenny.
Is that her ring?
Look, I know you mean well, but you're in way over your head on this one.
Do you think words are gonna make a difference, gonna change anything?
They're not. So just do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on me.
Looks like we're in for one.
You know, my Mary had a scarf like that.
- We can't have this goin' on here!
- Keep out of everybody else's business.
- Don't jump over my ass. He's the one...
- I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it.
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Yeah. Something like that.
- The point is he ripped it off.
- Yeah!
Fine. Suppose he ripped it off.
What do you wanna do about it?
(chuckles)
Did you take it?
Jack?
Maybe you should give it back.
Thanks for the light, old-timer.
Stupid cops.
How you doin'?
Do you wanna get some air?
If you wanna talk, I'm right over here.
Looks like we'll be in this place awhile.
Hey!
No!
It's OK.
It's OK. It was just a nightmare.
Can I help you?
Here, take these. They'll help you sleep.
- Would you mind?
- Would I mind what?
Stayin' a minute.
(Jenny gasps)
Oh, God.
Can't get through.
Storm must have knocked down the lines.
It ain't like anyone's gonna make it out here anyway, boss. We're socked in.
I ain't gonna think about ploughin' until the storm breaks.
What are we gonna do?
Break the news to the group.
Hank, you get Gilbert up here to help you move the body.
I think I'll be goin' with just a salad tonight.
- Did he leave a note?
- None that I could find.
No offense, Doc, but this mini-Alcatraz you got goin' here ain't gonna change a goddamn thing.
You may dry a few of 'em up, but you ain't gonna change what they're made of.
The boy was weak. We all knew that.
It was just a matter of time before old Humpty fell off the wall.
And what about
Dudley Do-Right there, huh?
What a peach he is.
30 years of bullshit war stories, only to leave his partner for dead.
Alone. No one to watch his back.
There's nothin' worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop.
You see what I mean, Doc?
You ain't the Wizard of Oz here.
You can't just hand out courage.
You're real good at kickin' 'em when they're down, aren't you?
- Do OK when they're standing up, too.
- You never stood up to anybody.
Yeah?
Well, at least I'm there for my women.
That's enough.
Hey, Doc! Check it out!
(Jaworski) Man overboard!
- Get my bag. It's in the office.
- (Jaworski) Earthquake!
- He's had alcohol.
- What's wrong?
He's on disulfiram.
Makes you puke if you even smell booze.
- (Lopez) He looks bad.
- (Doc) Shit!
- Looks like he swallowed a damn dog.
- Give us a hand.
- What do you want me to do?
- Hold him. Hold him still.
A little Aqua Velva over the rocks?
I rest my case, Doc.
Hold him.
- I want everyone's belts.
- (all protest)
Off with them. Now!
- Shoelaces, too.
- (all protest)
Do it!
I want the rooms checked every hour on the hour.
(Noah) Anything you say, Sheriff.
Hey, you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon?
- You mean the old loony bin?
- Yeah, right.
I got a friend I'm tryin' to ring stayin' up there.
Your friend sick in the head, is he?
In more ways than one.
Well, the lines are down.
You a cop?
Thought so. Been a few passin' through here lately.
One took a cabin for the night, bought out all my Scotch, damn near tore it down.
Another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater.
So how are the fish biting?
You happen to see what's goin' on outside?
It's called the dead of winter.
I meant ice fishing.
I'd love to try my luck.
Maybe you could help me out.
Maybe. Fact is, you couldn't have picked a better time of year.
We both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves, there's no stopping it.
I know you have to believe that, Jenny.
But I can't.
That's what this place is about.
Stoppin' em.
I don't get it.
Why do you put yourself through this?
You got family, Malloy?
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I. No.
The job is all I got.
I'm not a coward, you know.
I know that.
But try and remind yourself now and then.
That goes both ways.
Can't sleep?
I didn't mean to spook you.
I never knew.
Knew you could miss someone so much?
I didn't know that.
Just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger.
What's the matter, cowboy?
Somebody steal your horse?
No, I just thought I heard something.
Like what?
I don't know. Something.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Good morning to you!
Rise and shine, lazy ladies!
It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood!
Wakey, wakey!
Oh...
Doc!
Doc!
Doc!
Two suicides back to back?!
Get Mr Fed in here.
He's seen his share of dead officers.
The bruise is in the shape of an inverted V.
- What does that mean?
- The markings say it's a suicide.
The V is from the noose. If he was strangled, it'd be a straight-line bruise.
Hey, Doc. The waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute.
Still taking bets on who the next suicide's gonna be?
The man didn't say it was a suicide.
He just said the markings say that.
And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes.
And there shall be no more death.
Neither shall there be any more pain.
I'm tearin' up here, Reverend(!)
Shit!
I can't risk finding any more bodies.
I'll have to lock you in your rooms.
- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me!
- I need to review everyone's case files.
- Lookin' for what?
- Answers.
Look, man. Solitary confinement?
No fuckin' way, man!
- It's for your own safety.
- Nobody lockin' me up in no cell!
Is somethin' funny?
If the idea of a bunch of cops being locked up like common criminals isn't a joke, what is, then? (chuckles)
Doctor Mitchell, can I have a word?
- What?
- Jack's missing.
Jack's your responsibility.
Maybe he took a joyride.
We're short one snowmobile.
- He'll freeze to death.
- He ain't the only one!
Boiler bought the farm. Mm-hm.
Manny! Afraid soldier boy's turned into a human ice cube by now.
Yeah, the hell with Jack. Who knows what that crazy fucker's up to!
(bolts door)
Conner and Brandon.
They weren't prior suicide attempts, were they?
- I want you to lock your room tonight.
- Why?
Please. Just do it.
Damn!
Hey! Hey!
Come back here!
Jack?
Jack!
Jack!
We're droppin' like fuckin' flies!
Knock it off!
You're losing it. You're all losing it.
Slater's right. We're cops.
What would Slater know about bein' a cop? Bobbies don't even carry a gun!
God forbid I put myself on a par with America's finest.
Shut up! Communications are down.
Our meds are gone.
One orderly and Doc, who knows where they are! And we got two bodies.
That, and you're all in danger of experiencing d.t.'s.
Sweetcakes, shakes are the least of our worries.
You got a medical degree we don't know about? Let her talk!
I'm not talking about the shakes.
Grand mal seizure caused by d.t.'s... can kill you.
- Without meds, you're all vulnerable.
- Maybe you should tell them about Jack.
Hey, lady? What the hell is he talkin' about?
- I don't know.
- Bullshit! You tell 'em, or I will.
(McKenzie) Jenny, Doc's missing.
Two men are dead.
If there's something you need to tell us, now is the time.
- You should check his service record.
- I already did that.
- The guy was a patient here.
- Oh, that's great!
The son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in South Korea.
Strangled him. Psycho!
- And you gave this crazy fucker a job?!
- Come on, Lopez! Back off.
Since when did protecting women become your specialty, Malloy?
You're right. It's not.
My specialty... is doing my job... while the one good thing in my life is home, being butchered.
You talk about her again,
I'm gonna kill you.
How'd Jack end up working here?
I vouched for him.
He was totally rehabilitated.
- What about Gilbert?
- A manic-depressive. He hates violence.
Look, Jack's got nothing to do with this.
I know that.
Hey, people! Gilbert found Doc.
Jones.
Jaworski.
Noah.
Lopez.
(owner) That's the Scotch drinker, all right. Guess he never made it to detox.
- You're tellin' me this guy's a cop?
- Well, that's what he said.
Now, what the hell is goin' on up there?
I need to get up there.
Whoever did this must have used a sledge.
They hammered the living shit out of these carburetors.
The snowmobiles are finished.
Let's take the Suburban, go for help.
If I had extra hands, we could dig our way out if we get stuck.
- (Jaworski) The freezer's fillin' up fast.
- I think he's right.
Hank, take Jenny and Gilbert.
Manny can help with the digging.
No. Weeks can't be moved. We need someone here with medical expertise.
It's not a request.
You don't have to be here.
Where would I be safer? Riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like Hank, or sitting here in a room full of armed officers?
How about you?
No way. I'm gonna go down with the ship.
You guys go while there's still some light.
We're outta here!
C'mon, Gilbert, let's go.
- Now what?
- We'll rotate two-man shifts on watch.
- Who made you king shit?
- He's ranking officer.
- I ain't in uniform.
- I thought SWAT boys were team players.
My team doesn't wait around to get hit by a shitstorm. We are the shitstorm.
I'm with Noah. I say we find this crazy piece of shit and Frosty his ass.
How do you know it's Jack?
How do you know that?
How do you know it's not...
Lopez, or Jones?
How do we know it isn't Slater?
How do I know it isn't you?
Me?
Yeah... right!
You better keep an eye on that one, nursie.
He crackin'!
Split the building into sections.
Each person will clear an area.
Point me in the direction.
(killer) I see you.
But you won't see me.
He'll die without it.
Jenny, where'd you find Conner's body?
Hank! Do ya think we can get the truck through yet?
Keep digging, Manny.
(clunk)
What was that?
- Gilbert's gone!
- I don't give a shit where he's gone!
We're gettin' the hell outta here!
Get in the truck.
(Manny) What's that?
Look out! Look out!
(horn blaring)
Anything scares you, kill it.
Hank! Where'd you go?
Hank!
Jack!
(footsteps)
(footsteps continue, then stop)
Jack.
(door closes)
(door opens)
Gilbert!
- Wait!
- (terrified gasps)
(man) Hey.
Frozen corpses don't bite.
- You're used to seeing bodies. I'm not.
- It's OK.
Weeks is burning up. I need ice.
Will you get it for me?
(hammering on door)
(hammering continues)
Who's the fuckin' brainiac that locked the door?!
- Shit!
- What were you doing outside?
Noah told me to check for tracks.
- Did you see Malloy?
- Why? Should I have seen him?
Is there something goin' on here
I should know about?
(electricity buzzes)
(lighter clicking)
Jack?
Come on, now, Jacky boy...
No more games.
(groaning)
(electricity buzzes)
(Jones) Main circuit board died with
McKenzie. That means no power, no heat.
The emergency lights are not gonna last long.
Great! It's gonna be
20 below in here by morning!
(gun clicks)
This is bullshit! This is bullshit, Malloy!
- Come on.
- Malloy!
- What happened?
- Jack and Manny are dead. Hank's gone.
- Where's Gilbert?
- He saw me and he bolted.
- He's still out there?
- I found the missing snowmobile.
Whoever took it burned the personal files.
- Why?
- Makes it impossible to prove who's who.
One of us isn't a cop.
Give me a knife.
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?!
- Confirmation!
- Confirmation of what?!
I see you. You see me.
- He's here.
- What are you talking about?
He's here!
Agh!
(Gilbert) Dead...
- Dead... dead...
- What'd he say?
- All dead.
- They're all dead.
(Malloy) Open up! Come on, open up!
For the last time, I got out of there when I saw Jack strung up.
I almost got lost in the blizzard.
I'm coming back through the utility tunnels when Malloy comes in.
He's not just down there for a walk, so I hide behind the woodpile, OK?
It's not Malloy. I was with him.
He went out there to help you.
Well, what do I know?!
(Slater) Malloy should stay locked in my cell. Just to be safe.
Yeah?
Tell you what... you don't have to be a fed to read a flashing sign.
Maybe it's time for Reverend Jones to explain the artwork!
Don't you ever paw me, boy.
You understand?
Maybe Malloy was right about one of us not being a cop.
Somebody was out there in that storm.
If it wasn't Hank, or Malloy, who was it?
You were outside looking for tracks, right?
Right. And I got locked out.
Did you?
Guess my cover's finally blown.
Ignorant assholes.
It's not me, it's one of you.
Get the fuck outta my face!
Get the fuck outta my face!
- Drop the gun!
- Noah, don't!
- Back off!
- Drop the gun, asshole!
- Mine shoots bullets, too, motherfucker!
- Stop it!
I feel safer already.
Christ, it's Slater.
(Slater) I'm very close.
So close, you don't know it.
I stare into your eyes,
and you see nothing.
I see you. But you don't see me.
(Jaworski) So what did the fed say about all this?
(Jenny) He talked like it was someone he knew. Someone he tracked.
- The cop killer?
- (Jones) He's dead, isn't he?
He'd better be.
Hey, any cop killer steps my way,
I'll cap his ass.
Well, let's hope you do.
- What do you mean, hope?
- You've studied guys like this, Doc.
They don't just kill you.
They play with you.
Hey, man, I don't wanna hear this, OK?
They gouge out your eyes, shove things down your throat.
Are you deaf?
Maybe the Lord's got other plans.
Maybe we'll freeze to death first.
You wanna show us where that woodpile is?
What, are you nuts?!
I ain't goin' back down there.
Well, I ain't goin' down there by myself.
Lead on.
- (Hank) Wood store's down this way.
- (Slater) Sh!
- (Slater) You hear that?
- Hear what?
I think we got company.
(Noah) Not for long.
You two... clear that one.
I got this one.
Come on.
(Malloy) Move!
I found that hidden above Slater's room.
It's him.
He's taking trophies.
If we're gonna get outta here, here's what we do.
You and Lopez check upstairs.
I'll take the tunnels.
- Jenny, you stay here with Jaworski.
- Why?!
Please, just trust me.
Hank!
Slater!
Hank!
Slater!
- (gun clicks)
- Hey, cop.
Drop the weapon.
Hands behind your head.
Fingers locked.
That's it.
Now, on your knees.
You know, I like playing cop.
How do you like playing the victim? Huh?
D'you like how it feels?
- Come on.
- Please.
Please.
Wasn't it you who was gonna cap my ass, tough guy?
(mocking wail)
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
That a boy! See?
Look here.
You see somebody comin' up them stairs, you let faith guide that bullet right through their head.
Right?
(Slater over walkie-talkie) Malloy.
Malloy!
Malloy.
Malloy!
I see you, Malloy.
But you still don't see me.
Fuck you!
We've got to do something!
Why?
Malloy's already dead.
- Who was he?
- (Slater) Who?
Your stand-in.
Oh, you mean the real Mr Slater
I tracked up here.
Last I saw, he was detoxing
at the bottom of a frozen lake.
I didn't think you'd mind
me borrowing his name and his badge.
From there, it was easy.
I just came here and blended in.
You're real good at blending in, aren't ya, scumbag?
Is that how you found out about this place? Just blending in at the cop bar?
That doesn't matter now.
What matters is I got to you
before you got to me.
People will ask if I was insane.
Just the opposite. An insane man
could not have accomplished this.
All these deaths, including Mary's,
weren't irrational.
They were to prove a point.
You cannot control
what nature intended, Malloy.
We're born to perform a duty,
which I've done.
And so you finally see me.
Now what?
You know, you never feel more alive than
when you're watching someone else die.
Like when I stared at poor Mary.
But once again, Malloy, you're too late.
Now I imagine you are staring at poor Noah.
(Jenny) Malloy!
Malloy!
- Malloy!
- (Slater) Déjà vu, huh, Malloy?
How many second chances do you get in life?
You think you're strong enough
to stop me?
Run, Jenny! Run!
You're too young to die.
(Slater) Run, Jenny! Run!
Run!
I'll cut her fucking heart out.
Jenny... I like your eyes.
Let me see your eyes.
Did I mention I hear voices?
Right now I hear Malloy... pleading for his precious Mary.
You stay here!
I'm gonna follow these tracks.
Make me work for it.
Do you see me?
Cos I see you.
Stay... here.
Freeze! Drop the weapon!
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.
Lock your fingers. It's your turn now.
It's time to die.
Now, look at me.
Slater!
She... called out your... name... just before I... drained the life... from her.
I see you.
You see... this.
You OK?
How was the fishin'?
Icy.
(# "Love Is" by Kit Hain)
You're not scared, are you?
Scared?
Why should I be scared?
We're next to a cemetery.
So?
If anything were to happen, no-one would hear a thing.
What could possibly happen?
Remember the guy they caught, the one who was killing kids?
Yeah. And what?
Wanna know the worst?
What's that?
Chocolate milk?
He ate them.
Carried parts around in a cooler.
Making that up!
Am not!
My sister knows a newspaper guy.
He told her.
When they caught him, know what was in the cooler?
Their fingers?
Oh, gross!
It's a sheep's eye.
From the butcher shop.
When you die, the last thing you see is on your retina like a photograph.
Grandma says souls live in the eyes.
The "soul" is an invention of witch doctors.
There's someone out there!
There's no-one here.
There was. I heard him!
Howie?
Howie, is that you?
Howie, no more games, you hear me?
Howie?
You forgot to close it.
No. You were the last one.
Jesus!
Why you guys sneaking around?
We weren't sneaking!
You were.
Like a pair of rats.
No!
Let me go.
In the house!
Halt!
Emily!
Wake up Emily.
Come back.
Let me go!
- Stay in there.
- Let me go!
What did you do to that "thing"?
You have no right!
Thirteen years later.
West.
What you got there?
That some kind of animal?
Why, Moncho?
Are you hungry?
Is that a rat?
Your powers of observation are dubious at best.
Dubious?
Dubious.
You wanted me?
Yes.
Here.
New work assignment?
Dubious.
Oh, and it's "Sergeant" Moncho.
Ratty?
What did you do to Ratty?
Mother of God,
I ain't seen him, I swear.
I'm sick. Leave me alone.
Where is Ratty?
What's wrong, Cabrera?
Lose you stinky little pal?
Ask West if he's seen him.
West likes animals.
What do you mean?
Think about it,
"dubious".
Line up!
Let's move!
West, you seen my Ratty?
Is he missing?
You better tell me, Einstein!
Any identifiable characteristics?
Markings...
Who took him is gonna get markings.
You the new doctor?
That's right.
That way to the Clinic?
Warden wants to see you.
In films, this is the Death House.
You wouldn't call it that.
What do you call it?
The Death House.
- Prisoners here are?
- Condemned to death.
Don't talk until he talks to you first.
...are sex criminals.
As a woman, that should repulse you.
It's very disturbing, as a person.
But as a reporter it's an interesting statistic.
Good answer, Laura.
- Can I call you Laura?
- Certainly.
So, you don't believe in rehabilitation.
Don't be naive, Laura.
I believe in what works.
Two thousand volts of raw power from a stand alone generator.
This works.
When a man sits in it and I make every new prisoner sit in it they submit to my power.
Fascinating.
You're just saying that.
- Doctor Phillips?
- Yes, sir. Howard Phillips.
It's a pleasure, Warden Brando.
You graduated in the top five per cent of your class.
You could have your pick ofjobs.
Why here?
Institutional medicine interests me...
Really?
Well. Yeah.
Hi. I'm Laura Olney.
I'm with Arkham Record.
Anything you say to me will be quoted out of context.
Well in that case, let me just say hi.
Hi.
We have a fully equipped medical facility.
I'm sure you do, but these are mine.
Do all doctors have such a relationship with their tools?
You requested to have a particular inmate working in the infirmary.
We're understaffed and he has a medical background.
Keep an eye on him.
Sir?
He thinks he's smarter than everyone else, but he's not.
His attitude could infect others.
"Infect"?
An idea can be like a disease.
If you discover a minor anomaly, do you ignore it?
Fuck!
No, Doctor. No. You cut it.
Some growths are benign.
Not inside these walls.
Sir!
There's a situation!
Out of the way!
It's the doctor!
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
Hear my confession.
Just calm down.
The blood, the flesh, the beating heart.
I had to eat it.
I had to eat it.
Don't send me to Hell.
Get the drop cloth.
Keep his back perfectly straight.
Sorry!
Keep your hands off me!
On three, okay?
One, two, three, lift!
This way, doctor.
Out of the way!
Get the case.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.
I'm fine.
Where do we go?
What happened?
Heart attack.
Are you the new doctor?
Cute!
Get him on the table!
Nurse, set up the IV.
Hurry up!
Yes doctor.
Get me amiodarone.
- What?
- Amiodarone
We have none.
You have none?
It didn't come.
What have you got?
Try Sotalol.
It is similar.
Go get it!
Come on Nurse!
Coming!
I can't!
Could you help her, please?
Nurse, take these guys out of the way.
Everybody out!
And stay out there!
But...
Stay with them!
Clear!
You're wasting time.
Clear!
Come on!
Clear!
He was dead before he got here.
Goddammit!
He was my patient.
For five minutes.
You're the new doctor?
What is the meaning of this?
Doctor Herbert West.
I know all about you.
Really?
I know what you did.
They tried to cover it up.
Your experiments...
Don't believe what you hear.
I didn't hear it.
I saw.
That night they arrested you.
I was that kid.
I want to work with you.
Thirteen years...
There's bound to be some deterioration.
The reactive base may have destabilized but maybe not.
What are you doing?
Seeing if it still works.
No!
Someone could come in.
We're treating a patient.
The top of the spinal cord!
Of course
. Hold his head.
Hold it.
Quickly.
How long will it take?
I don't think it's going to take.
We can increase the dosage.
No, no. It's not going to work.
It might on something else.
Thanks for bringing me back my Reagent such as it is.
Oh well...
Wait a minute.
Listen.
Think about it. Come on.
We can make more.
In here?
This place doesn't have basic first aid, as you just found out.
But this is my clinic now.
What do you need?
It still works!
You're not dying.
How do you feel?
You hear me?
Stay away!
Can you hear me?
No!
We must sedate him!
Get the Thorazine!
50 cc.
No! No!
Forgive me, please.
Forgive me!
Dr. Phillips.
What the fuck's going?
He went crazy, sir.
Severe cardiac arrhythmia.
A reaction to medication.
What medication?
We administered 10 cc of Sotalol but it provoked an unexpected effect.
You call this
"an unexpected effect"?
The patient suffered arterial fibrillation.
His heart was beating too fast.
Allergic reaction is not unusual.
West, you've just added twelve months to your sentence.
It's swollen.
Doctor Phillips, one of my men is hurt.
I'll see to him.
Sergeant, that is an immediate Lock-Down!
Yes, Sir!
The rest of your visit will be outside of the security areas.
Warden...
West, the lockdown includes you.
Doctor Phillips asked me for a list of the supplies we need.
Right. I need that list.
Clean him up and get him to the Hole!
Come on.
Get up.
West, get to your cell!
My last partner turned
State's evidence on me.
I expect better of you.
And watch out for her.
She's trouble.
Hi there.
Hi. Just organizing my notes.
You were right about my ankle.
I should stay off it.
Hard to push in the clutch.
How about I drive you home?
Are you sure?
I'm putting you to trouble.
On a day like this, it's no trouble.
Had yourself a big day, Moses.
Beat the hell out of 4 grown men while having a heart attack.
How did you do that?
They gave you some medication.
What was it?
- I know why I'm here.
- Yes?
I'm dead, and this is Hell.
I'll show you what Hell is.
West!
You and me have got to talk, man!
West!
West!
Sorry about the tofu...
I should know.
This pizza's great.
I've had a great time.
Great
The way you handled that interview impressed me.
I did such a great job
I was thrown out.
State Penitentiary Progressive
Educational is so stupid.
Come on, don't give up.
Anything's possible.
See the possibilities and seize the moment.
Go for it.
- "Go for it"?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll "go for it".
What are you really doing here?
"Institutional medicine".
Tell me about your secret "I.M." research.
Of course.
I am investigating the effects of institutionalization on life and death.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Why do your residency in the "joint"?
Really. Why, Howard?
As a kid, I saw my sister die.
I'm so sorry.
I never want to feel helpless again.
I tried to resuscitate her.
I wanted to bring her back.
Who was helping you today?
Doctor Herbert West.
He's a prisoner but, he worked at a university hospital.
He researched death as a disease.
One of his reanimation experiments lost control.
The man went crazy... violent.
Like the man today?
And escaped from the Morgue.
The morgue?
He broke into our house.
That expression reminds me of Emily.
Your sister?
You're going?
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.
Looks like your ankle is better.
Yeah.
Seize the moment?
Go for it.
You got everything.
Moses isn't doing so good.
We need lab. Space, somewhere private.
He doesn't seem human.
I think this will do.
He's a monster.
He was the freshest specimen we could find.
It's a problem.
It is a problem!
I want to help people, not create mindless freaks!
Having second thoughts?
All medical research requires risks.
If you don't see, you shouldn't be here.
Soon I'll find a force to bring order to that chaotic organism.
Away to restore rational behaviour?
I can now accelerate the testing phase of my current work.
With your help.
This work requires commitment and full confidentiality.
You must tell no one.
- I'll walk?
- Lipstick on your collar.
Doctor Phillips, I'm going to be leaving now.
What's that for?
Doctor Phillips.
Do you need anything?
Are you there?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I was working late.
On what?
Nothing. Just clinic stuff.
What are you doing, investigating me?
- No.
- Yeah.
I was wondering how the man was doing.
He's fine.
Really?
Doesn't seem human anymore.
We shouldn't have...
You shouldn't have, what?
What's the matter?
The story I'm on.
I figured out some stuff, but it's just speculation.
- You need hard facts.
- Yeah.
But to get them I'll have to take some risks.
What do I do?
Play it safe, or "go for it"?
You've got to "go for it".
Really?
You got to take some chances.
That's what you're doing, isn't it?
What's your new story about?
Can't tell you yet.
Secrets?
Every girl needs a few secrets.
It hurts so much.
I can't even spit, Doc.
I don't see anything.
Once they gave me little red pills,
Vicodin, made me feel better.
Little red pills. Little red tits.
- Take two at bedtime.
- How about now?
Can I have more?
- Today's the day, cabr髇.
- Today's the day.
I'll see you in the yard.
- You're a dead man.
- A dead man.
Today's the day.
It worked.
Reschedule the afternoon.
But doctor...
Now. To test it.
On who?
My story isn't working, it's too impersonal.
Something's missing.
And it's you. You're the key.
The key?
To what?
To understanding how this prison works.
Everything is an extension of your philosophy.
I'd like another look around.
Afterwards I'll need you for an in-depth interview.
I'd be happy to do the interview
- if...
- If?
If we do it over dinner tonight.
You get to know the man behind the office.
After my tour?
Consider Miss Olney my personal guest.
Yes, sir.
And give her the tour, again.
Why did you come back?
To finish a profile on you.
Really?
You are a fascinating man.
You're just saying that.
Tonight then.
Did you know the human body loses
3 to 4 grms. Of weight at the moment of death?
I heard about that.
A rodent loses much less, but the ratio is the same.
The cerebral cortex is the site of an extraordinary neuro-electric phenomenon.
Hold him.
Hold him
Tightly.
Ratty is not going to be very happy.
This phenomenon,
NPE, Nano-Plasmic Energy, is not just in the brain.
It moves throughout the nervous system, and is present in every cell of the body.
Hold him a little.
Classic post-reanimation.
Confused, violent.
Like all my other subjects to date.
This brought him back from the dead.
But this will give him true life.
What is that?
The Nanoplasm, from a living donor rat.
Donor rat?
Now hold him.
Completely still.
This is the catalyst.
This is the force that tells the cells how to grow.
It works!
Laura.
Doctor Phillips, how are you?
Why are you here?
Just, "going for it".
- That the way to the "hole"?
- Certainly is.
I would really like to talk to him.
Not a chance.
My Editor gives expenses for stories.
How much are we talking here?
The cell door has to be locked.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
What if I need you?
Do I call?
Not a sound.
No one can know you're in there.
He can't hurt you in that straight jacket.
Look who's coming.
She's going to see Moses.
Why else would she do there?
All right, give him to me.
Any last words pendejo?
Ratty?
What happened?
I gave him his pet back.
Are you gonna let him go?
Give Daddy a kiss.
What's wrong, Ratty?
Hi. I'm Laura Olney,
I'm a journalist.
I want to talk about what happened the other day.
Do you remember what
Dr. West did to you?
Did you die from that heart attack?
Can I check your pulse?
Mother of God, forgive me.
What happened to you?
- Hungry!
- Sergeant Moncho!
Thank God you're here.
You must think I'm an idiot.
No I don't. Really.
You're a very intelligent man.
Fascinating.
- I don't like people lying to me.
- I wasn't lying.
Explain!
Give me that!
He attacked me.
He's dead.
You're right.
What are you doing?
I murdered him.
That's what they'll say.
You know the cretins out there.
It was self-defence.
You had no choice.
I'll swear to it.
Get down. You're going to have to convince me.
Lower. Bark.
- What?
- You heard me! Bark!
Am I the most fascinating man you've met?
Yes.
And you'd do anything for me?
Yes, sir.
Show me.
You bribed a guard, came in and freed a dangerous prisoner. He got excited...
- I wanna get Moses up here.
- Why?
To put this in him.
You've got more?
No. This is Ratty's NPE.
I gave Ratty the nanoplasm of a different rodent.
- Aren't they different?
- Not at all.
Nanoplasm is a completely neutral energy.
It's the same in rats, dogs, human beings.
- You want to put this in Moses?
- Yes.
Going from rat to rat is okay, but from species to species is not right.
Not right?
All this is the result of years and years of painstaking research under incomprehensible conditions.
How dare you say my work is wrong?
- You can't transfer the soul...
- The soul?
This is science, not superstition.
- This is a human being...
- Was human.
And will be again, with this.
Dr. Phillips?
1, 2, 3, up.
Dr. Phillips.
There's been an incident.
No!
No!
Moses killed her in the Hole.
He's dead, too.
Dead?
The Warden needs
Death Certificates.
Now!
Get rid of the nurse.
Nurse, help the officers.
- But...
- Get out!
- What if she ends up like Moses?
- She's not getting fresher.
Come on.
- Top of the spinal cord, right?
- Right.
Thorazine?
Don't want her getting too excited.
Hurry up.
What's her name?
- Remember?
- Leave her!
This is not a good idea.
What is she doing?
We can't leave her like this!
Let's get her to the lab.
Stop here.
Where did he go?
He's got to be here, somewhere!
Look everywhere.
Everywhere!
Poor little thing.
Come on, go get your food.
Let go, you freak.
What's going on?
Give it back!
- You little...
- No!
And why not?
It's cross species.
Then she'll stay like this!
You can't experimenting on her.
Now look, Rat NPE...
Dr. Phillips!
Get her down.
Where is the body?
She...
What is going on in here?
Mr West and I... we...
You've set up a Lab.
You're doing illegal research.
You'll lose your job for this, and your medical license.
Move.
This is what you gave Moses.
You are never going to see the outside of these walls again.
No. No.
You're dead.
No!
Hold it there!
Come back here.
Back in your cell!
It's party time!
What are you doing?
Wait. Just a second.
Two thousand volts of electric current will concentrate the nanoplasm to the brain, so we can pull it off.
You'll electrocute him.
That's the idea.
Only through, electrocution can you drive the nanoplasm to the hypothalamus where we can extract it at the moment of death.
You wanna put his nanoplasm into Laura?
Rodent to rodent, no problem.
But human to human?
Do you want Laura to stay like that?
Sit him up.
Head down on his chest.
Move!
Hold his head still!
Hold his head still!
He's not dying!
He's not dying!
Clear!
That's enough!
Stop it!
He has to die.
Go to the infirmary.
Let's go!
Ratty!
Ratty!
Give daddy a kiss!
Howard? Where am I?
You're okay now.
Something happened to me.
You could say that.
Why are you looking at me?
Warden Brando strangled you.
You were dead.
Doctor Phillips and
I brought you back.
What're you talking about?
Brought me back?
- I feel so...
- What?
How do you feel?
That's interesting.
What's happening?
I see what's going on here.
You are using me as a guinea pig.
You let him do it!
No!
Stay away.
Both of you.
Stop!
Howard. Howard, please.
Please help me.
Howard.
West!
Where are you Einstein?
Hiding is not gonna do you...
Listen, Ratty's acting really weird.
You fucked him up, or gave me the wrong rat!
- Get your hands off!
- Guards!
There ain't no fucking guards.
This place is a riot.
- Look here.
- Leave her alone!
What'd you say?
Stay away. She's sick.
Contagious.
Sick?
I got medicine, make her feel better.
West took my ratty.
I'll take his little pussycat.
What's happening Howard?
You like it rough, huh?
Laura!
Laura!
Over here.
Come on!
- Where is she?
- Who?
Laura. The journalist.
They were chasing her.
- There was no woman.
- She's there.
Seal it off!
Laura! Laura!
This way's dead!
Shit!
Don't you play hide and seek with me.
Daddy has a big present for you.
Cesar, find her.
Surprise!
Welcome back Warden.
Before I leave, one last experiment, and you're pertect.
Those three years in
Solitary were very instructive.
I did my best work in there... and this is the result.
Rodent to human.
Neutral energy, or behavioral imprinting?
Let's find out.
West, you cretin.
You'll fry for this.
Do you hear that?
There's a riot going on.
The animals are running the zoo.
They'll make their way down here quite soon.
I'd like to see the results, but I can't.
There's a new early release programme and I qualify.
I'll be sure and leave the door wide open so they find you.
Take these will you?
And these.
Come on, come on.
Shit!
- It's the Warden.
- He's not Warden anymore.
You don't dare...
I am always the Warden.
I need a doctor.
Sergeant, you let that man go.
Sergeant Moncho!
Straighten up!
On your feet, Sergeant!
Stand up! That's an order!
How can I get you to follow orders?
The good stuff!
Laura!
Laura!
Are these men giving you a problem?
I didn't do that.
Well maybe I did.
Or maybe they killed themselves.
They couldn't stand living with their crimes.
They couldn't stand looking in the mirror one more day.
Me, I like what
I see in the mirror.
The Death House was built for one purpose.
Punishment.
The problem with execution is it happens too fast.
One moment of pain, and you're dead.
You're off the hook.
Today's criminals aren't scared any more.
He looks scared to me.
Just acting.
They're all actors here.
Execution is the kindest thing we could do for them.
But what if the agony of Death didn't end in an instant but instead, was prolonged indefinitely?
Move out!
Quick! Quick!
No!
Mother of God. Forgive me.
Mother of God.
Forgive me for I have sinned.
It's all right.
I forgive you. It's all right.
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Lose something?
She changed.
You were wrong.
She changed!
It was a theory.
Oh God, I hate you!
You and your sick experiments!
What was I thinking?
Laura was right.
You killed my sister.
An unfortunate incident.
Emily's no incident!
Nothing we can do about your sister.
But we can still save your girlfriend.
Laura!
Her name is Laura!
- Try the Death House?
- What?
Did you look in the Death House?
If the Warden found her, he took her there.
The Warden? But, he's dead.
God damn you!
Religion has got nothing to do with this.
In position!
Come out with your hands up.
Help me!
Hand over your head!
Hands over your head!
I see the light!
I'm saved!
Thank you God!
I'm saved!
Hold your fire!
Thank you God.
I'm hungry!
Great.
It's great what you did back there.
I like you.
I like you very much.
On your knees.
Would you prefer punishment?
That's a good girl.
Give daddy a kiss.
Sergeant!
Go stand guard!
What was that?
You bitch!
That's Laura.
Come on!
Your ass is mine!
Laura!
It's, it's in me... it's taking over.
You have to get it out!
I can't.
Please.
Please.
Don't let it go on, you have to kill it.
Kill me?
Fascinating.
I was a piece of ass for you.
No, never.
This is mine.
Fucker!
You've been holding out on me!
You can't keep this.
This is awesome.
This green shit rocks, man.
Give it to me.
Sorry. I can't.
Prison rules.
You can't share needles.
It's not safe.
Now, fuck off.
I need some privacy here.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Fortunately, right now cabr髇, you are not, me.
Hey man!
Got any more?
Just another hit.
You had enough.
How about some Vicodin?
The little red pills. Vicodin.
Stop!
Howard.
Laura?
Howard, please!
Warden Brando, is that you?
Where is it?
- What?
- You know what.
Where's my work?
That's quite enough of you.
Ratty.
This experiment is over.
Please Howard.
Please stop me.
You will be punished for this.
You're being punished.
Kill me, Howard.
Go for it, Howie.
I'm the Warden!
Guilty as charged.
Halt! In position now!
Move, move, move!
Howard?
I had to kill her... to get it out.
To save her.
But I want her back.
It'll be all right, Emily.
I'll take care of you.
Hold it right there!
You okay?
She's alright.
I gave her life.
Halt!
This man is critical.
I need to get him to hospital!
- Who are you?
- Doctor Phillips.
I run the infirmary.
Who are you?
Who's responsible if hedies?
Okay, go! Go!
Dubious... dubious.
Hey! Take him.
I saved her.
Tell him.
Tell him I saved you!
Emily?
Laura?
Emily?
Laura?

"Creature Feature Show."
Ah-hhh.
The doctor is in.
Don't scream. Don't move.
Stay tuned for Channel 68's
Halloween Eve movie marathon.
I'm your host, your ghost host with the most,
Dr. Wolfenstein.
I will be with you until the end.
Howdy folks.
Black Blood.
Violence.
Freaks of Nature.
Come on down to Captain Spaulding's
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.
See the Alligator Boy.
Ride my famous Murder Ride.
Most of all, don't forget to take home some of my tasty fried chicken.
It just tastes so damn good.
...with a meat cleaver.
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.
Coming after you to rip your flesh apart.
Unbelievable but true.
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.
Shit, I can't do nothin' with this.
I can't get rid of this.
It ain't worth nothin', my name's all over it.
I was fixing it to trade it to Jackie Cobb.
That retard that hangs out at Molly's Fruit Stand?
- Yeah.
- For the life of me
I cannot understand why you hang out with that asshole.
He's one horny retard.
Well, ain't they all?
All they wanna do is eat and fuck.
If you knew him, you might understand his urges.
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.
You know what his favorite thing is next to whacking his weasel?
He takes a sharpened pencil and sticks it in his eyeball and twists it.
- What?
- He doesn't hurt himself though, he kind of twists it right next to his eyeball.
He'd been putting that pencil someplace other than his eyeball.
He don't do nothin' like that.
Although, once he got caught with a "Planet of the Apes" doll stuck up his asshole.
Goddamn.
They had to take him to the hospital.
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck halfway up his butt.
Couldn't get it out.
- Did you fix the toilet?
- Yes, I did, and I don't want you stuffing any goddamn paper towels down there.
I had to snake the shit out that thing.
Here you go.
You bust that crapper and I'm gonna bust your ass.
I hear ya.
Mary, fucking Moses, ya'll get the fuck outta here.
Hold it, clowney.
Keep your paws where I can see them.
Don't move.
I'll blast a hole the size of a Kansas City watermelon through your ugly ass, Bozo face.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Go grab that other asshole out of the shitter
- and drag his ass back in here.
- Right.
You miserable motherfu...
I ought to jump over this counter and bash your fucking balls in.
All right, Tippy, hand over the cash box and I might leave your brains inside your skull.
I'll tell you what, Ski King, why don't you just take your mama home some chicken and then I won't have to stuff my boot all up in ya ass!
I don't like chicken!
And I hate clowns!
Put that shit down.
Put it down!
That is it!
I'm gonna count to 10 and you're gonna hand over all the cash, or I'm gonna splatter your grease-paint mug across the state line.
- One...
- Fuck yo mama.
- Two...
- Fuck yo sister.
What are we gonna do?
I know you, you work at the hardware store, right?
- Richard Wick, right?
- Shut your trap.
Quiet down, both of you!
- Three...
- Fuck yo grandma.
I remember now.
All the guys made fun of you.
- Called you Little Dick Wick.
- Shut up!
Stop singing,
I hate that song.
Put your fucking mask back on.
Fuck it!
Most of all, fuck you!
Goddamn motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit.
How many want to touch this afternoon?
Raise your hand if you want
God to touch you.
I'm gonna pray that God will give you a divine touch...
...the US Department of Agriculture is checking whether state meat and poultry inspectors are good enough to allow the product to go on sale nationally.
The USDA has said...
Man, some of these
Manson chicks are really hot.
Shit, how are we almost out of gas?
And this squeaky, right here, now that's a girl you would date.
- Jerry, how much did you put in?
- I don't know? Two, three bucks.
Two, three bucks?
I told you to fill...
- Bill, feel me, am I made of money?
- Get off. Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Don't panic yourself there way too much, caffeine guy.
I wouldn't be drinking so much coffee if you did your share of the driving.
- You know I don't have nightvision.
- Oh, not this again.
Seriously, I can't even make out the lines in the road.
If you wanna pull the car over,
I'll be more than happy to kill us out in the middle of nowhere.
Besides, there's a billboard right there.
Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen.
- Awesome, great!
- Fried chicken and gasoline.
Next exit, there you go, problem solved and we didn't have to freak out.
It was a real big deal.
Dick.
All right.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth checking out.
Okay, Mr. Cranky.
Holy... crap!
You gotta see this place.
It's boss.
- How boss?
- Really fucking boss.
Like, wake up the chicks and break out the camera boss?
Hell, yeah.
Wakey, wakey!
Eggs and bacon.
Hey, sweetie, come on.
Grab Mary and get your stuff and come on inside.
Bill and I found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!
Let's go.
Come on, Sleeping Beauty, it's time to go to work.
What's in that case over there?
Hairless monkey.
Did you see the crocodile boy?
How'd you like to find that in your pants?
- Excuse me, sir? Howdy.
- Hi.
I love this place. How long have you been running this place?
Well, uhm...
How long's a piece of string?
I don't know.
Too goddamn long, that's how long.
Too goddamn long, that's right.
Right, I hear that, but how long, actually?
Oh, shit, I don't know exactly.
I took over for my pa, right after the Duke damned Oscar.
- Oh, you mean John Wayne.
- Hell, son.
How many dukes do you know about?
- Greatest American ever lived.
- Look at that.
"Circle up the wagons, pilgrims."
"Whatever you say, cowboy."
I'm not that much of a Western fan.
I like science-fiction.
Ah-hhh. Space boy.
- I figured as much.
Let me ask you something.
How come you're asking so many jackassy questions?
My friends and I, we're driving across country writing this book on off-beat roadside attractions, the crazy shit you see when you're driving across the country.
I don't drive cross country.
But if you did.
But I don't.
Yeah, but supposing for a second that you did.
You little dickens, you.
I know what your problem is.
What's that?
Ya'll think us folks from the country's funny-like, don't you?
- Jerry...
- Well, saddle up the mule, ma.
Slide me some grits,
I's got to get me some education.
- Jerry...
- You asshole.
No, I'm really very interested,
I'm not trying to make fun.
Gotcha!
You are such a bad clown.
Oh, fuck me, Side Sally, who the hell'd wanna read about all this horseshit anyway?
You'd be surprised.
Son, look around.
Would I be surprised?
Finally. Great, great. Come on, we paid for the tickets.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- What tickets?
This isn't everything.
There is actually a murder ride.
A murder ride?
I don't want to go on a murder ride.
- Yes, you do wanna go on a...
- No, I don't.
Hey, how about if we skip the murder ride?
Hey, how about if we go?
Anytime this year, people.
Tour is about to begin.
Okay, we'll see you inside the murder ride, we'll be back. Bye.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, you are about to enter the world of darkness, a world where life and death are meaningless, and pain is God.
- Pain!
- Billy, let's go.
- Quit that, sport.
- Sorry, Captain Spaulding.
We gonna have a good time now.
On your right, you will see the infamous
Albert... Fish.
Masochist, sadist, child killer and most importantly, cannibal.
Mr. Fish, born 1870 and enjoyed spankings with nail-studded paddles, stuffing needles deep into his groin.
- I have a question. How many...
- Hold all questions.
No, no, help.
Lizzie fucking Borden.
Now, one of our most famous crazies, the psycho of Plainsfield,
Mr. Ed Gein.
Murderer, cannibal,
Mr. Gein used to take great pleasure of playing with dead bodies of women, especially, their sexual organs.
Now, one of our local heroes,
S. Quentin Quale, aka Dr. Satan.
Oh shit!
Murderer, torturer, but most of all, master surgeon.
Mr. Quail was an intern at Willows County Mental Hospital, nicknamed Weeping Willows for the neverending cries of pain.
Through primitive brain surgery...
- Jerry, stop it.
- Mr. Quail believed that he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill.
Vigilante justice prevailed.
They took his ass out and hung him.
And that infamous hanging tree is no more than a stone's throw away from where y'alls' ass is now seated.
But the next day his body was found to be missing.
Until today no trace of Dr. Satan has ever been discovered.
But then, who knows?
Maybe he lives next door to you.
Tour's over.
Exit through the doors.
That was so bad-ass.
Dr. Satan. Ah-hhh,
Dr. Satan.
Maybe he lives next door to you.
Calm down, it was all right.
Do you think maybe we could go now?
I'm gonna go call my dad.
I'll be right back.
I love you.
What do you mean, it was all right?
It was cool, but it wasn't that great.
Dude, you don't have to play it down in front of your chick.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Don't move a muscle, an artery,
Or a vein.
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, Denise.
- We stopped for gas at this place called Captain Spaulding's, somewhere outside of Ruggsville.
It turned into this whole big thing, so we're behind schedule.
Don't be too late.
I forgot to tell you that Halloween falls on a school night so they're trick-or-treating tonight.
Your left hand shows your past; your right hand shows your future.
Good evening.
I'm Lance Brockwell and this is the 7:00 news.
And our top story tonight, investigators still have no leads to the strange disappearance of the five cheerleaders from Ruggsville High School.
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,
Allison Cole, Valarie Green, and Dawn Baker were last seen four days ago leaving a football game.
I know it seems stupid, but I really wanna see this tree.
Do yourself a favor, son, just forget about it.
Oh, come on,
I live for this shit.
Okay, all right,
I'll draw you a damn map.
- Thank you.
- I still say it's a waste of time.
You are here.
Go straight up this road.
Make the first right.
First left.
Come straight across and down.
Can't find it? Tough.
- Here's your map.
- Right on.
- Here's your complimentary chicken.
- Oh, wow.
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
You're gonna get a great write-up for this.
Here's an idea, let's just skip it.
It's probably nothing anyway.
Christ, Jerry, Bill is right, we can't see anything.
What's that?
Hitchhiker.
- What? Should we stop?
- We can't leave her in the rain.
Stick her in the front if you wanna pick her up so bad.
So, uh,
- where ya headed?
- I was just going home.
- Home, where's that?
- A couple miles up the road.
- So, you live around here?
- Yeah.
Do you know where this Dr. Satan tree's at?
Yeah. You know where that's at?
It's right by my house.
- I can show you.
- Really?
- So, it is a real thing.
- Fuck you.
So, a tree?
Where's it at?
- What tree?
- Okay, this is crazy.
She obviously doesn't know anything.
Oh, I know,
I'll show you where it's at.
Whatever you need to do, you do it.
There is no wrong.
If someone needs to be killed, you kill 'em.
That's the way.
Fuck.
I think we blew a tire.
- Oh poop.
- Oh, hell.
At least we got that spare.
You filled it up like I asked, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, what if I forgot to put it back in the trunk?
What would plan B entail?
- Jesus Christ, Jerry.
- Technically I did what you said.
Oh for fucking sake, Jerry, what're we gonna do now?
I can't rightly say if I know, me ladies.
Wait, I love this song.
Would you turn the radio off, please?!
God!
We can walk to my house from here.
What?
My brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.
- I'll go, it's my fault.
- Forget it, I'm going.
- No, Bill, l...
- You guys stay here.
There's no sense in everyone getting drenched.
Returning to the news, local authorities still have no lead in the mysterious disappearance of the five cheerleaders from Ruggsville.
The girls were last seen leaving a cheering competition... lt was loud enough to wake the dead.
- That's an idea.
- What is?
Wouldn't it be dramatic? Supposing the people inside were dead, all stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them.
I'm sure it would be very amusing.
Why you ask?
Why is not the question.
How?
Now, that is a question worth examining.
How could I, being born of such conventional stock, arrive a leader of the rebellion?
An escapist from a conformist world, destined to find happiness only in that which cannot be explained.
I brought you here for a reason.
But unfortunately, you and your sentimental minds are doing me no good.
My brain is frozen, locked.
I have to break free from this culture of mechanical reproductions and the thick incrustations dying on the surface.
Oh, Christ.
Fuck it.
These are all my dolls.
I used to chop their heads off and their arms and stick them up on the wall.
The door's locked,
I gotta go around.
Just wait here.
Jesus Christ!
Don't do that.
You scared the shit out of me.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Is your brother ready to go?
- Yeah, he already left.
- Come on, inside.
- What? He left?
Come on and get toasty.
Don't worry about it, he's fine.
I just don't understand why...
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
Turn the radio off.
Now listen.
I still don't hear anything.
I swear to God,
I heard some weird...
Turn on the headlights, see if something's out there.
Calm down, calm down.
Jesus H. Christ.
It's the fucking tow truck guy.
So, you live alone here?
I mean, just you and your brother?
Nah, there's a bunch of us around somewhere.
I think Otis is upstairs messing around or something.
You gotta have the marshmallows.
That's what makes it fun.
Yeah, I guess.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Wow.
Look at him.
He must've been going pretty fast to smash through that wall.
You sure are silly for a guy with glasses.
- I like that.
- Okay, hey.
Need those to see, thank you.
How do I look?
Terrific, really.
Tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
Okay, okay.
I wonder what time...
- it's getting kind of late.
- Don't worry, sugar.
It ain't past my bedtime
Are you flirting with me?
What? Oh, no.
Great! They're back.
Whoppie-fucking-do.
Excuse me?
I gotta call my dad and tell him we're gonna be late.
Can I use your phone, please?
Hello?
Ain't got one.
- Oh, hi.
- Goodness.
You really don't have a phone?
No.
I once had one back in '57, but...
I don't quite remember.
There's nobody round here.
I feel like jaw-flapping at no more.
Do you think the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone?
His name is Rufus,
Rufus Jr.
But we all call him
- RJ.
- Makes sense.
What do they call you, sweetie?
I am Qualsnarg of the Crab Nebula.
But you humans can call me Jerry.
Jerry.
Baby, go on and see how RJ's doin' with these nice folks' automobile.
Why don't you just all make yourselves to home?
What brings you kids way out here?
Haven't you got something better to do on Halloween than wander around out in the sticks?
I thought maybe we'd take in a hoedown.
No, he's just joking.
- You are?
- I'm sorry, I'm messing with you.
Shut up, dude.
Oh, I get it.
Y'all just think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
No, just a little too old.
Oh really? I hope something changes your mind someday.
- Mama, Tiny's home.
- What about RJ?
He was gone before I seen him.
But Tiny saw him and said he said he was going down to the yard to get a new wheel.
How long is that gonna take?
Probably be back in a couple of hours.
A couple of hours? What?
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Even though I know that you think it is childish, tonight is Halloween Eve, and to us it is special.
So you are all invited to dinner.
I hope to Christ she don't expect us to wear these things.
What ever it is, just do it.
The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Now is not the time to make waves.
Jerry.
You'll have to forgive Tiny.
He can't hear so much.
That poor baby.
It's his daddy's fault.
Earl wasn't a bad man, he never hit me or nothing like that.
One day he just up and went devil on us all.
- What happened?
- He tried to burn down the house.
He said it was possessed by the spirits.
And Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started.
But I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us.
Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
- Is that why he wears the mask?
- Yeah.
My baby boy gets shy around new people, but he'll warm up to you, especially the girls.
He's a real lady-killer.
You're gonna miss a good show tonight.
That's your tough luck.
I thought you kids were all about team spirit.
You ain't done fuck-all to cheer me up since you got here.
Give me a B. Give me an A.
Give me a B. Give me a Y.
What's that spell?
What's that spell?!
What's that spell?!
Baby.
You're damn right.
Okay now.
Everybody put on your masks.
Can't very well eat our desserts with our everyday faces exposed.
Can we?
Gosh, kid, put it on.
She ain't gonna let any of us touch dessert unless you're wearing this damn thing.
Mrs. Firefly?
Do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
- Here we go.
- Shut up.
I'm not much for gossip and this and that,
- but I have heard...
- I know all about what you wanna know all about.
Otis.
I can't believe you decided to come down and join us.
And you brought Little Wolf.
Oh, my baby.
Oh my God.
It's such a special night for me.
I don't know who told you your fairy fables about Dr. Satan.
We heard it from a Captain Spaulding up the road at...
That old bitch hog don't know shit.
Tells this cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.
Something happened, right? It had to be based on some real incident.
Are you, Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?
- Grampa, watch your language.
- I don't think you need to know.
Better you leave here with your head still full of kitty cats and puppy dogs.
- I really would like to know...
- Hey, he'd really like to know.
Enlighten him.
I bet you'd stick your head in fire if I told ya you could see hell.
Meanwhile, you're too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing, "Holy Miss Moley,"
"Got me a live one."
Can we change the subject, please?
Dinner's over.
Ladies and germs, it's show time!
Tell you a little story...
Eat your wife's pussy...
I mean jam your face in it!
...starts licking and chomping on her pussy and she's screamin' and yellin' and she just...
Ah-hhh!
The old battleaxe at home's liable to crush my balls!
Would you be quiet?
You're gonna wake up grandma.
Bravo, man.
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now, don't be moving.
We got something real special for you men out there.
- Wow!
- All right.
Jerry.
- Get off him.
I said get the fuck off him, you stupid fucking whore!
- Fucking slut!
- You shouldn't have done that.
Oh, really? Are you gonna do something about it?
- I'll do something, motherfucker.
- Yeah, come on.
I'll fucking cut your tits off and shove them down your throat.
- Baby, stop!
- Come on, Ma,
- this bitch has got it coming.
- No, I told you, remember?
- Car's done.
- Thank God.
I suggest that you kids leave.
We're gone.
Fuck you!
- I love you, Mama.
- I know.
- Lock the fucking doors!
- Hurry up.
Jesus Christ, you think she was really gonna cut you.
Of course she was gonna cut me, she's a fucking nut.
I knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up.
Okay. That's that.
Let's get out of this fucking nuthouse.
What're you doing?
Why are you stopping?
- I gotta open the gate!
- For Christ's sake, hurry up!
Oh, shit!
- Oh shit!
- What are they doing to him?
Who's that?
Oh my God!
- Shut the fucking door!
- Oh, no!
Somebody help us!
Oh my God! Get away from us!
No, please.
Oh my God!
No-ooo!
Oh my God!
Help me! Help me!
Rock and roll this morning with some Led Zeppelin...
...kinda wild around the radio station today, it being a holiday.
It's kinda like a ghost town around here.
It's kinda nice though, it's kinda kick back.
Maybe time to get away with stuff.
Huston.
Donald Willis.
- Don Willis, how the hell are you?
- Listen, Frank,
I'm a little worried about Denise.
She called me last night from the road near Ruggsville, a place called Spaulding's.
Yeah, I know the joint.
She said she'd be here about 11:00, but she never showed up.
I'll run a check on up there by Spaulding's and see if there's any accidents, or road closings.
It was raining like a son of a bitch here last night.
They're probably just stuck in the mud someplace.
Shut your mouth!
I said, shut your fucking mouth!
Listen, you Malibu middleclass
Barbie piece of shit,
I'm trying to work here!
Work! You ever work?
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Scooping ice cream to your shitheel friends on summer break.
I ain't talking about no goddamn white socks with Mickey Mouse on one side and Donald Duck on the other.
I ain't readin' no funny books, Mama.
Our bodies come and go, but this blood is forever.
I'm gonna remove your gag, but if you make so much as a fucking peep
I'm gonna cut you like a pig and make you eat your own fucking intestines. You got me?
Why are you doing this to me?
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?
Messy up your day?
Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill?
- Bill?
Is he okay?
He's a good guy.
He's been a great help to me.
A real blessin'.
I couldn't have asked for a better specimen.
You don't know what kind of dry spell I've had, total block, total block.
But Bill, he's okay.
Where is he?
Hi.
Where is he?
Can I see him?
Can I see Bill, please?
Let's go see.
Behold...
- Fish-boy!
- Oh my God!
Oh my God, Bill.
No, no, this can't be real.
This can't be real.
This can't be real, this can't be real.
Oh, it's real.
Real as I want it to be, Mama.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
- Well...
Let's see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Take a look at all this crap.
I'd red flag anybody running a joint like this.
Sweet baby Jesus.
Whoever's jerking off on that bell better be gone when I come out, or I'm gonna rip your nuts off.
Officers, officers, what can I do for you?
I ain't fired up the birds yet if that's what you've been ring-a-ding-dinging about.
I need you to answer some questions about some missing kids.
Oh, I don't know nothin' about nothin'.
I'm the kind of guy that just minds his own business, if you get what I'm saying.
You seen this girl?
Say in the last 24 hours?
Yeah, yeah, a cute kid.
Ain't my type though.
I like 'em with a little more meat on 'em.
The bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin'.
Look, clown-ass, just answer the damn question.
We ain't interested in your love life, all right?
Cut the crap, Spaulding and get with the facts.
Huh?
What did you see?
Who was she with?
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.
She was with some stupid kids.
They's nosing around, asking a bunch of stupid questions.
- Questions about what?
- I don't know.
This and that. Mostly a bunch of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.
They caught a gander at the display in the back and they figured they's gonna run out and solve the great Deadwood mystery.
And how'd they get that idea?
I wrote 'em a map.
Out to the old farm road.
I figured, what the hell?
It wouldn't do no harm.
'Sides, it's good for my tourist trade.
You can shit 10 bricks for all I care.
What else?
Nothin'.
Stupid-ass kids probably got themselves turned around ass-backwards and got theyself lost.
Is that all? And I want you to think real hard.
Well,
I don't rightly know.
They wasn't here long enough for me to get up close and personal with 'em, like I do most assholes that come wandering in here.
How about you write them same directions out for me then?
All right, all right. Don't get all
"True Grit" on my ass.
You can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Enough talk!
Write.
I don't know where that skunk ape sleeps.
All I know is, that he had impure relations with my wife.
That's true, he performed lurid acts upon me and my person.
Hold up the picture.
I'm gonna kill that skunk ape.
Please, Tiny.
Please let me go.
Let me go.
Help me.
Please, God, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm just gonna go now.
I'm just gonna go home.
I'm just gonna go home now.
I'm just gonna go home now.
I'm just gonna go now.
I'm just going home now.
Where the fuck do you think you're getting to?
No, no, no...
Playtime is over.
It matches.
Call it in.
- I think we found 'em.
- Yeah.
Hey, poopie pants.
What's new?
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's
Denise? You can't keep us here.
Shut up!
Wanna play a guessing game?
Guess what number I'm thinking of.
Eat shit and die.
No, wait, please. Come on, stop it.
What do you want from me?
- What do you want from...
- Be quiet. I don't wanna slip.
Okay, one more.
You get this right,
I'll let you go.
If you get it wrong, you are fucked!
Who's my favorite movie star?
I don't know.
Marilyn Monroe.
No, Betty Davis.
Sorry, you lose!
Ah-hhh!
Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit out this thing, didn't they?
Yeah.
No mercy shown here.
Didn't find any bodies, did ya?
- Not yet.
- Holy Christ.
What could these kids have done to bring this much hell down on 'em?
- I found something.
- What's that?
Keys.
Don't stand there like some prize dog, Dick, open the trunk.
- Yes, sir.
- Toss them here.
- Oh, Goddamn.
- You got something, Georgie?
Yeah.
We found something.
People come, people go, but how many ever stop to take a look at the underbelly of the beast?
I make 'em stop and I make 'em look.
Hope you like what you see.
Hope you like what you see!
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.
At a time like this, you're taking pictures?
I just couldn't help it.
You look so natural sitting in that box.
Put me behind the wheel of that bitch, I'll show you drivin'.
You useless fuck. You couldn't even get your big ass in that seat.
You ungrateful...
Don't start with me, Hugo.
Get off the damn car, this ain't your living room.
Goddamn grease monkey.
You sure this guy is supposed to ride with us... in this car?
Mm-hmm.
This doesn't seem right to me.
It ain't up to us, Chief said pick him up and take him with us.
Guy's an ex-cop, figures he can be of some help.
I just hope he doesn't get in my way, is all I'm sayin'.
This must be him.
- Mr. Willis?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Wydell, this is Nash.
- How you doin', sir?
Donald Willis.
Any leads?
We were on our way out to check on a couple of farms out on the edge of town.
That's about our only lead up to this point.
What about this body you found?
You know about that?
Local girl.
Karen Murphy.
One of the cheerleaders that went missing last week.
That's it?
We know the kids were on their way out to a place the locals call Deadwood.
They wanted to play Nancy Drew with this local legend people call Dr. Satan.
- This is insane.
- Don't you worry about it.
We'll find her, all right?
My name is Lewis Dover and I'm no rich man, but I know the truth.
You don't have to go to hell.
You're in hell... this is hell.
This is hell.
This is hell.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home.
You and Mr. Willis check around, see if you see anything.
Come with me.
I hate fucked up families!
- It's just a dip.
- Otis!
Otis, come quick.
There's cops out there.
- What? Damn!
- How many?
- Don't worry about it.
- I don't know. I only saw one.
Fucking pigs always travel in packs.
- Take this.
- What should I do?
Go downstairs and play nice.
I'll go round back and take control like I always fucking do.
Goddamn.
These packrats throw anything away?
- I don't think so.
- Hold this thing.
Hello? Hello?
You'd think these son of bitches would have a yard sale, don't you?
Yeah.
Hello?
Oh my God!
- Oh my God!
- Calm down, Barney!
Don't even start with that "Mayberry" shit.
It's only a dog.
I was bit by a cocker spaniel when I was eight years old.
- Hello, Officer.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm Lieutenant Wydell. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Why, heck, I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
I appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.
I'm looking for a missing girl.
I'm serious. It was a big cocker spaniel... big teeth.
It was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, you hear that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear it. Where do you think it's coming from?
Out this way.
All right, hold on, hold on one second here.
Hey, hey!
Sheriff's Department, open up.
- No, I ain't seen her, sorry.
- Ma'am...
If I could just come in for a minute.
I have some other pictures
I'd like you to look at.
It might stir something up.
No. I don't think so.
Ma'am.
It'll only take a minute.
Oh, all right.
I guess I can trust you, being a man of the law.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Oh, this one looks familiar.
Is he on the TV?
No, ma'am,
I don't believe he is.
- Wydell?
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Wydell, over! Wydell, over!
- Wydell, over.
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all havin' a Halloween Party.
What makes you think that, big boy?
You sure are buying a whole mess of holy water for two people.
We like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit.
- You know what I mean?
- I like to get fucked up too.
- Do some fucked up shit.
- Yeah, I bet you do.
How much we owe ya, goober?
Actually it's G. Ober, for Gerry Ober, but the new guy, Romald in the back, he drew in that other O and made Goober.
Fucking asshole.
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe ya?
The damage is quite severe.
- That ain't gonna break my bank.
Here, keep the change and go get yourself a new name, Goober.
Holy dog, I will, thank you.
You all drive safe. Thanks for comin' in to Red Hot Pussy Liquor.
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?
He's comin'. He's got something real special this year.
Otis, Otis, Otis...
I'm the one who brings the Christmas candy.
Now tell me, who's your daddy?
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy.
Who's your daddy?!
I'm the one who beats you when you're bad.
- Who's your Daddy?!
- Who's your Daddy?!
Come on, sweetie, give the old man some sugar.
Daddy, Daddy.
And I'm the one who loves ya when you're fucking dead.
Who's your Daddy?!
Who's your Daddy?!
Well, I say my little darlings.
Maybe it ain't a good idea to be prancing around where you don't belong.
And you, the great rusher of fools, what was it that you were after?
Come on, speak to me, boy.
I remember now.
Dr. Satan.
Goddamn it, everybody got to know about Dr. Satan.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm gonna let you meet the old bastard.
It's all true.
The bogeyman is real and you found him.
And you found him...
Hey, happy boy, step your ass up here.
Take his gag out.
It's more fun with the screaming.
I like that too. That screaming is much more exciting that way.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Please don't kill us... nah... please don't kill us.
Shut your mouth and get your shit in the box.
- Get in now.
- Wait, wait, wait...
I wanna say goodbye.
Goodbye, sweetie.
We could've been great.
Just let us go, I swear to God we won't tell anyone.
- I swear...
- Honey, you know I can't do that.
I swear to God, we won't tell. I swear to God.
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?
Get your fucking ass up, boy.
Come on, we aint' got all night.
Where does she think she's gonna run to?
- She gonna run all the way home?
- No, let me get her.

Mary.
Told you.

Mary.
Mary...

"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit.

No, no, not tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow. Right.
You, me, Gary, Brad.
We'll be teeing off at...
Well, I like Gary.
Dr. Dandewar,
I'm kind of in a bit of a hurry.
We'll be teeing off at 7:30, and if you're not there because of Gary, well, come on, you know. I gotta go.
Am I missing something?
Why did Dr. Cho order a head X-ray when the man was bitten on the hand?
The patient was in a bar fight.
He was communicative when he was admitted at 6:00.
That's 6:00 a.m.
This morning. That's when
I started my shift.
Where's the patient now?
I'd like to see him.
They moved him.
I'm sure one of the night nurses can tell you...
Page me when you find him.
Sure.
I'll do that.
Hey, Cora, can you do me a favor and locate a patient for me?
Hey, Ana. Sure.
Edward Solomon?
Yeah.
Aren't you off?
An hour ago.
Here he is.
They had him backward.
Solomon Edward.
He's upstairs in I.C.U.
From a bite?
I don't know what from.
Toxicology is gonna work him up in the morning.
Okay, I'm gonna get outta here.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you page Dr. Dandewar and let him know?
Sure.
Thanks.
You talk to Luis about Sunday?
I will. Night, Cora.
Night.
Hey.
Hey, Ana?
Let's go.
It's starting early.
Great.
Let's go!
Let's go!

Ana, look.
I can go backwards.
Let me see.
Hey, that's amazing!
Maybe tomorrow after work
I'll do a few backward laps around the block with you, okay?
Okay.
All right. Careful now,
I gotta pull in.
Say hey to your mom for me, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, you.
You're late.
You missed it.
They just cut the mailman loose.
ANA: No, Richie?
The chubby one?
Oh, my God.
He had such a sweet voice.
I can't believe that.
Hey, you.
How'd it go today?
Not bad. You?
Good. I'm trading shifts with Cora, so if I take Sunday,
I can have a three-day weekend at the end of the month.
Is that okay?
Sunday?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think Cora's got this new guy she doesn't want me to know about.
Really. Wow. Lucky her.
I thought maybe you'd gone out with the girls or something.
What? And miss date night?

MAN: Airborne is a possibility.
We don't know.

A U. S...
God, they're here!
MAN: And I looked and behold, a pale horse.
And its name, that sat on him, was Death.
And Hell followed with him.
Say something.
Please.
All right! Okay!
Put the guns down!
What are you doing?
Come on. He's a cop!
Come on.
Put the gun down!
I thought you were one of them.
You do not wanna go that way.
What's that way?
Officer, sir, you do not wanna go that way.
What's that way?
It's pretty bad.
What about Fort Pastor?
Maybe if you had wings.
The road's thick with those motherfuckers that way.
How do you know?
We just tried.
Come on.
Back when there was eight of us.
We're going to the mall.
Shit.
Damn.
Hurry up!
Back up!
Open the door!
Lights.
Here.
No?
No.
Come on.
Sit right there.
We need to make sure this place is safe.
I'm gonna see if the doors over this way are locked.
I'll check down there.
Maybe, Officer, you could go down that direction. Check for...
All right. Okay.
Maybe it's better you stay here with the gun.
Andre and I will check around.
All right, baby,
I'll be right back.
No, no, just stay right here, okay?
Stay right here.
Shatterproof, asshole.
Shit!
Hey, what happened?
Come on, move!
You all right?
Move!
LUDA: Which way?
Here. Elevators.
Let's go! Let's go!
Can I see that arm?
We need to suture that.
Yeah.
You okay?
KENNETH: Yeah.
Find someplace else.
Look, we just need a place...
Maybe you didn't hear me.
There is no place else.
Well, that's tough shit,
'cause this is our place, and you can't stay here.
Yeah, and you already trashed Metropolis.
Look, dumbass.
My wife is pregnant.
We can't run anymore.
His arm.
Those things are down there.
Well, these are all your problems, not mine.
If I put my foot up your ass, would that be your problem?
Hey, asshole, I'm the one pointing the gun at you.
He is a cop, C.J.
So what?
ANA: We're not going to cause any trouble.
Just let us stay here for a little while.
Please.
Okay.
Come out of there slowly, and give your weapons to Bart and Terry.
Don't do it.
You must be out of your fucking mind.
You can take your ass on over to Quality Inn if it's still there, Shaq.
Huh?
Wanna do that?
Let's go.
Hey, don't give him that gun.
Fuck.
Smart move.
MAN ON TV: They're everywhere.
Nobody seems to know what's going on.
There's a lot of blood.
We have bodies.
There's a slew of fires.
We're back to a live picture now.
All right.
Can I get one second here?
Ma'am, are you American?
All right.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
Get your own little TV.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me, please.
Is there a restroom?
No. You're staying here.
So then why don't you tell us which spot in here you'd like us to take a piss.
All right. It's around the corner, that way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
She's not going anywhere alone. Come on.
Oh, well,
"She's not going any..."
This is a fucking nursery school.
Terry, go with them.
MAN ON TV: Hi. I'm Bill Vibert with 23V Cable News.
I'm at one of the collection depots waiting on an interview with Sheriff Cahill.
I understand you're having a difficult time killing these things.
Just shoot them in the head.
They seem to go down permanently when you shoot them in the head.
Then you gotta burn them.
We gotta burn...
Danny! Danny!
Put another round in that woman over there!
Look, she's a twitcher.
"Twitcher"?
Now that is one cool motherfucker.
The bleeding's not gonna stop on its own.
I need to stitch his arm.
What are you, a fucking doctor?
No, I'm a fucking nurse.
I know some of these people that we're putting down...
First Aid kit's in the security office.
What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.
Huh? What did I tell you, boys?
Get those bodies off the truck!
Haven't got all day here!
America always sorts its shit out.
You know, you're lucky.
They could have bitten it off.
Yes, I believe you're referring to a report that came in this morning.
But that report was completely...
REPORTER:
What can you tell the people out there watching TV that don't know what to do?
What I would suggest is that you come to Fort Pastor.
And if you can't make it here, we have multiple search-and-rescue teams out there and they will find you.
My brother's there.
He's waiting for me.
What's the hold up, darling?
Hmm?
So what's the plan?
The plan is you drink a nice tall glass of shut the fuck up.
MICHAEL: Okay.
That's one idea.
What about locking this place down?
'Cause sooner or later, they're going to get in here.
Mmm.
That's good.
Like I hadn't thought of that.
MICHAEL: Hey, no doubt.
And you probably already thought about putting a sign up on the roof.
Because, you know, there's still planes in the air.
Might be good.
Let them know we're alive.
We can get some paint from Case Hardware.
We need some office doors to board up the weak spots.
That's a solid plan.
C.J., is it?
Yeah.
All right, C.J.
All right, everybody, listen up.
I'm gonna give everybody a job to do, and I expect you to do all of it.
I don't wanna see any half-assing.
You know what?
Why don't you start off by cleaning up that mess you made in Metropolis?
Hey, C.J., look.
Terry, take a look at Ben Cozine.
Hey, Ben. Ben!
Look at him.
BART: Look, he's a twitcher.
TV says you gotta shoot them in the head.
TV said a lot of things that aren't true.
Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.
Let's go.
Let's get to work.
Holy shit.
TERRY: Let's do it.
BART: All right.
Let's pick him up then.
All right.
Ready? One, two...
BART: On two.
All right.
One, two...
What are they?
I don't know.
Why are they coming here?
KENNETH: Memory, maybe.
Instinct.
Maybe they're coming for us.
ANA: Hey, look over there.
There's someone on the roof.
C. J: Yeah, his name's Andy.
He's alone.
He may as well be on the Moon.
ANA: Poor guy.
What's he pointing at?
MICHAEL: Helicopter.
ANDRE: Hey, it's coming.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Please!
What's he doing?
Where's he...
No, no. I mean, they saw us.
So, I mean, they're gonna be coming back, baby.
Don't worry.
I mean, they're gonna send somebody or something.
ANA: It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them to come back.
I don't want anybody sneaking around and stealing shit.
Comprende?
Sweet dreams.
Those assholes are gonna get us killed.
We have to do something.
I'm not doing anything to create problems for Luda and me.
The helicopter's coming back soon.
I hope so.
And what's that supposed to mean?
It means it might come and it might not.
We don't know.
What do you mean it not come back?
You said it was coming back!
We have to get to hospital.
Hey, baby, listen, listen.
Don't worry. This guy, he doesn't know shit.
All right?
It's coming back.
Hey, my man. You know,
I hear you talking a lot.
You know, you're always saying something.
Who the fuck are you that we should listen, huh?
What are you, like, in Special Ops?
You in the Marines?
What the fuck do you do?
I sell televisions at Best Buy.
ANDRE: Wow.
Hey, Officer, how you like following a guy that sells TVs?
About as much as I like following a guy who steals them.
I'm not following anyone.
I'm going to Fort Pastor to get my brother.
They seem to need to feed on warm flesh.
Some basic skills remain.
They don't seem to have much, if any, reasoning power.
And how does this spread?
These guys are so full of shit.
They've been saying the same damn thing all day.
MAN ON TV: Everybody they kill gets up.
Tell me something
I don't know, asshole!
I've just been informed that we are going off the air...
BART: Wanna hear something that sucks?
...and switching over to the Emergency
Broadcasting System.
You guys know that chick at Dairy Queen?
I don't know when we'll be back on the air.
The fat one?
Yeah.
She was coming over tonight.
I would have tapped that shit for sure.
Bart, dude, everybody's dead, okay?
Your mom's dead.
Your brother's dead.
That fat chick at Dairy Queen?
Dead!
It's been a pleasure to report the news to you in these past 26 years.
God bless you.
Yeah.
God bless America.
That sucks too.
Hell is overflowing.
And Satan is sending his dead to us.
Why? Because you have sex out of wedlock.
You kill unborn children.
You have man-on-man relations.
Same-sex marriage.
How do you think your god will judge you?
Well, friends, now we know.
When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth
What the hell...
Hey, dumbass.
It's the timers.
It's? :00.
Terry.
Go shut them off.
It's Bart's turn.
You're the trainee, man.
Shit rolls downhill.
I wish somebody was working at Hallowed Grounds.
How hard is it to make a cup of coffee?
I wanted a soy mocha latte with foam.
Faggot.
What are you doing?
What's the news?
Bad.
Hey. Hey!
Hey!
What?
The bathroom in here is fake. It doesn't work.
I'll tell C.J.
I'm telling you.
You're the type of cat that goes to church and all that kind of shit, right?
Yeah, I do all that kind of shit.
So what you think? Hmm?
What is this?
Is this the end of times?
'Cause if it is,
I'm telling you,
I'm fucked.
No, I'm serious.
I've done some bad things in my life, man.
Oh, I get it.
You saw hell yesterday.
Now you're scared of going to hell for all the bad things you've done.
I'll tell you what.
Go in the stall, say five Hail Marys, wipe your ass, and you and God can call it even.
You think I feel like I deserve to be here?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I don't.
And I'm cool with that.
But you see, that's not it.
'Cause I feel like
I'm here for another reason.
I feel like I'm here to bring that baby on this earth.
And give it everything that I never had.
I just want the opportunity to change things.
Shit!
C. J!
How did you get out?
And who gave you permission to loot the goddamn stores?
What are we gonna do about that truck?
We're not going to do anything about that truck.
There's people in there.
Yeah? How do you know they're not all fucked up like everybody else out there?
Well, for one thing, they're driving a truck.
Oh, and shooting guns.
If we start letting people in here, then we're gonna let the wrong ones in.
And then I'm dead.
You know what?
I don't wanna die!
Who are the wrong ones?
Nobody here is sick.
And I intend on keeping it that way.
I just think we should...
I did not ask for your opinion, lady!
Now, if you wanna argue with me, you can argue with this.
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, take it easy.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Get the gun outta my face.
You can't just turn them away, C.J.
You'll kill them.
Tough shit. Self-defense.
I'm not killing anybody.
You know what?
I'll kill you.
No, no, stop it, C.J.
Don't do this!
Shut up!
I'll kill each and every one of you to stay alive.
You hear me?
I said get the fucking gun outta my face!
You got quite a mouth on you.
Somebody should show her how to use it.
Is there a holding cell in there?
Yeah, back of the security room.
That's real good, man.
You're gonna get us all killed, dumbass.
Fucking traitor!
BART: Get off me.
I hope you got a good plan.
Come on.
Hey! Up here!
Can't see a damn thing.
Me neither.
Why's he backing up the truck?
Through here!
Hey!
Shit.
Fuck. We gotta go out there.
Man, you better throw that bullshit right out your head.
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.
No.
Okay.
One, two, three.
No. Don't do it, man.
Come on, man.
Thanks.
Yeah.
ANDRE: Shoot them in the head!
I don't see anybody.
Get back inside!
They're fine!
Get back inside!
Here you go.
There's six more people inside the truck.
Andre, look!
MONICA: Thank God.
I couldn't stay in that fucking truck anymore.
ANA: All right, anybody who's injured, let's get you into
Metropolis right away.
I'll come take a look at you.
Let me take a look at her.
Can you help me with...
Sir, what's your name? Sorry.
Glen, yeah, sure.
Just give me a second to collect myself, okay?
Thanks.
If you wanna just go wait for me in there,
I'll take a look at your leg.
Here. I'll hold this.
Just go and wait there.
My arm!
It's okay, ma'am.
We're gonna make you nice and comfortable, all right?
The rest of you, we've got plenty of food and water.
Help should be along soon.
Help? Did you hear that from the same jackass who told us to go to St. Verbena?
The church downtown?
Yeah.
That's the first place I went.
Some dipshit on the radio said it was safe there.
He was wrong.
Is that where you picked them up?
Well, I get this call on the C.B.
From that guy Glen saying all these folks are in the chapel.
He's a priest?
No, he plays the organ.
I was in the neighborhood, so I picked them up.
Well done.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
When you two fellows are done blowing each other, maybe Davy Crockett can tell us the deal here.
Well, we haven't heard much since the TVs went out last night.
KENNETH: Excuse me.
Whose rig is that?
It's mine.
You mind if I borrow it?
I'm not using it,
Officer.
Keys.
They're in the cab.
Truck's not gonna make it to Fort Pastor.
No, forget the truck.
That place is fucked, man.
Bloodbath city.
How do you know?
We just came from there.
Is everyone there dead?
Or dead-ish.
Is everyone there dead?
Yeah, in the sense that they all, sort of, fell down, and then...
I gotta look for myself.
You're not gonna make it.
...got up and...
I'll get as far as I can.
Right now it's about one foot out that door.
...started eating each other.
I'll take my chances.
Don't be an idiot.
Please, there's people here right now who could use your help.
Fuck y'all.
It's nice to see that you've all bonded through this disaster.
Hey. You need anything?
No, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.
He's got a bite on his hand.
She's cold.
That's good, right?
ANA: I don't know, it's weird.
I've never seen an infection this bad that didn't come with a fever.
That guy's arm looks pretty bad over there.
You should probably check it out.
All right.
Stay with her for a minute.
Here. Want me to take a look at that?
I'm fine. Really.
They don't hurt much at all.
Tucker could use you more than I could.
His ankle's cut pretty bad.
Here. I'm just gonna clean it up a bit.
TERRY: You okay?
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?
Ana! Ana, come here!
Anyone know her name?
Died without a name?
Damn.
Guys, do you wanna move into the other room?
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
Oh, shit.
I think it's the bites.
Frank said she was walking on her own when she got in the truck five hours ago.
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.
How do you know?
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse.
She was gone.
Then... Yesterday
I saw the same thing happen to somebody else.
I think that's why it spread so fast.
All right.
So who else in the group is bitten?
Frank, for sure.
How about the one with the foot?
Tucker?
He says no, he fell.
So, it's Frank.
Tall guy, right?
Right. So we have to quarantine him right away.
Where exactly do we do that?
I don't know.
There must be someplace to keep him in here.
Then what?
I don't know, but...
It's too dangerous to keep him on here.
I'm sorry. What are we talking about here?
Are we talking about killing him?
Would you rather we waited for him to die, and then he tries to kill us?
Yes. No.
You can't kill him.
Ana...
He's got a daughter!
I'm sorry.
I don't think there's any other choice.
He's right.
Michael, you can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?
You've seen it happen before.
Frank,
Michael's coming to shoot you.
What are you talking about?
You're infected.
You're gonna become one of them.
Is this true?
Are you gonna kill me?
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.
No, no, no!
Leave my dad alone!
Go away!
You can't do this!
You have to understand that she's lost everyone.
Her mother, her two brothers.
I'm all she's got.
Well, Michael, what are you waiting for?
Go ahead, kill him.
Hey, kill Tucker, too.
Wait a minute.
I was never bit.
We can't be sure.
Do it, Michael.
Are you sure it's the bite?
No.
She's sure.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
You okay?
Let me see your arm.
It hurts.
It's already starting to heal.
Andre, I can't have baby here.
Why not? People have been having babies for millions of years.
All on their own.
No hospitals.
Wait.
Oh, yeah.
It's moving.
I felt it.
ANDRE: So now we gotta come up with a name for this baby.
I want Russian name.
Don't start that again.
African name.
Please?
Come here.
Give me a hug.
FRANK: Sweetie,
I'm so proud of you.
I couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter.
I love you, baby.
I love you too.
Time to go, honey.
No.
Terry, come on, man.
Open the door.
Shut up.
C. J: Come on, man.
Don't tell me to shut up.
Just come open the door.
BART: I got you this job.
Come on.
You want...
...every...
...single second.
Ana.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
C. J: Okay, okay.
Here's a good one.
"Top Ten Ingredients
To A Successful Relationship."
All right, I'm gonna skip to the top three.
Number three,
"He listens to me."
Number two,
"He tells me he loves me."
And number one...
Oh, it's "trust."
Number one's trust.
Holy shit. He got him.
So, who do we have next?
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.
Tell him to get
Burt Reynolds.
STEVE: Oh, my goodness.
Man, he's good.
It barely even looked like him.
Oh, oh. Rosie O'Donnell.
Tell him to get Rosie.
Oh, yeah. Rosie.
No, too easy.
Give him something hard.
You guys had really rough childhoods, didn't you?
A little bit rocky?
Hey, sweetheart.
Let me tell you something.
You have my permission.
I ever turn into one of those things?
Do me a favor, blow my fucking head off.
Oh, yeah.
You can count on that.
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay...
I was 13.
This guy...
Todd.
He was building a deck in our backyard.
Okay? Just, please, stop.
I remember he had the most astonishing blue eyes.
Oh, my God!
I'm in hell.
Hey, Andre.
How's Luda doing?
She's fine.
Hey, where's that lemon stuff?
It's all gone.
Steve likes to put it in his booze.
Try the vanilla stuff.
All right.
I'd like to drop by and check on her, just to see how she's doing.
No, thanks. She's fine.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's okay, hon.
We understand.
Thanks.
Before that I worked in a stationery store.
And I drove a snowplow.
Fixed copiers.
God, it's such a shame that this whole end of the world thing's holding you back.
Okay, worst job.
I know which job
I was the worst at.
Being a husband.
That's not a job.
It sure is.
You guys just haven't met the right girl.
Yeah, I tried it three times.
I got pink slips every time.
What were you best at?
Being a dad.
I think
I was best at that.
KENNETH: Everybody calm down.
NORMA: Are they inside?
MICHAEL: No.
This place have generators?
ANDRE: It's all right, baby.
Baby, please.
You gotta be quiet. Okay?
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby's on the way.
It's coming.
That's it. It's in employee parking, level three.
They keep them in a pen near the parking shuttles.
Have fun.
Hey. Wait a minute.
You're coming too.
No, I'm not.
I said I'd tell you where the generators are.
I never said I'd show you.
Did you think
I was gonna leave you two up here?
You come with me, or you go back in that cell.
All right.
I ain't going anywhere without a gun.
You're not getting a gun.
Trust.
Primary ingredient in any relationship.
Have at them, cowboy.
Asshole.
Bart, get the chains.
Shit.
Are we ready to roll?
You coming with us?
No, you're coming with me.
I've done this before.
Know how to use that?
This one's the dangerous end, right?
Now it is.
This is level one.
We gotta walk down to three.
What the fuck was that?
I just saw something.
You didn't see shit, Bart.
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, shit.
Here it comes.
Jesus Christ!
It's a fucking dog.
Come here, boy.
At least you know nothing's down here.
It would've eaten him.
See? I told you
I saw something.
MICHAEL: What's wrong, boy?
There's nothing wrong.
That dog's just fucked up.
Run!
BART: Wait, C.J.
Wait up! Wait!
It's locked!
It's fucking locked!
No! No!
KENNETH: Come on! Let's go!
C.J.!
I'm out.
C.J.! Matches!
Breathe.
You're doing good.
Breathe.
You're doing good, baby.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Okay. That's the last.
I'm gonna go check on Luda.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I'll go.
You sure?
Yeah.
Take them some candles.
Okay. Let me know if they need anything.
Okay. I'll have a little smoke on the way.
See you.
Bye.
It's coming.
I see it.
Guys?
Oh, my God.
It's a girl.
You wanna kill Luda?
You wanna kill my family?
Norma? Come on, Norma.
What happened?
Son of a bitch shot me.
Get away from her.
ANA: Wait.
Just wait.
She died of the gunshot.
She wasn't bitten.
She's gonna wake up though, right?
ANA: No.
No. If she was one of them, she'd be up by now.
Terry.
Yeah?
Hold this.
Oh, God.
Somebody should say something.
Yeah.
MICHAEL: Glen?
No.
You worked in the church.
I played the organ.
C. J: Come on, man.
You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.
It was a job.
I don't believe in God.
I don't see how anyone could.
Somebody should say something.
Nothing to say.
Been to a lot of funerals.
Folded the flag and given it to a lot of wives, and fathers, and kids.
I told them how sorry I was.
But that's not what
I was really feeling.
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying,
"Better them than me."
But I don't believe that now.
Because now I realize there are some things worse than death, and one of them is sitting here waiting to die.
I don't wanna die here.
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.
We could fix them up.
We could reinforce them.
Then get as far from here as possible.
And then what?
Oh, I have an idea.
While we're at it why don't we swing by the marina, and hop in my boat, take it for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.
Wait a minute.
That's a good idea.
There's islands out in those lakes.
There's not a lot of people on them.
I was kidding.
How far is the marina?
Oh, my God.
You're serious?
I think it's a damn good idea.
How about the rest of you?
Kenneth?
Yeah, it's a good idea.
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.
Excuse me, not to shit on anyone's riff here, but let me just see if I grasp this concept, okay?
You're suggesting that we take some fucking parking shuttles and reinforce them with some aluminum siding, and then just head on over to the gun store where we watch our good friend Andy play some cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-covered-wagon bullshit?
Then we're going to drive across the ruined city through a welcome committee of a few hundred thousand dead cannibals.
All so we can sail off into the sunset on this fucking asshole's boat?
Head for some island that for all we know doesn't even exist?
Yeah.
Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm in.
We have 12 of these shotgun shells,
26 of those pussy nine mils and 16 of those.357 Magnums.
ANA: Yeah? Well, it's still not very much, so...
Hopefully we'll get to the dock and there won't be too many of them.
Well, it's nice to see you busting your ass today.
Oh, that's sarcasm.
That is awesome.
Yeah, you know,
I would love to help, but a captain never works alongside his men.
You guys, have a good one.
What a total dick.
Guys, where'd Chips go?
Chips?
NICOLE: Where'd you go, Chips?
I can't find him.
Chips, come here.
Come on, Chips.
Come on, Chips.
NICOLE: Chips, come on, boy.
Where'd you go, honey?
NICOLE: There you are.
Come on. There's my boy.
Don't you ever leave me again, okay?
Ever, ever.
Hey. Kenneth wants everyone upstairs for a meeting.
Come in here first.
I want you to see this.
When those things are on the side of the bus, this'll get them off.
Cool, huh?
Wow.
That might be the most romantic thing anyone's ever shown me.
I'm trying here.
Yeah, I know.
It's not just about him starving, Steve.
If we go to pick him up and he doesn't have his strength, then we're going to be carrying him. It's...
TUCKER: She's right.
He's a hell of a shot too.
We're going to need him.
Tucker, I'm not saying we don't need him.
There's no point in arguing about this.
We need a solution.
We need to get some food over there.
STEVE: Okay. I have an idea.
We draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.
ANA: Could you be a bigger prick?
STEVE: I think so.
But, you know, that's irrelevant.
My question to you is, what's your plan?
Come on.
MICHAEL: We're not going to leave him on his own to die, all right?
I got it.
MICHAEL: We gotta get over there anyway.
Shut up.
Because we need more ammunition, all right?
I have an idea.
Stop, it's hurting him.
No! He's not safe.
Nicole, they're not interested in him.
I promise.
Look at me.
They want us.
Chips is gonna be fine.
See? Look.
He's walking right by them.
They're not even paying attention to him.
KENNETH: The walkie's in the bag, right?
TERRY: Yeah.
Let me see.
There he is. Good boy.
Good boy, Chips.
Okay. He's there. He's in.
Give me those.
KENNETH: Oh, man.
What?
KENNETH: No.
What?
No. Oh, man.
They got him. They got him!
Try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?
Andy, can you hear me?
Andy?
ANDY: Can you hear me? Hello?
Is this working?
I'm dinged up pretty bad, but I think I'm gonna be okay.
Where are you hurt, Andy?
Goddamn, those bastards bite hard.
I just have to stop the bleeding.
It's really going.
Easy, boy, easy.
Is this Ken?
Is that you, man?
Yeah, it's me, brother.
Hey, man.
Good to hear your voice.
I guess we're going to meet up close pretty soon, huh?
Oh, shit. Hang on.
Oh, Jesus, he got me good.
Now, you just hang in there.
You got the food, right?
Yeah.
Do we tell him?
Hey, this dog got a name?
See, Nicole, Chips...
Nicole?
What the hell's that?
Oh, my God! It's Nicole!
Shit.
That idiot's going after the fucking dog.
She made it. She's in.
NICOLE: You guys?
I found Chips.
I got him. He's okay.
Nicole, how's Andy looking?
I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here.
It's everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.
Wait a minute. I see him.
He's on the roof.
He's writing something.
What's it say?
Guys?
Tell her to get out.
Guys?
What's wrong?
Nicole, baby, how's the truck?
I'm not going back out there.
Chips, be quiet!
Tell her to get the hell out now!
Honey, listen to me.
You need to find a place to hide.
Can you do that?
What do you mean?
What's going on?
MICHAEL: Nicole.
Oh, here's Andy.
Oh, my God!
No! Tell her to get out!
Nicole, listen to me.
I'm in a closet.
But he's outside.
He's trying to get...
MICHAEL: Nicole?
Nicole?
Help me! Please, you have to help me!
I'm gonna die!
We need to do something, now.
Tucker, listen. When we come back through here, we may have company.
You need to stay here and make sure that fire door stays open.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Why does he stay here, while I go on the suicide mission to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend?
Fuck you, man.
We don't know that.
You know what, asshole?
Either way we gotta get over there and get the guns and get out of this parking lot, all right?
Michael, it's okay.
Let him stay.
Yeah.
Steve, don't fuck this up.
Yeah. Totally.
C. J: All right.
That's it.
MICHAEL: Are you sure?
I ain't a plumber, but I'd say we're pretty much at the end of the line here.
C. J: Go! Go!
Through here!
C. J: Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry!
What do you need?
TERRY: Here.
Damn it.
Come on. Hurry up.
All right.
C. J: Oh, shit.
Nicole?
KENNETH: Andy.
I'm sorry, brother.
MICHAEL:
Nicole, are you in there?
NICOLE: I'm here! I'm here!
KENNETH: Get as much ammo as you can.
You got a plan?
Uh-uh. You?
How about a barbecue?
How do we know if he hits it?
Oh, shit.
TERRY: C.J.! Over here!
Hurry up!
Over here!
Go! Get down!
TUCKER: Look out!
C. J: Come on, Tucker!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
TUCKER: My leg!
C. J: I got you, Tucker.
Go! Go!
Shit.
Go!
MICHAEL: Let's go!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
NICOLE: Terry, come on!
Hurry! Hurry!
Goddamn Steve Markus!
NICOLE: Steve, come on!
Steve!
NICOLE: Open the door!
Open the door!
TERRY: Steve!
Fucking kill him!
TERRY: Come on!
Open the door, Steve!
Let's go!
KENNETH: Move!
Go!
C. J: Move it, guys! Move it!
MONICA: Where are you guys going?
Let's go right now.
We're going.
MICHAEL: Go! Go!
ANA: They're right behind us!
KENNETH: Come on, move!
They're right behind us!
I like this song.
Everybody in!
Hey, there you are.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Give me the keys.
ANA: Prick.
What?
I'll deal with you later, motherfucker!
Wait a minute! Nicole!
Man, get in!
I'll take the gun. Okay.
GLEN: Okay, let's get out of here.
Hold on!
Oh, Christ!
C.J., now! Go!
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit them with the saw!
STEVE: Come on, damn it.
C. J: Give me the shotgun!
Holy shit.
There's still one hanging on.
Which fucking side?
Right side.
GLEN: I got him.
You gotta drive faster, man.
Hard left! Hard left! Here!
Whoa! Stop! Stop, guys!
What?
We lost them. Back it up.
Back it up! Back up!
Kenneth, are you there?
Kenneth?
ANA: Kenneth, are you there?
Kenneth, are you okay?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
Fucking nursery school.
C.J.!
Ana, no. Everyone's dead.
Steve took off.
What?
C. J: Let's go! Come on!
Steve!
I got him.
Damn.
Watch out!
Come on! Come on!
TERRY: Open the door!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Guys, get in!
KENNETH: Let's go.
Where's Ana? Ana!
Ana!
Get in! Get in!
What the hell were you doing?
Hold on!
NICOLE: Come on, boy.
Go.
Kenneth! Here.
Go to the end of the dock.
KENNETH: C.J., come on.
Do it, man. I'll catch up!
There it is.
MICHAEL: Terry, get the bowline.
Shit.
C.J.!
It's jammed! Fuck!
Come on!
Bitch! Shit!
Come on.
It fucking figures.
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
I can't go.
What?
Downtown when they jumped on us.
Oh, no, Michael. No.
I have to stay here.
Wait. You can't.
Not you. Please.
I'm sorry, Ana.
I can help you.
MICHAEL: No, you can't.
You can help them.
MICHAEL: Stay on the boat.
I can help you.
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.
No.
It won't.
Hey.
It will.
You sure you wanna do this?
Yeah.
I think I'll just stay here awhile.
Enjoy the sunrise.
I run a tight ship.
Where did you get that thing?
TERRY: I found Steve's camera.
Put that down. Help us.
TERRY: Kenneth, fucking shoot it! Shoot it!
TERRY: Christ!
TERRY: Shit.
Get that damn camera out of my face.
Doesn't look like there's anyone there.
Terry, put the camera down while I dock the boat.
TERRY: Nicole, what is it?
NICOLE: Chips, no!
TERRY: Oh, shit!
KENNETH: Stay behind me!

Jesus!
Are you still there?
No, I'm back.
I'm not sure I got the spelling.
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.
I'll catch a ride and see you out there. Bye.
- Jack.
- Yeah?
The Balkans peace council is "comprised" or "composed" of ten members?
Twelve members.
Oh, right. Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.
What?
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.
It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party.
I can't.
Mary's waiting for me.
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.
Take a look around.
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good. Good.
Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now.
We'll take it.
Really? Oh, my God!
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
Mary.
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!
Hold on, darling.
911, there's been an accident.
Yes.
Nothing.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's just me.
You didn't see it, did you?
See what?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
According to the doctor, it's extremely rare.
One in...
600,000 gets this thing.
Did they say it was a result of the accident?
No, it turns out... that it's been there a while.
There's nothing else they can do?
They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out.
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car... and the universe... just points at you and says...
"Ah, there you are, a happy couple.
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you".
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
I feel like
I ruined everything.
You didn't ruin anything.
Not a damn thing.
I want you to be happy.
You didn't see it, did you?
Yes.
Yeah?
She knew.
What?
She was drawing angels.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it. People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment.
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate out there for the Democrats?
Well, I'm hearing a lot about Russ McCallum.
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...
Hey, I told her to watch.
Who?
Peter's friend Gwen.
She'll be there tonight.
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make that one tonight.
Come on, you can't keep blowing this thing off.
I'm not. I've got an interview with the governor.
I gotta be in Richmond at 8:00 in the morning.
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.
They bumped the meeting till tomorrow night.
Eddie, look, I...
Look... she's not Mary.
Not by a mile.
But you know what?
No one ever will be.
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.
Maybe some other time.
It's about 1:00 in the morning.
I'm a little wired, so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.
Al I right, come on.
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late, but my car broke down just up the road.
I wondered if I could use the phone.
Hello.
It's him.
I been waitin' for you.
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?
Get the door! Get the door!
Just stay right there.
Mister, I don't know who you...
Shut up!
Shut up.
Honey, Connie's here.
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?
Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here.
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m., there's a bang on the door.
I open it up, and here's this guy.
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back.
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
I used the word "trespass", and he still came back.
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch.
He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon.
What?
Fine.
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might come back, and sure enough, there he is.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC. Look.
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car.
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein.
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise? No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here.
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor. I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks, Eddie.
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
Mr. Smallwood...
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
Listen, mister.
Connie called me.
She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me.
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
And as far as I know,
I'm not crazy.
So if you're accusing me...
Look, here's the thing.
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad. I really wanted to know what I look like.
Sergeant, I'm curious.
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me.
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now...
I'd sure like to hear it.
The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things.
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights, strange phone calls, you.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move.
And then I guess it just... took off..
That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words.
You didn't see it, did you?
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds.
They all like this?
Well, once it was a man talking really fast.
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
Shucks, no.
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schoolin' and stuff.
All right, all right.
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding. Something of national interest in West Virginia?
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
Keep him at bay, okay?
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"Do not be afraid.
Ninety-nine will die.
Denver Nine".
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
Gordon, you... your ear's bleeding.
What?
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine.
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.
He had hallucinations, heard voices.
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion.
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait. Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news.
I wish I was sick. Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes.
Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
Wow, man.
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah... No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction.
It came true.
These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?
The way he describes them, they sound like dreams.
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
I was trying to swim, but I was too cold.
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.
I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away.
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear.
"Wake up, number 37".
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
Last night, coming home from work about midnight.
I'm driving past the cement plant... out by the chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind of hot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"Do not be afraid.
My name... is Indrid Cold".
And he said to me...
"In a place this size.
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
I will see you in time".
And that was it.
It's a little...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here.
Slow down, Gordon.
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
Gordon, let me talk to him.
Sure. Hang on.
Hello, John Klein.
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood.
Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin.
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
Okay, you got my attention.
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
Very good, John.
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
You're reading my mind, aren't you?
Did you read my mind?
I have no need to, do I?
What's the third line of page 51?
"A broken smile beneath her whispered wings".
Still more proof, John Klein?
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
You already have, John.
I have seen you afraid.
You're afraid right now, aren't you?
Can I ask you something?
Why ask me what you already know, John?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
What's up, Connie?
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood.
See? It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second.
But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so.
But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second.
Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
Still more proof, John Klein?
What is it?
Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse.
But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords.
Why ask me what you already know, John?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you. We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
Yeah, I know.
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein. I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
You can help me.
Follow me.
The nocturnal butterfly.
In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul immortally trapped... in the hellish death realms.
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
Rough translation, of course.
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plant went down.
Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane.
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially.
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
Electricity, microwaves, infrared waves.
You know, these things have been around forever.
They show up in cave paintings.
They're a normal condition of the planet.
They're just not part of our consensus of what constitutes... physical reality.
What are they part of, then?
You're asking for an explanation... for something... that can't be explained rationally.
You know the buildup of energy before something happens?
The way your hair stands up before lightning strikes?
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
All right, then... are they trying to warn me?
Their motivations... aren't human.
All right, then what do they want?
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
You noticed them, and they noticed that you noticed them.
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?
Last week my friend got a strange phone call... from an entity... a spirit, whatever.
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke to, he's off by more than a few degrees.
Then how do you explain that it knows everything?
Look at that.
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away, that window washer could likely see it.
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten. Twenty, maybe.
Listen to me. Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time. They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Shit.
- Where is he?
- Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane. You know why?
Denise and all the others, they don't know, John.
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
You talked to him too, John.
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
And lately, when I hear him... all at once...
I understand.
Everything.
John, do you remember the last time you were happy?
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
What?
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?
I can't believe I got through.
Gordon, where are you, man?
Speak up.
Listen, John, he was right.
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
It's real, John.
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
When did he call you, John?
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
Chief, this is John Klein.
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
Yeah, great. Thanks.
Shit!
Regular coffee to go, please.
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you.
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything", and then she left.
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
I mean, the hair is different.
- Oh, come on!
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.
Now, I agree there is a similarity...
Bullshit!
John, it's all right.
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
I'm sorry, John.
I feel like
I've ruined everything.
I feel like
I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences.
But you were, weren't you?
John, I had tapes of their voices.
I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened.
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
I was investigated, almost arrested.
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
Oh, you'll never understand their messages.
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question.
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
It's me, Cyrus.
John, is that you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
Whatever you are doing, you drop it.
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport.
You listening?
Yeah, McCal I um... at the chemical plant. Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
John, are you there?
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me.
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
Connie, please.
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.
You can't do it. You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.
Cancel it. Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up! toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.
You have a message.
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
John, do you realize what's happening to you?
I have to go.
Hey, it's me.
- Connie?
- Yeah.
I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No,you can't.
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.
So if you leave now, you'll just make it.
I can't.
It's Christmas Eve, John.
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
Yeah, you can.
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
No one can stop it, John.
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls may sound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
She's dead, John.
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there.
Even more easily because there, you're all alone.
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00.
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
Bye, John.
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
My God...
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!
Get off! Everyone get out of your cars and get off!
C.J., come on!
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!
Get off!
Get off the bridge!
Oh, God!
Go!
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!
Quick!
Let's get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Come on. Get out.
All units, this is unit 64.
Get out!
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.
Rose, do you copy?
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...
Wake up. Wake up.
Here we go.
You are here.
I didn't know if I was dreaming or...
I left DC right after you called.
You did call me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I called.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
But I supposed it could've been a lot worse.
Are they done with the search?
Thirty-six.
Looks like about 36 people.
Jesus.
Thirty-six?
Thirty-six?
Wake up, number 37.
There are 666 portals that connect
this world to the other side.
These are concealed
from all human beings.
But there are some who
notice their existence.
And some are willing to open the door
to gain the power of darkness...
Somewhere in Japan exists
the 444th portal, known as...
The Forest of Resurrection.
It was a long time ago when the evil soul uncovered its existence...
CHARGES: 1st Degree Murder, Robbery,
Excessive Self-defense, Manslaughter, etc.
VERDICT: Guilty
SENTENCE: 202 years in prison
"The world is full of people
who are better off dead..."
Prisoner No. KSC2-303
This way.
You better be right.
It's okay.
Just trust me.
Where are they?
Don't worry, they're coming.
I'm not worried.
I just don't trust you
Do as you please then.
It's quite a big deal for a pick-up, isn't it?
Where's the other car?
We gotta wait for him.
Then we'll leave.
Are you serious?
It's not safe here.
It doesn't matter.
We have specific orders from him.
Look, the roads could be blocked by now.
We gotta go!
What about roadblocks?
That's not our concern.
Hey, you...
Shut up, what the hell are we doing here anyway?
No, you shut up.
An order is an order, stop whining.
To hell with those orders!
Do you know what we had to go through forthis?
Besides, this place gives me the creeps.
Don't bother.
These assholes can't do anything but follow orders.
What?
On your way to a party?
Or are you trying to promote hoodlums?
You...
Better watch your mouth.
After all this running around...
...all we get is a useless bunch of punks.
Count me out.
I see.
So, shall I give you some time to rest?
Like forever!
Stop!
We were also ordered to keep this guy alive.
Shut up, come on, come on, come on!
I don't understand why this one is so special.
But you have to follow orders, too, right?
Don't be so nosy.
Wait a minute!
Calm down, all right?
You'd better be quiet, too.
Don't be so tense.
Fighting wouldn't do any good here, right?
That goes for you, too.
We'll let you get out of here when he comes, so be patient.
You know what?
I really hate waiting.
Stop it for now, it's not a good time.
That's right...
There's still...
After he gets here...
We'd better get out of here quick.
No matter how many times we come here, I hate this place.
It's ominous.
A forest to the southwest is an ominous feng shui sign.
Oh, really?
Meeting with you guys is ominous enough.
I told you to shut up.
Don't start again!
Hey!
Bring the girl.
Hey, what's with this girl?
Who knows?
The order was to kidnap her and bring her here with us.
One stupid girl and one asshole...
What the hell is he planning to do with those two?
I don't have the slightest idea what he's thinking!
Hey, come on.
He must have some plan.
Hey, wait.
I'm taking no part in kidnapping.
What?
What did you say?
Five men on one girl, you must be proud of yourself.
Hey, let her go and take off your toupee.
Shut the fuck up!
Do you know who you're talking to?
Perhaps you're misunderstanding the situation, hmm?
A crook like you could be spending the rest of your life in jail if we weren't here.
So just shut your smart ass mouth up!
Here's the thing, I'm a feminist.
What're you gonna do about it?
Hey you, let her go now.
Watch it.
I'm telling you, you should just let her go now.
Hey, are you crazy or what?
Don't make me tell you again.
Let her go right now, or you'll pay for it later.
So what are you going to do now, tough guy?
Where did they go?
It's scary here.
I'll kill that guy.
No, you shouldn't do that.
If you do, he'll become a monster like them.
I don't get it...
You know what?
Then I can kill the bastard twice.
That's nonsense.
This is not good, let's get out of here.
Don't be stupid, we can't let them get away!
We have bigger problems, don't we?
Look, this is yourfault, isn't it?
It's notjust that, think about it.
Thinking isn't going to do a bit of good.
They were not dead...
This can't be happening.
We'd better catch them before he gets here.
Yeah...
You're right.
Why did you do that?
You didn't have to kill that man.
What's your problem?
If you did something like that, you're no different from those men.
They're bastards, I'm not.
I'm sorry...
Thanks for helping me.
I didn't mean to help you.
They just piss me off.
So, what are we gonna do?
Don't you have a plan?
Plans always change.
What are you talking about?
They're going to kill us!
But they were...
...definitely dead.
Hey.
So, why were you in jail?
Shut up, let's go.
Something's not right with this forest.
Like what?
People are everywhere...
...but you can't hear a thing.
Nobody's here.
Yes, there are.
What makes you think that?
I've had a strong sixth sense ever since I was little.
Hey.
Hey...
Wait.
What's wrong with you?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Stay back.
This man...
What are you doing?
Hey, stop!
Don't do that!
Hey, wait!
Let that man rest in peace!
I don't believe this...
You're crazy.
Let's go.
We'll take their car.
Stop it!
Let's just go.
They must still be around here.
Something's wrong here.
That again?
I can feel it!
Those guys back there...
There is something here!
Hey...
What?
They were...
...definitely dead...
...but they came back to life.
So what?
The dead can come back to life here.
So, what are you saying?
We've...
...been here over and over...
And...
The ones we killed...
We buried them!
They are supposed to be buried right here!
Where the fuck are they now?
Where are they?
I didn't mean to...
I just...
Come!
Let go of me!
The game is over.
What are those monsters?
I thought they were your playmates.
So, do you want me to kill you?
Then you can be my next playmate!
Don't kill this one!
You have orders!
Hey, you've got the wrong man.
I don't care.
Just let the guy go.
That's why you're nothing more than a punk.
Wow.
This is getting complicated.
Hey, she's been taken away.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
That runt shot my arm and took the girl.
Jesus, the both of you!
You're both crazy!
Are you turning back now?
I'll play with you later.
So, just wait here.
You just let him go?
I'm disappointed in you.
Don't you get it?
It'll be easier if we let that guy find the girl for us.
Huh?
We'll get them both afterthey're together.
Now I see!
You're using your brain!
Keep both of them alive...
Those were his orders exactly.
Oh... too bad.
It doesn't matter anymore.
He's going to die anyway.
I'll be in charge from now on.
What?
It's all been planned, he's just coming here to die.
Don't fool with me!
What was that?
It'd be a pain in the ass if you became a monster...
...so die slowly.
Are you okay?
Yeah...
But this place is fucked up.
Nothing can stop me...
Not even those monsters...
Don't worry.
Come on, run faster!
Bastards...
Are you okay?
It hurts...
Hey...
Your hand!
They took it...
Those bastards!
Damn it!
We'll make them pay for this.
Shouldn't we report back?
No...
We'll search for them...
...and destroy them!
But...
We don't know where they are.
I know what they're thinking.
They must have taken the mountain paths instead of going down the highway.
I was trained at FBI headquarters in Langley.
I'm an expert at profiling.
An expert?
So, Expert, where in the mountains?
Don't worry.
I'll track them down.
I grew up at Yellowstone
National Park in Canada.
A natural born hunter!
A hunter?
Which way?
No!
Shut the fuck up!
What's wrong with this place?
He'll come after us.
Let me go!
This is so insane.
You...
You did all this?
It's all your fault!
Stop...
You're crazy...
Hey.
No!
What do you want?
You don't have to kill this one.
Shut up, don't preach to me.
You can't hurt people for no reason.
These days, the world is full of people who are better off dead.
That's not for you to judge.
What are you, a preacher?
Okay, fine.
Let's go.
Look, no more killing, okay?
M-My gun...
Hey, who the hell are you?
How did you get here?
I was kidnapped...
What?
I can't remember.
Huh?
I can't remember anything about what happened...
...before I got here.
What the hell are you talking about?
How about you?
Why were you in prison?
I was...
What?
You don't remember either?
I forget things easily.
So, you too...
When did you get here?
Just now.
What the hell was with those two idiots and all the monsters?
What are you up to?
Something bad.
Where are the others?
They're all dead except us.
I see.
And why are you alive?
Got a problem?
Yeah, you.
A scumbag like you should be dead.
Well, well, well, who are these scary people?
What's going on?
You're dead.
No, let's get away from here.
That was pretty good, boys and girls.
But not good enough.
Hey, baby.
You...
What are you?
If you want to kill me...
...you'll need to bring an army.
Bastard!
I'll give you power...
...in death!
It's him!
No, we have to go!
No, he is...
Please, let's go!
Hurry!
Hurts?
Human life is only an instant.
Your body will eventually rot.
Do you want to be dead?
Or eternal life?
Eternal...
Any trouble?
Yes, a little accident.
Are you okay, officer?
Don't call me officer.
Did you do it again?
You better behave yourself.
Or, you'll be joining those idiots on the mountain...
...officer.
You want to fight me?
The master of all martial arts?
The Fighter?
Okay, Fighter.
Fighter?
We don't have time for this crap.
Those criminal bastards!
Let's kill them all!
Right, Fighter.
Hey, your heart!
I'll give you this...
Help yourself!
H-Hot, hot, hot!
Mother fucker!
I'll show you the world beyond death...
What's wrong?
We should hurry!
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.
I'll tell you something...
I hate to turn my back.
We don't have time for this.
That man is dangerous...
Who the hell is he?
You know him, right?
He's...
Cut the crap already!
I don't know him at all!
Who the hell is he?
And who are you?
What does this have to do with me?
Because...
Say it!
It is your...
...destiny.
What?
You two are...
...destined to fight each other.
What are you talking about?
I've never even met him before.
You have...
What?
The Resurrection...
Stay back.
We'll talk later.
It's time.
You said something about Resurrection...
What were you talking about?
The power of returning the dead soul back to the body.
It can be used only in the Forest of Resurrection.
Now what?
The Forest of Resurrection...
Is where we are.
I don't understand.
It's him...
...he is resurrecting the dead...
...with the Power.
What are talking about?
What Resurrection?
I was able to kill them.
That's because...
Who's that?
Is this one dead too?
No, that girl's alive.
Hey, what are you?
Hey!
Please, no killing!
Because...
I thought you were going to lose.
You know what?
I never lose.
Hot, hot!
What the hell?
Stop.
Huh?
They're around here...
What?
I can smell...
Smell?
I can smell like a dog...
Like a top dog breeder.
Like a dog breeder?
I smell...
Look.
An escapee.
We have our death warrant!
Go!
Die!
What?
Dammit...
T-This way!
No, this way...
Wait, this way!
Bitch!
W-Wait a minute!
You're not a monster...
You are not a monster...
Let me talk, bitch!
Speak.
You're not a monster yet, right?
Neither are you, right?
W-Wait a minute!
Don't misunderstand me!
I was just taken here...
Bitch!
It seems like...
...we are the only survivors...
...Baby.
What's going on?
I don't know...
But we need to get out of here, that's for sure.
Hey, you want to come with me?
Why would I?
I know this forest very well.
I'd be a big help.
That's a good point.
However...
One wrong move...
...and you're dead.
I know that.
You...
You've changed.
Get up.
Hey...
You really don't remember anything?
What the hell are you talking about?
About me...
Don't you remember?
I've never seen you before.
Why...
Why did you help me then?
I told you.
I didn't mean to help.
You came after me...
...and you saved me.
You said something about my destiny...
What is going on?
I will tell you.
It's you...
You're still alive.
Impressive.
So, you caused all of this.
I knew you could survive no matter what.
I don't know you at all.
What do you want?
It's fine that you don't know me, because your soul does...
You're making things complicated.
What are you up to?
It's time.
Give me the girl and come with me.
Don't be stupid.
Hey, hey, what are you two talking about?
I don't like this at all.
This guy doesn't remember anything?
Really?
Leave us alone.
I can't do that.
I've waited...
Are you going to tell me what you're up to?
He wants me dead.
What?
I'll grant you power.
Why don't you come with me?
I'll take care of her later.
Let's talk now.
What's going on?
The girl's blood gives me power.
This is the Forest of Resurrection.
A Gate...
A portal to the other side...
Where the dead become zombies...
That was ajoke.
That was nothing compared to the real power.
A great power is hidden in this forest.
The darkness on the other side...
You need two keys to open the gate there...
One is a human sacrifice.
And the other key is...
...the one with the Blood of Resurrection.
I found them...
Five hundred years ago.
You're totally insane.
Just shut up and come with me.
I'll show you...
...the power of darkness.
You know what?
I hate being told what to do.
It's no use.
You can't kill me.
So just shut up and listen to what I have to say.
I don't want to listen.
Because you interrupted me...
...I had to wait five hundred years for her to reincarnate.
It's been a long time.
But it's okay.
I forgive you.
I've waited for her to reincarnate and mature.
I've been waiting for today.
The power of the Forest of
Resurrection and her matured blood...
...will open the gate to the other side.
I finally found you, but you were in jail.
I never expected you to be in jail.
And what's more...
You were serving a life term as a serious criminal who committed disturbing crimes.
Why...
Did you make me come here?
I like you better as a criminal now.
You used to be an awful man...
You believed in this stupid idea ofjustice, and you really made me suffer.
In the end, you did something really stupid.
But you've changed quite a bit.
That's why I brought you here.
I'll forgive what you've done in the past.
Don't let me down this time.
Why don't you get lost?
You now have the heart of a serious criminal.
How many people have you killed so far?
Forty three people as of today...
That's my little brother.
Brother?
Do you feel that?
The power of this forest...
People are born...
...live...
...and die.
The darkness after death...
...is what's real...
I'm going to open that door.
Come with me.
Follow your instincts.
What your heart really wants...
...is darkness.
I'd rather die than live with you.
Then die.
As I planned...
Get the girl.
I'd rather die that let you touch me.
I'd rather die!
Still a bitch...
That man could never save you.
Not the last time.
And not this time.
You've finished playing your role.
It looks like you'll never grow up.
I've waited...
The Forest of Resurrection...
I've returned here after so many years...
...so open the gate in exchange for her blood.
And grant me power...
Grant me the power!
Why?
How come nothing is happening?
Why is nothing happening?
My Blood of Resurrection...
...only works once.
I've already used it.
Can you wait until I reincarnate...
...again?
You...
I'll kill you!
You wanted me to kill you in a moment of anger, right?
However, you can't fool me.
I won't let you interfere with my plan.
Your blood is not good enough.
Your blood cannot open the gate.
Your blood is not enough!
You know why?
Figured it out yet?
Do you know why I brought that man here?
That's right...
He was able to resurrect with your blood.
That man's resurrected blood is the true key.
I wanted to see that expression on your face.
That face...
Hey.
You talk too much.
Here he comes...
...the last key.
It took me a while to remember.
I'm the one you want, right?
Don't touch my girl, fucking asshole!
You want to do it now?
Or...
Do you want to play?
Wait for me...
Don't worry.
I never lose.
Stay there.
Wait here.
This is between him and me.
One of us will return.
He's different now.
You might lose this time.
Maybe...
We'll see what happens...
You have to work for what you really want.
Right?
Freeze...
Freeze...
I said, freeze!
Leave the car.
What was that?
What did you say, what did you say, you runt?
I said, we're taking your car!
We are looking for escapees!
Out of my way!
So you are a Fighter.
I can tell.
Give me the car, that's all I'm saying!
Shut up, you asshole!
I'm sick of this place.
I'm really sorry.
You short-ass bitch!
Come on, get in the car!
T-That hurt!
Hey, let's go!
That was your partner!
This is not my fault!
Hey!
I've found you!
Prisoner number KSC2-303!
Give me my right hand back!
Hey, I'd have two left hands!
You can't hit me with your slow bullets!
My reflexes are...
...five hundred times faster than Mike Tyson's!
Come on!
Oops!
Just like last time...
No matter how much power you've gained, you can't beat me.
The darkside has chosen me.
I won't let you stand in my way.
I told you...
I never lose.
Listen...
What?
You came back...
...because of the forest and my blood.
If you leave this forest...
You might die.
Maybe...
But that's fine...
We'll see what happens.
I hate to be locked up in one place.
I should have been on your side.
There's nothing left to destroy in this world.
Hurry up and take me to the other side...
...brother.
Just stop it!
Sometimes, Doctor Lecter and I would talk when things got quiet enough about the science courses
I was takin' and...
Mail order courses in psychology?
- No, sir.
I don't consider psychology a science.
And neither did Doctor Lecter.
Now, Barney, while you were working at the asylum, you observed Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter... interacting.
- Eh, interacting?
Talking to one another.
- Yes... yes, it seemed to me that they...
- I can see you're eager to justify your consulting fee, but why don't we start with what you saw not what you thought about what you saw.
- Oh, Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.
Barney, give us your opinion of what you saw.
What was it between them?
Well, most of the time, Doctor Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors.
He'd just, for instance, open his eyes long enough to insult some academic who was there to look over him.
With Starling, he answered her questions. She interested him.
Uh... she intrigued him. He thought she was charming and amusing.
Mm-hm. So Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter became friendly.
- Well, in a kind of formal structure, yes.
- And he was fond of her.
Yes.
Thank you, Barney.
Thank you very much for your candor.
And keep all those wonderful items from your personal Lecter treasure trove coming.
I've enjoyed them immensely.
Mr. Verger.
- Oh, I almost forgot.
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you think, Cordell?
I think it would kill you.
How much?
- Two hundred and fifty. Thousand.
Cordell, cut a check for 250,000 dollars.
How can she sleep at a time like this?
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.
Pay attention. Here's the layout.
- I'm Officer Bolton, D.C. Police.
Yes, I can see that from your badge.
- I'm in charge here.
Officer Bolton, I'm Special Agent
Starling, and just so we don't get off on the wrong foot, let me explain why we're all here. I'm here because
I know Evelda Drumgo. I've arrested her twice on RICO warrants.
D.E.A. and A.T.F., are here for the drugs and the weapons.
You're here because our mayor wants to appear tough on drugs especially after his own cocaine conviction, and hopes he can accomplish that by having you join us here today.
- You got a smart mouth, lady.
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me continue, Officer.
All right, take a look.
Fish market backs on the water.
Across the street, ground floor is the meth lab.
Drumgo's H.I.V. Positive, she will spit and bite if she's cornered, so you should watch it. And if you the one who puts her in a patrol car you don't want to push her head down.
She'll likely have a needle in her hair. We want to take her inside the building, not out in the street.
We can get closest with the van.
If it looks good, we hit the front,
D.E.A. hits the back, D.C.P.D. backin' them up. She'll have her watchers out at least three blocks around.
They've tipped her before in time, so let's not make spectacles of ourselves.
Pretty busy today.
- I agree.
Can I please get a cup of coffee?
Did you see that?
That's a roger.
Goddamn it, it's her.
With three guys. They're all packin'.
She's carryin' something. She's got a baby. Hey, Brigham it's too crowded.
There are too many people.
I say we call it off. What do you say?
I agree. All units stand down.
Whiskey team copies.
- Burke copy.
This is Bolton. Stay on target.
- I said all units stand down. Now.
It's too late. We're movin' in.
- Bolton, he said it's off. Stand down.
She's carrying a baby. I repeat, she's carrying a baby. All units stand down.
Keep that gun down, Bolton.
Bolton! Son of a bitch!
It's a go. F.B.I.!
Hold it! Hold your fire!
Don't!
Evelda, get out of the car!
Starling, is that you?
Step away from the car!
Show me your hands.
Evelda. Please.
Show me your hands.
- How've you been?
Don't do this.
- Do what?
It's all right. It's okay.
I know, I know, baby, I know.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.
I know, it's okay. It's okay.
Friends, family, co-workers gathered here this morning at Arlington to bury B.A.T. F. Agent John Brigham, shot and killed in the line of duty Friday.
He was 40 years old. This ill-fated drug raid that claimed his life and
5 others is the latest in a seemingly endless series of incidents, beginning with Waco, Texas, in which the Justice Department and the F.B.I.
Have been questioned about their use of firepower rather than judgement.
This time it was F.B.I. Special Agent
Clarice Starling heading up the calamitous strike force. She attained some measure of celebrity 10 years ago, when she was given information by
Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter, which led to the rescue of
Catherine Martin.
However, when she returns to work later this week, she won't be so celebrated. Attorney Telford Higgins, representing one of the families of those slain, says he will file...
Cordell!
Cordell.
- Yes, sir.
Get me the Justice Department.
Agent Starling, this is John Eldridge from D.E.A. Assistant Director Noonan, of course, you know. Larkin Wayne from our Office of Internal Affairs.
Bob Sneed, A.T.F., Benny Holcombe,
Assistant to the Mayor.
And Paul Krendler. You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice unofficially, as a favor to us.
In other words, he's here and he's not here.
- So I take it you've seen the coverage in the papers and on television?
- I have nothing to do with the news.
The woman had a baby in her arms.
There are pictures.
You could see the problem, I'd think.
- Not in her arms. In a carrier across her chest. In her arms was a MAC-10.
- Look, we're here to help you.
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to do with a combative attitude.
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?
Your agency called this office to get me assigned to help you on this raid.
I tried to do that. I clearly expressed my judgement and was ignored, and now a good agent and a friend is dead.
You shot and killed 5 people out there, Agent Starling. Is that how you define good judgement?
- This raid was an ugly mess.
I ended up in a position where I had a choice of dying or shooting a woman carrying a child. I chose.
I shot her.
I killed a mother holding her child.
I regret it. I resent myself for it.
- All right, gentlemen, I'm going to call a halt to this meeting and get back to you individually by phone.
Well that was a waste of time.
You have a secret admirer, Starling.
He isn't much to look at, but he does have friends in high places. Remember Mason Verger?
Lecter's fourth victim. The rich one.
The only one that survived.
He says he has some new information on
Lecter. He'll only share it with you.
Only me? You want it seize it.
- We'd rather not.
I wasn't speaking to you, Krendler.
When I speak to you, I'll look at you.
Why would we rather not?
- The last time he called was when we took Lecter off the 10 Most Wanted
List. He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."
He said, "Hey, this is a Senate
Oversight Committee to make your life miserable." His family's political contributions may not be enough to buy a senator, but they are enough to rent them from time to time. There's no reason to go through that again if he really does have something new.
It's a good deal for you, Starling.
You can't pretend it isn't. You get to go back on a celebrated case. I'll take care of the media for your Drumgo killing. Everyone’s gonna be happy.
- I'm not happy.
Well, maybe you're incapable of being happy.
Mr. Krendler, when you're out on the street, you know you might take a bullet in the line of duty. You accept it or you get out. You live with it. What you don't expect, or accept, is taking one in the back in your boss's office for doing your job exactly as they've taught you.
That makes you unhappy.
Of course you're right, Starling.
But it doesn't really change anything.
It changes everything.
It changes me.
Miss Starling. I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.
How do you do?
- Please park down at the end.
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.
Mr. Verger, Agent Starling is here.
- Good morning, Mr. Verger.
Was that a Mustang I heard out there?
- Yes, it was.
Five-liter?
- Yes.
Fast.
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.
I... thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.
You could be useful seeing about my lunch.
I'd like to attach this microphone
To your clothing or your pillow.
Oh, by all means.
Oh, here, this should make it easier.
You know, I thank God for what happened.
It was my salvation.
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent
Starling? Do you have faith?
I was raised Lutheran.
- That's not what I asked.
This is Special Agent Starling,
5-1-4-3-6-9-0, deposing Mason Verger on March 20, sworn and attested.
Mr. Verger...
We can get to that later. I just...
- No, we can get it to now.
You see it all comes to bear.
It was a Christian camp my father founded for poor, unfortunate, cast-off little boys and girls who would do anything for a candy bar.
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know about the sex offenses. I just...
Oh, it's all right. I have immunity from the U.S. Attorney, and I have immunity from the risen Jesus.
And nobody beats the Riz.
- Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter before you assigned to him for therapy?
- What do you mean? Socially?
That is what I mean, yes, if you don't mind talking about it.
Oh, no, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
- I didn't say you should be.
No, we met conventionally.
As doctor and patient.
How did he end up at your house?
- I invited him, of course.
To my pied-a-terre.
I came to the door in my nicest fit.
I was concerned he'd be afraid of me.
But he didn't seem to be.
"Afraid of me."
That's almost funny now.
I showed him my toys, my noose set-up among other things.
It's where you sort of hang yourself but not really.
It feels good while you are... well, you know. Anyway, he said,
"Mason, would you like a popper?"
And I said, "Would I?"
And, wow, once that kicked in...
I was flying. He said, "Mason, show me how you smile to gain the confidence of a child."
When I smiled he said,
"Oh, I see how you do it."
The good doctor approached me with a piece of broken mirror.
Try this.
Try peeling off your face and feeding it to the dogs.
Try again.
No, I can still see it.
No, I'm afraid not.
"That's entertainment!"
Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that you'd received new information.
Cordell!
Where did this come from?
- Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.
Where is the package it came in?
- Good question. There was nothing written on it of interest.
Cordell, did we throw it out?
Yes, I'm afraid we did.
- Oh, dear. You think it'll help?
I hope so. I hope it'll help you catch him to help cleanse the stigma of your recent dishonor.
Thank you. I think that's all I need.
- Did you find some rapport with Doctor Lecter in your talks at the asylum?
I know I did while I was peeling.
- We exchanged infos in a civil way.
But always through the glass.
- Yes.
Isn't it funny?
- What's that?
You can look at my face but you shied when I said the name of God.
Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?
That's all there is now. It was more, but it's been picked over the years.
You know, this stuff's worth a lot of money in certain circles.
It's kind of like the cocaine that disappears around here time by time.
Hey, Barney. Remember me?
Would you agree for the record, Agent
Starling I've not been read my rights?
I have not mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.
So when you turned him over to the...
- They weren't civil to him.
And they're all dead now.
- They survived his company 3 days.
You survived him 6 years at the asylum. How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.
- Yes, it was.
Did you ever think after he escaped he might come after you?
No. He once told me that, whenever feasible, he preferred to eat rude.
Free-range rude, he called 'em.
What about you? You ever think he might come after you?
Oh... you ever think about him at all?
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it. He's always with me, like a bad habit. Do you, do you know what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings and...
Everything got thrown away when the place closed. Oh, cutbacks.
Barney, I just found out that
Doctor Lecter's signed copy of
"The Joy of Cooking" sold to a private collector for 16.000 dollars.
Whew! It was probably a fake.
- The seller's affidavit of ownership was signed Karen Phlox.
Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.
She filled out your employment application, only at the bottom she signed it Barney.
The same thing on your tax returns.
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.
I want the X-ray they shot after you broke Lecter's arm during the attack on that nurse.
And everything else you got.
We used to talk about a lot of things at night.
After the screamin’ finally died down.
We talked about you sometimes.
You want to know what he said?
Go get the X-ray.
I'm not a bad guy.
- I didn't say you were.
Doctor Chilton was a bad guy.
After your first visit, he started taping your conversations with Doctor Lecter.
These are valuable.
Go on now.
You've grieved long enough.
And what'd he say?
What'd he say about me late at night?
Well, he was talkin’ about inherited, hardwired behavior.
He was using genetics in the roller pigeons as an example. They fly way up in the air, roll over backwards in a display, fallin' toward the ground.
There are shallow rollers and there are deep rollers. But you can't breed
2 deep rollers or their young, their offspring, will roll all the way down, hit and die. Agent Starling is a deep roller, Barney. Let us hope one of her parents was not.
Surely, the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice.
Jack Crawford dangles you in front of me, then I give you a bit of help.
Do you think it's because I like to look at you and imagine how good you would taste, Clarice?
(Clarice) I don't know. Is it?
(Lecter) I've been in this room for
8 years now. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive.
What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree or even water. I want to be in a federal institution.
The Capponi correspondence goes back to the thirteenth century.
Doctor Fell might hold in his hand, his non Italian hand, a note from
Dante Alighieri himself but would he recognize it?
I think not.
Gentlemen, you have examined him in medieval Italian, and I will not deny that his language is admirable for a straniero, but is he acquainted with the personalities of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?
I think not. What if he came upon a note in the Capponi library, say, from Guido de Cavalcanti?
Would he recognize that? I think not.
They're still arguing.
Sogliato wants the job for his nephew.
But the scholars seem satisfied with the temporary guy they appointed.
- Mm.
If he's such an expert on Dante, let him lecture on Dante to the Studiolo.
Let him face them if he can.
- I look forward to it.
Let's set a date.
- Very well. On the fourteenth.
Doctor Fell? Chief Inspector
Rinaldo Pazzi of the Questura.
Commendatore. How can I be of service?
I'm sorry. I'm investigating the disappearance of your predecessor,
Signore de Bonaventura. I was...
- Predecessor implies I have the job.
Unfortunately, I don't. Not yet.
Though I am hopeful.
They are letting me look after the library. For a stipend.
Hm. Uh, the officers who first checked didn't find any sort of farewell or suicide note.
Eh, I was wondering if you...
If I happen to come across anything in the Capponi library stuffed in a drawer or book, I'll call you at once.
- Thank you.
You've been reassigned.
Pardon?
- You were on the Il Mostro case.
Yes, that's right.
- Now you're on this. This is much less grand a case, I would think.
- Well, if I thought of my work in those terms, yes, I guess I'd agree.
- A missing person.
Sorry?
- Were you unfairly dismissed from the grander case or did you deserve it?
Regarding this one, Doctor Fell are the Signore's personal effects still at the Palazzo?
- Mm-hm. Packed neatly in 4 cases with an inventory. Alas no note.
Mmh.
Well, I'll send someone over to pick them up. Thank you.
Hey, thanks.
How's it goin'? Any leads?
- Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.
How do you live with this stuff.
- Oh, God.
This is from the Guinness Book of
World records, congratulating me on being "The Female F.B.I. Agent Who
Has Shot and Killed the Most People."
Geoffrey, would you excuse me, please?
Sure.
Dear Clarice: I have followed with enthusiasm the course of your disgrace and public shaming.
My own never bothered me, except for the inconvenience of being incarcerated.
But you may lack perspective. In our discussions down in the dungeon, it was apparent to me that your father, the dead night watchman, figures largely in your value system.
To end James Gumb's career as a couturier pleased you most because you could imagine your father being pleased.
But now, alas, you're in bad odor with the F.B.I.
Do you imagine your daddy being shamed by your disgrace? Do you see him in his plain pine box, crushed by your failure?
The sorry, petty end of a promising career?
What is worst about this humiliation,
Clarice?
Is it how your failure will reflect on your mommy and daddy?
Is your worst fear that people will now and forever believe they were indeed just good old trailer camp, tornado-bait, white trash?
And that perhaps you are, too? Hm?
By the way, I couldn't help noticing on the F.B.I.'s rather dull public web site that I have been hoisted from the Bureau's archives of the common criminal and elevated to the more prestigious Ten Most Wanted list.
Is this coincidence, or are you back on the case? If so, goody goody,
'cause I need to come out of retirement and return to public life.
I imagine you sitting in a dark basement room, bent over papers and computer screens.
Is that accurate?
Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M. D.
P.S. Clearly this new assignment is not your choice.
Rather, I suppose, it is part of the bargain. But you accepted it, Clarice.
Your job is to craft my doom. So I am not sure how well I should wish you, but I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun.
Ta-ta. H.
On the letter there's one partial fingerprint, here. Not enough...
Well, I know it's him. Where he was when he wrote it is what I need.
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.
And, yes, it's linen fiber, yes, it's on the expensive side but, no, it isn't so rare that you're not gonna be able to find it in a 1000 stationery stores throughout the world. Same with the ink. And the same with the wax.
And your Las Vegas postmark, well you can check it out, but I'll bet a buck it came from a remailing service.
No. It would be the last place he'd be.
An assault on his sense of taste.
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?
I hardly see how you couldn't.
And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
- All right, then tell me how...
No. It's your turn to tell me. You don't have any more vacations to sell.
Quid pro quo, Clarice. I tell you things, you tell me things.
Not about this case. About yourself.
Quid pro quo.
Yes or no, Clarice?
Hand cream.
Raw ambergris base.
Tennessee lavender.
Trace of something else.
Fleece. Lovely.
- What's ambergris?
Ambergris is a whale product.
Alas, much as we'd like to, we'd can't import it.
Endangered Species Act.
Where isn't it illegal?
- Japan, of course. Couple of places in
Europe. You'd almost certainly find it somewhere in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam.
Maybe London.
- This bouquet was hand engineered to someone's specifications.
- Is there any way of knowing where?
Of course. We'll give you a list.
It'll be short
I need opera tickets.
- I don't think I got any on me.
It's sold out, whatever it's called.
It's the pretty young wife with the ever-open break who needs tickets.
Benetti.
- What?
Rewind it.
- I can't rewind it. I'm making a copy.
What is this?
- Security camera from a perfume-shop on Via Della Scala. F.B.I. Through
Interpol requested a copy.
Why?
- They didn't say.
They didn't say?
- No. It was actually kind of weird, like they were making a point not to say.
Are we going to the opera?
- Yes. Sorry.
Yes, we are going.
- You got tickets.
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.
Please not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.
Nowhere near the back row.
No matter what the cost.
Hannibal Lecter
Tell me, Clarice, would you want to harm those who have forced you to consider it, though?
It's perfectly okay to feel this.
It's perfectly au naturel to want to taste the enemy.
It just feels so good.
Tell me Clarice, what is your worst memory of childhood?
- Jesus, Starling!
Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?
- What you doing there in the dark?
Thinkin' about cannibalism.
- People in Justice are thinking, too.
They're thinking, what is she doing?
- Aren't you curious why he dines on his victims?
What's the point? Are you writing a book or you catching a crook?
- To show his contempt for those who exasperate him. Or sometimes to perform a public service. In the case of the flutist, Benjamin Raspail, he did it to improve the sound of the
Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra, serving the flute player's sweetbreads to the board with a nice Montrachet at seven hundred dollars a bottle.
That meal began with green oysters from the Gironde, followed by the sweetbreads, a sorbet, and then you can read here in Gourmet Cuisine:
A notable dark and glossy ragout, the constituents never determined.
I always figured him for a queer.
- Why would you say that, Paul?
Well, all this artsy-fartsy stuff.
Chamber music, tea party food.
Not that I mean anything personal if you've got a lot of sympathy.
What I came here to impress upon you,
Starling, is I better see cooperation.
There are no little fiefdoms here.
I want to be copied on every 302!
Mm-hm.
- If you work with me, then your so-called career here might improve.
If you don't, then all I have to do is draw a line through your name rather than under it and it's over.
Paul, what is it with you?
I told you to go home to your wife. That was wrong?
- Don't flatter yourself, Starling.
That was a long time ago. Why would I hold that against you? Hm?
And besides this town is full of corn-pone country pussy.
That said I wouldn't mind having a go with you right now, if you want to reconsider.
- In the gym, anytime.
No pads.
Is it went out with the regular mail?
- No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.
This was the day after your request.
I don't understand what happened.
I think you should have it by now.
I don't. Can you send me another one?
- Sure. I will make another copy.
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?
Uh, Agent Starling. I'd appreciate it.
Uh, what's your name?
Oh, my name is Franco Benetti.
- Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
Okay. So I'll send you tomorrow?
- All right. Bye-bye.
Nothin', huh?
- Oh, nothin' yet. Still waitin' on Florence and London.
(Operator) The number you have dialed is not in service at this time.
Yes? Hello?
- I have information about Lecter.
Have you shared your information with the police, sir?
I'm required to encourage you to do so.
- Uh-huh.
Is the reward payable under special circumstances?
May I suggest you contact an attorney before taking any possibly illegal action? There's one in Geneva who is excellent in these matters.
May I give you his toll-free number?
The number is:
Hello.
- I was just speaking with someone...
There's a one hundred thousand dollar advance. To qualify for the advance, a fingerprint must be provided, in situ, on an object.
Once the print has been positively, the money will be placed in escrow at
Geneve Credit Suisse and may be viewed at any time subject to 24 hour prior notification. To repeat the message in French, press two.
In Spanish press three.
In German...
Buon giorno.
Doctor Fell? It's Inspector Pazzi.
Yes, I can see you.
Come on up.
Doctor Fell?
Hello?
Doctor Fell?
Hello?
Snap.
I should have encouraged you to bring someone along. The cases are heavy.
Maybe you could help me with them.
- Hm?
Eh, just down the stairs, I mean.
Yeah. This way.
Here we are.
Is that the inventory?
- Yes.
May I see it?
- Of course.
You are a Pazzi of the
Pazzi family, I think.
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio your ancestor was hanged?
Francesco de Pazzi? Yes, thrown naked with a noose around his neck from a window writhing and kicking alongside the archbishop against the cold stone wall.
In fact, I found a very nice rendering of it here in the library the other day. If you like, perhaps I could, uh, sneak it out for you.
- I would think that might jeopardize your chances for permanent appointment to the curatorship.
Only if you told.
Remind me, what was his crime?
- He was accused of killing
Giuliano de Medici.
- Oh. Unjustly?
No. No. I don't think so.
- Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it, he was guilty. I think that would make living in Florence with the name Pazzi uncomfortable even five hundred years later.
Not really. In fact,
I can't remember the last time before today someone brought it up.
People don't always tell you what they're thinking.
They just see to it you don't advance in life.
I'm sorry, Commendatore.
I too often say what I'm thinking.
I'll be right back to help you.
You know, the room you're standing in was built in the fifteenth century.
(Pazzi) It's beautiful.
Yes, it is. Unfortunately, I think the heating system was installed about the same time.
That's a pity.
- Yes.
Okey-dokey, let's drag these down.
They must be as heavy as bodies.
Hey.
- Yeah!
How much is this?
- Fifty thousand.
I'll take it.
Gnocco.
When you go for his wallet, he'll catch you by the wrist.
I've done this a few times.
- Not like this.
If there isn't a clean print on the bracelet you'll spend the summer in a cell at the Sollicciano.
Give me the bracelet.
- Wash your fucking hands.
He's coming.
I got it.
He grabbed me just right.
Tried to hit me in the balls.
But he missed.
Let me help you.
- No, don't.
Sixteen point match, Mister Verger.
Bingo.
Pronto.
- Carlo?
Mason?
- Ciao, bello. Come stai?
Uh, oh, oh, well, well, well.
Am I coming to see you?
Oh, yes, soon, I hope.
But, uh... well, first I need you to pack off the boys. Yes, I know, the day you never thought would arrive has. Now, Cordell will fax the veterinary forms directly to
Animal and Plant Health but you need to get the vet affidavits from Sardinia.
Yeah. Va bene?
- Uh-huh, bene, bene.
Uh, how are they?
Ah, they are big, Mason. Very big.
Tommaso!
Say again?
- They are big, Mason. Really big.
Maybe two hundred and seventy kilos.
- Oh, wow!
Can you hear?
Oh, they sound fantastic!
Oh, super!
The full balance of the money is payable upon receipt of the doctor alive. Of course, you won't have to seize him yourself. Rather just point him out. In fact, it's preferable to all concerned if that's the extent of your involvement from this point.
I prefer to stay involved.
To make sure things go right.
Professionals will see to that.
- I am a professional.
You enjoy the performance?
- Oh, very much.
Um, Allegra, this is Doctor Fell, curator of the Capponi Library.
Signora Pazzi. I'm honored.
- Are you from America, Doctor?
Not originally. I've traveled there.
- I've always wanted to visit.
New England, especially.
- I've enjoyed excellent meals there.
You wrapped up in the libretto.
I thought this might amuse you.
Dante's sonnet from La Vita Nuova.
- Mm-hm. It's beautiful.
Rinaldo, look at this.
- Oh, yes, I can see.
"Joyous Love seemed to me, the while he held my heart in his hands and in his arms my lady lay asleep wrapped in a veil."
"He woke her then and trembling and obedient, she ate that burning heart out of his hand. Weeping,
I saw him then depart from me."
Doctor Fell, do you believe a man could become so obsessed with a woman from a single encounter?
- Could he daily feel a stab of hunger for her and find nourishment in the very sight of her?
I think so. But would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?
Please keep that.
Oh, I couldn't.
- I insist.
Commendatore. Allegra.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
Uh, good-bye.
- Let's get something to eat.
Of course.
- Why not?
Is that you, Doctor?
Questura. Pandolfini.
- Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi please.
Agent Starling, American F.B.I.
- All right. Eh, one moment.
Pazzi! F.B.I.
- I'm not here!
Pazzi.
- Inspector Pazzi, Agent Starling,
F.B.I. How do you do?
- I was just leaving for the day.
Can I call you back tomorrow?
- Oh, this won't take long.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for sending us the security tape.
When I say you, I mean your department.
Agent Benetti.
Is he there? Can I speak with him?
- I'm sorry, he's gone home.
Oh, that's all right. I should tell you this rather than him anyway.
I'm late for an important appointment.
- Well, the person I'm looking for,
Inspector, who was indeed shown on that tape, is Hannibal Lecter.
Who?
- Doctor Hannibal Lecter. Never heard?
Umm, uh, I'm not familiar.
- And the tape confirms that he is, or was recently, in Florence.
Oh, really?
- He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.
He's killed 14 people that we know of.
- I really have to go, Miss, uh, eh?
Starling. Just another minute. Are you sure you've never heard of him?
No, I haven't.
- I'm confused, because someone there has been accessing our private VICAP files on Doctor Lecter with some regularity on your computer.
- Everybody uses everybody's computer here. Maybe one of the detectives on
Il Mostro was looking at profiles of killers...
- I'm speaking about the computer at your home, sir. You're trying to catch him yourself, aren't you?
For the reward. I cannot warn you strongly enough against that.
He killed three policemen down in
Memphis while in custody, tearing the face off one of them, and he will kill you, too, if...
Yes?
- I want him out of Tuscany fast.
Believe me he'll be gone from the face of the Earth fast.
Feet first.
Because of his avarice and his betrayal of the Emperor’s trust
Pier della Vigna was disgraced, blinded and imprisoned.
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna on the seventh level of the Inferno, and like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging.
So Judas and Pier della Vigna are linked in Dante by the avarice he saw in them. In fact, avarice and hanging are linked in the medieval mind.
Now this was the earliest known depiction of the Crucifixion, carved on an ivory box in Gaul about
A.D. Four hundred.
It includes the death by hanging of
Judas, his face upturned to the branch that suspends him.
Here he is again on the doors of the Benevento Cathedral, this time with his bowels falling out.
Ah, Commendatore Pazzi.
- It wasn't easy, but I got this number without tellin' 'em why.
- Sorry.
Not at all. Welcome.
Please join us.
Now, in this plate from the fifteenth century edition of the Inferno,
Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a bleeding tree. I will not belabor the obvious parallel with Judas Iscariot, but Dante Alighieri needed no drawn illustration. It was his genius to make Pier della Vigna, now in hell speak in strained hisses and coughing sibilants as though he is hanging still.
Come I'altre verrem per nostre spoglie.
Ma no pero ch'alcuna sen rivesta.
Che non e giusto aver cio ch'om si toglie. Que le strascineremo, e per la mesta selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi.
Ciascuno al prun de I'ombra sua molesta.
Avarice, hanging, self-destruction.
Io fei guibbetto a me de le mie case.
I make my own home be my gallows.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your kind attention.
I'm not a scholar, but I think you've got the job.
Thank you.
- May I buy you a drink?
Fine. I'll gathering my things.
- Oh, well, take your time.
Yeah?
- Allegra, I'll be home just a little later than I said. I'm taking Doctor
Fell out for a drink. Yes.
Yeah. I can see the people coming out now.
Yes, bye, honey. My wife.
- Of course.
Oh, I should have shown them this one.
I can't imagine how I missed it.
I told you about it. It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi library.
Can you make it out?
There's a name there.
The one I told you about?
It's your ancestor, Commendatore, hanging beneath these very windows.
Francesco de Pazzi.
On a related subject,
I must confess to you
I'm giving very serious thought to eating your wife.
So I'll ask you the questions and then we'll see, all right?
Okay?
Now, was it Mason Verger you sold me to?
No, no, no.
Blink twice for yes, once for no.
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?
Yes? Good. Thank you. And are his men waiting for me outside?
Was that a single blink?
Oh, you're confused. Well, please don't be confused, because I may have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.
Have you told anyone in the Questura about me?
No, I thought not.
Have you told Allegra?
No? You sure?
I believe you.
Okey-dokey, here we go.
Okay.
Your heart is really palpitating.
Oh, it's not your heart.
Well, shall I answer it?
Pronto.
- I've spoken to your section chief.
Someday you'll thank me, or you won't.
I don't care. You'll be alive.
Inspector Pazzi?
- Is this Clarice?
Well, hello, Clarice.
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.
Is he dead?
- Did you get my note? I hope you liked the skin cream. I had it specially...
- Is he dead, Doctor Lecter?
Clarice, there's nothing in this world that I would love more than to be able to chat with you. Unfortunately, you've caught me at an awkward moment.
Please forgive me. See you around.
An old friend.
Okay, hold on.
Here we go.
I'll go around back! Cut him!
Kill him if you have to!
So, what's it to be? Bowels in or bowels out? Like Judas.
Are you confused? Then I'll decide for you, if you'll permit me.
Ciao.
Carlo!
Yes?
Good evening.
Cordell, to you, does that look like a wave good-bye or hello?
So, what do you think?
Does Lecter want to fuck her or kill her or eat her or what?
- Probably all three, though I wouldn't want to predict in what order.
Here's what I think. No matter how
Barney might want to romanticize it or make it "Beauty and the Beast".
Lecter's object, as I know from personal experience, has always been degradation and suffering, but...
Cordell, get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.
He comes in the guise of a mentor, as he did with me and her.
But it's distress that excites him.
To draw him she needs to be distressed.
To make her attractive to him, let him see her distressed.
Let the damage he sees suggest the damage he could do.
When the fox hears the rabbit scream, he comes a-runnin' but not to help.
- I don't understand.
Well, there's nothing to understand,
Paul. All you have to understand is, is what it's worth to you.
- No, no, I don't understand why she didn't turn this over. I mean, she's such a straight arrow.
She didn't turn it over because she didn't receive it. She didn't receive it because it was never sent.
It was never sent because Lecter didn't write it, because I did.
- Oh!
So, what do you think?
- You'd have been better off if you never got her out of trouble.
- Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda! I meant, what do you think about the money?
- Five.
Ha! Oh, well, let's just toss it off, like "5". Let's say it with the respect it deserves.
- Five hundred thousand dollars.
That's better. Well, will it work?
- It'll work. It won't be pretty.
What ever is?
Cocksucker.
- I've never seen this before.
Then how do you account for its being found in your office? Your basement.
How do you want me to answer that?
Let me ask you this: What possible reason might I have to withhold it?
- Perhaps because of the content.
Reads to me like a love letter.
- Has it been tested for prints?
No prints on it. Like the last one.
- Handwriting analysis?
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why the
Philistines don't understand you?
It's because you're the answer to
Samson's riddle: You are the honey in the lion." It sounds like him to me.
- Do you mean, like a homosexual?
Like a nut with a crush.
- Excuse me...
I am placing you on administrative leave till Document Analysis tells me unequivocally a mistake's been made.
You remain eligible for insurance and medical benefits. Surrender your weapons and your identification.
I want to say something. I'm entitled.
- Go ahead.
I think Verger is trying to capture
Dr. Lecter for the purposes of personal revenge. And Mr. Krendler is in collusion with him and wants the
F.B.I.'s efforts to work for Verger.
I think he is being paid to do this.
You're lucky you're not sworn here.
- Swear me! You swear, too!
Clarice, if the evidence is lacking, you'll be entitled to full reinstatement without prejudice.
If you don't do or say anything in the meantime that would make that impossible.
Relieved of field duty pending an internal affairs into the charges,
Agent Starling, began her career with an assignment to interview madman
Hannibal Lecter. Earlier today we heard comments from Justice Department spokesman Paul Krendler.
- Mr. Krendler, can you comment the decision at this morning's meeting?
- F.B.I. And Justice Department are looking carefully into the charges, and, yes, they're extremely serious.
I'd like to add a personal note.
Starling is one of the best agents that we have...
No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay.
Do you think that...
- Look, it's much too soon to condemn her. Okay?
Shh... shh... shh.
Good boy.
Ah, and this.
I think she's nice.
She's always been nice to me. Polite.
Don't you think?
- Do you know what a roller pigeon is?
Roller pigeons climb high and fast, then roll over and fall just as fast towards the earth.
There are shallow and deep rollers.
But you can't breed two deep rollers, or their young, their offspring, will roll all the way down, hit and die. Agent Starling is a deep roller.
Let's hope one of her parents was not.
Hello?
- The power on that battery is low.
I would have changed it, but I didn't want to wake you. You're gonna have to use the other one, in the charger.
Hopefully the light on it is green.
This is gonna be a long call. Even though you've been stripped of your duties, I know you wouldn't abandon them, you'll try to put on a trace.
So, we'll disconnect long enough for you to exchange the battery.
Shall we say... uh, three seconds?
Are you ready?
Yes.
- Go.
Very good.
- Thank you.
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught with a concealed, unlicensed firearm in the District of Columbia, the penalty is pretty stiff.
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.
The reason we're doing it like this, Clarice, is because
I like to watch you as we speak, with your eyes open. No, it does not excite me. It pleases me.
You have very shapely feet.
Where are we now? Call it out.
- Massachusetts Avenue.
Take it.
- I thought, to begin with, you might tell me how you're feeling.
- About what?
The masters you serve and how they've treated you. Your career, such as it is. Your life, Clarice.
- I thought we might talk about yours.
What's the next cross street?
- Capitol Street.
In 2 blocks make a left into
Union Station. Park.
My life? What is there say about mine?
I have been in a state of hibernation for some time. A little inactive.
But now I'm back home.
I'm very happy and very healthy.
You, though, it's you I'm worried about.
- I'm fine.
No, you're certainly not fine.
You fell in love with the Bureau, the institution, only to discover, after giving it everything you've got that it does not love you back. That, in fact, it resents you. Resents you more than the husband and children you gave up to it. Why is that, do you think? Why are you so resented?
- Tell me.
Tell you? God bless you.
Well, isn't it clear?
You serve the idea of order,
Clarice. They don't.
You believe in the oath you took.
They don't. You feel it is your duty to protect the sheep. They don't.
They don't like you because you're not like them. They hate you and they envy you. They're weak and unruly and believe in nothing.
- Mason Verger wants to kill you.
Turn yourself in to me, and I promise no one will hurt you.
Will you stay with me in my prison cell and hold my hand, Clarice?
We could have some fun. No, Verger doesn’t want to kill me any more than
I want to kill him. He just wants to see me suffer in an unimaginable way.
He is rather twisted, you know. Have you had the pleasure of meeting him?
I have.
- Face to face, so to speak?
Yes.
- Attractive, isn't he?
Doctor Lecter? Doctor Lecter?
Okay, back to you. I want to know what it is you think you will do now that everything in the world you've ever cared about has been taken from you.
I don't know, Doctor Lecter.
- Tell me, Clarice. Do you think you'll work as a chambermaid at a motel on Route 66, just like your mommy?
What do you think now? Are you paying attention to me, ex-Special Agent?
Are you, by any chance, trying to trace my whereabouts?
I'm being followed, Doctor Lecter.
- I know. I've seen them.
And now you're in a real dilemma, aren't you? Do you continue to try to find me, knowing that you're leading them to me?
Do you have so much faith in your abilities that you believe you could somehow simultaneously arrest me and them? It could get very messy.
Like the fish market. Hey, Clarice.
- Yeah?
What if I did it for you?
- Did what?
Harmed them, Clarice.
The ones who have harmed you.
What if I made them scream apologies?
No, I shouldn't even say it, because you'll feel, with your perfect grasp of right and wrong, that you were somehow accompli.
- Don't help me.
No of course not.
Forget I said it.
Pier.
Clarice, you were very, very warm.
You were so close.
But now you're getting colder again.
Yeah warmer again.
Well, I think I've been generous enough with you, and the clues.
You're on your own now, Clarice.
- Doctor Lecter?
Hope you like them, Clarice.
Ta-ta.
Va bene.
Get out of the way!
I know the first thing an hysteric says is, I am not an hysteric, but I am not an hysteric. I'm calm.
- I'll ask you one time. Think good.
Think about every good thing you ever did. Think about what you swore.
Two men in a van. A third driving.
Another man down. They put him in the back. I think it was Lecter. I've given you the license plate, and I'm reporting it all to you again.
- All right.
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.
I'll send someone out with, if he'll let us on the property.
- I should go, too. Deputize me.
No. You're not going.
You're going home where you'll wait for me to call and tell you what, if anything, we found.
Thank Mr. Verger for look around.
- He's always happy to see you.
Phone.
- What number, please?
Carlo.
Pier.
Hello?
- How is he?
Uh, sleeping.
- Bring him home.
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.
Pick up, Starling. There was nothing out there. I'm gonna say it again, in case you didn't hear me clearly:
You are not a law officer while you're on suspension. You're Joe Blow.
I hope, you're in the bathroom.
Hylochoerus Meinertzhageni.
Ring any bells from high school biology, Doctor?
No? Well, I could list its most conspicuous features, if that would help jog the memory.
Three pairs of incisors, one pair of elongated canines, three pairs of molars, four pairs of pre-molars, upper and lower, for a total of forty-four teeth.
The meal will begin with an hors d'oeuvre tartare.
Your feet.
The main course, the rest of you, won't be served until 7 hours later.
But during that time you'll be able to enjoy the effects of the consumed appetizer with a full-bodied saline drip.
I guess you wish now you'd, you'd fed the rest of me to the dogs.
No, Mason. No, I much prefer you the way you are.
So, dinner at eight.
You will stay for the evening's entertainment, won't you, Cordell?
If it's all right with you
I think I'd rather not.
Rather not or will not?
Your little brother must smell almost as badly as you do by now.
Hold it! Hands where I can see 'em!
- Si.
Quiet!
- Si. Vai!
What was that? Cordell, quickly!
Down on your stomach!
- Good evening, Clarice.
It's just like old times.
- Shut up.
Can you walk?
- I can try.
You look well.
- I'm gonna cut you loose.
If you touch me, I'll shoot you.
- Understood.
Do right and you'll live through this.
- Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry. This might go faster if you hand me the knife.
There was a third in the loft.
Behind me.
Cordell! Get the gun and shoot him!
- Go into the pen?
Yes!
- No. I'm staying out of this.
You're involved is what you are, in all of it. Now do it!
No.
- Yes!
Hey, Cordell! Why don't you push him in? You can always say it was me.
Cordell?
Cordell? Cordell! Cordell!
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.
Don't want any calls forwarded either, you understand? Whoever it is, they can all wait, okay?
Mary, listen, it's Fourth of July, for Christ's sakes. Thank you.
What the fuck?
Good, you brought the wine.
- Oh, God! Oh!
Yeah, we've traced your call and units will be there in about ten minutes.
If you can do it safely, then just get out of the house.
Otherwise, stay on the phone with me.
Ma'am? Are you there?
Are those shallots?
- Mm-hm. And caper berries.
Ah. That butter smells wonderful.
- Mm-hm. You feeling hungry, Paul?
Very.
What's the main course?
- Ah you should never ask.
It spoils the surprise.
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Back to bed.
- I'm hungry.
Hello, Paul.
- Paul, don't be rude.
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."
- Hello, Agent Starling.
I always wanted to watch you eat.
- What have you got in your hand?
Something to bash me over the head with? Put it on the table.
Good girl.
- Hey, that's mine.
Now sit down.
Hey, Clarice. I love the dress.
It's beautiful.
What do you think, Paul?
- Nice. Nice.
Why don't you say grace, Paul?
Me?
- Yeah.
Grace?
- Sure.
Okay. Bow your head.
Father, we thank Thee for Thy blessings and dedicate them to
Thy mercy we are about to receive.
Forgive us all, even white trash like Starling here and bring her into my service.
Amen.
Now I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have do better.
He hated women, too.
- May I have some wine, please?
No good idea. Not with the morphine.
Better you should eat some broth.
By the way, Starling, that was a job offering I worked into the blessing.
I'm going to Congress, you know.
- Are you?
Come around campaign headquarters.
You could be a office girl!
Can you type and file?
Can you take dictation?
Take this down:
Washington is full of corn-pone country pussy.
- I took it down.
You said it already.
- Paul, now you're being rude.
And I hate rude people. Drink your broth like a good boy.
Come on. Sip.
Good.
Ugh. It's not very good, buddy.
- I admit I added something to yours.
It's clashing with the cumin. But I assure you, the next is to die for.
Ah, ah, ah! Come on, Clarice.
- No.
That's a good girl. Good.
You see, the brain itself feels no pain, Clarice, if that concerns you.
For example, Paul won't miss this little piece here, which is the part of the prefrontal lobe which they say is the seat of good manners.
Your profile at the border stations has five features. I'll trade you.
Trade?
- Stop...
How does that word taste to you?
Cheap and metallic like sucking on a greasy coin?
- Who's Clarice?
Agent Starling. If you can't keep up with the dialog, don't try to join.
Me, me, Paul. I'm Starling.
- See.
Here, right here is the sac that contains the brain.
I would really like some wine!
That smells great.
- Yes. Why don't you try a piece?
I would really like some wine.
It is good.
- All right. But just a little.
Okay? No?
Given the chance, you would deny me my life, wouldn't you?
Not your life.
- My freedom. You'd take that from me.
And if you did, would they have you back, do you think? The F.B.I.?
Those people you despise almost as much as they despise you?
Would they give you a medal? Would you have it professionally framed and hang it on your wall to look at and remind you of your courage and incorruptibility?
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.
I had plans for that smart mouth, but I'm never gonna hire her, you now.
Paul?
- Paul?
Remember what I said?
If you can't be polite to our guests you have to sit at the kiddies' table.
Don't get up, Clarice.
Paul will help me clear and make the coffee.
Just think about what I said, Clarice.
Coffee.
I came halfway around the world to watch you run, Clarice.
Let me run, huh?
Tell me, Clarice would you ever say to me,
Stop? If you love me, you'd stop?
Not in a thousand years.
That's my girl.
Now that's really interesting,
Clarice. I'm really pressed for time so where's the key?
Where's the key?
Okay.
Above or below the wrist, Clarice?
This is really gonna hurt.
Show me your hands!
Identify yourself!
- I'm Clarice Starling! F.B.I.!
Hi.
- Hi. What's that?
Oh, that's caviar.
- What are those?
These are figs.
- And that?
And this?
Oh, that I don't think you would like.
- It looks good.
Oh, it is good.
- Can I have some?
You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?
- I couldn't eat what they gave me.
Nor should you. It isn't even food as I understand the definition.
Which is why I always bring my own.
So which would you like to try?
Aha.
Well, I suppose it's all right.
After all, as your mother tells you, and my mother certainly told me,
It is important, she always used to say, always to try new things.
Open up.
They come in here, they're taking American jobs from American, hard-working American...
Those fucking idiots on this thing.
But I see that another man...
Think I have something here.
There you go. Know this?
Gordy?
You look tired, man.
You look beat.
Your turn to feed Emma?
No, well, she still has that, um... ear infection.
She's still got that?
She had that at the christening.
She's still got it? Wow.
How's Wendy holding up?
Tired. Same as me.
You need anything, Gordon, you let me know, okay? I'm here.
Hang in there, man.
You're gonna be fine, all right?
Uh-huh. No.
About 15 minutes. Yeah.
Okay, all right, I'll tell him right now.
That was, uh, Bill Griggs on the phone.
He says he's getting off the ramp.
He'll be here in a minute.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
You know what?
Can I ask you a quick question?
Yeah, sure.
- When was the hospital actually closed?
- Yeah.
Yeah, because you know I'm curious, because you know they got you and you got the... the firearm on.
And it's not like people are trying to get out, right?
No, no, not out, in!
You know, kids, delinquents, homeless.
Oh, yeah, a lot of patients ended up in the streets when this place closed down.
And some of them, they come back.
I found a half a dozen squatting up there last spring.
The patients come back?
Yeah, they come back.
I mean, God knows why.
Wait till you see the place.
I mean, Jesus, I'd rather sleep in the street, personally.
- But, then, you know, I'm not nuts.
- Obviously.
- Hey, there he is.
- All right.
- Good luck, fellas.
- Thanks.
- We first in line?
- Nope.
Environmental Solutions,
American Yankees were up here last week.
Wow. What was their bid?
Under the Yankees, bid was fast and low.
But that's the way Griggs likes them.
He likes jobs fast, Gordon.
- I like them safe, though.
- But we cannot gamble with this.
Gordon, you want me to talk to him?
Phil, I know what I'm doing, okay?
Okay?
Holy shit! Look at this.
Look at this.
1871, that's when she went up, gentlemen.
We called her the "Kirkbride Building", named after Dr. Thomas Kirkbride.
Well, it's a pretty simple layout really, you know?
If you consider a giant flying bat.
You know, the main staff building in the middle, the bat body.
And slanting off to each side are these, like, giant crooked bat wings.
You know, one for female patients, the other for male, you know?
A bat.
Yeah, believe it or not, this place is listed in the national historic register.
You know, that's why I can't tear it down. I'd love to, you know?
Only one-tenth of it is salvageable.
But the land, the land is priceless.
You know, put up a Wal-Mart maybe, but the town manager wants to reclaim it, so...
Whoa! What the fuck is this?
Oh, what, are you a little scared, Phil?
This is hydrotherapy.
Used to be cutting edge.
They'd soak the nut jobs in cold water.
I guess that was a way to chill 'em out, I don't know.
Or they'd give 'em a lobotomy.
Yeah, yeah, the pre-frontal lobotomy was perfected here at Danvers.
Sounds like you've done your homework.
Well, you know, my wife Elizabeth, she's the town historian.
She likes to keep me in the know.
Hey, there's a fantastic morgue in the basement where they do the post-mortem...
Bill, Bill, could you show us the problem areas?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
- Thank you.
Feed a fucking army in here!
Well, they did.
It was a self-contained town.
Church, movie theater, bowling alley, you know?
Oh, there's a lovely cemetery up behind the machine shop.
No headstones, just numbers.
You really ought to check it out.
Watch your step here.
This will become the municipal archives, my wife's department.
It was a dining area.
Is there gonna be a lot of foot traffic?
Well, yeah, it's like a library.
All these tiles will have to go.
These are deadly.
- They're loaded with asbestos, Bill.
- Really?
You know, the other bids didn't point that out.
Oh, they should have, man. It's standard.
All right, I'm gonna take you to the female wing now. Ward C.
It'll become Administration,
Town Manager's office.
- Department of Public Works.
- In other words, your office.
You better believe it!
Okay, each wing is made of four wards.
Wards A, B, C, and D.
Ward A, which I call the wing tip, is the farthest away from the staff building.
This is where they'd keep the extreme patients.
What do you mean, extreme?
Well, psychotic.
Keep the most dangerous ones furthest away, right?
Hey, you're so smart, Phil.
Whoever said you weren't smart?
You know what they called Ward A?
The snake pit.
Now, you follow these two down, they'll take you to C.
But I wouldn't advise walking on the floors.
- There's water damage.
- How do we get over there?
Any of you guys scared of the dark? What?
Over here.
Hello, Gordon.
Gordy? It's me, man. Come on.
Survival rations.
Yeah, duck and cover, my friend.
Bend over and kiss your ass good-bye.
You know, this place was used as a fallout shelter.
To me, that is a weird idea.
All these ducts are gonna have to be wet-stripped. You see this?
Yeah.
That breaks off, dust gets into the east tunnels.
You're gonna pollinate the entire building.
Oh, Jesus, I wouldn't want that.
Believe me, you don't want that to happen.
No, you don't.
Gordon, let me lead. Hold on.
Jesus. Okay.
Yeah, this used to be a solarium.
I call it the carpet-toned room.
Well, here we are, gentlemen,
Danvers Town Hall.
Reclaiming the dark past to build a brighter future.
Something like that. Huh?
- Crocidolite.
- Crocli... what?
- Oh, Crocidolite.
- Crocidolite?
Yeah, worst kind.
This is decaying, friable.
Uh, I'd say circa 1940s.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So, what's the deal, then?
Well, if I were you, Bill, I would...
I'd seal off the whole area.
Full poly, a couple of neg air machines, decon showers, the whole bit.
You know, OSHA won't let me start until you guys clean her up, and I got to get construction crews in here by Columbus Day. So...
You got a guesstimate on how long?
Roughly? Ballpark? What?
These rooms, game room, tunnels,
I would say...
Three weeks, minimum.
Three weeks.
Two. Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
Yeah.
You guys Mack and Myer for Hire?
What is it? Three or two?
Two. Two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- He's the captain, right?
You better believe it.
Well, I guess you guys have seen enough, huh? Need anything else?
- No.
- All right.
- What's all this, Bill?
- Ah, they're punks.
Little motherfuckers come in, and they get high, boot scag, shoot guns.
- Destructive little bastards.
- Shoot guns... at what? At what?
Well, hopefully, each other.
- Hey Bill.
- What?
What is this?
Hey, Phil, what, are you checking in?
Don't go in there without your bathing suit.
Oh, yeah, this is... this is seclusion.
That's what they called the patients' rooms back then, seclusions.
It's some part of some therapy that was big in the '70s.
All these cut-outs and... stuff.
You know, art therapy, creative expression.
You know, it helped them with their... you know, like, self-esteem.
Yeah.
Helped them feel good about themselves and more at home. It was creepy, huh?
Shades of your childhood, huh?
Yeah, there's a picture of me at summer camp somewhere up here.
Huh. Wow.
What do you think was wrong with this one?
I don't know.
Watch out for the broken glass here.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, I got a little time.
You want to check out that cemetery?
- 750 bodies buried there. It's like...
- Gentlemen, I'm... I'm sorry.
- What, Phil?
- I left a bag. I got to go back.
- Oh, you know where you're going?
- Yeah, middle of the bat wing, right?
You got it.
- Okay, I'll see you down here.
- I'll be out!
- Gum?
- No, thanks, man.
You know, I don't think I ever congratulated you and Wendy on your new addition.
Ah, thanks man. Thanks!
You know, I know how long you both...
Well, you know, we're just so happy for you and Elizabeth.
- You wanna see her?
- Oh, yeah. Bring a picture?
- I'll show you my baby.
- Aww.
Aww.
- Yeah?
- Isn't she just a doll.
- Emma.
- Oh, yeah!
Listen, I'll match Yankee's bid.
Well, this isn't how we normally do the bidding process.
I mean, the deadline's Friday, paperwork on my desk...
I know, I know. We'll be in on Monday, and we'll be out the following Monday.
- I thought you said two weeks.
- One week. I'll do it in one week.
I've got four really good guys.
I'll hire another guy.
One week, we're gone.
- One week?
- One week.
- That's fast.
- Uh-huh.
I'm good for it. You know I'm good for it.
I need the job.
I really need this job.
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Genny is up and running, sir.
- Take the mask off, Hank.
- Are the ACO levels safe, sir?
Take it off, dickhead.
Here's what I want you to do, okay?
I want you to go down to the tunnel, hang up those glove bags.
Tag those ducts we looked at this morning.
Use the green slime.
You mean red, right?
Those ducts are hazards, Gordo.
- What?
- Red, right?
Yeah, red.
Hey ya, Phil. Amy says hi.
Keep it up, dickhead.
Don't shoot the messenger, Phil.
I'm just relaying information.
She says to me this morning, while we're laying in bed, to say hi to you.
Keep it up.
Yeah, I got it. That's the problem, right?
So dude, how long have you been working with my Uncle Gordon?
- Five whole years.
- All right.
Was he a slave driver or what?
Well, Gordon's a very reasonable man. I'm the slave driver.
Got a couple of rules though.
Safety first, get the job done, second.
And, uh, no drugs on the job, dude.
- Woo-hoo!
- What the hell is that?
So, Mike, you gonna show me the ropes?
- This the new guy?
- They call it Jeff.
It's Gordon's nephew.
- Mikey didn't tell you about these?
- What?
- You can't use these.
- Why not?
Rule one, music creates sonic vibrations.
Vibrations jiggle spooge dust into the air.
Gets into the air, it gets into your lungs.
This the kind of music you plan on listening to here, buddy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. You trying to kill us all?
Put it away or play something else, man.
Like Yanni or John Tesh or something, all right?
I'll see you guys at lunch.
I'm going down deep.
Later.
Who's Yanni?
You know, Gordo, you finally landed us the perfect gig.
Next time someone says what we do is crazy, you just say, "Yeah, well, we work in an insane asylum."
You might actually want to be grateful, my man.
You're about to make some decent money.
Yeah, what? Five bucks an hour?
- You didn't tell him?
- You tell him.
Okay. $10,000 bonus.
Gordon arranged it with the town.
What's the catch?
We got to finish by the 13th.
The 13th? As in what, this Monday?
Come on, Gordo, you know this is at least a two-week job.
That's exactly right.
So, we're gonna work our asses off.
So, what is it? Ten G's each?
If you don't like it Henry, I'll give you a ride to the airport right now.
Let it go, Phil.
What about Amy?
You gonna take Amy to the airport?
She likes to travel.
- I know she likes to travel...
- Hank!
Hey, guys! I got your keys for the gate.
Thanks, man.
So, what do you think, huh?
Fifteen years really does a number on a place.
You know, it's hard to believe there used to be over 2,400 patients here at one point.
Yeah, so why'd they close this place down?
Nearly all these places got closed down in the '80s.
Ya know, the budget cuts.
The Feds called it Deinstitutionalization.
So, they just dumped the people on the street?
Some. Some went to, like, homecare-type programs.
So, the loonies are outside in the real world, and here we are with the keys to the loony bin, boys.
Well, it wasn't just the budget cuts, you know.
What was it, then, Mike?
Patricia Willard scandal, 1984.
Patricia Willard?
I don't recall that.
Patricia Willard, she was committed here in the 1970s by her parents.
Manic depression, that sort of thing.
Typical adolescent crap.
But in the 1980s, this new kind of therapy took off,
Repressed Memory Therapy.
See, the shrinks figured that with these new techniques they designed, they could release... hidden memories of traumatic events in your life: rape, incest.
So Patricia, with the help of her doctors, recalls that when she was 10, her father raped her.
But not once, right?
No, he'd do it three times a week.
And he didn't just rape her.
He came into her room at night wearing a black robe.
He'd take her and drive her to a wooded area where her grandparents and her mother were.
And they'd all have black robes on.
They'd take them off, and group orgies would ensue.
And then they bring out the newborn.
She was forced to watch, as her mother would cut this baby's heart out with a stone dagger.
She'd drink the blood, others would eat the flesh.
Her grandfather and father would fuck her repeatedly.
She was forced to have abortions, and they'd cook the aborted fetuses.
- Enough!
- Huh?
- This happened here?
- Oh, yeah. Everywhere.
Satanic Ritual Abuse Syndrome was big in the '80s.
Destroyed a lot of families.
Patricia was ready to sue hers.
It was all set to go to trial, and...
- What?
- She dropped the suit.
Why?
Well, her parents discovered a physical examination she'd undergone about a year prior.
Turns out she was a virgin.
None of it happened.
So the family countersues. They win.
That, and the budget cuts.
And... poof.
- So, Mike, is that story true?
- Yeah.
How do you know all that stuff, man?
My dad was a lawyer. He was on the case.
Aw, come on, Mike, don't be so humble.
His dad's the state attorney general, so you better watch your ass there, buddy.
Hank, leave it alone, will ya.
You were supposed to carry the torch too, right? Tufts Law School?
Hank, drop it.
What were you on there again, Mike?
The one-year plan?
- Need help with that?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Jesus!
- Tough weekend, boss?
No, I think I pulled a muscle or something.
Mike and I called you Saturday night to take you out to Molly's for a beer over the winning bid.
Aw, cheers, man, sorry and all.
I was trying to catch up on some sleep.
- Baby still got that ear thing?
- Oh, yeah.
- So, Gordy, if we don't make Monday...
- Oh, Griggs likes jobs done fast.
No, I understand that.
But if we lose this bonus?
We won't lose the bonus.
Listen, man, I know where this is leading, but, believe me, Jeff is young, okay, but he's not as stupid as he looks.
I'm not talking about Jeff.
We ran into Craig McManus on Saturday night.
I told him about the job, about the bonus.
He would leave Yankee and work for us in a second.
Now, he has more experience than Hank, and he gives a shit.
Phil, your job here is to keep things on track and to eliminate obstacles.
And that's what I'm trying to do, is to eliminate an obstacle.
Jesus, man. We're talking about Hank here.
Now, listen, if I thought he was a liability, I'd let you sack him.
As it happens, he's not.
- And I don't agree.
- I don't care!
Now, let's finish the decon chamber.
Jesus, Phil.
Fine.
- All right. All right.
- Let's go, turn right, turn right.
Now, when you get it straight, you gotta bring the nose down.
Bring... Don't look at me. Look...
What are you, a lobotomy case?
- Fuck you, man! I got it!
- Put the nose down!
Turn around! Jesus!
- Nice job, Jeff!
- That wasn't me, man.
- Yeah.
- Fuck you, dude.
- Just, just wait there.
- What?
Just... hang on.
What the hell?
Huh?
Okay, go down and check the breaker box.
No, I can't do that.
Why?
I got nyctophobia.
- What?
- Fear of the dark.
Okay. I'll go check the breaker box.
You... just try not to break anything, okay, mullet head?
Thanks, man.
Oh, damn!
Goddamn!
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Good first day, Gordo.
- Hm-mm.
Listen, Mike needs another hour.
The genny carburetor's acting up.
Okay, but listen, I don't want anyone hanging around this place after dark.
Okay. No problem.
Good first day, guys.
It keeps up like this, we'll all be dead by Monday.
Hey, fuck you, Phil!
See you in the morning.
I know this is difficult, Mary.
And that's why we're here to help, okay?
I miss Peter.
I miss him so much!
Mary, I want you to try to remember what happened 22 years ago.
On Christmas night in Lowell.
That's where we grew up.
Yes. Can you tell me what happened that night in Lowell?
- Nothing happened!
- Mary, something did happen.
That's why we have these sessions, to help you remember, so you can get better, okay?
No. No, I can't remember.
File note. Patient is showing extreme agitation.
She is putting her fingers in her mouth.
Mary... Mary?
Will you share a doll, Mr. Doctor?
Who am I speaking with?
Mary got a china doll from her mommy.
And we can't find it now.
No, Princess, I haven't seen it.
Maybe Billy knows where your china doll is.
Silly Billy!
Princess, tell me what happened on Christmas 22 years ago in Lowell.
We got presents.
Mary got a pretty china doll, and Peter got a big old knife.
Then what happened?
Mary's mommy and daddy went to sleep.
And then we played upstairs.
Peter turned off the lights and hid.
And Mary tried to find him.
Who played upstairs, Princess?
Mary and Peter, and me and Billy, silly!
Has Billy told you what happened next?
Billy only tells me nice things, Mr. Doctor.
Like, that I'm pretty.
Princess, was Simon there that night?
Simon?
Ooh, I don't know any Simon.
Billy's never told you about Simon?
No.
I'm tired, Mr. Doctor.
Maybe Billy would like to talk now.
Billy's asleep, Mr. Doctor.
He's asleep.
You can hear me.
Genny's gassed up and running, sir.
Very good. Make sure she stays that way.
I don't want her dying on us.
Put your mask on, Princess.
Fuck off. I'm not your princess, dude.
What?
So, what's up with Phil and Hank?
What's up with Phil and Hank?
Hank stole Phil's girlfriend.
It's a nightmare.
You don't want to get involved.
You especially don't want to get on Phil's bad side.
He'll give you the grunt work, all right?
1883. Fuck, yeah!
Free at last! Free at last!
Yo, Henry, come back.
Hank? Come back!
Uh, yeah, yeah, Hank here.
I want you with Jeff and Mike after lunch, so bring your gear up.
Yeah, all right. Hank out.
Gordo!
Got your wallet.
Nice grab. Okay, ladies, time to thank Uncle Gordy for lunch.
Thanks, Uncle Gordon!
Your turn tomorrow, Hank. Where's Mike?
The equipment room, looking for those lost cartridges.
Jesus, Phil!
I told you, I didn't want anyone wandering around here by themselves!
Okay, boss. It won't happen again, okay?
Do you got my scratch tickets?
Yeah, I got 'em right here, Bubba.
I'm comin'.
Let's see, Hank, your scratch tickets.
There you go. There's one.
Oh, Phil, these are Jubilee.
You know I play Blackjack.
- Yeah, here's one for you, too.
- Hey, Phil... fuck you!
Mike, come in.
I can't talk anymore. I am too tired.
It appears Miss Hobbes is now entering a dissociative state, rubbing her eyes, appears to be switching to an alternate personality.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- Mary?
- Hello, sir.
Well, hello, Billy. How have you been?
Never better, sir.
Billy, where does the Princess live?
- In the tongue.
- Why the tongue?
Because she's always talking, sir.
And where do you live, Billy?
I live in the eyes. You know that.
Remind me, though. Why the eyes?
Because I see everything, sir.
And where does Simon live, Billy?
Where does Simon live?
Hey, what's mortified pride?
Says here, three patients were committed in 1889 because of mortified pride.
Let me see that.
1889. Where'd you get this?
Under some boxes, man.
It's fucking intense, some of the shit...
When Phil calls lunch, it means lunch. Understood?
Sorry, no cartridges. I gotta go pick some up at Grossman's.
Listen to this.
17 were committed due to disappointed expectations.
Henry, they're talking about you.
They would've committed your ass back then.
Hey, what do you have to do now to get committed?
Mortify someone's pride?
Simple.
You kill someone.
Nah, that won't get you committed.
But it'll get you in jail.
If you get caught.
John Hinkley, temporary insanity.
He's not in jail. He's in a nut house.
Right, Mike?
That defense never works.
Most people are cognizant of their actions when they murder.
Homicide implies a motive.
Oh... God, Mike.
How did you fail law school? You're good.
Yeah, what are you, dude? A lobotomy case?
Jeff, come on, man.
- Hey! Hey!
- Mike!
- Mike!
- Mike.
C'mon, I'm just fucking around, Gordo.
- Don't hurt him!
- It's all right.
The Ice Pick method.
Insert a thin metal pipette into the orbital frontal cortex and enter the soft tissue of the frontal lobe.
A few simple smooth, up and down jerks to sever the lateral hypothalamus.
All resulting in a rapid reduction of stress for our little patient here.
Total time elapsed, two minutes.
Only side effect?
Black eye. Recommended treatment...
Sunglasses.
Brilliant! Very good.
All right. Let's go back to work. Come on.
I wasn't kidding back there, man.
You're smarter than this crap job.
You should be using your head, buddy.
Yeah, um, I gotta get a part from Gordon's van.
Make sure mullet head here knows how to operate that thing.
Hey, Mike, come on, don't forget this.
- You know how to ride a lawn mower?
- Yeah.
Oh, then, you're golden.
Basically the same thing.
So, I don't know.
Just push it in to that mid section there and just start over there, all right?
I'm gonna take a smoke break.
We just had a break.
Hey, Jeff!
- What's up?
- You know what a whale is?
Yeah, I know what a whale is.
A whale is a big time gambler.
I got this buddy, right, he deals out at Foxwoods.
12 hours, and this whale has the house down 300 grand, right?
As this guy's leaving, takes his car keys, and drops them in my friend's pocket.
- You know what they're for?
- What?
Porsche 911.
It's true, man, and that was the tip.
Fucking tip!
What's your point?
Just have an exit plan, dude.
If you stick with this job too long, it will mess you up, man.
It gets inside of you... the stress.
You see?
Already an itty bitty piece of this shit may have gotten into your lungs, man.
It incubates in your lungs, and tissue begins to grow around it like a... like a pearl.
Like a time bomb.
Time you hit 30... Boom!
You're drowning in your own lung fluid.
Look at you, you're not even wearing your mask now.
- Hey, where's your mask?
- Me? Nah...
Nah, buddy,
I've learned to sublimate my fear.
'Cause I got a fuckin' exit plan, man.
I have a way of dealing with the stress.
You think Mikey reads all those books for fun?
Nah, man, he's got an exit plan, let me tell you.
If stress gets too intense on this job, he'll bolt.
He's gonna go back, finish law school, pass the bar, get the big, juicy cases, make his dad proud.
That's his exit plan.
Phil, Jesus...
Phil's got his stress reducer.
He's got his plan. I'm sure he'll tell you about it someday.
Then there's Uncle Gordo.
Hey, did you know if he didn't get this gig, he'd have to fold H.E.C.?
Yep. Man, he can't even have an exit plan.
Fiber has always been his life.
It was over there. It is here.
Imagine that stress.
Hey, let me tell you something, buddy, you better hope, hope, you got some of Gordo's genes, though. 'Cause Gordo...
Jesus, Gordo is the Zen master of calm.
I've never seen old Gordo lose it.
I don't know, though, man.
The last few months, Gordo,
I'm seein' some cracks.
Ya know, I worry.
Mikey knows what I'm talking about, right, Mikey?
He does have the new baby, ya know.
It should be the joy of his life, dude.
Hank, when you and Amy have a kid, you'll see how hard it is.
Me and Amy? A kid with Amy?
Nah, I just fuck her to beat on Phil.
Hey, get off your ass. I want my bonus.
Hi, Wendy?
I know, but we need to talk.
Because we have to.
Would you let me finish?
Would you...? Hello?
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Let's do this thing.
Silver.
Yeah, baby, gold, gold.
Fucking eyeballs. Jesus Christ!
They ought to be worth something.
All right.
Yeah, baby, check that out.
What the fuck is that?
God!
Fucking birds!
Jesus.
Oh, damn.
So what's the verdict?
I'm getting nothing here.
He's not even left his answering machine on.
You a...
- You try Amy's yet?
- Do you know her number?
Okay, I'll try information.
No, fuck, give me the phone.
Huh?
I know the number, Gordon.
Give me the phone!
Thank you.
Hi! Hi, it's me. Yeah, uh...
Wait... Wait a second. What?
What are you talking about?
When? When? Slow down.
When did this happen?
Really?
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no.
You hang in there. I'll call you back.
Well, our favorite piece of shit, Hank, went to Amy's last night, packed his car, told her that he found his meal ticket, and then bolted to Miami to Casino School.
That lucky fuck! And he probably scored on a scratch or something.
I warned her, didn't I?
I fucking warned this bitch, didn't I?
She said that he left without saying anything?
Gordon, it's Hank.
He's totally unreliable.
Mike, call McManus. Call Craig.
See if he's still available.
Gordy?
Gordy, this is a blessing.
We replace this asshole, and we move forward.
What's the problem?
Something's not right here. Some...
What's the matter?
Who are those two guys you were talking to yesterday?
- What guys?
- I saw ya.
- Now, what were you talking about?
- What is this?
I'm asking you a question.
What were you talking about?
Okay.
Okay.
- Are you questioning my performance?
- I don't know. Should I be?
- Mike, call McManus.
- Don't walk away from me!
Don't ever walk away from me!
You gonna hit me?
You think I'm doing a bad job, Mike?
No, you're doing fine.
This used to be a great deal.
Steady gigs, joking around, beers after work.
Hey, look! It says here, eight were committed for uncontrolled passion.
Then Emma came.
Don't look at me like that, man.
You know it's why we lost the last two gigs.
He's tired, and he overbid.
- Gordon loves being a father.
- Yeah, now he does, now he loves it.
But it was never in his heart.
This was Wendy's idea.
Look, Phil...
Just 'cause you say you don't want something, it doesn't mean you don't want it.
Now, six years ago I didn't want to be a lawyer, but now I'm thinkin' I might...
Wait! Wait! Who the fuck are you kidding?
You shuck fiber with us, in there, okay?
Look... That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about... fatherhood is screwing this guy's head up, and it's fucking his job up.
At the very least, Mike, he should've canned
Hank's ass six months ago, and you know it.
What are you looking at?
Where you going, Mike?
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You got 25!
Hello, Wendy?
Can we talk?
Wendy?
I wanna ask you something.
Can you forgive me?
Uncle Gordon!
Wendy?
Hello?
Gordon?
- Sorry.
- Hey, man.
I didn't see you on the phone.
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Thanks.
I just... I just came to...
Thank you for giving me this job, you know?
I mean, I want to let you know
I'll bust my ass for you, okay?
I know that. I know that.
So, don't stress out, all right?
Things will work out.
I'm here for you, and I'm gonna bust my ass, all right?
Yeah.
- Family, man.
- Yeah.
- So, was that Aunt Wendy?
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?
- She's good.
She's, uh... tired, you know?
It's when...
- Kids tire you out sometimes.
- Yeah, no, I know.
My dad's got the photos back from the christening.
Yeah?
- Emma looks pretty pissed off.
- Yeah, she's pretty pissed.
Why are you crying, Mary?
I miss my family.
How come they don't visit, Doctor?
Mary, can you tell me how you got those scars on your chest?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I fell off my bike when I was a girl.
Is that what you remember, Mary?
Yes!
Now, can you tell me who the Princess is?
- No idea.
- And who Billy is?
I don't know anyone named Billy.
- Who is Simon, Mary?
- I have no idea who Simon is!
- I am sick of this!
- Mary, calm down.
- I just want to go back to my room!
- Mary?
Mary?
Mary is asleep, sir.
Billy, why won't you tell me what happened in Lowell.
I know you saw what happened.
You know perfectly well what happened, sir.
But Mary needs to know what happened, Billy.
- She needs to remember.
- No!
Well, then, maybe Simon would like to tell me what happened.
- He's asleep.
- Help me wake Simon.
- No!
- We must wake up Simon.
- I won't... scared!
- Billy, we have to wake up Simon.
You should take a shower, Gordon.
You shouldn't go home with that shit on you, man.
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?
You mean, besides coming to work for you?
Uh... I would have to say...
I would have to say introducing Hank to Amy.
That was pretty fucking stupid.
I wish I had that one back.
I wish I had that one back.
I hit Wendy.
What?
It was Friday night. I wanted to celebrate getting this job.
I had the flowers. I had the champagne.
I went into the kitchen.
She was cooking pasta.
I wanted to kiss her.
She turned around, and before I knew it, there's a pot of boiling water all over my leg.
I don't know if it was the dog barking,
I don't know if it was Emma crying, but I slapped her.
I hit my wife.
I love my wife.
It was an accident.
But I slapped her for it.
I've tried to talk to her on the phone, but she wouldn't listen.
Where are you staying?
A motel.
You don't tell the other guys about this.
Oh, come on, man.
You were right about Craig.
You should give him a call.
You know, uh, they, uh, those kids, the other day...
I had a conversation with those fuckin' graffiti artists, and they will not be coming back our way again.
I spoke to 'em, I said, "If I see you again, I'm calling Security," so...
Anyway, so, that's taken care of, all right?
Okay.
Hang in there.
Take a shower.
Get that shit off of you.
Hello, Gordon.
Do you know who I am?
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Not here, Gordon. Later.
Watch out!
Do it, Gordon!
Hey.
- You're up early.
- Yeah.
Guess I wasn't the only one who couldn't sleep.
I got, uh, I got Craig coming in tomorrow. Okay?
You okay?
I want to go home.
I'm gonna go inside.
Okay?
I gotta go.
It's gonna get ugly.
Ah, Jesus Christ!
- Jeff, what did you do?
- It wasn't me, man!
I'm gonna go check the breakers.
Mike!
- What?
- Take a break with me.
- I can't. I gotta go check the breakers.
- Let the kid do it.
Well, the kid can't. He's got nyctophobia.
Mike.
Okay, all right.
Fuck.
- We got a problem.
- What?
We have a problem, and I want you to know that this is not easy for me.
Look at me. This is not easy for me, do you understand?
All right.
- We need to talk about Gordon.
- What about him?
He needs to take some time off, Mike.
- Why?
- Because he's becoming a liability.
I.. Phil, look, I can see why you're a little paranoid.
Can ya? Do you know that he hit his wife?
He hit Wendy, Mike.
Now, I've got Craig coming over tomorrow.
If Griggs hears about this, you understand what that means, right?
You want to lose this gig?
You want to lose the bonus?
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
So, what do we do?
Okay, you listen to me.
You follow my lead.
You let me handle this, okay?
I don't give a shit what happens.
Fuck! I'm in charge now.
So, what did he say?
It think it might happen Saturday.
I don't...
Hey.
We were just talking about your nephew.
And how he's coming along.
That sort of thing.
And how's he coming along?
Hank?
Yo, dude, hello!
Hank!
You're in some deep shit, you know that?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
Everyone thinks you're in Miami at that Casino School.
Fucking Gordon and Phil want your head, man!
So, dude, did you score on a scratch, or what?
What are you doing here?
Listen, I forgot something. I'll be back.
You know, um, he just needs a little motivation.
- That's... pretty much it.
- Yeah.
What do you think, Phil?
Same, I think he's a little slow.
But, uh...
With Hank gone and Craig coming on, we'll pick up the slack.
I mean, I'll motivate him... the little mullet head.
He may be party in the back, but I'll make sure he's business in the front.
- What time is it?
- I think it's noon. About noon.
- Lunch time.
- Yeah.
Want to place the order?
Yeah. Yeah, sure, sure.
I think it's Phil's turn, though, right, Phil?
- Fuck it, Mike. Let's flip for it.
- What?
- Let's flip for it.
- Where'd you get that?
Found it. It might even be worth something, too. You ready?
- You found it?
- Yep.
Call it in the air. Heads or tails?
Heads.
Tails. Get going, loser.
What?
- What?
- Hey, Uncle!
Gordon?
- I found Hank!
- Gordon?
What do you want, Jeff?
I found Hank.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I just found Hank... in the stairwell.
He was just standing there.
Don't be a fucking idiot, okay?
I'm not a fucking idiot!
I swear to God, I saw him!
If he's in Miami, Jeff, why would he be here?
How could that be possible, Jeff?
I don't know, but I saw him!
You know what?
Go back to work, we'll bring you lunch.
Where was he, Jeff?
In the staircase, next to the equipment room.
Wait... wait a minute. You believe him?
You believe this punk, Gordon?
Gordon! Oh, for Christ's sakes, Mike!
This is so goddamn ridiculous! Gordon!
- If he's in Miami, why would he be here?
- Ask him yourself, Phillie. Right up there.
We're gonna do that, Jeff.
We're gonna do that, my man.
That's what we're doing, man.
That's where I'm taking you.
We're gonna do that.
- I'm telling you, he's up there.
- Where is he?
He was standing right there.
It's fucking weird, but he's right here.
I'm telling you. He's right...
Right over where, Jeff?
I swear he was. I'm not lying.
Why would I make this up?
Nice going... Jeff.
Okay, listen to me guys, now.
You heard me on the phone with Amy.
Am I right? She said Hank went to where? Miami! Okay?
Now, we heard it, we all heard it, right?
No... no, we didn't.
What?
- I want to go to lunch.
- No, you stay where you are.
What are you saying, Gordon?
You told us that's what she said, but we didn't hear her say it.
We saw you on the phone, we heard you on the phone, we didn't hear Amy.
Right, so what you're saying to me is that it wasn't Amy on the phone?
Is that what... Mike, now, come on, man.
This is what I'm talking to you about.
- Mike. Mike, give me that cell phone.
- Why?
'Cause I want to talk to Amy.
What? I spoke to Amy.
You don't need to speak to Amy.
- Give me the cell phone.
- Don't give him the fuckin' cell phone.
- Give me the cell phone.
- Mike, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Give me the cell phone.
- He's losing it, man.
Mike, give me the cell phone!
This is what I'm telling you.
He's losing it, man!
- Look at him! He's losing it, man!
- Give me the fuckin' cell phone!
- What the fuck was that?
- It's Hank!
It's Hank!
Okay, okay. Jeff, Mike, go downstairs.
Make sure he doesn't come around.
- You, you come with me.
- Hey! Fuck you!
You come with me. Let's go.
- Mike!
- Come on, Jeff.
- Oh, wait, you heard him go that way.
- Take the tunnels. They're safer.
Safer?
Gordo, this could be anybody.
Could be squatters, could be kids.
Come on, Phil, slow down, man.
He's not fucking down here.
God!
Hey, Gordo, did you hear that?
I thought I heard something down there, in the tunnels. Did ya hear it?
No. No, it's this way.
Gordo, I'm going down in the tunnels, all right? You follow up top.
Mike! Mike, we stick to...
Fuck this.
What the fuck, Phil? Man, slow down.
- So fucking stupid! Why?
- Shh! Shh!
- I don't hear anything.
- Shh! Shh!
Give me your torch.
This is fucking dumb.
He's not gonna be down there.
Shut up! I want you to stay right there.
You see or hear anything, you call me.
You understand me?
- I left my walkie in the van!
- Stay there!
- Phil, wait!
- What, Jeff?
When I saw Hank,
I think he had blood on his hand.
Stay there.
And, Billy, you understand that you, the Princess and Simon are all in Mary?
Yes, sir.
And if Mary is sick, then, you are sick, too. All of you.
Yes, sir.
You want Mary to get better, right, Billy?
- Yes!
- So, help her, Billy.
Tell me about that night in Lowell, Billy.
We were playing hide n' seek, sir.
Mary was looking at her new doll, and she was looking for Peter.
It was real dark.
Phil?
No, I won't tell!
Mary's a good girl!
She doesn't need to know!
- What?
- What Simon did!
To who, Billy? To who?
To Peter!
- What did Simon do to Peter, Billy?
- I won't do it!
Tell me, so that we can make Mary...
Fuck!
Gordon.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Billy, I need to talk to Simon.
He made me do it. It was awful.
- Billy, wait.
- It was awful. No!
What are you doing here?
- We need to wake up Simon.
- No, it's too awful!
Wake up Simon.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Phil. Phil, I think I found Hank.
What are you doing here?
Gordon, come back.
Gordon, come back.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- Ward A. Third floor.
- I'm coming.
Hello, doc.
Simon?
You know who I am?
Billy has told me a lot about you.
Billy is a smart boy.
What happened on Christmas night in Lowell?
Use your imagination.
I'd rather you tell me, Simon.
Peter was naughty, doc.
What did Peter do?
He shouldn't have done it, doc.
Tell me, Simon.
He scared Mary, doc.
He crept up behind her in the dark.
And he scared her.
Mary fell down, doc.
She fell on her doll.
It cut her up, doc.
It cut her up real bad.
She needed someone to help her.
So I introduced myself.
Hello, Mary.
And I told her to cut up Peter, doc.
Do it, Mary.
To cut him up real bad.
Good thing his knife was brand-new.
Real sharp.
And then, just so her mommy and daddy wouldn't get mad...
...I told her to cut them up, too.
Do it.
There was a lot of blood, doc.
So much blood.
But Mary wanted to do it.
Do it, Mary!
So she did it.
Gordon, come back, please.
Who is that?
Gordon, it's Jeff. I'm by the van.
I'm sorry, man. I was freaking out.
The lights went out.
I got these in the van. Is that okay?
Come back.
Come back.
This is Gordon.
We found the one...
The one responsible.
You've got to be kidding me.
Freaking beautiful.
Gordon!
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Phil?
McManus is here. Where are you guys?
Phil?
I mean... I mean...
He was a liability.
Who did this?
Well...
I mean... He brought it on himself.
Didn't he? I mean, it's typical...
Typical Henry.
Wrong place at the wrong time.
You did this.
Gordon.
I need you to wake up... and take... a really... really... good look at him.
Oh, Jesus.
What are you doing here?
It's okay, Hank. Hank, it's okay, it's me.
You hang in there, brother.
You hang in there.
We'll try and get you some help, okay?
You know what I wouldn't do?
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.
Because if they find out about Hank, they're gonna find out about the others.
You did this.
What are you...?
What are you doing here? Huh?
You got those guys, didn't ya?
You hired those guys to do this?
Gordy, you are asleep.
- You hired those guys to kill him.
- You're asleep.
- Where are the others?
- Open your eyes.
- Where are they?
- You've got to wake up.
- You tell me where they are.
- Would you wake up?
- Tell me.
- Would you wake up?
I am fucking awake!
Hey! Gordon!
Who you talking to, man?
Gordon?
I'm a little confused here, man.
What's, uh... Hey, what is it?
Hey, Gordon!
No!
No!
Do it, Gordon!
What are you doing here?
Why did you do it, Simon?
Because Mary let me, doc.
They always do.
What are you doing here?
They always do.
You know what I wouldn't do?
I wouldn't mention this to anyone, Gordy.
- Gordy.
- I wouldn't tell anybody about this.
Because if they find out about Hank, they're gonna find out about the others.
I found Hank, Gordy.
He's hurt, and he said you did it to him. Is that true?
Gordy? Gordy!
Who did this?
Well...
He brought it on himself.
Didn't he?
Wrong place at the wrong time.
- Where are the others?
- Gordy, you are asleep.
Uncle Gordon!
Wake up!
The lights went out.
I'm sorry, man. I was freaking out.
I got these in your van. Is that okay?
Gordy.
I need you to open your eyes now.
Wake up.
And remember.
Roses? They're lovely!
What's the occasion, Gordon?
Not here, Gordon. Later.
Watch out! Gordon!
Oh, my God, Gordon...
No!
Stop!
No, stop, Gordon! No!
Do it, Gordon.
Do it, Gordon.
Do it now.
No!
Wendy. Wendy, it's me.
Please don't hang up. Please.
I just want to say how sorry
I am for what's happened.
I am so sorry.
I am so lonely here.
I want to come home.
I want to hold you.
I want to hold my baby.
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
And where do you live, Simon?
I live in the weak and the wounded... doc.

{5085}{5157}I heard you.|You have a job in a disco.
{5162}{5220}Doing what, the accounting?
{5230}{5257}The door?
{5270}{5352}As a bouncer? Are you nuts?|You could get killed!
{5367}{5422}Tell me about it later.
{5432}{5512}Don't get angry.|You just never stop calling me.
{5517}{5567}I'm sorry. Yes.
{5570}{5622}Yes, I love you a lot.
{5630}{5722}I'm nervous about the flat.|I haven't sold a single one.
{5727}{5802}Yes, it started well,|but after that...
{5825}{5927}Also, some clients have been|waiting for me
{5932}{6012}for a half hour|in this freezing weather.
{6015}{6120}It's pouring and I'm dressed up.|You're lucky.
{6130}{6187}You can wear|a jogging suit to work.
{6220}{6257}What? A tuxedo?
{6275}{6357}You had to rent one?|Are you crazy or what?
{6367}{6420}They have to pay for that.
{6430}{6500}You think firemen|buy their helmets?
{6510}{6607}We'll talk about it later.|Okay, honey.
{6625}{6665}I love you a lot!
{6670}{6717}Yes, bye.
{6722}{6767}He's such a pain!
{7030}{7075}Luis?|Julia, from the agency.
{7080}{7142}Excuse me, I was|talking to a client
{7145}{7235}who's interested in this flat.|Did I say it was amazing?
{7260}{7307}-Yes, you did.|-On the phone.
{7472}{7572}Well, well, well.|Here are the super-advantages.
{7575}{7645}One, near the subway.|Two, downtown.
{7650}{7715}Three, there are schools|for the kids,
{7720}{7785}and four, parks|where they can play.
{7790}{7857}-We don't have kids.|-You don't? Good.
{7862}{7967}Me neither. It leaves you free to go|to the movies or to a bingo parlor.
{7972}{8050}I don't play bingo,|it was just an example.
{8055}{8117}You can walk|anywhere from here.
{8122}{8190}-So there's no garage?|-No.
{8195}{8240}There's no... garage.
{8280}{8312}Let's see.
{8322}{8377}This is it. By the way,
{8382}{8420}I wanted to warn you
{8425}{8532}that these old flats usually|have old furniture
{8542}{8572}and that funny
{8577}{8620}seventies wallpaper...
{8630}{8677}I can imagine it. Let's go.
{8682}{8775}That's what I mean, you have|to use your imagination.
{8780}{8817}They usually belong
{8822}{8912}to elderly people.|Sometimes they smell bad...
{9002}{9065}But not in this case.|Look at that.
{9090}{9125}This is your typical
{9130}{9207}amazing flat, period.|It's what we call
{9210}{9275}"ready to live in".|And it's completely furnished.
{9280}{9367}It has pictures, lamps,|a TV, a radio,
{9372}{9435}a sofa...|I think it's a sofa bed.
{9440}{9515}No, it's a sofa sofa,|and a good one.
{9522}{9557}This looks like leather.
{9585}{9677}High-quality! Not like mine,|which is like a beach chair.
{9710}{9775}Every time I show|someone this flat,
{9780}{9817}I want it for myself.
{9825}{9922}Though to each his own|and I won't pressure you.
{9927}{9967}-The owner lives here?|-The owner?
{9972}{10060}What owner? I don't think so.|No, it says it's free.
{10065}{10145}You can sign for it and|come live here tomorrow.
{10150}{10182}What do you think?
{10187}{10237}Can we see the other rooms?
{10242}{10322}Of course, no problem.|Let's see the bedroom.
{10375}{10457}But first, the closet.|Lots of room.
{10465}{10517}The bedroom, I think...
{10572}{10662}What a beautiful bed!|It must be king size.
{10677}{10730}A waterbed, like in Las Vegas!
{10735}{10760}What's the price?
{10770}{10845}Not that I've ever|been in Las Vegas.
{10850}{10882}But this is nice.
{10920}{11007}And if you get seasick,|you can turn it off.
{11010}{11087}I imagine. There must be|a button somewhere.
{11095}{11132}And the price?
{11150}{11195}Didn't they tell you?
{11242}{11347}Think about it, anyway.|I'll give you my card...
{11670}{11702}Not too much...
{11727}{11810}Her, it was her....
{11900}{11957}You're like|a ventriloquist's dummy!
{11962}{12042}Go ahead, laugh.|What a day I've had!
{12045}{12125}I get a cab at the disco,|and guess who I meet?
{12130}{12185}-Who?|-Antonio Pesadas.
{12190}{12277}Pesadas who worked with me|at the insurance company.
{12282}{12317}Right. He was unbearable.
{12322}{12402}Well, he still is.|But now he's a taxi driver.
{12405}{12462}-He got laid off, too.|-Just like you.
{12467}{12567}I didn't get fired for doing|something wrong. It was downsizing.
{12572}{12650}Right. He was|superfluous, too.
{12655}{12702}I don't know what he was.
{12705}{12770}But if you mean|I'm "superfluous"...
{12775}{12862}Please. It was four years ago.|Forget it.
{12865}{12920}But you keep reminding me.
{12925}{13017}You're saying I lost my job|because I was superfluous.
{13047}{13117}Listen: maybe Pesadas|was superfluous,
{13122}{13195}but I wasn't, I was essential.
{13277}{13325}What's all this?
{13372}{13412}It's a romantic dinner.
{13417}{13465}But... whose flat is this?
{13470}{13580}Nobody's. But since I'm|the only one with a key...
{13585}{13617}Let's see if I get it.
{13627}{13720}This is one of the agency flats,|and you're cooking in it?
{13740}{13817}Don't start acting|like you were my father.
{13822}{13927}I'm not. But you do whatever you|want without checking with me!
{13932}{13967}Acting like your father...
{13972}{14072}Ricardo, we'll clean up afterwards|and they won't find out.
{14077}{14130}-They will and they'll fire you.|-So what?
{14135}{14220}Let them. It's only|a 15-day temp job.
{14225}{14302}And it's worth it.|It has a Jacuzzi.
{14305}{14322}A what?
{14332}{14367}A hot tub, Ricardo.
{14382}{14407}And a sauna,
{14415}{14457}a Finnish sauna.
{14460}{14505}You sure it's Finnish?
{14520}{14552}And the best part is...
{14605}{14630}Come on.
{14702}{14755}-It moves!|-It's a waterbed.
{14760}{14825}You can change the temperature.
{14830}{14890}What if you want it to stop?
{14895}{14950}There must be|a button somewhere.
{14955}{14980}Wait, wait...
{15007}{15032}Stop!
{15270}{15360}Julia, you know I need|to be relaxed for this.
{15365}{15435}We've waited|six months for you to relax!
{15440}{15512}That long?|Try to understand.
{15517}{15572}Someone could|come in any time.
{15577}{15677}We're alone.|You'll relax, leave it to me.
{15692}{15760}-What's that noise?|-The pipes.
{15765}{15802}It's the neighbor's TV.
{15807}{15885}You can hear it perfectly.|The walls are thin.
{15890}{15952}Forget about it|and concentrate.
{15965}{16052}If we can hear them,|they can hear us.
{16057}{16125}Stop being paranoid.|Let them hear us.
{16130}{16182}They'll get off on it.
{16555}{16582}Get it off of me!
{16622}{16662}What now?
{16667}{16692}That's disgusting!
{16697}{16732}Where did they come from?
{16737}{16787}I told you we shouldn't be here.
{16800}{16907}Don't start with your Jesuit school|guilt complex, Ricardo!
{16912}{16950}But we are guilty.
{16955}{17010}Okay, we're guilty.
{17015}{17097}We're fornicating|like degenerate beasts,
{17100}{17177}but the cockroaches|don't know that!
{17180}{17237}You're driving me crazy!
{17247}{17275}You're right, sorry.
{17285}{17345}But they really give me|the creeps.
{17350}{17387}Me too, believe me.
{17392}{17437}We'll close the door,
{17442}{17495}go into the living room...
{17500}{17562}...Clean up and go home.|Please, Julia.
{17565}{17587}No.
{17590}{17617}We'll stay here.
{17622}{17650}Why?
{17655}{17735}Because I say so.|Our house is freezing,
{17740}{17792}and this is a special night.
{17805}{17877}Yeah, Walpurgis night.
{17920}{17995}-Julia...|-You don't feel like it.
{18000}{18080}-You don't mind, do you?|-No, not at all.
{18085}{18150}We're like Krishnas.|Tomorrow we'll beg in the park.
{18155}{18215}That would be better.|In the disco,
{18220}{18290}this 12-year-old|with baggy pants
{18295}{18372}said he'd kill me|because I asked for his lD.
{18377}{18460}Who would ever hire you|as a bouncer?
{18465}{18542}I told the temp agency|I would do anything.
{18547}{18582}Should I turn on the TV?
{18587}{18642}The neighbor's isn't enough?
{18647}{18710}What a great romantic dinner.
{18780}{18852}The vulture,|nature's gravedigger,
{18857}{18892}devours the dead.
{18912}{18972}When one vulture|finds a carcass,
{18990}{19055}twenty more appear|to share it.
{19060}{19107}A voracious jackal joins them.
{19115}{19207}The somber party continues|until nothing's left.
{19352}{19377}Hello?
{19410}{19492}God! Richard!|Richard, wake up!
{19617}{19667}God, the 9:00 people!
{19677}{19715}Richard, wake up!
{19720}{19750}Just a little more...
{19755}{19812}Now you feel affectionate?|Men!
{19817}{19890}We have time for a quickie.
{19895}{19927}To dress quickly.
{19930}{19962}-What's that?|-The doorbell.
{19967}{20015}-Who is it?|-A client, damnit!
{20020}{20055}I have to explain everything.
{20077}{20142}-Great. Always in a hurry.|-Carlos Manzanares?
{20147}{20212}Julia García.|I was expecting you.
{20217}{20290}First, the location.|Here are the super-advantages.
{20295}{20332}One, near the subway.|Two,
{20337}{20420}downtown. Three, schools|for the kids, and four,
{20425}{20462}parks where they can play.
{20465}{20497}Fantastic.
{20797}{20870}High-quality leather.|A sofa to last a lifetime.
{20875}{20912}-What's this?|-Look.
{20917}{20970}-Stains just wipe off.|-Right.
{20975}{21035}Let me show you|the bedroom.
{21042}{21110}No, let me show you|the kitchen.
{21115}{21180}Fully equipped,|it even has a toaster.
{21230}{21272}I said you should see
{21275}{21300}the kitchen.
{21305}{21362}-What is this?|-A dampness problem.
{21387}{21432}-Who are you calling?|-The fire department.
{21437}{21505}There's no need to.|We can fix this.
{21510}{21547}A stitch in time...
{21552}{21637}The man upstairs must|have left a faucet on.
{21642}{21695}If the agency finds out...
{21822}{21852}Stop, it's here!
{21892}{21927}Come on, quickly!
{22015}{22095}-What's going on?|-Today is the day, Encarna.
{22100}{22177}-The old man? No!|-Yes. Something bad has happened.
{22182}{22240}I've prayed for this moment!
{22245}{22297}I hope it's not a false alarm.
{22302}{22332}God forbid.
{22432}{22507}They must have|left a faucet on.
{22512}{22562}-Let's see...|-This is my flat!
{22567}{22630}No, excuse me.|That's the door.
{22635}{22717}Let's see. Please.|Get back, we need room.
{22725}{22752}Ma'am, please!
{22782}{22825}Have you nothing to do?
{22985}{23015}What's up?
{23037}{23112}Don't come out|dressed like a drag queen!
{23195}{23225}Ring first.
{23240}{23272}Mind your own business.
{23280}{23315}Yes, you should ring.
{23330}{23427}What the fuck did you call us for?|To ring the bell?
{23450}{23510}-I didn't call you.|-lgnore her.
{23515}{23582}-What if he's asleep?|-Asleep? Bullshit!
{23590}{23672}Besides, he never opens|the door, even if you ring.
{23685}{23732}He's a dangerous lunatic.
{23737}{23812}He'll leave the gas on someday|and blow us up.
{23817}{23880}-Hit it!|-Ma'am!
{23885}{23930}Don't touch my ax,
{23935}{23962}damnit!
{24010}{24047}It must be bolted.
{24080}{24135}-With a iron bar.|-And chains.
{24140}{24187}They haven't gone in yet?
{24192}{24250}They're trying.|Tell María and Salas.
{24255}{24345}This isn't a circus.|Who the hell is the manager?
{24350}{24435}He's not here. He took|his kids to Disneyland.
{24440}{24515}In Paris,|not the "Wals Dineys" one.
{24530}{24585}It had to happen today.|Bad luck.
{24590}{24632}-Aren't you the manager?|-No, no.
{24665}{24715}Who's she?|Who are you?
{24727}{24767}We don't know her.
{24770}{24820}She bought the engineer's flat.
{24832}{24862}Well, "bought"...
{24867}{24925}Julián Chueca,|from the videoclub.
{24930}{25010}Nice to meet you.|We met your husband
{25015}{25052}downstairs at the door.
{25080}{25110}He's very elegant.
{25132}{25210}-He's a croupier in a casino.|-Really?
{25215}{25290}He said he was going|to a disco.
{25305}{25352}Well, it's a disco-casino.
{25405}{25442}What do you think?
{25477}{25502}The Rotaflex.
{25745}{25790}Okay, everyone downstairs.
{25807}{25842}I'm surfing the net...
{25847}{25887}Everyone downstairs.
{25890}{25970}My son's right. Why can't we|stay if we live here?
{25975}{26022}Because I say so, okay?
{26027}{26087}-No need to get cocky.|-Downstairs!
{26092}{26127}-It's our home!|-She's staying!
{26157}{26257}What a stench!|What is all this fucking shit?
{26822}{26850}Disgusting!
{26855}{26937}-Where did you come from?|-My flat. The door was open.
{26942}{27017}Stay out of our way.|This is no joke.
{27147}{27220}There's the leak.|It must be a broken pipe.
{27232}{27292}How could someone|live like this?
{27297}{27347}I didn't know him.
{27355}{27382}You hear that?
{27875}{27932}Here's our friend,|watching TV.
{28155}{28177}God!
{28270}{28342}-What are you doing here?|-He's dead!
{28355}{28397}Of course he's dead.
{28410}{28475}We see this every month.
{28535}{28572}He died weeks ago.
{28580}{28660}He was alone, with no family|to look after him.
{28692}{28747}-What's that smell?|-That smell...
{28757}{28807}is the smell of rotting flesh.
{28827}{28915}The cat has probably been|feeding on the body,
{28930}{28972}and I can assure you,
{28975}{29025}it's not a pretty sight.
{29030}{29052}Paco!
{29057}{29092}Cut the bullshit.
{29690}{29722}Hey?
{29942}{29987}Are you there?
{30150}{30177}What are you doing?
{30225}{30247}What are you looking for?
{30317}{30425}Fifteen men|on a dead man's chest.
{30440}{30512}Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle
{30525}{30550}of rum.
{30640}{30682}Up. What are you doing?
{30700}{30752}Fuck, we'll have to bend him.
{30757}{30817}Bend him?|Just raise him a bit.
{30825}{30865}There we go.
{30900}{30937}He was snobbish and thin.
{30960}{31022}-Hold on, ma'am, he's falling!|-Over here.
{31027}{31057}Have a toke, Juanillo.
{31062}{31127}Always so proud,|and look at him now.
{31130}{31175}God fucking damn it!
{31180}{31215}Calm down.
{31220}{31247}Come on!
{31350}{31375}Slow down, Toni!
{31392}{31427}This guy stinks!
{31495}{31542}-Finally! That bastard.|-You sure he's dead?
{31547}{31617}That's enough already!|Ladies!
{31655}{31720}There's no need to push us.
{31757}{31782}Is that her?
{31805}{31842}The one in the suit.
{31847}{31887}How did she get in?
{31892}{31942}She called the fire department.
{31947}{31987}The bitch!
{32375}{32415}A crossword puzzle?
{32790}{32815}Hello?
{32830}{32862}Hi, dear.
{32880}{32947}No, I'm in a café.
{32980}{33080}Yes, the firemen came.|It was a pipe or something.
{33122}{33217}Did you tell people it was our|flat? They think we live here,
{33222}{33255}I mean, there.
{33262}{33332}No, if they see we're not there,
{33337}{33392}the agency might find out.
{33395}{33467}So I should spend|the night.
{33475}{33562}Are you going home?|Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
{33585}{33672}Careful with the kid|in baggy pants. Bye.
{34242}{34290}The secret is Mr. Clean.
{34375}{34412}It's a cinch!
{34462}{34482}Great!
{34487}{34570}You scrubbed|everything but my back.
{34575}{34660}Mr. Clean does|the hard work for you.
{34665}{34740}The secret is Mr. Clean.
{35690}{35752}If Ricardo knew, he'd kill me.
{35852}{35907}Fifteen men
{35910}{35990}on a dead man's chest.
{36005}{36055}Ho, ho, ho,
{36062}{36122}and a bottle of rum.
{36165}{36190}It's loose!
{38612}{38637}What's going on?
{38695}{38755}I must talk to that woman.
{38760}{38855}With a knife? You're crazy, Castro.|Give it to me.
{38860}{38902}You'll ruin everything!
{39472}{39532}What is it? Is it her?
{39535}{39582}Shut up! I can't hear.
{39630}{39655}Let me see!
{39685}{39735}Get back, Castro.
{39757}{39807}Just settle down.
{39882}{39937}-Well?|-Excuse me?
{39955}{39982}Taking out the trash?
{40005}{40077}Yes. There's a lot|when you're moving in.
{40082}{40115}Wait a second.
{40140}{40170}Stay right there.
{40270}{40295}Don't worry.
{40300}{40355}-I'll take it down.|-No, no.
{40360}{40427}-I'll go with you.|-I don't mind.
{40442}{40472}But I do.
{40605}{40665}-How's your husband?|-He's exhausted.
{40670}{40740}-You know what moving's like.|-No, I don't.
{40747}{40810}I was born and will die|in this building.
{40825}{40865}I didn't see you bring
{40870}{40905}too many things.
{40910}{40967}The flat was ready|to live in.
{40972}{41030}-Did you know the engineer?|-Who?
{41040}{41070}The previous owner.
{41075}{41130}No, I got it|through an agency.
{41135}{41187}I'd never use an agency!
{41192}{41257}-Why not?|-They're all thieves.
{41272}{41320}They take your money|without doing anything.
{41895}{41927}-Shall we go up?|-No.
{41930}{42002}I have to buy some cigarettes.
{42017}{42052}Cigarettes...
{42492}{42560}-No, no! Wait!|-What?
{42565}{42617}It's just paper.
{42632}{42667}Hold on!
{42672}{42732}My husband's into recycling.
{42745}{42797}Recycling, recycling...
{43335}{43420}That's two hundred bills worth|5,000 pesetas
{43425}{43532}in each bunch|and there are 300 bunches,
{43540}{43567}that makes...
{43662}{43705}300 million pesetas.
{44002}{44035}Calm.
{44075}{44112}I'm a mature woman.
{44137}{44192}This is just something|that happened.
{44205}{44257}I have to accept it as normal.
{44322}{44365}I won't lose control.
{44382}{44407}No.
{44452}{44540}I'm a multimillionaire,|that's all.
{44612}{44687}I'm totally rich.
{44737}{44777}Without spending a penny,
{44787}{44845}I could live off the interest
{44857}{44902}and never work again.
{44950}{45047}I could go around the world|as many times as I can take.
{45095}{45160}Is this going to affect me?
{45222}{45250}No.
{45270}{45310}I'm the same as always.
{45315}{45382}A millionaire, but the same.
{45737}{45767}Why are you here?
{45780}{45832}-You don't want to see me?|-No!
{45837}{45892}I mean, yes, but weren't you|going home?
{45897}{45925}Fine, I'll go.
{45930}{46017}-Don't be silly. What happened?|-The disco is history.
{46020}{46075}-They fired you?|-No, I quit!
{46080}{46127}Why do you always say that?
{46132}{46205}Did the 12-year-old|do that to you?
{46210}{46250}Don't. No, worse.
{46255}{46335}The disco owner,|obeying the kid's father.
{46352}{46390}I lasted two days.
{46395}{46460}I'm the king of disco bouncers.
{46470}{46510}I'm King Kong!
{46535}{46595}The giant shithead bouncer.
{46607}{46642}You want a beer?
{46647}{46710}We have beer here now?|What?
{46715}{46767}Have we moved in completely?
{46792}{46872}I have something|important to tell you.
{46877}{46957}Not tonight. Tell me|the bad news tomorrow.
{46962}{47022}It's not bad news,|on the contrary.
{47032}{47112}lmagine something|changing everything.
{47122}{47187}Everything,|I mean, everything.
{47200}{47235}A stroke of luck.
{47255}{47352}Julia, look who|you're talking to here.
{47375}{47410}I have nothing.
{47427}{47492}I've been beaten|and humiliated,
{47502}{47555}I feel ridiculous.
{47562}{47615}I prefer not|to imagine anything.
{47635}{47650}Fine.
{47662}{47712}If you don't want to know...
{47782}{47825}THE STRONGEST DRUG|ISN'T SPEED
{47902}{47932}IT'S MONEY
{47937}{47962}Which is better?
{47980}{48065}A Rover or a Mercedes?|I'd prefer a Mercedes.
{48070}{48127}They're classy, elegant.
{48132}{48175}Yeah, fucking great.
{48180}{48252}I want to be reincarnated|as a fucker who owns one.
{48270}{48372}In this life, we'll never|put our asses in one of those.
{48380}{48445}Unless we catch Pesadas' taxi.
{48450}{48520}The cocksucker has a Mercedes.
{48537}{48607}Your character is turning bitter.
{48612}{48670}You always say|I have no character.
{48687}{48747}What you didn't have was bitterness.
{48760}{48852}Now I'm embittered.|That's what you're calling me!
{48855}{48957}What about you? Always|looking over my shoulder.
{48977}{49035}-What?|-Don't pretend to be offended.
{49045}{49110}Always saying people|can't put up with me.
{49120}{49167}"What, fired again?"
{49180}{49210}What are you saying?
{49225}{49255}You heard me.
{49282}{49370}Look. Just because|things aren't going well
{49375}{49460}doesn't give you|the right to be rude.
{49485}{49532}For years, "Mr. Rude"
{49537}{49610}has kept our thing afloat.|You know that?
{49620}{49690}-What thing?|-Our thing.
{49695}{49782}Our relationship, the bills,|the rent, everything!
{49832}{49857}Look,
{49870}{49935}let's talk about this tomorrow.
{49977}{50050}We used to live off|my salary, but now
{50055}{50097}you have to work, too,
{50102}{50172}and never stop|rubbing my face in it
{50175}{50270}so that I know you're in charge|now. Think I don't get it?
{50280}{50327}A nice romantic dinner...
{50332}{50402}Well, my life is going to hell
{50407}{50467}and I can't buy|an Audi or a Mercedes.
{50472}{50505}I can't! Okay?
{50530}{50572}I had good news,
{50587}{50662}but now I don't even|feel like telling you!
{50670}{50740}And I don't feel|like staying here!
{50745}{50807}-Where are you going?|-Home.
{50810}{50922}I don't want to stay in this flat|because it's what we'll never have!
{50930}{50972}You don't realize that.
{51027}{51100}I'll never have|this flat or that car
{51105}{51152}or a girl like|the one in the ad!
{51157}{51237}So you have to settle for|someone like me.
{51242}{51275}I didn't say that.
{51280}{51337}Yes, you did, and you meant it.
{51342}{51450}Well, I have to settle for you|and you for me. So what?
{51462}{51560}At least I recognize my limitations|and don't expect strokes of luck.
{51600}{51630}Ricardo!
{51642}{51667}What?
{51695}{51755}You're making a huge mistake.
{52622}{52685}Quique, the lady|needs something.
{52710}{52737}Everything okay?
{52740}{52810}The best breakfast|in Madrid, Quique.
{52815}{52857}Is there a newspaper here?
{52867}{52907}If there isn't, there will be.
{53000}{53025}Excuse me...
{53060}{53127}Napoleon was exiled to Elba,
{53132}{53170}the Canary Islands,|or Treasure Island?
{53182}{53205}What?
{53220}{53282}The Trivia machine.
{53300}{53337}Well, it must be Elba.
{53357}{53382}Okay.
{53485}{53507}Thank you.
{53565}{53645}Picking up girls, Charli?|The horny little guy.
{53677}{53747}I was just asking her|about Napoleon.
{53752}{53807}His mother gets angry|with me because
{53810}{53837}he spends
{53842}{53885}the shopping money on that.
{53890}{53960}How dare you talk|like that about me!
{53965}{54007}Charli. Charli, Charli...
{54012}{54075}My mother has nothing|to do with this.
{54080}{54110}5th floor, right?
{54117}{54185}-You're the new neighbor.|-Hi, Charli. I'm Julia.
{54255}{54335}Nice to meet you.|If you need anything...
{54402}{54462}I've got to go to the butcher's.
{54485}{54512}I have number 35.
{54532}{54575}25 was 10 minutes ago.
{54927}{54960}That's 1,525 pesetas.
{54965}{55015}Cheap for Madrid.
{55220}{55272}-I don't think so.|-It's no good?
{55280}{55365}It is. With the E.U.,|everything's good.
{55370}{55407}The bank will change it.
{55412}{55442}But it's paid for.
{55447}{55482}Really? By whom?
{55515}{55580}Oswaldo,|the Cuban dance teacher.
{55582}{55615}He's really good.
{55622}{55725}He dances merengue, salsa,|the lambada, that kind of thing...
{55730}{55767}He's something else.
{55777}{55850}-Tell him thanks when you see him.|-Okay.
{55865}{55912}ELDERLY MAN DIES WATCHING TV
{55917}{55992}...CIFUENTES, 88,|WITH NO KNOWN RELATIVES...
{56350}{56382}What are you doing?
{56400}{56427}You're here.
{56485}{56545}I got it off. Silicon.
{56550}{56657}Some bastard is blocking|everybody's locks.
{56685}{56792}Well, you must be busy. I'm|on the 3rd floor if you need me.
{56795}{56862}And careful,|there's lots of thieves around!
{57100}{57155}Hello?|Hi, how are you?
{57165}{57232}I'm in the hospital|with my husband.
{57237}{57340}He had an accident.|He was beaten up in a disco.
{57345}{57437}Twenty guys with metal bats.|Right, soccer hooligans.
{57445}{57495}I don't know. That's why
{57500}{57550}I didn't go to the office.
{57557}{57615}Show a flat? Now?
{57635}{57680}I don't think I can.
{57705}{57735}Which one?
{57750}{57802}Other buyers, right.
{57822}{57862}The "ready to live in" one?
{57877}{57920}When are they coming?
{57927}{57957}Now?
{58030}{58102}Yes, I'll be there|in five minutes.
{58107}{58167}No, don't send anyone,|I'll go.
{58172}{58265}It's not serious. His head|or his back or something,
{58270}{58335}I didn't really understand.|Okay.
{58337}{58412}Sorry, I'm losing the signal.|Talk to you later.
{59042}{59090}Hi, Julia García.
{59095}{59137}Is this a bad time?
{59142}{59177}Not at all, come in.
{59242}{59295}Here are the super-advantages.
{59300}{59407}One, near the subway. But you|look more like taxi type people.
{59420}{59452}Two, downtown.
{59457}{59555}Near a bingo parlor. A shot of|anisette and a game or two. Great!
{59560}{59637}And three. Schools, blah,|blah, blah. Kids, etc.
{59672}{59707}But you have no kids.
{59712}{59735}What?
{59740}{59787}You're into doing "scissors".
{59792}{59872}-Excuse me?|-She thinks we sew?
{59877}{59935}"Scissors". It's on your card.
{59940}{60022}"Lesbian battle-axes|need flat to do scissors."
{60035}{60092}-Please!|-What's "scissors"?
{60097}{60165}Well, think about it, then.
{60172}{60212}We'll keep in touch.
{60222}{60262}Shut up! Don't you get it?
{60850}{60877}Hello.
{60890}{60932}Excuse me. Are you going
{60937}{60965}on a trip?
{60975}{61030}I just don't stop.|I'm so busy.
{61035}{61127}Now I have to take these clothes|to my husband in the hospital.
{61132}{61160}What happened?
{61170}{61217}Nothing.|He was hit by a truck.
{61265}{61302}-I'm sorry.|-It was awful.
{61335}{61442}And the truck was full of|chemicals that disfigured his face.
{61447}{61472}That's terrible!
{61515}{61567}-I should go...|-No, don't.
{61572}{61602}It's not your fault.
{61660}{61715}I came to invite you|to a party.
{61722}{61797}-Really? When is it?|-Tonight.
{61800}{61892}Every year I celebrate|the day I came to Madrid.
{61900}{61935}I'm a little sentimental.
{61940}{61985}-I'd celebrate it too.|-Right.
{61990}{62027}I'll be there.
{62035}{62082}What about your husband?
{62117}{62162}He doesn't mind what I do.
{62167}{62215}Besides, I can't do much
{62220}{62287}at the hospital...|All those tubes.
{62290}{62322}Of course. You need...
{62327}{62372}to get away from it all.
{62390}{62432}-Exactly!|-Right.
{62440}{62487}So you will come tonight.
{62495}{62522}Around nine?
{62540}{62567}Great!
{62652}{62700}And thanks for the coffee!
{63122}{63162}She...
{63170}{63237}slips and runs into me...
{63245}{63307}I know the day I lose her
{63322}{63422}I'll suffer for her again,|and once again
{63427}{63457}I'll find her...
{63480}{63572}with another face,|another body...
{63660}{63755}We've spotted the target, sir.|We're waiting for instructions.
{64002}{64070}...let whatever God wills occur...
{64110}{64155}We'll take her|to the Dark Side.
{64162}{64232}It's time to take out|our light saber.
{64640}{64667}The Force...
{64695}{64735}I feel the Force!
{64805}{64900}It's coming! The Force!|The Force!
{64947}{64985}The Force, the Force...
{65055}{65120}Charli! Open the door,|you pig!
{65125}{65172}I know what you're doing!
{65177}{65245}The Force!|Yes, the Force!
{65272}{65302}Knock it off!
{65480}{65550}Lucía? Hi, it's Julia.|Remember me?
{65562}{65622}Right. It's been a long time.
{65640}{65702}I'm calling to|ask you something,
{65707}{65765}since you work in a bank...
{65825}{65870}You're going to laugh.
{65875}{65982}My friend inherited a lot of money|in cash from her parents...
{66010}{66072}They must have had it at home,
{66077}{66137}under the mattress.|Anyway,
{66140}{66207}she wants to take it|to the bank...
{66212}{66302}What? No, of course I'm not|mixed up in anything funny.
{66327}{66412}The amount? I don't know,|say... 300 million.
{66480}{66547}Under a mattress.|That's not so strange.
{66577}{66657}Whatever. lmagine|someone, Miss X, appears
{66662}{66747}in the bank with that money.|What would you do?
{66777}{66802}Right.
{66815}{66862}Without thinking twice.
{66877}{66952}Well, I'll let my friend know that.
{66967}{67020}Okay. Great to talk to you.
{67025}{67100}We'll have to get|together sometime. Bye.
{67120}{67165}She'd call the police.
{67180}{67205}ldiot!
{67465}{67500}It's her!
{67507}{67572}Everyone get ready!
{67777}{67812}-Hi.|-What a surprise!
{67817}{67907}Well, I wasn't going to come,|but in the end...
{67935}{67960}What a party!
{68035}{68105}-Someone here wants to meet you.|-Really?
{68110}{68167}Hello, Julia. I'm Emilio.
{68172}{68260}The manager. Nice to meet you.|How was Eurodisney?
{68270}{68317}Well, news gets around.
{68325}{68417}I've been here two days and I feel|like I already know everybody.
{68430}{68480}Great, it was like a dream.
{68495}{68532}A children's paradise.
{68535}{68567}Is your family here?
{68570}{68662}No, they stayed. It's not|their fault I'm the manager.
{68670}{68717}So I'm on my own.
{68735}{68807}Everyone here is|from the building, right?
{68812}{68875}It's a very close community.
{68880}{68940}We're all interested|in the common good.
{68945}{69010}We have an interest in...|the building.
{69015}{69057}We've always lived here.
{69060}{69100}Ramona was born here.
{69105}{69210}Right. I've known her|since I was a boy. Cheers.
{69372}{69425}You're sure|she hasn't gone out?
{69447}{69507}Not since the Cuban went up.
{69547}{69597}I can't stand this.
{69620}{69677}Emilio gets some ideas...
{69680}{69752}That's what I say,|but no one listens.
{69755}{69797}He's brainwashed them.
{69802}{69850}What would you do?
{69875}{69915}We've got her here.
{69920}{70025}What are we waiting for?|I could fix this in a second.
{70030}{70075}Without Emilio finding out?
{70080}{70132}No one's moving from here.
{70145}{70205}Cookie! This is our song!
{70217}{70247}Come on, Cookie!
{70250}{70307}What fucking song?|I don't have
{70312}{70377}a song.|Stop being a dipshit!
{70392}{70437}You can dance with the retard.
{70542}{70627}Don't take it so hard.|He's very passionate.
{70635}{70705}Passionate?|What do you mean by that?
{70715}{70790}Well, about what he does.|He doesn't leave
{70805}{70837}things undone.
{70847}{70910}He leaves a lot undone.
{70920}{70975}Every night|we just watch videos.
{71025}{71105}I don't want to know|about anyone's private life.
{71110}{71195}Since you seem to be|such good friends lately...
{71210}{71257}Well listen to you!
{71262}{71325}Go dance, you have no idea.|Go on!
{71330}{71367}You're so bossy!
{71415}{71467}Take off your jacket,|it's hot.
{71472}{71500}I'm fine.
{71505}{71612}You just don't want the girls|to see how fat you are.
{71635}{71705}I know you ate|all the canapés!
{71875}{71940}It's a shame what happened.
{71952}{72022}Yes, that poor old man.|It was terrible.
{72030}{72090}We meant your husband.
{72145}{72205}Right, the accident.|It was awful.
{72215}{72267}Accident? Wasn't he beat up
{72272}{72300}by skinheads?
{72305}{72352}He was. But it was an accident
{72357}{72437}because they took him|for someone else.
{72450}{72475}Right.
{72507}{72552}Did you know the old man?
{72557}{72582}The dead one?
{72587}{72655}-We all know each other here.|-He was strange.
{72675}{72702}Always alone.
{72707}{72792}-He never went out.|-The lottery win went to his head.
{72810}{72837}He won the lottery?
{72850}{72882}The sports lottery.
{72895}{72950}But that was a long time ago.
{72962}{73012}He was too afraid to go out.
{73017}{73097}Isn't that silly?|Afraid of us!
{73137}{73167}Afraid!
{73300}{73335}-Can I go now?|-No.
{73340}{73392}Emilio said|we all have to stay.
{73397}{73442}You made me sign it.
{73445}{73535}Do you want to end up|like the engineer?
{73550}{73582}And stop drinking.
{73712}{73755}How is it going?
{73765}{73822}I don't know.|The bitch is smart.
{73825}{73862}But she has the money.
{73867}{73917}We don't know that yet.
{73945}{73995}Ramona saw her with bags.
{74000}{74032}She sees what she wants to.
{74047}{74122}Why don't we go up|and search her place now?
{74132}{74192}You want to go up?|Stay calm.
{74202}{74245}We have to do this right.
{74295}{74375}We should have done it|right from the start.
{74557}{74592}Eurodisney!
{74605}{74687}Eurodisney|fucked us over completely!
{74695}{74762}I finally have|a vacation and... Shit!
{75005}{75112}You were brave, going into|that flat with the firemen.
{75117}{75155}What was it like? A cave?
{75167}{75207}More or less, yes.
{75242}{75312}What was the first thing|you saw?
{75332}{75412}Cockroaches, bags full|of garbage, and filth.
{75442}{75475}Nothing else?
{75527}{75600}I know we sound morbid,|insisting like this.
{75615}{75695}We've just wondered|about it so long.
{75710}{75757}You can ask him, too.
{75762}{75810}He went in with me.
{75867}{75932}Domínguez! That's news.
{75950}{76025}The fucker went in|and didn't tell anyone.
{76242}{76310}I hope they weren't|boring you.
{76322}{76402}No, they're charming.|Everyone is, really.
{76670}{76697}They're like
{76702}{76770}a family to me.|I'm lucky to live here.
{76780}{76857}There aren't many|young people... like us.
{76902}{76955}It's my senior citizens party.
{76975}{77015}But they love to dance.
{77020}{77095}You just have to|start them off. Shall we?
{77105}{77155}No, I only dance at weddings.
{77160}{77227}-Come on, I'll teach you.|-Only at weddings!
{78050}{78087}Come on!
{78090}{78167}You don't have|to accompany me.
{78170}{78235}-You Cubans!|-We like taking care of women.
{78240}{78315}-I bet you say that to all of them.|-And it works!
{78565}{78650}How embarrassing!|We left together.
{78655}{78722}But possibly|each to their own flat.
{78727}{78805}No, you were already|in your own flat.
{78810}{78857}You didn't have to go.
{78882}{78925}You're right! I'm blasted!
{78937}{78977}They're thinking the worst.
{78982}{79035}Well, we can't|disappoint them.
{79040}{79137}Right, if they're going to gossip,|it might as well be true.
{79152}{79205}Wait... What about|your husband?
{79235}{79310}My husband.|What a pain, my husband.
{79315}{79417}I didn't want to say so, but|the hospital called. He's dead.
{79420}{79470}-Really?|-You heard me.
{79475}{79545}The anesthesia gave him|a heart attack.
{79560}{79652}But I don't want to think|about that now, I need to...
{79657}{79710}-To get away from it all.|-Right!
{79715}{79750}To get away from it all.
{80172}{80252}Isn't it amazing?|It can make waves.
{80257}{80295}The engineer had class.
{80300}{80370}-Did you know him?|-No.
{80375}{80427}But I've heard|a lot about him.
{80445}{80477}And the ceiling?
{80482}{80562}The finger of God|punished me the other day.
{80605}{80640}You know what?
{80667}{80715}He'll have reasons to.
{80725}{80817}We'll savagely profane|this holy waterbed.
{80822}{80885}Wait, wait a second.
{80930}{80957}I have ice cream.
{80962}{81020}I love ice cream.|But hurry back.
{81310}{81350}You forgot the ice cream.
{81390}{81432}-Were they listening?|-No.
{81440}{81492}They're beating up Domínguez.
{81497}{81562}It must be Castro.|Always the same.
{81565}{81605}Some people shouldn't drink.
{82445}{82477}What was that?
{82490}{82522}What, darling?
{82542}{82620}There's someone|in the living room.
{82735}{82760}Julia.
{82820}{82860}Julia, come back!
{82910}{82935}What is this?
{83027}{83052}What are you doing?
{83140}{83167}How did you get in?
{83185}{83222}Get out of my flat!
{83227}{83265}Your flat?
{83295}{83347}-Let's go.|-I'll call the police.
{83360}{83402}-Are you sure?|-Put that down.
{83425}{83452}What do you mean?
{83457}{83490}I don't think you would.
{83495}{83540}Forget it, Ramona.
{83545}{83600}-She doesn't fool me.|-Slut.
{83665}{83690}I'm sorry.
{83740}{83817}Let go, it's not yours!|I'll buy you one.
{83830}{83927}Well, let's leave.|Come on, let's go. Let's go.
{84042}{84077}Unbelievable!
{84082}{84132}They just walked in!|Did you...?
{84547}{84580}Out of my home!
{84622}{84662}Get out right now!
{84695}{84777}You were all working together,|all of you!
{84822}{84885}You came up|to unlock the door.
{84890}{84985}God, how could I be so stupid?|To think you and l...
{84990}{85035}Get out! Get out!
{85060}{85087}Get out!
{85270}{85345}You'd better be|as innocent as you seem.
{85350}{85390}Get out!
{86327}{86382}Where do you think|you're going?
{86400}{86480}-What happened?|-Thanks to you, I was almost killed.
{86485}{86550}-I had nothing to do with it.|-Lying bitch!
{86555}{86615}You told them I had the money.
{86620}{86647}What do you want?
{86652}{86750}They're downstairs.|They'll take the money and kill us.
{86755}{86795}-You're crazy.|-Crazy?
{86815}{86885}They're crazy.|Think about the engineer.
{86890}{86942}He wouldn't sign|and he disappeared.
{86947}{87005}-I don't understand.|-Listen, your life's at stake.
{87057}{87150}We used to watch|the old man day and night.
{87165}{87207}Every day for years!
{87212}{87290}How did you know he had|the money at home?
{87295}{87377}One day the bank people|came with two big bags.
{87385}{87427}The 500 million stayed there.
{87430}{87462}It's 300 million.
{87485}{87557}-I heard 500.|-300. I counted it.
{87630}{87660}It doesn't matter.
{87720}{87812}It used to be a dream|that helped us get by.
{87817}{87890}To share his money|when he died.
{87895}{87985}But now he's dead, the money's|here and they know it.
{88027}{88062}-Get out.|-First my suitcase.
{88065}{88162}The suitcase!|Fucking greed will send us to hell.
{88170}{88192}Help me!
{88285}{88355}-Help!|-The elevator's stuck again?
{88397}{88422}lgnore her! Help!
{88432}{88500}Go tell Emilio|the elevator's stuck.
{88507}{88555}Don't! Don't move!
{88575}{88622}We just want to help.
{88627}{88667}Go back inside.
{88752}{88797}God! Get me out of here!
{88832}{88865}Don't or I'll kill you!
{88900}{88950}You hear me, you bitch?
{88955}{88990}It's all your fault!
{89000}{89042}Sticking your nose|in our business!
{89065}{89127}-What's wrong, Mommy?|-Go to your fucking room!
{89142}{89220}It's crushing me!|God, it's crushing me!
{89225}{89247}I can't hold on!
{89262}{89332}I'll tell Emilio|it's taken care of.
{89450}{89477}Tell him
{89482}{89557}the suitcase is his|if he gets me out!
{89582}{89602}God!
{90000}{90032}My God, no!
{90060}{90125}-It was an accident!|-Come on, come on!
{90132}{90157}Come on!
{90170}{90250}Scream and I'll cut you open!|Come on!
{90265}{90295}Inside!
{90300}{90327}Inside!
{90387}{90442}We don't have
{90445}{90492}anything to do with this.
{90497}{90542}-It must be Emilio.|-The manager?
{90547}{90577}Yes, it was his idea.
{90602}{90670}The old man|didn't enjoy his money.
{90685}{90772}We just didn't want it to go|to the tax administration.
{90777}{90807}How noble!
{90852}{90910}She must be in the patio.
{91005}{91032}Shut up!
{91050}{91115}Emilio's an accountant,|he understands it.
{91150}{91225}He said that if we worked|together patiently,
{91232}{91287}we'd get it|without hurting anyone.
{91292}{91327}And you believed him?
{91332}{91385}Not everyone.|Some walked out
{91390}{91492}and the rest of us signed|an agreement. Equal shares.
{91500}{91597}It was serious, but we never|thought anyone would get hurt.
{91605}{91655}May lightning strike him|if I'm lying!
{91660}{91722}-No!|-Shut up!
{91825}{91927}We're going outside. Keep your|mouth shut. You come, too.
{91975}{92022}Come on, outside!
{92027}{92100}-Are you going to kill Mommy?|-I don't know.
{92120}{92150}She's here!
{92160}{92220}Tell my husband.|He's in the videoclub.
{92255}{92292}Pull yourself together.
{92297}{92342}Let Hortensia go!
{92347}{92407}Relax, we can talk it over.
{92412}{92457}There's enough money
{92462}{92507}for everyone in there.
{92532}{92577}Don't do anything rash.
{92580}{92617}Stay back or I'll kill her!
{92622}{92682}Julia, you're not a killer.
{92685}{92735}But you people are. Back!
{92740}{92802}I'm leaving here|and I don't care how.
{92807}{92917}You're scared. We're not responsible|for what happened to Domínguez.
{92922}{92985}The elevator's|had problems before.
{92990}{93017}It's true, Julia.
{93022}{93097}We called the repairman.|We haven't hurt anyone.
{93102}{93140}How can you think that?
{93145}{93192}We're normal, like you.
{93200}{93290}Normal? You killed Domínguez|and you want to kill me!
{93300}{93337}She's right. What is this?
{93342}{93407}We should just slit|her fucking throat.
{93412}{93480}Castro, shut up!|Give me the suitcase.
{93485}{93507}Fuck you!
{93512}{93572}Give me the suitcase|and leave.
{93577}{93672}You screwed with the old man|until he died of fright.
{93685}{93772}I won't let you bastards|keep the money!
{93785}{93850}Someone call|my husband, please!
{93852}{93960}She'll kill her and keep the money!|We've waited so long for this?
{93965}{94000}Let me think, damnit!
{94005}{94057}About what? Either I leave,
{94062}{94172}or there will be a massacre|you'll never fucking forget.
{94202}{94280}We have to give her|the money! We have to!
{94342}{94367}I'll kill her!
{94410}{94447}Put that away!
{94460}{94487}Castro!
{94505}{94537}Get out of the way!
{94802}{94862}Who the fuck called|the police?
{94867}{94917}Thank God|you got here in time.
{94920}{94945}Stay calm.
{94955}{95007}I'm Gutiérrez, the manager.
{95022}{95060}Here is the body.
{95065}{95137}It was a horrific sight.|No, no.
{95142}{95207}Don't look.|Damn accident!
{95230}{95290}She's leaving,|the bitch is leaving.
{95385}{95415}How long have you|been the manager?
{95435}{95482}You're not leaving here!
{95485}{95532}You want me to scream?
{95537}{95612}Do it. And explain|the suitcase to the police.
{95695}{95725}Excuse me, Julia.
{95730}{95820}I told them you were the last|person to see Domínguez alive.
{95825}{95895}Yes, but it all happened|so quickly...
{95900}{95935}Let's go to the station.
{95940}{96020}-The station? Why?|-For your statement.
{96025}{96112}Sorry, I don't have time.|I have a plane to catch.
{96122}{96182}Of course, that explains|the suitcase.
{96185}{96242}It's a business trip.|I'll call you
{96245}{96290}in a couple of days.
{96300}{96342}Sorry, that's impossible.
{96350}{96420}You can go after|giving your statement.
{96440}{96487}Why don't we do it here?
{96490}{96600}Excuse me, but I know|about these things.
{96615}{96687}The first thing we do|is interview witnesses.
{96702}{96807}Come on, we have to|let these men do their work.
{96812}{96845}-Use my flat.|-No!
{96895}{96972}There's no need,|we can use mine. Let's go.
{96985}{97072}Thanks for your help, Emilio,|but we don't need you.
{97087}{97115}Right, upstairs.
{97135}{97162}Go on up.
{97292}{97337}That's all, then. Right?
{97340}{97392}You might be called later
{97397}{97450}if there's an investigation.
{97460}{97497}There's something else.
{97537}{97595}In this building...
{97607}{97660}Something strange|is happening.
{97667}{97700}-What happened?|-Yes.
{97705}{97817}The inevitable. You left your wife|alone and she was almost killed.
{97825}{97880}I was in the videoclub.
{97885}{97992}No, I went to look for him|and only the blonde was there.
{97997}{98072}I must have been having a coffee.|I don't know.
{98077}{98127}If you don't know...
{98132}{98192}We've all been here on guard.
{98197}{98275}-What do we do now?|-I don't know, give me time.
{98287}{98347}-What if she tells them?|-About what?
{98360}{98395}The elevator, the party...
{98400}{98480}No, she'd have to tell them|about the money.
{98485}{98537}She held on tight|to that suitcase.
{98550}{98615}No, it's not that. It's...|complicated.
{98627}{98675}Let's just say that they
{98680}{98755}have been looking|for something for years
{98765}{98820}and I found it|in a couple days.
{98835}{98860}"They"?
{98865}{98910}The neighbors.
{98922}{99007}They know I have it|and they want to kill me.
{99055}{99102}But what did you find?
{99182}{99210}Ma'am, what
{99215}{99242}did you find?
{99297}{99332}This flat.
{99407}{99467}I know it sounds silly,|but it's nice.
{99490}{99542}It's furnished, with a view.
{99545}{99590}I found it by chance.
{99602}{99667}They've worked for years|for what they have.
{99685}{99752}People can be very envious.
{99812}{99862}But the elevator...?
{99872}{99955}She has a nicer flat|so they want to kill her.
{99960}{100002}Absurd, isn't it?
{100030}{100072}Forgive me, I'm nervous.
{100155}{100200}Everything's ready?
{100217}{100247}Yes, perfect.
{100525}{100557}She's leaving.
{100562}{100597}Do something.
{100602}{100675}Maybe you'd like an aperitif.
{100680}{100722}How about... a beer?
{100725}{100790}-No, thanks. We have to go.|-Come on.
{100795}{100850}Encarna, can you|get some beers?
{100855}{100892}-Right away.|-And olives.
{100897}{100952}Let's have a nice cold beer.
{100955}{101032}We do appreciate it,|but we're on duty.
{101035}{101105}A couple of beers|never hurt anyone.
{101110}{101150}No, they're good for you.
{101155}{101227}They don't want anything!|Let's go.
{101240}{101292}-Damn her.|-Emilio, she's going.
{101427}{101452}Julia...
{101480}{101507}He's talking to you.
{101580}{101625}You left the door open.
{101667}{101697}What?
{101710}{101795}The door. You forgot|to close the door.
{101800}{101827}Come back up.
{101927}{101990}Close it for me.|See you later.
{102005}{102080}Julia, lock it if you're|going on a trip
{102085}{102162}to keep out the burglars.|Right, officers?
{102195}{102252}He's right,|you should lock it.
{102292}{102317}Well...
{102350}{102422}All right, but wait for me here.
{102425}{102477}-I'll be right back.|-Don't worry.
{102960}{103022}Hurry, you'll miss your plane.
{103057}{103110}The policeman downstairs wants
{103115}{103142}you to come down.
{103220}{103250}Should we wait?
{103357}{103390}No, she'll be okay.
{103395}{103447}-Are you sure?|-Yeah. She's nuts.
{103602}{103667}This hurts me|more than it hurts you.
{103922}{103980}We wanted you|to be one of us,
{103990}{104065}to share the luck|of living in this building.
{104097}{104155}We even threw you a party.
{104225}{104260}And how do you thank us?
{104287}{104315}Laughing at us,
{104320}{104410}and what's worse, trying|to run off, playing dirty.
{104420}{104447}Domínguez died
{104452}{104537}because you double-crossed him!|What was the deal?
{104545}{104630}"50-50 and fuck the rest|of those cocksuckers"?
{104695}{104762}Domínguez didn't|deserve to end up like that!
{104780}{104830}God! Do you know how many
{104835}{104915}years I've been|behind this project,
{104920}{104977}getting these people together?
{105022}{105080}I've turned down jobs,
{105085}{105145}well-paying jobs,|just to stay here.
{105150}{105207}I knew things would
{105212}{105252}fall apart without me.
{105395}{105447}You see what happens?
{105480}{105530}A treat for the kids.
{105535}{105610}My first vacation in 20 years,|and you appear
{105617}{105665}and fuck everything up!
{105752}{105825}Who do you think you are?|I'll tell you.
{105852}{105895}You're a lying whore who
{105900}{105977}hasn't a penny!|This isn't even your flat!
{105995}{106030}But that doesn't matter.
{106045}{106095}I feel sorry for your kind.
{106100}{106135}What are you saying?
{106155}{106222}Don't play dumb.|You understand me.
{106245}{106312}You people think|only of yourselves.
{106317}{106390}You probably|don't have a family, either.
{106395}{106457}You people don't|want responsibilities.
{106472}{106555}You just want|to live in the present.
{106560}{106652}Fuck everyone else.|Well, we're different here.
{106722}{106777}This is a community.
{106807}{106855}García's hip is bad
{106872}{106957}and he eats lunch|at his daughter's house.
{106962}{107037}He needs a little car|to get around town.
{107042}{107110}Paquita, on the 5th floor,
{107120}{107192}is 40 years old and still single.|Know why?
{107222}{107247}Her mouth is
{107252}{107317}disgusting and|she's never been kissed.
{107332}{107392}She needs to get|her teeth fixed.
{107412}{107505}It's all here on this list,|corrected year after year.
{107540}{107582}Know what I'm talking about?
{107607}{107690}About solidarity, respect.
{107707}{107757}We believe|in respecting others.
{107805}{107847}You don't know|what that means.
{107912}{107947}Just finish it!
{107952}{108002}Don't tell me what to do.
{108017}{108087}You killed the engineer,|didn't you?
{108122}{108235}He didn't want to guard|the old man. Just two hours a day.
{108240}{108290}No, he was above all that.
{108295}{108342}He didn't have|a family to support.
{108350}{108415}Out living it up to all hours.
{108417}{108477}Drunks coming in and leaving.
{108487}{108530}He kept us all awake.
{108557}{108620}He was destroying|the community.
{108655}{108767}So kill me, too and stop boring me|with your sermons.
{108772}{108817}You're a fraud and a thief,
{108822}{108860}like me, like everybody.
{108870}{108925}No, I'm not a thief.|I'm not a thief.
{108930}{108985}I have a right to it, I do.
{109015}{109077}We did the sports lottery|together.
{109085}{109142}I helped him|guess the scores.
{109150}{109210}He asked me for advice.
{109265}{109297}He said...
{109360}{109445}"Sporting against Real Sociedad"....
{109492}{109517}And l...
{109552}{109580}I...
{109595}{109622}I said...
{109720}{109752}"Tie".
{109777}{109870}I don't know, it just|came out of my mouth.
{109887}{109992}No one else in Spain|marked "Tie". Just me.
{110025}{110082}I said, "Tie".
{110157}{110237}When I heard he'd|won the jackpot,
{110275}{110305}I was glad.
{110325}{110367}I swear I was glad.
{110372}{110427}And he didn't want to share.
{110455}{110527}As if we didn't exist.|We were neighbors.
{110532}{110597}A lifetime together, meeting
{110602}{110655}in the elevator, in the bar...
{110660}{110707}It meant nothing to him.
{110732}{110807}He could have given us part,|or just gifts.
{110825}{110902}But no, he wanted it|all for himself,
{110915}{110980}the Goddamn greedy fucker.
{111055}{111132}I've dreamt about|this moment ever since.
{111175}{111255}If I hadn't spoken,|if I'd shut my mouth,
{111265}{111315}if I hadn't said "Tie"...
{111325}{111410}the bastard wouldn't|have ruined our lives.
{111450}{111492}Are you going|to keep it all?
{111555}{111580}What?
{111622}{111682}You wouldn't kill|for 30 million,
{111700}{111747}but you would|for 300 million.
{111772}{111835}People kill for 15,000 pesetas.
{111860}{111897}You needed the neighbors.
{111902}{112017}You couldn't guard the old man|by yourself. You planned this.
{112020}{112075}-That's a lie.|-Now you don't need them.
{112080}{112112}But how will you get out?
{112160}{112207}Will you kill them all?
{112230}{112260}You'll need an excuse
{112265}{112342}to take out the suitcase.|You must have one.
{112980}{113050}You've had 20 years|to think about it.
{113110}{113215}And about getting rid|of your beloved wife and kids.
{113230}{113302}I love my wife as much|as the first day we met.
{113347}{113422}She must be a good woman|to have gone
{113427}{113457}without vacations.
{113485}{113567}But with money, you can|get something better.
{113572}{113602}Shut up.
{113617}{113670}Someone who doesn't know,
{113695}{113772}who matches|your new house and pool,
{113780}{113832}your new convertible.
{113862}{113902}Have you thought about it?
{114062}{114152}Get in the bathtub, I don't|want bloodstains on the floor.
{114167}{114215}Get in the bathtub, I said!
{114805}{114887}What are you doing?|Why did you buy that?
{114892}{114972}Don't distract me,|I'll have to start over.
{115005}{115062}I'm worried about you.|Are you okay?
{115067}{115115}Yes, Mom. Leave me alone.
{115130}{115207}Well, whatever happens,|don't leave the flat.
{115220}{115290}Everything will|turn out all right.
{116005}{116067}Hello? Yes, speaking.|Who's this?
{116082}{116120}What agency?
{116137}{116187}The real estate agency.
{116205}{116252}Yes, what is it?
{116270}{116337}Look, I can't talk|to you right now.
{116407}{116437}What?
{116460}{116500}Who told you?
{116510}{116537}A neighbor.
{116542}{116637}Yes, I am living here|and I suppose I'm fired.
{116695}{116772}Don't worry, in an hour|I'll have it clean.
{116780}{116827}No, give me 90 minutes.
{116847}{116937}What? Someone else|is coming to see it?
{116957}{117017}Is this the only flat|in Madrid?
{117970}{118002}Hello?
{118037}{118090}There's no one here,|come in.
{118167}{118225}Well, this is a great flat.
{118235}{118302}Here are the super-advantages.|One, near the subway.
{118305}{118397}Two, downtown.|Three, schools for the kids,
{118402}{118455}and four, parks|where they can play.
{118475}{118540}We can see the kitchen,|if you want.
{118545}{118622}-Does it have a garage?|-No, it doesn't.
{118625}{118687}If it did, it'd have|been sold by now.
{118745}{118820}Hi, I'm Julia García,|from the agency.
{118825}{118872}What's going on?
{118882}{118945}They must be friends of hers.
{118952}{119010}It's plastic,|I can't hear anything.
{119015}{119077}Excuse me.|I'd like a minute
{119082}{119122}-alone with you.|-Of course.
{119125}{119167}-What's your name?|-Javier Pacheco.
{119182}{119230}We have to tell Castro.
{119245}{119310}He said to tell people|he's in the bar.
{119330}{119402}Great. I'll go get him.
{119420}{119507}But he's not there. He just|doesn't want his wife to know.
{119522}{119552}About what?
{119557}{119587}His affair with blonde.
{119610}{119642}From the videoclub?
{119645}{119727}You didn't know? Haven't|you noticed he's always
{119745}{119782}carrying videos?
{119785}{119877}Lately he's seen more movies|than Woody Allen.
{119925}{119967}lmpossible.
{119970}{120060}She's hot. I got a card and|I don't even have a VCR.
{120065}{120150}What do I care about|that loser's private life?
{120187}{120230}Well, since you asked...
{120250}{120325}-You slapped me!|-You deserved that and more.
{120365}{120422}You see a couple of tits
{120447}{120482}and that's that.
{120520}{120567}You all have shit for brains.
{120597}{120682}Listen, Jaime or Javi.|I need a favor.
{120695}{120777}I rang three times.|They said they'd call...
{120790}{120825}You did very well,
{120830}{120865}Jaime or Javi.
{120880}{120935}Just don't show them|the bedroom.
{120940}{120975}What do I tell them?
{120980}{121027}The truth.|There's a bad leak.
{121040}{121102}-ls that the reason?|-No, silly.
{121112}{121172}Let's say I wasn't|alone yesterday
{121180}{121217}and I'm not today, either.
{121262}{121290}Did he do that?
{121315}{121372}Love can be very strange.
{121382}{121420}But you're still so young.
{121457}{121500}See, there is a leak.
{121510}{121572}Yes, it's not worth|showing them.
{121650}{121745}You're new and don't know,|but this is normal in our work.
{121750}{121827}The bosses know.|It's a kind of fringe benefit.
{121832}{121912}Still, I think I'll wait|a few months before...
{121917}{121957}I bring girls to the flats.
{121962}{122022}You have|to find the girl first.
{122027}{122097}So today for you,|tomorrow for me.
{122602}{122702}LUCK HITS|SAN JERONIMO STREET
{122960}{122985}Julia!
{123030}{123085}Something's wrong|with my head.
{123130}{123157}Help me.
{123410}{123477}Julia, what have you done?|Come here!
{123510}{123560}Julia, come here!
{123677}{123700}Julia,
{123705}{123737}it's Oswaldo. Open up.
{123767}{123815}No, Oswaldo, I'm sorry.
{123820}{123860}Where's Emilio?|Did he hurt you?
{123877}{123915}They're waiting for him.
{123930}{124012}Who sent you this time?|Castro? Ramona?
{124017}{124090}No, forget them. I'm alone.
{124095}{124162}This is our chance|to get away. Hurry.
{124165}{124255}-They'll come back.|-You just want the suitcase.
{124262}{124345}Yes, I want the money.|But to share with you.
{124360}{124405}They've all gone crazy.
{124427}{124467}-I'm afraid.|-Julia!
{124485}{124520}Help me!
{124552}{124600}The airport's an hour away.
{124615}{124667}Tomorrow we'll be|far from here.
{124800}{124832}Together?
{124835}{124897}Why not?|There's something between us
{124910}{124987}and you know it. We need|each other. We're like
{124992}{125040}castaways.
{125055}{125100}Two castaways on an island.
{125125}{125175}An island full of monsters.
{125185}{125222}Don't cry, honey,
{125227}{125282}I won't let them hurt you.
{125305}{125375}Open the door, my love.|I need you
{125392}{125430}more than anything.
{125655}{125697}Julia! My car's parked
{125700}{125742}downstairs. Open up.
{125865}{125910}Can't you hear me, darling?
{126135}{126160}No, no, no!
{127507}{127560}Holy shit! The bitch!
{127585}{127657}-Come on!|-My God!
{127672}{127777}It can't be true!|My God, it can't be true!
{127980}{128007}Help!
{128012}{128057}They want to kill me!
{128110}{128175}Hey! Didn't you hear me?
{128187}{128222}Help!
{128370}{128427}Hey, what's up?|How are things?
{128435}{128480}Hey! Hey!
{129127}{129180}Mommy! Mommy!
{129220}{129262}Get moving, damnit!
{132640}{132737}You wanted to escape too,|crazy old man?
{133360}{133422}Come here!|The door's blocked.
{133427}{133527}Push! Push! Goddamnit!
{134037}{134102}Our Father, who art in heaven,|hallowed be
{134107}{134157}-Thy name...|-Up here! Hurry!
{134182}{134225}-Julia!|-Charli?
{134230}{134250}Yes.
{134255}{134292}Come up.
{134330}{134367}Come on, come on!
{134370}{134445}-Where's the suitcase?|-No, forget the money.
{134450}{134482}There's no time!
{134485}{134562}-They're already here!|-The suitcase!
{135070}{135100}Where are we going?
{135327}{135402}He was my friend.|We were going to escape.
{135407}{135455}So you know how to get out?
{135460}{135542}He had to die just now.|It isn't fair.
{135547}{135567}Run!
{135580}{135622}The bitch!
{135720}{135775}She's on the roof!
{135780}{135807}Come on!
{135907}{135992}Fucking bitches!|Do they have to push me?
{135997}{136067}They'll take the suitcase!
{136092}{136120}That way!
{136830}{136862}This is my plan.
{136865}{136942}I'll create a distraction,|like in the Death Star.
{136945}{136967}What star?
{136987}{137015}Han Solo distracted
{137020}{137060}the Stormtroopers while
{137065}{137132}Luke and the Princess fled,|remember?
{137140}{137187}This isn't "Star Wars".
{137277}{137317}The Force is with me.
{137340}{137387}They could kill you!
{137405}{137462}Don't worry,|nothing will happen.
{137472}{137532}I'll play dumb like always.|Trust me.
{137962}{138025}Too late.|The Princess has fled.
{138030}{138115}The Rebellion will triumph.|Hooray for the Republic!
{138212}{138285}Republic?|What fucking republic?
{138295}{138342}Why is this retard here?
{138350}{138397}Stop it! You'll kill him!
{138400}{138465}-Keep him here!|-Come on, Castro.
{138507}{138547}I'll see you later.
{138657}{138695}I told you to stay home.
{138887}{138955}She said|she would marry me.
{138980}{139022}Your father was right.
{139050}{139105}We should have|drowned you at birth.
{140870}{140920}That suitcase is mine.
{141705}{141737}My God!
{142740}{142765}Give it to me.
{142835}{142872}You're going to fall!
{142882}{142930}You're going to fall!
{142960}{143007}Let me go and it's yours!
{143010}{143075}I won't say anything,|I swear.
{143087}{143120}Give it to me!
{143320}{143347}Shoot, Ramona!
{143412}{143495}Shoot again, stupid!|She's getting away!
{143500}{143532}Stupid? Me?
{143535}{143587}-You don't know me.|-Just shoot, damnit!
{143697}{143797}Not my Cookie! Not my Cookie!|Not my Cookie!
{143802}{143882}What are you doing, Ramona?|Stay calm!
{143887}{143955}-You go that way!|-We're together in this!
{143970}{144002}Yes, yes, yes...
{144097}{144137}What are you doing?
{144445}{144487}I'm going after you, honey.
{144670}{144712}Don't run, honey!
{145082}{145177}You're getting out of here,|but feet first!
{145440}{145487}Give it to me right now!
{145527}{145590}-You wanted to cut in line.|-Let go!
{145595}{145640}You wanted it|all for yourself!
{145657}{145695}You pig!
{145707}{145775}What did you do to Emilio?|What?
{145820}{145885}You want to keep the suitcase.
{145982}{146022}How does that feel?
{146220}{146295}Give me the suitcase.|You won't need it.
{146767}{146827}You hypocrite!
{146832}{146865}You hold that suitcase
{146870}{146907}like your soul
{146910}{146975}was inside!|You're just like us,
{146980}{147010}like everyone!
{147030}{147095}No, I won't be like you!
{147137}{147177}You can't help it.
{147187}{147242}You were born that way,
{147252}{147295}it's in your blood!
{147342}{147382}You ran over everyone.
{147420}{147492}Say you're like me!|Say it!
{147515}{147547}No, Ramona.
{147567}{147607}You'd never do this!

{149657}{149697}THE BEAR AND THE MADROÑO TREE
{149980}{150067}I spent three days at the bear|statue before I heard about the bar.
{150120}{150207}Why didn't you tell me|about the suitcase?
{150212}{150290}They'd have noticed and|you wouldn't have escaped.
{150302}{150330}Only that?
{150360}{150440}I also wanted to see|if you were like my mom.
{150477}{150502}Want some consommé?
{150510}{150570}-With sherry.|-Another one, please.
{150577}{150622}What was in|the other suitcase?
{150625}{150675}You're something else!
{150680}{150712}You don't deserve it.

{151420}{151492}Portugal, why do you|seem so happy?
[over radio]: We've been hit!
Everybody, brace for impact!
Jake, I want to ask you something, and it stays between us.
What do you know about
Russian-Palestinian relations?
VANCE:
Sergei Mishnev.
Our intel says Sergei survived.
How? I hit him.
He went down.He got up.
What?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[gunshot]
Only the beginning, my friend.
MAN:
Well, you know the deal with them two, don't you?
Them two who?
Judge McGraff?
And Wilson, the D.A.
The two of them used to be college sweethearts.
Is that a fact?Check 'em out next time you're in court-- little looks between 'em, smiles.
He objects, she sustains, every time.The old flame's still burning, huh?I think they'd burn it up right there on the bench if they could.
Keyes, you are bad.
Not as bad as this yahoo.
[siren blaring]
Pull over to the side, please.
[siren continues blaring]
[siren stops]
[indistinct radio chatter]
How we doing tonight, sir?
License and registration, please.
[knocking on window]
What do we have there?
It's okay.
It's prescription bourbon.
[exhales]
You know, all fairness to alcohol,
I've done stupid things when I was sober, too.
I'm glad you think it's funny.It's not.
But it's nothing
I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about, either.
So you called me?
I figured I could count on you for the shortest lecture.
Bourbon... Tobias?
Yeah. I barely cracked it.
It was mainly the beer
I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine
I still take for when you shot me in the ass.
It smarts like hell in cold weather.No, no.
I saw the police report.
That was a fluke thing, which I intend to learn from and put behind me.
And if you were my friend, you'd do the same thing.
[phone ringing]
Yeah, Leon?
Uh-huh.
Where?
What's up?
Let me know if you need me, Gibbs.
I owe you one.No, you don't!
[chuckles softly]
NCIS.
Gibbs.
Fire's out. Your team just got here. Wardroom.
Are you still thinking gas explosion?Well, I'm hoping.
Galley's one compartment over.
We're thinking maybe a leaky stove or an oven.
Who are all these suits?
Dignitaries from a dozen international agencies.
We'd just started boarding when this happened.
But there were a bunch of crew members in there setting up.
SECNAV?On the West Coast-- we were patching her in on closed circuit.What's the occasion?
It's a summit on global terror.
No irony there.
I'm not going there, Gibbs.
Keep thinking gas leak.
[camera shutter clicks]
Welcome to the party, boss.
Casualties.
Uh, six reported injured, two are in sick bay, two more seriously being rushed to Norfolk Memorial.
[sighs]:
And one dead.
Female petty officer.
Can't make out her name tag.
I'll call Ducky.
This is no gas explosion.Yeah.
We had our doubts.There's no smell of gas.
Just gunpowder.TONY: And then there's this.
Bomb fragment?
It's in Russian-- it says "grenade."Just because it's in Russian doesn't mean it's...
Sergei Mishnev.
We knew he wasn't done yet, Gibbs-- just a matter of time.This means you're the target.
Any friend of yours is an enemy of his.
Let me check the guest list.
The Russian ambassador had to cancel, so they sent someone in his place.Someone we know?
Another friend.
Director Vance.
Agent Gibbs.
VANCE:
Counselor Pavlenko.Thank goodness you're all right.
I just heard about the explosion.
Interesting you being late.
Was anyone hurt?
Do we know what happened?
Wehave a pretty good idea.
A bomb?A Russian grenade.
You think Sergei?You don't?
And here you are conveniently rolling in after the fact.
Gentlemen, please, do not tell me we're going to engage in this farce yet again.
You have to admit, Counselor...
I admit nothing.
In fact, let me assure you, Director, if Sergei is behind this,
Iwas his target.
Not you.
Not Agent Gibbs. Me.
PAVLENKO:
I cannot believe I am forced to defend myself once again for the actions of a criminal.
A Russian criminal,
Counselor, with whom you once had a working relationship.
Once, Director.
And we have paid dearly for that mistake, leaving Sergei now a man without a country.
Freeing you up to play the victim.
Not a victim, Gibbs-- a target, like you.
For reasons that make sense only to Sergei.
Reasons such as?
Your helicopter crash.
He saw my help in the rescue as a betrayal.
Help?
And now he perceives that I owe my life to Agent Gibbs for saving me from our defector, the scientist.
You shoot Nelly Benin dead, and now we're practically golf buddies.
I don't golf.
Well... who has time?
I mean, really.
Gibbs, my sympathy for your loss--
I have suffered a few myself-- but we are in this together.
No, we're not.
All due respect, Counselor, you created this monster.
Don't fool yourself, Director.
Many hands went into creating Sergei.
Now, please, tell me what I can do.
What can I say, Gibbs, to convince you that I am on your side here?
You stay out of my way.
[distorted, echoing clicking of camera shutter]
Dear, a mere child.
Tell me about it.Eager to serve, to learn, to see the world and experience its many adventures.
Until along comes a coward with a bomb.GIBBS:
Update.
Where are we?DUCKY: We are tired of this insidious monster,
Jethro, that's where we are.Take a number, Duck.
McGee.We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments.
Looks like only one was used.Get everything to Abby now.All right.
Now!
I want a list of every delivery this ship's received in the past 48 hours. Bishop?
We've I.D.'d the victim--
Petty Officer Third Class
Katherine Gomez.
Assigned to the ship only three weeks ago and...Witness interviews?
Well, we were just about to get started.
TONY: Sick bay just gave us clearance.
We're just waiting to hear from the hospital.
Sick bay-- that's where we start. Let's go.
Come on, let's move.
We can handle it.
What?Bishop and I can handle the interviews-- might be better.
Better?
What's better, DiNozzo?
What are you trying to say? Spit it out.
Well, your... bedside manner might be...
[exhales] You might be too close to this.
DUCKY:
He's saying take a breath, Jethro!
It's good advice for all of us.
[phone ringing]
Emily, why are you still using your mother's phone?
Only to call certain people.
I need to see you right away.
Get you a soda or some water or something, Em?
No. I just had a low-foam latte, and this won't take long.
I've got debate quarterfinals in an hour.
High school debate?I am varsity captain as a freshman.
Arguing's pretty much in my blood.
We could have done this over the phone.No, we couldn't.
I know about you bailing out my dad this morning.
Wasn't exactly bailing him out.
He's going through a tough time.Don't soft-pedal me,
Uncle Gibbs.
He looks nuts with that bald head.
It's an undercover operation.
You don't believe that.
Last week he shaved it twice in one day.
Said it helps him feel clean.
[sighs]
Since Mom died, he's been... angry... bitter, self-destructive... oh, and... drunk-- he's drinking way too much.
You know what he's experiencing.
I try to help, but he doesn't listen to me, and I've got my own grief to work through.
How's that going?Some good days... some awful.
All compounded by being a teenager who can't be expected to maintain a teenage social calendar if I'm too busy worrying about... my father hurting himself or anyone else.
Okay, I'll talk to him.No.
Help him.
Please.
I will.
Thank you.
ABBY:
It's an oldie but a baddy, McGee.
McGEE:
Russian RKG-3 antitank grenade.
Straight out of a Rambo movie.
Actually, it dates back further than that.
They still keep showing up in Iraq and Afghanistan.Yeah, and... here.
Any shot at tracing it?
Come on, McGee.
You know, if there is anything
[phone ringing]on these grenade fragments that'll lead us back to Sergei,
I will find it.
Yeah, Tony?
Already?
Okay, I'll be right up.
[exhales]
Gibbs wants an update, and they just got back from the ship.
You said yourself
Gibbs is on fire.
Like you've never seen before, Abby.
We've seen it.
Not like this.
I'm telling you, if Sergei gets away again, there's not a level of hell below where Gibbs is right now.
Then we can't let him get away again.
Petty Officer Gomez was a culinary specialist setting up a catering station when the bomb went off.
As for the witness interviews, no one in the ship's sick bay could say where the blast originated.
Did you show them
Sergei's mug shot?
Them and everyone else-- no one reported seeing him.
FORNELL: Well, hell, it's not like Sergei would deliver the bomb personally.
Tobias...Sorry to interrupt.
Just got word about the ship.
And you're on leave.Not any longer.
[clears throat]
FBI is here to help.
Continue.
Uh...
Go.
There were two other victims that were taken to Norfolk Memorial.
Both are still in surgery, but we'll interview them as soon as they're able.
Abby's checking the grenade fragments for prints.
Grenade fragments?
Let's get a cup of coffee.No, I'm good.
He used a grenade?Hey, I'm not asking.
Come on.
Hey. What are you doing?
What are youdoing?
VANCE:
Gibbs and Fornell, my office.
Now.
FORNELL: It's just a lack of sleep, Leon.
You know it better than anybody.
Same with Gibbs.
Until Sergei is dead, there's no peace.
But unlike Gibbs, you've let your demons get the better of you.
I can smell it on you.
One Bloody Mary!
With lunch!
Before I heard about the bombing.
Gibbs and I were just getting coffee.
I need you to wait outside.Look, I deserve a shot at Sergei.
More than anyone.And I need to have a word with Gibbs, so please have a seat outside.
[quietly]: You want a shot at him or not?
We can't cover for him, Gibbs.Give him some time.
Let me talk to him.And say what?
Does he look like he's listening to anybody right now?
This is his whole career on the line, Leon, his life.And what about your life, Gibbs?
He's a danger to himself, his fellow agents and to us.
FBI has to know, if they don't already.
Gibbs, this kills me, but we can't cover for him, and you know it.
Assistant Director
Wilt, please.
[dial tone droning]
[sets handset in cradle]
Have you lost your damn mind?I will take full responsibility.
I will get Fornell out of the way.
I'll leave my team to go after Sergei.You're gonna do what?
You're gonna leave your team?They're more than capable, Leon, and I'll be a phone call away.
Gibbs, this is Sergei Mishnev we're talking about.
And maybe it's me that's too close.
Maybe it's me andFornell.And you think
I'll just let you?That or bench me.
Or trust me.
Well, I never thought
I'd see the day.
And where are you gonna go, Gibbs?
Where are you gonna take him?
[grumbles]
[revs engine]
[engine turns off]Where are we?
Come on. Help me unload.
Holy Jeremiah Johnson.
Are you kidding me?!
[exhales sharply]
[shivers]
This is not what we agreed to.
You said we were going after Sergei.No, no.
You said that.
I said let's go.
Which would imply agreement!
What the hell are we doing out here?
Wait a minute.
An intervention?
Is that what this is?
Do you think you need one?No! I mean, last night was bad, yes, but-but not bad enough to make any kind of New-Age come-to-Jesus even remotely necessary!Oh, good, that's not what this is.
No more slow-motion suicide, Tobias.
You want to kill yourself... fine with me.
Go ahead.
I'll even come with you.
[trembling breath]
Still no word from Gibbs?
Not a peep since he left last night.
Huh.I can't believe he'd leave at a time like this, even to help Fornell.Well, family first-- not to mention your brave suggestion that he might just be too close.
Are you mocking me?
Well... he obviously took it to heart.
Okay.
Number one, that's adorable.
And number two, Gibbs would never bail on a case, much less a Sergei case; and much, much less at my suggestion.
Unless he had a plan.
[phone ringing]
Special Agent McGee.
Oh, great, great.
Thanks for letting us know.
We'll be right there.
Hospital.
Both victims are awake and well enough to be interviewed.
Hey. Gibbs's plan, McGee-- what do you think it is?Oh, I have no idea.
I just know that he wouldn't leave unless he had one.
I'm with you, McTuitive.
Gibbs has to be up to something.
[cell phone ringing]
Oh.
Maybe we're about to find out.
Morning, boss.
Okay. Where are we, DiNozzo?
We are in the big orange room.
We know where we are.
Where are you?
McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?
Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.
Really?You didn't tell us?
Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.
I don't.
And I don't want someone coming here when you do tell them after you hang up.
All right, so what can we do for you?
Well, for starters, you can give me an update.
Well, we're still combing the ship's deliveries the last 48 hours.
Nothing yet.We were just about to leave for the hospital.
McGee got a call because the...
[retching]
[retching continues loudly over phone]
Boss, is that you choking, or are you choking someone?
Got to go.
Call me after the interviews.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is there anything you want to tell us?
Yeah, like, is there a... plan of any kind?
You need a plan?
Catch Sergei.
That's a little vague.
Wait.
Who was that?
Morning, sunshine.
Was that your team?
Is there any progress?
[shudders]
They're working on it.
Did you sleep well?
I hate you, Gibbs.
What are we doing out here?
Where's my cell phone?
How would I know that?Give me yours.
I need to call Emily.
No, no, no. Hey, hey,
Emily's fine.
She's staying with friends.
I talked to her.
You called?
She's in on this?
No.
She's okay.
Fine. You win.
What now?
"What now" what?What do we do next?
Bang drums? Sweat lodge?
Squirrel juggling?
Oh, really?
You think it's a good idea to hand me an ax right now?
Well, yeah.
It's cold, Tobias.
It's getting colder.
That, uh... that ass wound of yours... bet it's acting up, huh?
I'll make coffee.
Milk, two-percent.
Black.
Right.
You have any fake sugar?
Why do I even ask?
So you're not military?
MAN:
Uh, no, sir.
In fact, that was my first time on a Navy ship.
He was so excited when he left the shop.
Now look at him.
Sorry. The shop?
Uh, video and sound.
Navy had us running a satellite for anyone who couldn't attend the breakfast.
Like your Navy Secretary.Our SECNAV, yeah.
Were you there, Mr. Boulos?No.
I just do the books now.
Frankie's in charge of the new equipment.
Which we don't care about losing, by the way.
All that matters is my boy is alive.
Frankie, is there anything specific that you can recall before the explosion?
The crew was nice.
I was running a sound check, and the last thing I remember was thinking maybe we'd been torpedoed.
[groans]
I just can't believe
Katie's dead.
You and the petty officer were friends?
She was new, but yeah.
Happiest CS-Three anyone ever met.
And you were nearby when the explosion happened?
We were setting out pastries and joking about eating them all.
And the next thing I knew, sh... she went flying across the room.
Her parents.
She talked about them all the time.
Do they know yet?
Yeah.
Navy's flying them in now.
Who would do something like this?
Excuse me. Tony?
All right. Thank you.
I hate Sergei.
Did I say that?
Yeah, me, too.
Me three.
But if you don't mind,
I just need to vent about something else for a second.
Oh, no. What did we do?
No, not you.
Jake. He just called.
You know that dinner he and Gibbs ended up having last week?
The one that you and Tony ditched.
We did not ditch.
We were working.
But it did leave them to be BFFs.
More than any of us realized.
Apparently, Gibbs asked Jake to share intel.
Everything NSA has on
Russian-Palestinian relations.
Sergei Mishnev,
Anton Pavlenko...
He didn't say anything to us about it.
Because he didn't want us or anyone knowing.
But how could Jake not tell me?
Well, that's a marriage thing, but it sounds like he just did.
Only because Gibbs called early this morning and told Jake to send us everything he had and that we would know what to do with it.
Oh. Could that be part of a plan?[cell phone chiming]
Well, the e-mail just came through.
It's a huge file.
Let's go.
I dumped it.
What?
The bourbon-- it's gone.
What are you, my mother?
What are you trying to prove?
I don't need you monitoring my intake.
Ah, it seems to me you do.
Well, I don't.
And I don't need this.
Yeah, well, neither do I... but here we are.
[cup clatters on floor]
I'm done.
"Done." With what?
Embarrassing yourself?
Or-or maybe you mean embarrassing the badge.
You've done a good job at both.
Oh...
That all you got, Alice?
Yah!
[grunts]
[coughs]
Do you feel better?
We should be in D.C. looking for Sergei.
Not in this condition.
Geez, forget about Sergei.
What's really bothering you?
Don't Freud me, Gibbs.
You're not qualified.
You know what
I'm asking.
Back off.You blame me.
Jethro...
It's okay, Tobias.
I blame me.
I'm the one who got her killed.
[sighs]
If Diane wasn't on that rooftop, she would be alive.
And you wouldn't be walking around pretending like I wasn't the one who put her there.
So it's all about you.Yeah.
It is all about me.
And it's about you, and it's about Diane, and it's about the drinking, and it's about all of it.
No, my friend.
It's just me.
I killed her.
No one to blame but myself.
And now I really need a drink.
[sighs]
That NSA intel give us anything?
Oh, we are just getting started, Director, and there is a whole lot to comb through.
Stuff in here about the Soviets in Afghanistan, the mujahideen...
Wait a second.
Got something about Sergei and the Russian Counselor
Pavlenko.
Our "friend" Anton.
What is it?They go way back.
All the way to college.
They competed at
Saint Petersburg University in the biathlon.
Isn't that the one where they cross-country ski and shoot rifles?TONY:
Yeah.
As random Olympic sports go, it's sort of the equivalent of bullfighting on a trampoline.
That explains a lot.
Go on.
Well, they were friendly rivals for a while, contending for the Soviet Olympic team.
When neither of them made the cut,
Pavlenko went to law school and Sergei discovered the Afghan heroin trade.
Explains even more.
Like his soft spot for an old college buddy gone bad.
Making Pavlenko less of a cold, duplicitous creep, and more of a sentimental, duplicitous creep.
[dog barks in distance]
[grunts]
Sergei...
[speaking Russian]
This is America. Speak English.
We are quite alone,
I assure you.
Yeah? The last time you assured me,
I lost good men in the Kola Peninsula.
It was no assurance.
It was a warning.
To stay away from NCIS.
You chose to ignore it, and where are you now?
Setting off hand grenades and hiding in alleys?
It's not how you fall, Anton.
It's how you rise.
Remember that one?
Which is why I called you.
To help you rise, Sergei.
With a proposal from the Russian government.
The government that wants me dead.
I convinced them to give you asylum.
Complete immunity, on one condition.
This should be good.
Kill Gibbs.
Your vendetta has dragged on long enough.
We need it to end.
And I have your blessing now?
Why now?
Why the sudden change of heart?
You owe Gibbs your life.
I know you believe that, like I once did, but...
That what? What?
Tell me. Convince me.
Nelly Benin.
The scientist.
She's alive.
Gibbs killing her to save my life was a ruse.
An elaborate sleight of hand to help her defect.
And you know we don't like defectors.
And I don't like being played for a fool.
Is there a timetable?
Now.
Today.
My people know exactly where he is.
I can have you there in a matter of hours.
[bird singing, duck quacking]
FORNELL:
This is insane.
I'm sure I saw cans of tuna in those grocery bags.
You never fished as a kid?
In the summer, sure.
Finger Lakes.
I loved it.
I should get back to it.
But there's a lot I don't do enough of anymore.
Get outdoors, work with my hands...
[reel spinning]
Whoa, look at this.
Yeah.
Reel her in. Steady.
Yeah, I got it.
[grunts]
Beauty!
[laughs]Look at that.
It's big enough for two.
I'm not sharing.
Let's get you one.
Am I reading this right?
Sergei is originally from Israel?
Born in 1965.
Father, Dimitri, was a Russian officer stationed there.
Nothing here about his mother.
Wait a second,
I got something on her.
This report says his mother was a doctor, a Saudi national with
Palestinian roots.
Apparently, the father took Sergei back to Russia when he was ten, leaving his mother behind.
Birth of some issues right there.
What?
Am I missing something?
You think that's what's driving him?
No wonder the guy's pissed off.
Uh... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Details. Now.
Your predecessor at that desk,
Ziva David, had a half-brother.
Ari Haswari. Same father.
I know the story.
Ari's mother was also a doctor with Palestinian roots.
So it's quite possible that Sergei and Ari were...
Half-brothers.
Which would explain the depth of his hatred for Gibbs.
Should we call him?McGEE:
Well, I don't know what he'd do with that information at the cabin, other than punch out a grizzly bear.
TONY:
It does open up a whole new world of possible allies for Sergei.
[phone beeps]
McGee.
ABBY:
Okay, which one of you wants to be Gibbs Gibbs
Gibbs Gibbs Gibbs?
Be right there, Abbs.
I mean, it wasn't a bad little table.
I mean, Diane would always stick a matchbook under one leg to remind me that
I'd measured wrong, but she never got rid of it.
Probably just to torture me,
I guess.
She liked that you built it.
Well, she was always a pushover for that manly man stuff.
God knows it worked for you.
I don't know about that.
You're the one she kept remarrying, not me.
Right?
What the hell are we doing here?
One fish is enough.
Where's your team with those updates?
26 separate pieces of grenade fragments, and there's not a single fingerprint on any of them.
Not even a partial.
So what's the urgency,
Miss Sciuto?
The urgency is that this type of grenade doesn't go off by itself.
I mean, you have to turn the handle and throw it, and then boom.
But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator.
Which we never found.
But you did find it.
Or at least a piece of it.
It's this, right here.
Looks like a blob of plastic.
That's because it's a blob of plastic.
But before it melted, it was a highly sensitive, paper-thin plastic sheet that vibrates at certain sound frequencies, triggering whatever device it's attached to.
The A/V guy.
Frankie Boulos.
He said that the grenade exploded while he was doing a sound check.
Could his voice have set it off?
It would depend on his voice.
I mean, it's more sensitive with higher-pitched frequencies.
I mean, unless the device was super close to the sound equipment.
Or if it was planted inside the sound equipment?
Oh, yeah.
Now, this is pretty great.
What?
Oh, yeah.
[clears throat]
Come on, man.
Gotta eat.
Later, maybe.
Not that hungry.
Are you gonna make me ask you again?
You mentioned before about Diane and me getting remarried.
In the end, she wasn't really so sure.
Natural to get cold feet.
No, it wasn't that.
We were arguing one night about something stupid.
I don't even remember what.
And in a fit of anger,
I told her that our being together, our rekindled romance, was a big mistake.
And I stormed out.
Next day, she called.
I was in a classified briefing, so she left a voice mail.
That's why I hope
I haven't lost my phone.
It's the only way
I can still hear her voice.
I was gonna give it back to you, eventually, anyway.
DIANE:
Hey, baby, it's me.
Um, look, can we just forget last night?
Between Jethro's wife number two in town and...
I don't know, let's hit rewind or delete or whatever.
I don't think we're a mistake at all, Tobias, and I pray you don't, either.
I know we can work through the petty stuff.
Jethro just texted me to meet him, but call me back as soon as you can, okay?
I love you, Tobias.
Call me.
Every word.
I agreed with every word she said, but instead of calling her right back,
I chose to play it small.
Petty.
Let her twist in the wind.
Serves her right.
And then she was gone.
Died thinking it might be over between us.
Not truly knowing how much I loved her.
No, she knew.
"We're making a big mistake."
Those were the last words she heard me say.
And for that,
I can never forgive myself.
Could you?
[choked up]:
If I had a daughter, yeah.
That's her daughter, Tobias.
You want Diane to know how much you love her?
That's the only chance you got left.
Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Is everything all right?
Something's come up since our interview this morning.
We want to show you a photo.
Okay.
Before the bomb went off yesterday, do you recall seeing this man?
Uh, I don't know.
He looks kind of familiar.
Kind of?
Mm-hmm.
What is this?
My son needs his rest.
How many times are you going to disturb him?
McGEE:
Mr. Boulos, I'm sorry.
We... we have a few more questions to ask.
What did you tell them?
Not as much as you're about to tell us.
GIBBS:
Hang on.
What's that?
The last part.
You're breaking up.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Say it again.
Can you hear me?
DiNozzo!
DiNozzo?
What's going on?
Ah... they got a suspect, but... I lost him.
I got cut off.
A suspect? Not Sergei?
No, somebody else, but there's a connection.
They're bringing him in for questioning. Check your cell.
Same here-- no bars.
But who cares? Let's go!
Go?
Yes.
If Sergei is involved, you and I should do the questioning.
But it's not Sergei; it's somebody else, and we're not done here yet.
What?
Oh, yes, we are.
I'm done.
You think so?
I know so.
I was just sitting here, feeling not lousy for the first time in I don't know when.
And I appreciate it, Gibbs.
Little wake-up call to my liver.
Getting to say things out loud that I never thought I'd say.
I may not be whistling rainbows just yet, but I got the message.
One night is enough.
You're right.
I need to see my little girl.
Not yet.
What do I need here, a safe word?
What's going on?
There's something else here.
What are you not telling me?
Sergei is no friend.
We played together as boys in Palestine and reconnected as young men in Kabul.
Reconnected as he was making his name in the heroin trade?
Which I wanted no part of.
I-I came to this country to pursue the American dream.
I've been doing just that for years, until Sergei walked into my shop last week.
Had to be a surprise.Not a happy one.
He knew we had been contracted by the Navy and insisted I help him deliver a package.
A package?
His threat to my family was clear.
I could not say no.
He placed it inside a speaker and assured me my son would be safe.
How'd your son feel about it?
MR. BOULOS:
I could not tell him.
And my deceit nearly cost his life.
Someone else wasn't so lucky.
TONY:
Okay.
Where do we find him?
I wish I knew.
When I saw him today,
I wanted to kill him myself.
He saw Sergei?
You saw him today?
He had the nerve to call, pretending to be concerned for my son, then demanding a device.
What kind of device?I keep only one in stock for the proper authorities to use.
It's a transmitter that blocks cell-tower reception.
BISHOP:
A cell-phone jammer.
MR. BOULOS:
It's portable, long-range,[dialing] very expensive.
[line ringing]
And he just took it.
Come on, Gibbs, pick up.
Sergei.
Not Gibbs... but Special Agent Fornell, is it?
We've yet to be formally introduced.
I know you... you murdering son of a bitch.
Yes.
My apologies.
I meant only to hurt Gibbs.
Never realizing how much
Miss Sterling got around.
Where is he?
Like I'd ever tell you.
I took the mother of your child.
Do you think
I'd hesitate to make that little girl an orphan altogether?
Suit yourself.
[groaning]
[grunting]
We're back in the Russian forest?
Out to rewrite history,
Agent Gibbs?
Turn back the clock?
FORNELL:
If only that were possible.
Where is Gibbs?
This is between... me and him, and no one else.
This is between you and me now, Sergei.
Perhaps you don't know,
Agent Fornell, what Gibbs took from me.
Oh, I know all about your family tree.
But I have a family, too.
This is for Diane.
And this?
What is this?
What is this?
What?
Well, it seems to me that you have some options.
You could drop that sidearm, raise your arms and surrender...
Not exactly my style.
No.
Or you could run, make us hunt you down.
See what that feels like.
[click]
FORNELL:
I got him.
Yeah.
You feel better?
Not even close.
Well, maybe a little.
Gibbs.
I just heard from DiNozzo and McGee.
Mishnev is still dead.
That supposed to be a joke, Leon?
He fooled us before.
Not this time.
That's for sure.
Man, I really do look like hell.
Did you think we were lying to you, Tobias?
Well, it's nothing a hot shower can't fix.
Amen to that, Leon.
And a hot meal with my daughter.
Well, then, our timing's perfect.
And I was thinking more of sushi?
FORNELL:
Whatever you want, baby.
Whatever you need, it's yours.
Well, then...
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
And unless you need anything else,
Jake is waiting for me.
We have much to discuss.
Go easy on him.
Good night.
What, Leon?
Nothing.
Unless there's something
I should know.
Some detail I missed you might need to tell me.
Good night, Gibbs.
Night.
[knock at door]
Yeah, it's open.
Come on in.
[door opens]
Open.
Why am I not surprised?
Hello, Anton.
Don't have any vodka, but there's a cold beer in the fridge.
You are considerate... but I cannot stay.
I understand we had some success.
You could say that.
I admit I was nervous.
He was quite suspicious at first, but you were right.
When I told him you killing
Nelly Benin was a fake, he bought it-- as you say-- hook, line and sinker.
People believe what they want to believe.Had he not, we might not be having this conversation right now.
But here we are.
[speaks Russian]
Counselor.
Thank you.

Picture a waterfall running into a beautiful, clean river.
You stand on the bank of the river.
Soft grass brushes against your bare feet.
The water is clear as crystal.
The sky is profoundly blue and everything is clean.
Now take a drag on your cigarette.
Look at the sky now.
You've poisoned the sky.
Now look at the water.
It stinks.
Throw away your cigarette.
Now look at the water.
What do you see?
You won't want to smoke anymore now.
Good.
- That’s 150 pounds, is it?
- Yeah.
Cash.
Yeah. I knew that.
Try to avoid things you associate with cigarettes.
- Alcohol, stress...
- Sex.
If you get the urge to smoke, just clear your mind.
Revisit the beautiful meadow, the cool river.
But... think only nice thoughts.
No more... little girls floating underwater, okay?
- Come in.
- What did you say?
I have another appointment.
Come in, please.
Now, take a drag of your cigarette and look at the water.
- Look how dirty it has become.
- I need to speak to you.
Look at the filthy sky.
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of...
Why did you mention the girl?
- You have to leave.
- You saw her, didn't you?
- I didn't see anything.
- A girl in a white nightgown... underwater, in my head.
That 's amazing. That 's incredible.
You could help me.
Something bad happened.
Now she won't talk.
Not a word.
She needs to tell what, you know, happened.
I'm sorry.
I just do cigarettes. Bye.
Is it lunch time yet?
No, it 's dinner time.
And it 's daddy's turn to cook... so you'll just have to wait.
Martha! Yuk! Yuk!
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hi, honey.
- Look what I got for you.
- A doggy!
- Thank you, daddy.
- How's my girl?
Fine.
Sorry.
Great. A toy that barks all day.
Only when you touch his head.
How was your day?
Long. Lonely.
Nicer now you're here.
Martha's starving.
Again?
- Guess what I'll cook for dinner?
- Macaroni and cheese.
- How did you guess?
- That 's what you always make.
"That 's what you always make!"
Take this.
Come on. Come here.
What are you worrying about?
- Is it kicking?
- Tap dancing on my kidneys.
I think I should find a new office.
- What about over a tobacco shop?
- I'm serious.
Let 's save a little money first, okay?
It 's gonna be all right here,
Michael.
- It 's just like home.
- You think so?
It will be. When we get this place fixed up... find Martha a better school... make at least one friend.
I'm kidding.
- I like the English. They're so...
- What?
Outgoing.
Hello, Dr. Strother.
Mind if I call you Michael?
- I'm late.
- I'll walk up with you.
- Is it about the...?
- No. No craving at all.
I gave you my final word about the other thing.
Why do you charge cash? Do you have a National Insurance number?
Does the Inland Revenue even know about you?
If you don't leave me alone,
I'll call a policeman.
I'm a policeman. Policewoman.
Police person.
You want to see my badge?
I don't care about your taxes.
All I care about is that yesterday you did two impossible things.
- Two?
- I haven't thought about smoking.
I can't read minds.
Nobody can.
Then how do you explain yesterday?
A feeling. Intuition.
It happens to everyone, even to you.
You just don't pay any attention.
I'll pay you 5OO pounds, cash.
If you can get her to talk.
You don't know what you're asking.
- I'm asking you to help a child.
- I'm sorry, no.
Well, you will be sorry when I shop you to the taxman.
- So, where in America did you live?
- Seattle.
- That 's a Seattle accent, is it?
- No.
I'm from Europe, just like you.
I moved to America1O years ago.
I'm not from Europe, I'm from
London. Wouldn't live anywhere else.
This is where we're keeping her.
Her mother's name is Grace.
She's not going to like you.
Ready?
- No.
- You'll be fine.
Hello, Keith. This is Dr. Strother, come to see Heather.
- Is she awake?
- I've had no word about this.
No. Typical, ain't it?
Hi, Grace.
What 's this?
Another doctor?
This one's special.
Got me off the fags in one session.
A bloody miracle.
- How's Heather?
- Same.
- Any words?
- Not a sound.
I won't do anything unless you say so.
Damn right you won't.
He just talks.
That 's all.
He won't even touch her.
I trust him.
Well, go on then.
- Could you...?
- Sorry. Keith, sit down.
Hi, Heather.
My name is Michael.
Is this a new one?
Do you like music videos?
You know, sometimes... the lights and colours act like musical notes.
See how the colours get brighter as the beat gets louder?
You can almost feel the music on your face, can't you?
And on your chest.
And the louder the music gets... the brighter the colours get until... they merge into one.
One great, white light.
It 's almost difficult to watch, isn't it?
Difficult to keep your eyes open.
Maybe you should close your eyes.
Just for a moment.
Let them close.
You'll feel better.
Don't fight it.
Just close your eyes.
That 's much better, isn't it?
Now tell me, Heather... what do you see with your eyes closed?
Like stars in the night sky?
Millions and millions of stars stretching away to infinity.
Travel through them... past them... beyond them.
Now faster... and faster and faster.
And now you see one very bright star ahead of you.
The most beautiful star you've ever seen.
And it comes closer... and closer.
You feel happier and happier.
The light covers you up.
Swallows you.
Makes you feel safe and warm.
And now... you pass through the light... to the other side.
To the place where you lost your voice.
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Where are you?
Heather!
Wake up.
Wake up, Heather!
You talked!
I don't know what you said, but you talked! Tell me something! Anything!
Are you all right?
She's that girl in the papers...
...who escaped the Tattoo Murderer?
- Yeah, well spotted.
I don't want anything to do with her.
Michael, you were brilliant.
- She didn't actually talk, but...
- Just forget about me, okay?
- Did you see anything?
- No.
Yes. I mean, nothing really.
Losey, it 's dangerous.
If I screw up, she could...
Christ!
You're gonna have to tell me everything.
She was kidnapped from her home in Hackney 3 weeks ago.
1O days later she crawled out of a canal near Lime house.
She had bruises. No broken bones.
No evidence of sexual assault.
She had quite a few needle marks on her arms and legs... but no trace of any identifiable drugs in her blood or hair.
And no indication, yet, of any particular infections.
The only thing we have to go on, really... is the tattoos.
Have a look at these.
Mean anything to you?
No.
Not really.
What do you mean, "not really"?
We found traces of wicker under her nails and in her hair.
He may have kept her locked up in some kind of basket, Michael.
She's lucky she got away.
The other three dead kids were all tattooed the same way.
All of them died from catastrophic serological reaction to blood... human blood of the wrong type, injected into their veins.
They were all type "O".
Heather's type "AB".
So what are you saying? She's got the killer's blood in her veins?
Probably.
So, what did you see, Michael?
Nothing much. A face.
- Man or woman?
- Man.
- The killer?
- I don't know.
- Could you identify him?
- How?
- Well, we can make a photo fit.
- No.
So that 's it?
I guess so.
I haven't got 5OO quid.
I don't have to be a mind-reader to know that.
Stars in the night sky...
Heather!
Batteries. Where the hell am I gonna find batteries?
Moloch, Gog, Drammlach,
Lord of the Rats.
Hear the darkness beseech.
Hear the Darkness.
The Fabric of Sorrow beseech thee.
Yield once more the Contagion of Woe.
What are you doing?
Did I wake you?
It 's 3 o'clock in the morning!
I can't sleep.
Two nights in a row. Don't tell me we're gonna go down that road again.
I'm just...
I'm thinking about the baby.
You promised if we went somewhere completely different...
I will be okay. Okay?
I'll be up in a minute.
- Take a pill, Michael.
- I did.
Take another one.
What are his qualifications?
Is he even a medical man?
Is he certified in any specialties?
Do we know anything about him at all?
- What does he charge?
- He's working for free.
- That 's pretty damn suspicious.
- He got through to her. She talked.
Right.
Why didn't you say so sooner?
What did she say?
Only gibberish, but it 's a start.
- Did you record any of this?
- Yeah.
- May we hear it?
- I haven't got it with me.
I was there, Chief. What Heather said didn't make any sense... but he was very good with her.
And you have vast experience in this field, do you?
No, ma'am.
Only gibberish?
Your only remit was to look after Heather's welfare?
- What?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
- That 's all you were asked to do.
- Listen... our experts on the occult can tell us all about zodiacs... but they can't tell us why we keep finding tattoos on dead children.
6O officers have spent 17 weeks and 6 million pounds... and all we know about this monster is he's certain to strike again, soon.
And you're gonna have to go on the telly again... and say we know fuck all again!
- I think Losey needs a holiday.
- I think you're right.
But...
I'm gonna allow her to continue, for now, with this...
Thank you.
On condition that you get me his full story.
- Home Office check, the works.
- You won't regret it, sir.
- I'd better bloody not.
- I'd like to record my objection.
Done.
You stole my tape, you bastard.
"Contagion of Woe,
Lord of the Rats".
- So what is that about?
- Hell if I know.
It 's hardly something an 11-year old girl would say.
It could be what we call a Flashbulb Memory.
A vivid recollection imprinted on the brain by trauma.
She probably just heard those words and doesn't know what they mean.
Jesus! Where are you going?
What about Heather?
We'll get there.
First, there's a man I wanna see.
Couldn't you see him later?
The researchers we've been using haven't come up with shite.
I talked to this guy on e-mail.
He's got a fucking weird website.
Paranormal, Aleister Crowley.
All kinds of creepy occult stuff.
I was gonna ask him about those tattoos, but... maybe he'll have some idea about this business, too.
It 's almost on the way.
Elliot?
Can I help you with anything?
You sent me an e-mail saying
I could come and talk to you here.
Right.
When I wrote that, I certainly didn't expect you to be a woman.
Well, I am.
Obviously.
I must admit you two don't look like the usual sort of...
...interested types.
- What do they usually look like?
- Me.
- I'm with the police, Elliot.
- But I haven't done anything.
- Of course not. We want your help.
Okay, well...
I'd be only too pleased.
You ever hear of
"The Lord of the Rats"?
Well, you tell her. Go on.
What 's this?
She's dressing up in my shoes.
The bike's in the way.
What is it, Heather?
Is it stuck?
Heather!
- Michael!
- Stop there, Heather.
Don't go any further.
Close the door.
Now come back to me and your mother, where it 's safe.
Come back to your painting.
- A pen. Quick.
- Pen. Keith?
You're back with your painting.
This time, Heather, I'd like you to draw a different picture.
Something you remember from that time.
Something that sticks in your mind.
Go on, Heather.
We're all here.
You're safe.
No one can hurt you.
The glass slipper fit perfectly.
So, they brought Cinderella back to the palace...
I just... realized she'd been gone too long.
I went to the door to check.
It was standing open.
Someone had just... taken her.
Let her sleep at least an hour.
I know how important giving up smoking is to you.
Your husband is not gonna leave you.
Well, okay, maybe he is.
I can fit you in tomorrow.
Tomorrow morning?
Well, yeah, okay.
I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry. Bye. Bye.
You're not sorry at all, are you?
- Lf my wife finds out, I will be.
- Jealous?
8 months pregnant, second child.
I can't afford to lose my clients.
I'd be jealous.
You're not married, are you?
Bit permanent, marriage.
I thought that 's supposed to be the attraction.
- Impermanence has its attractions.
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- What are you looking for?
- Sleeping pills.
The bathroom window downstairs was wide open.
- So?
- So?
- Someone could get in.
- Someone 8 inches tall.
- Talk to me, Michael.
- I just need some sleep.
- Is it about money?
- No.
We have enough till things pick up.
Things will pick up.
Look how well you've done in the last 7 months.
This time next year you'll be booked solid and you can double your fees.
Then, write a book, sell videos.
Yeah, keep my head down, work the cigarettes.
You're the one who described it as saving lives.
What 's wrong, Michael?
Nothing, it 's...
- It 's just the sex.
- What?
I'm sure I just miss sex.
Honey, so do I.
Anyway, it 's... it 's not entirely out of the question.
What the...?
Relax your ankles, relax your knees... relax your stomach, relax your chest... relax your face.
Try to relax.
Relax your body completely.
Start with your toes.
Very relaxed.
Let the feeling move up to your legs.
Very, very relaxed.
All the way up to your stomach... chest...
Breathe deeply.
Feeling relaxed.
Very, very relaxed.
Please, no.
No.
"Nistnesus".
I'm sorry, just...
You're through to Hargrave Models.
Please leave a message.
Hi, it's Michael Strother.
We met a couple of days ago.
I wonder if the word "Nistnesus"... might mean anything to you?
Yeah, thanks.
Telephone number...
O2073...
- Have you got one, then?
- All right, all right.
Light.
Hey, look.
Let 's check it out.
Now, the diagrams you gave me... these three are pretty much standard hermetic stuff.
Just as all Christian sects use the symbol of the cross... most pre-Christian sects use the signs of the zodiac.
Likewise, certain number patterns.
Sacred numbers are very important to adherence of the Old Knowledge.
- I didn't know.
- Yes. Yes, oh yes. But... these other two diagrams, they're very interesting.
And very peculiar.
And they tie in absolutely with both the typed liturgical fragment... and the other term your partner called to ask about.
- Liturgical?
- Precisely.
A liturgy. A ceremony.
Do you mind my asking where you came across this stuff?
- Check this out.
- No way.
Wuss!
- Who's the wuss now?
- Fuck off, that 's blood!
- Hi, Elliot.
- Glad you could make it.
Elliot tells me you asked him to research something for you.
I assume this has got something to do with a crime.
- What sort of crime?
- What term did he ask you about?
"Nistnesus".
The unwitting will of the mind to flee the body.
What 's that all about?
Michael?
Something I thought of after you left.
Right. So, what 's the tie in?
Paladine. Francis Paladine.
He wrote the liturgy, invented the term "Nistnesus"... and he's the man you're after.
Is this Paladine a friend of yours?
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Only about 5OO years.
He was executed in France for heresy.
His living bowels were burned before his eyes.
He believed the soul was infused in the fore part of the brain... behind the eye.
Are there many practicing disciples of this Paladine these days?
I don't think there are any.
It was never a cult or anything.
So, how do you know all about it?
Well, I read books.
Try "The Hidden Light", by Catherine
Lebourg, there's a chapter on him.
Why don't you ask her yourself?
I'm sure she's still alive.
- You look like shit.
- I feel like shit.
- Are you having my house watched?
- You're getting paranoid.
Big silver Mercedes, lurking.
Drove off when I ran outside.
You don't need to watch my house!
Policemen in England are poor.
They don't drive big silver Mercs... they drive clapped out old bangers like this. You want a lift?
- No, I'll get a tube.
- Bye.
At least now we know what kind of trainers he wears.
Hallelujah.
I think we should get Heather here.
It might spark her off.
The American Medical Registry has no record of any Doctor Michael Strother.
- You checked him out?
- It was your assignment, wasn't it?
He's here on a student visa.
So is his wife.
- He could make us look very bad.
- That is not gonna happen, sir.
All I want from you is to look after Heather!
I don't want him going near her again!
Now stop running around playing detective!
Yeah, we had a little baby girl.
I'm walking through a crime scene... which I believe to be connected to the so-called "Tattoo Murders".
And just look at what I've found.
The mark of Edward Lippard-Smith.
Who was by no means a godd Christian.
What do you think you're doing here?
- I'm a consultant on this case.
- And I'm Britney Spears.
Did any of you happen to notice by whom this church was built?
Get a life!
I'll get it!
Jesus Christ! Martha?
Martha?
Martha?
Where's Martha?
I thought you were watching her.
All right?
Who the hell are you?
Gas man.
Reading your meter.
For God's sake, Michael! Martha's right out here in the garden.
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Take it easy.
Michael.
Absolutely.
Yes, sure, I will tell...
It 's very, very urgent that he gets this information.
Yes, Elliot Spruggs.
Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good night.
- Good night, daddy.
Your consultant just called.
- What?
- He thinks you're a policeman.
Spruggs. Elliot Spruggs.
I don't know anything.
Losey and Michael know everything.
All right?
I have Michael's number over there, by the telephone.
What are you doing?
Please don't.
That arsehole Elliot called my wife. I'm in the shit.
You can always come and stay with me.
Yeah, right.
Elliot said he'd been to the crime scene... and he took some important video footage.
I think we should go to his place ASAP.
Michael?
Sorry. It 's okay.
I'll meet you there.
Is it okay?
- I need to do this.
- What 's going on, Michael?
I'm helping the police treat a little girl.
The little girl in the papers?
Yeah.
Michael.
I think I can help her.
We've flown 4,OOO miles to start a new life in a new country... because you couldn't sleep in your own bed anymore! Remember?
- This is different.
- No! This is not different.
That 's why the insomnia's back, isn't it?
I'll be back soon.
Fuck!
You're a bit jumpy, aren't you?
The door's been forced open.
Elliot?
- What was he doing in the church?
- I don't know.
- Did you tell him about it?
- How? I didn't know anything.
Elliot could have followed me.
I drove straight to the church after meeting him.
We looked at the video, and his
"very important evidence".
It 's a19th century mark of an architect called...
Lippard-Smith.
Do you know anything about him?
No.
Pity.
Apparently the rat is recovering nicely.
It 's not your fault, Losey.
I think I know who we could ask about Lippard-Smith.
She won't be able to talk long, just had a biopsy.
Professor Lebourg, you've got guests.
And I'm not deaf.
I'll be in my office.
Well... don't just stand there grinning like monkeys. Do sit down.
- Professor...
- Please, call me Catherine.
- What 's your name?
- Strother. Michael Strother.
Are you famous?
No.
Pity. Is she?
No, I'm not famous, either.
We're doing some research.
We've been reading your book.
- Oh, yes? Which one?
- "The Hidden Light".
Not my best.
We are specifically interested in Francis Paladine.
A great man.
Greatly misunderstood.
Do you know of any active followers of his ideas?
Half the population of Silicon Valley.
I'm sorry?
Naturally none of them have ever heard of him... but they're all trying to download their consciousness into computers.
Or so I read.
Paladine was after the same kind of transfer.
5OO years ago.
Well, only his method was supposed to work from man to man.
Why?
How old were you when you first realized that one day you would die?
We'd also like to ask you about a19th century church architect... called Lippard-Smith.
Not a great man.
He built ten indifferent churches around London.
Was he interested in the occult?
Not as much as he was in prostitution.
Was Lippard-Smith a follower of Paladine?
I'm tired.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Not outside my house.
Drop me a bit further down.
Better wipe the lipstick off your cheek.
There is no lipstick, Michael.
- You need some rest.
- Yeah, I need some...
What 's wrong?
Michael.
...following the discovery of a body in East London.
Chief Inspector Clements confirmed that the derelict church... stumbled upon by two schoolboys yesterday... is linked to the "Tattoo Murders".
- Who the fuck are you?
- Easy, pal. I'm just doing my job.
The police are using you in the case, right? They are, aren't they?
Don't tell me you're a newspaper photographer?
Am I right?
Ask him why he left America.
We can look on it as free advertising.
I'm sorry.
Should we try Australia?
Didn't you realize that this case would put you in the public eye?
I had other things on my mind.
You didn't drown that man.
And saving this girl, or any other, is not gonna bring him back.
He could swim. He was on his high school team, but... something happened.
I never found out what.
And he developed a real terror of water.
He couldn't go near the lake or even a swimming pool.
So, where did you go wrong?
I did the thing someone like me should never, ever do.
I took away his fear.
I convinced him he had no reason at all to be afraid.
I made him feel invincible.
So the very next day he went down to the lake.
It was early April.
The ice had only just melted.
And... he went for a swim.
The coroner said... a man of his size and weight would have survived 1O minutes.
15 at most.
It would have been a case of suicide if I hadn't told them what I'd done.
- They blamed you for it.
- No. But the newspapers did.
Is that why you aren't registered as a doctor in America?
I'm registered, all right.
You checked up on me?
Of course you have.
Strother is my wife's name.
Hello?
Yes. Okay.
Number 35...
King Charles Avenue,
London, England.
- Martha?
- Bye.
- Who was that?
- A man.
St. Mary Magdalen, Clerkenwell.
St. John The Baptist, Whitechapel.
St. Luke, Westminster.
Holy Trinity, Bermondsey.
St. Stephen's, Blackheath.
What?
Nothing. It 's okay.
Go back to sleep.
Fuck!
- Have you seen my filofax?
- No.
I'm sure it was here.
- I haven't seen it.
- We need to get out of here now.
Heather, do you want a cone?
An ice-cream cone?
I'll go. Do you want one, Keith?
Sure.
With a flake.
And because... when I flick this switch... we will see on my screen... the answer to the biggest question of all.
Where exactly are we anyway?
That 's 3 pounds, please.
Thank you.
Thanks, love. Bye.
Bye.
What are you doing here?
I tried to call, but no-one here would give me the time of day.
My family needs protection.
Sorry, but we've got worse things than photographers to worry about.
- He was in my house last night.
- Go to the Press Complaints.
I mean the killer was in my house!
He did this.
And he took my filofax.
Oh, God.
He has the address of the safe house. Get Heather out of there.
What?
Keith is dead.
Heather's been kidnapped.
It 's all my fault.
That 's why I've been sacked.
Sign there, please, sir.
How long will you be staying?
Not sure.
Come on, sweetheart.
It 's not so bad, huh?
No, it 's fantastic.
We can put the baby's cot right here.
The changing table over there.
Sterilize the bottles downstairs.
- Dad, it 's cricket.
- It 's just like baseball, honey.
I'll find a way to make it up to you.
At this point, if anyone would let me on a plane...
I'd already be halfway home.
They will catch him. Soon.
Don't we at least get a guard?
Now he has Heather back, they think he won't bother us.
What 's he gonna do to her?
Francis Paladine.
A great man.
Greatly misunderstood.
He believed the soul was infused... in the fore part of the brain behind the eye.
The mark of Edward Lippard-Smith.
Who was, by no means, a good Christian.
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach,
Lord of the Rats. Hear me.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
Forthine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Listen.
What if the killer used that church specifically... because it was built by Lippard-Smith?
Maybe it 's some kind of sacred place.
I mean, sacred to him.
The killer.
And Lebourg said there were ten churches.
- Maybe he's in one of them.
- Clements is way ahead of you.
He checked them out.
They're all active places of worship... and the priests in charge are all on alert.
- There are only eight churches.
- But Lebourg said ten.
We got a list from the C of E.
Lippard-Smith never worked for anybody else.
They say there's only eight.
- Do you have the list?
- Yeah, I've probably got it.
Can you fax it to me?
There you go, sir.
Thanks.
Excuse me, can we get some more tea?
Daddy, are you looking for a better hotel?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy!
- Sweetheart.
- Hang on, I'll get it.
Wait a minute.
If we add one church here... and one here...
Losey, listen: Lebourg was right.
There are ten churches.
Look at your map.
If you add two more, one in
Shepherds Bush and one in Hackney...
Hold on, hold on.
...it makes a five pointed star.
Do you see?
Like the mark of Lippard-Smith.
- You're right.
- They could've been changed.
That 's why they are not on the list.
I'm near Hackney.
You look in Shepherds Bush.
If you find it, call me.
Don't go in.
It 's a taxi. I gotta go.
I gotta go! Bye.
Taxi!
I'm looking for a church which is no longer a church... somewhere around Hackney.
This is the place?
No. It 's a synagogue.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- What are you doing here, love?
- You gave me such a fright!
I thought you were...
No, never mind.
Thanks.
Yes?
Hi. I wonder if I could ask you a couple of questions?
Yeah? What about?
This building you live in, I'm doing some historical research...
Please, I need to use your phone to call the police.
It 's an emergency.
Thanks.
- Were you mugged?
- No.
- Could I sit down, please?
- Sure. Phone's round here somewhere.
Bloody portables.
There's a man in the cellar.
Have you noticed anything odd down there?
What kind of "odd"?
Downstairs...
How did that telephone get down there?
Where's Heather?
How did you find me?
We know all about you.
Who's "we"?
The police.
Losey?
Yeah.
Then where is she?
Talk to me.
You're lying.
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Where's Heather?
Talk to me.
I'm listening.
What do you wanna know?
The truth.
You don't have to talk.
We'll find out what you know.
Can't you talk to me?
How much do you know?
How much do you know?
Talk. Talk. Come on!
Shit! Talk to me!
Heather?
Heather, where are you?
Heather?
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach,
Lord of the Rats. Hear the Darkness.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
Forthine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
I'm tired.
You know who I am, don't you?
Relax...
I shall show you.
Moloch, Gog, Drammalach...
Lord of the Rats.
Beseech thee for more Darkness.
The Fabric of Sorrow beseech thee.
Yield once more to the Contagion of Woe.
For thine is the Bitterest Pill and the Dismalest Traffic.
I am Francis Paladine.
Do you know the darkest fear that gnaws at the heart of men? Do you?
I have examined your mind and found that, like me, you have a gift.
But you have hidden your gift under a bushel.
Men choose to be weak, because power frightens them.
So also do they choose to die.
But I have cheated the Reaper nine times with my physic... and today will mark a tenth.
Farewell, sweet Michael.
Ignorant Michael.
Sleep now.
Allow thyself to slip away.
Wake up, Michael.
Wake up, Michael.
Wake up, Michael!
He is strong.
Kill him.
Are you looking for Tony, love?
- Is he in?
- No, he's been held up.
- I've been waiting for an hour.
- Maybe you can help. I'm looking...
- Is this more historical research?
- What?
There was a bloke here earlier, said he was researching the building.
- What did he look like?
- Tall, dark hair, nice looking.
- What happened to him?
- I don't know, he's long gone.
Seemed a bit disappointed.
Something about being the wrong sort of church.
- Want to leave a message with Tony?
- No, thanks. It 's okay.
Heather?
It 's Michael.
We're alone.
Listen to me, Heather.
Listen to my voice.
Remember your paint set?
Remember the colours?
Now close your eyes, Heather.
Picture that row of colours in your mind.
And the sable brushes, Heather.
Remember how soft they felt?
How smoothly they glided across the paper?
Now... spread the blue paint over the paper.
- She's gone.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
We'd better get on with it.
Quickly.
Quickly.
And under that sky... the greenest field you've ever seen.
Full of yellow buttercups.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to run around in that field?
But you can't.
You're stuck, aren't you, Heather?
I'm afraid.
Afraid of him.
Listen to me, Heather.
I'm gonna count to three.
And on three... all your fears will disappear.
Are you looking for Tony?
No, he's been held up.
I've been waiting for an hour.
I've been waiting for an hour.
You are invincible, Heather.
Nothing can make you afraid.
Push, Heather.
It 's okay.
It 's fine.
Untie me, quick!
Michael!
No, don't move.
Don't move.
Heather?
You are invincible, Heather.
Hurry, Heather's in there.
How do I get in?
Nothing can make you afraid.
Shit!
All your fears will disappear.
Heather!
Heather!
Come here.
I've got you, little one.
I've got you. I've got you.
I can't find my other shoe.
Let daddy sleep.
She's beautiful. They both are.
Filthy habit, that.
I know this cute hypnotist.
I think he could cure me.
You mean that quack from the papers?
Publicity pulls punters.
It also pulls the Home Office.
I'm not allowed to work anymore.
Funny you should mention that.
- I hope this isn't a cheque.
- No such luck.
It 's a recommendation from the highest level... that you and your family be granted permanent residence here.
If you want to stay, of course.
- Thanks, but I won't be needing it.
- No?
I'm taking my family back to the States.
And you?
Well, thanks to you,
I've been promoted.
What about Heather?
Not bad.
Doctors say no permanent damage, physically.
Emotionally, I guess, only time will tell.
So it was Lebourg's blood they were putting into her all along?
Yeah, apparently.
- What was in it for her toy boy?
- Sure you want to know?
- Yeah.
- He was her son.
Anyway, you can see how Heather is yourself.
Hi, Michael.
- You look great!
- I am great.
You want an ice-cream?
- Vanilla?
- Okay.
Willard.
There are rats in the basement.
Ow!
Willard...
what are you doing?
I'm going to bed.
It's late.
Yes. I'm going to bed.
Good night, mom.
What were you doing down there?
You, uh, said there were rats.
Well, did you see them?
Well... there aren't any rats.
There are.
All our neighbors moving away...
and all these new people remodelling the houses.
They're stirring up rats.
Well... have you been to the basement?
No. You know I can't.
I know they're there.
I can smell them.
All my life I could smell mice.
Smell... mice?
And hear them.
Don't you hear them down there?
It's... it's just the wind.
There aren't any rats.
Come in here. Hmm?
Come in here.
I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you.
Well, you've... you've been a...
Well, you are... a wonderful mother.
It's my fault your life was wasted.
Willard.
What an awful name... Willard.
Maybe if you had a stronger name... that Frank Martin wouldn't push you around...
or maybe you'd have found a girlfriend...
if you had a more handsome name...
Mark or Kyle or...
Clark.
Willard, from now on, your name's Clark.
Good night, Clark.
Pardon me.
That you?
Sorry.
They told me to sit here.
Willard, he wants to see you.
Oh. Well, um...
Ms. Leach, it seems that someone... this girl, is sitting at my desk.
Maybe that's why he wants to see you.
OK.
Hey. Pay attention.
Yeah?
Who's that at your desk out there, Willard?
I... I don't know her.
Sit.
Who did you say that was at your desk out there, Willard?
I... I... I don't know her.
Well, you should know, because it's your fault she's there.
You've fallen at least a week behind... processing the purchase orders.
You know, when that happens, Willard... everything comes to a standstill... my salespeople up on the floor... shipping, receiving, inventory.
Everybody's standing around... with their thumbs up their asses... because you have allowed the purchase orders... to bottleneck at your desk.
Your father built this company,
Willard.
Hell, your family name is still out there... on the side of the building...
"Martin Stiles Manufacturing."
Ah, hell, it just seems to me like...
that alone would make you take... a little more pride in your work.
Well, I...
Oh, my mother is sick.
I see.
So, it's your mother's fault that you've fallen behind?
Willard, I'm an old friend of the family.
Hell, I've known your mother since before you were born.
She's a fine lady, and she deserves to be kept comfortable.
Your dad was like a father to me.
And I promised him that I would always...
Look after you and your mother... and as long as she was alive, you'd have a job right here.
And in keeping with that promise...
I must insist that you find... a good rest-care facility for mom.
We can't afford that.
But, hell, I guess you could always sell the house.
Here's an idea... I'd tear it down and build apartments on it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin.
I'll... I'll... I'll...
I'll catch up. I'll stay late.
Oh, yeah. You would love that, wouldn't you, Willard?
Suck up on more overtime than it even costs me for a temp.
You'll catch up, all right, asshole... and you'll catch up on your own damn time!
There's one thing that you will never understand, Willard... business is a rat race.
Promise or no promise,
I will not allow myself... to be devoured by all of those other rats because of you!
Clark!
What is it? What is it?
Shh, shh, shh.
It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.
Here we go.
What was all that noise?
Rats?
No.
A bird got stuck in the house somehow, and I let it out.
It's all right now, so go back to bed.
What are you doing in there?
I'm going potty.
You've been in there a long time.
I'm not feeling well, mom.
Is it loose or hard?
I'm OK. I'm OK.
So just... just go to bed.
Let me see.
I'm still your mother.
Clark! Clark!
You should be in bed.
You're feverish.
I get afraid, Clark.
Your father was in that bathroom late that night.
Yes, I know. I'm never going to do anything like that.
What is that on your hand?
It's... it's soap.
It's cooking oil.
Oh, Willard, you're too old for that.
When will you find yourself a girl?
Well, other than getting caught in the trap... you seem pretty... pretty smart.
You should be called...
Socrates.
What do you think?
Yeah? All right. Socrates.
Whoa. Like it in here? Oh.
Where are you going?
Bye, Socrates.
Say hello to your family.
You're reunited with your brother and sister and mom.
Look. Look, everybody.
Food. Food for everybody.
There you go. Very good.
Bye.
Socrates...
I will never let anyone harm you ever.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
Martin, I have to cover your damn car every day.
"Cover my car. Cover my car."
Ugh!
Do you like my new S-55,
Willard?
My new car. My new Mercedes.
I saw you drooling over it.
Oh.
Uh, yes, Mr. Martin. It's...
Do you know why I have that car?
I'm driving that 350-horsepower,
V-8 masterpiece... for you and your fellow employees.
You see, buyers feel a sense of security...
when they can see proof...
that they're dealing with a successful man.
So, when I whip into that parking lot behind the wheel... of my brand-new
Mercedes AMG-class... they'll buy from us over the slob in the Jaguar S-type.
Do you know why I can afford to plunk down 90,000 bucks... for that little edge over the competition, Willard?
Because I'm a successful man!
Because I have never been late for work a day in my life!
Because when I come to work,
I don't show up... in one of my dead father's cheap suits!
Because I have never given my boss such grief.
Maybe it wouldn't hurt you to find out what pleases me!
Are you OK?
Hi, Socrates.
It's been a bad day.
Tear it, Socrates.
All right... you teach them.
They listen to you, Socrates.
Tear it.
Tear it.
Tear it up.
Jeez. You're big.
Big Ben.
Do you know him, Socrates?
Ben, this looks like the beginning... of a beautiful friendship.
Tear it.
Tear it.
Tear it.
OK, everybody, that was really good.
Speed. Speed.
Very good.
Rope... up.
Tear it.
You go down there. Go on now.
Down. Down. Tear it.
In.
Still.
Out.
One week! You've been late for so many hours... that it equals an entire week!
Mr. Martin, I... I'm sorry.
I want my week back.
I've discussed it with counsel.
I may not be able to fire you, Willard... but, by God, it is well within my rights to administer... physical disciplinary reprimand!
I know that you must be tired of this excuse... but what can I do?
My mother is sick.
You don't give a shit about your mother!
If you did, you'd show up for work on time... because now look what's happened.
You're out a week's pay.
Oh, you don't like that.
Then quit.
Act like a man for once in your life and just quit!
You're a slimy, pukey piece of shit!
You wouldn't make a pimple on my grandmother's tush!
Willard.
In.
In.
No!
Ben, no.
If you get in, nobody else will be able to fit.
In.
Be careful, stupid.
We're not making a bed here.
All available units, please respond immediately.
211 in progress...
316 Glenview Parkway.
Out.
Door.
Tear it.
Tires. Tear it.
Ben, I told you to stay.
You... you won't fit.
What the hell is that?
You left the washer in the garage...
running again, didn't you?
In! In!
Come on. Come on.
Anybody out there?
Is someone out there in the garage?
Oh, shit! Look at that!
Somebody got in here and slashed my tires!
Damn!
Who's out here?
Yeah, you better run!
You don't mess with a man's brand-new car like that!
Run, and you'll only die tired!
You better run faster...
because if I catch you, you are dead meat!
Quiet!
Go home!
Do you want to see what's in the bags... you stupid little dog?
The look on his face.
Imagine, all four of his tires.
Do you know what a set of those tires run?
Insurance will cover it.
But insurance won't cover how pissed off he's gonna be.
Hey, what's up?
Someone broke into
Martin's garage last night... slashed his tires and peed on the floor!
Morning, Cat.
You look very nice today.
Wow. Someone... someone urinated on the floor?
No, no, no.
You know, what happened...
when Martin goes in his garage... and sees his tires, he pissed his pants... and blamed it on the guy that did it.
Do you think that's funny, Fox?
Ahem.
Good morning, Mr. Martin.
Is everything OK?
No, everything is not OK.
How would you like it if some maniac...
invaded the privacy of your home... and scared the dog shit out of your wife... and then you had to lose an entire night's sleep... because you're dealing with the cops?
Knowing that that perverted sicko has control... over you and your family's peace of mind?
For Jesus and Christ, for how long?
How long will it last?
No, I'm not all right!
This morning, I rode the subway.
Well, Mr. Fox, how would you like that?
No, sir,
I wouldn't like that at all.
I didn't think you would.
Barbara, I need a foot massage.
Oh, that's so good.
That's so good.
Foods.
Foods.
We, um... we're running out of room.
I'm very sorry about this...
but I can't... I can't feed you anymore.
I can't afford it.
You're going to have to find a new place to live.
Go find somewhere more comfortable.
I wish that they didn't have to... but all good things must come to an end.
Follow Ben. He will find a new place for you.
He will take care of you.
Won't you, Ben?
You're the leader... after Socrates.
Good night, Ben.
You're not going anywhere,
Socrates.
You'll always be with me.
I hate everyone but you.
Let's go to bed.
Ben, I told you.
You can't come upstairs.
Now, it's only Socrates, not you.
Oh, Socrates.
Aah! Don't touch me!
You're getting rid of me.
Mom, I... I love you.
I heard you!
"All good things must come to an end."
No, I... I love you more than anything in the world.
You don't love me!
You won't feed me!
I hate you!
You need to go to the hospital.
What if mom sees you?
No.
Mom?
Mom?
Off. Off. Off.
Off. Off. Off.
Off.
Down! Down! In the basement!
Down! Down! Down!
In the basement! Down!
You think you're funny?
You think you're smart?
Socrates, he's smart.
He knows that they're going to have to come... and they're going to have to take her away... and then they'll come, and they'll take me away... and then they'll come, and they'll take you away!
Hi.
She's my mother.
I love her.
And I'll miss her.
I already miss her.
But, Socrates... if you ever died, I...
You're the only friend that I've ever had.
Well... at least you're with father again.
I have a friend.
See?
He wants to say good-bye to you.
Say good-bye, Socrates.
That's good.
Willard.
In.
Willard, are you all right?
Yeah.
I didn't mean to upset you.
You didn't have to come here.
Well, we didn't hear from you... and I wanted to make sure that you were OK.
Uh, and I want to let you know that... you have a friend.
Willard Stiles,
I am Joseph Carter.
I'm an attorney with Montgomery and Glitt...
the trustees of your mother's estate.
I've been trying to reach you, but you don't answer the phone.
May I have a moment with Willard, please?
Do you mind if I check on you after work... and make sure that you're OK?
Oh, I... thanks.
That's OK. I'll be OK, Cat.
Willard, I have some news...
I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for.
Your parents had been living off an account... they had originally set up for your future.
It was intended to be yours upon their passing.
However, your father's death left debts... that even Mr. Martin's buyout did not completely relieve.
In fact, there remains pending litigation... on some unsettled debts.
Well... it's... it's still my house.
Your mother refinanced the house...
after your father's death.
- In fact, we still owe...
- "We"?
It's my house.
We can declare bankruptcy.
We can sell the house.
- It's my house!
- Yes, of course.
You grew up there.
It's your home.
- But it's the bank's house.
- It's my house!
There's no need for a single man... to be living in such a large house, Willard. Sell it.
Why do I have to pay for what things my parents did?
The money can help you start over.
"Start over"? I'm almost done!
Willard, look.
You have no choice...
If I have no choice, why did you even come here?
Why did you even bother telling me?
Do you get off on telling people... that they have no control over their lives?
That I have no money, no home, and it's not even my fault?
Willard, this is not the time nor place.
Now, you think about it.
Then, please, you have to contact me.
This is the only chance you have... to take control of your own life.
Thank you.
Socrates.
Ben!
Willard, it's Cathryn.
Answer the door.
I saw you walk in.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
I'm just on my way out.
I have some stuff that
I have to do at the cemetery.
Oh, well, this might not be the best time, Willard... but please don't take this the wrong way.
You looked so lonely at your mother's service... and I remember how devastated I was... you know, when my mother died.
And the only thing that helped me through... was... her mother.
This is Scully.
She'll make a great friend, and she'll keep you company.
Oh.
I don't know what to say.
I...
I can't accept Scully.
See? She likes you.
Well...
Why don't you hold her?
Just take her. Just hold her.
Really, I can't. I'm sorry.
- Just take her.
- OK.
Well...
I'm really late, and...
Do you think it's OK if I just put her inside?
- Sure. She's potty-trained.
- Oh, good. Good.
Socrates.
It's OK.
It's OK.
I wasn't... really trying to hurt him.
I know.
You're trying to keep the peace... but he has to learn...
I am the boss.
It's back to work, Socrates.
Ben, out.
OK, Ben... just because
Socrates says it's OK.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Am I reading this correctly?
"Mr. Stiles, it is our regret to inform you...
"your position has been terminated.
"Enclosed please find two weeks' severance.
"Your service is appreciated.
"Frank Martin."
He's firing you.
But I thought he couldn't fire you.
Willard.
Hey. Hey!
This whole thing is just one big misunderstanding.
I'll make it up to you, though.
I'm gonna take you to the Jets-Dolphins game.
- How does that sound?
- What?
Feels like this office could use a little holiday cheer.
Cathryn, go dig out the Christmas decorations.
They're in the back storeroom.
The key's in Willard's desk somewhere.
Talk it over with Rosie and let me know.
I'll be right here at the office working late tonight.
Christmas bonus time, you know.
Mrs. Leach, found the keys... but you can dig out your own holiday cheer... and then you can shove it up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho.
- I quit.
- Bye-bye.
How could you?
What part of "You're fired" don't you understand?
- My father!
- Is dead. Been dead.
And now your mama's dead, too.
He started this company!
It's my family's company!
No. My company.
Been my company... and I don't want you around it anymore.
Why in the hell are you even still here?
You hate it here.
I hate you being here.
You're going nowhere here.
Mommy and daddy are dead.
Get over it and get on with your life.
The terms of your purchase contract... they strictly state that you are not allowed to...
Sue me.
Get you a goddamn lawyer and sue me. You'll win.
Go down today and hire yourself a $250-an-hour lawyer.
Sue me.
My $400-an-hour lawyer... will tie it up in the courts until I die.
So, what? 10, 15, 20 years from now, you'll win.
You know I cannot afford that!
You know that!
Need money?
Make me an offer on the house.
Don't give me that face,
Willard.
I buy the house, you have money.
You can go buy yourself a very nice clean used car...
move someplace where you'll be happy...
get a job, a girlfriend.
Jeez, you'll be so damn happy you won't want to sue me.
All right...
I'll sell you the house.
But, please, please, please let me keep my job!
Please!
Please let me keep my job.
Please.
What in the hell is going on now?
A rat! A rat in here! Oh!
It's a rat! Oh, my God!
Rat! Look out!
There's a white rat... and it is the size of a dog... I mean, huge dog.
Over there, behind the Christmas lights.
See him?
Where? I don't see any mouse.
No. Up there, you idiot.
Up there!
I think your wild-ass imagination... is kind of getting away with you.
He's up higher.
There he is.
No!
Walt, this is Mickey.
I'm coming to join you.
Yeah.
What's the matter, tiger?
Can't take a little blood?
Ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers.
Nice work, Mr. Martin.
Yeah, good one, sir.
He expects me to clean that up?
I'll do it.
Thanks.
What could I do?
What could I do?
What could I do?
What could I do?
What could I do?
What could I do?
What could I do?
What can I do?
What can we do?
In.
In.
That's it.
We can't fit any more.
The rest of you are going to have to wait here.
Ben and I will be back later.
Right, Ben?
Oh, Jesus.
Ooh... I like that.
Ooh, look at you.
Oh, my God.
Look at all the rats.
Yes.
Look at the rats.
We've come to see you.
We?
They'll do anything I tell them.
Well, then tell them to get the fuck out of my office!
Sit down.
Now, you listen to me, Willard.
Sit down!
What the hell's wrong with you?
Mr. Martin, you stole this business from my father.
It killed him, and it killed my mother.
And now you're trying to kill me.
No. That's...
You never let me alone for a minute.
You made a fool of me in front of everybody.
And now you're trying to take my house.
You made me hate myself.
I thought a lot about it... hating myself.
Well, right now... at this moment...
I like myself.
You killed Socrates!
Who the hell is Socrates?
He was the only friend...
I ever had!
What's the matter, tiger?
Afraid of a little blood?
Tear him up.
Good-bye, Ben.
Food.
Food.
- I think I hear footsteps.
- Yeah.
- Let's look around back.
- OK.
Willard? It's Cathryn.
I've been calling you all day.
Did you hear?
Martin's dead.
They called from the office.
The details are weird.
All kinds of rumors... that he was murdered or attacked by animals.
I'm hungry.
Could we get something to eat?
Right now?
Let me get my coat.
Just a second.
Could I use the restroom?
Cathryn?
In here.
Sorry. I had to go so bad, and you flew off somewhere.
We need to go.
Shit. I must have run over something.
- There he is.
- You sure that's him?
Yeah.
Get in the car.
I'll call triple-A.
I've got a cell phone.
Mr. Stiles, police.
Open the door, please, sir.
Can you please tell me what this is about?
Willard!
Open the door, Willard!
I want to help you!
Willard!
Willard!
Open the door, Willard!
Let me in!
What's going on in there?
I hear him going around back.
Stiles.
Stiles!
I'm sorry, Ben. I...
I'm sorry that I left you.
I got scared... and so I... I came back here.
It's all over, Ben.
You can live anywhere.
You can go anywhere.
I have nowhere.
Who's he talking to?
There was nothing that I could do about Socrates.
But... we got him back.
We got Mr. Martin back together.
This guy's nuts.
We should just call Bellevue.
It's all over, Ben.
So just... go!
Go away!
Whoa! It's not just Bellevue.
We've got to call the health department exterminators.
You see that?
Oh, man.
Let's go.
Do you want some food?
I'll give you some food, Ben.
I'll give you all the food that I have... if you'll just go away.
Do you want food?
No.
No, no, Ben. It's food.
It's just food.
Whatever food is in the bag is yours.
Ah! That's it for you, Ben!
I hate you!
I loved Socrates, but I hate you!
I'm not setting foot in there.
There's, like, a thousand rats.
Ma'am, you want to get eaten alive?
Martin.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator.
Cathryn, help!
Help!
Cathryn!
Cathryn.
Ben.
I thought we were friends.
Food's here.
Food.
Look, Stiles, you've got to eat.
You might be out of your mind, but your body's staying here.
Eat.
Come on.
We got some nice chicken... some mashed potatoes... got a sourdough roll.
Hey, look.
We got a piece of cheese.
That's what the mice eat, isn't it?
OK, rat boy.
Look, I'm gonna leave it here.
You can do whatever you want with it.
Hi.
Shh.
I know you're hungry, but we have to wait.
Our time will come.
Let's not let them know that you've come back to me.
We have to sit here... and wait... wait... quietly.
Quiet as a mouse.
It is said that over 150 years ago...
... in the town of Darkness Falls...
...Matilda Dickson was adored by all the children.
Whenever one of them lost a tooth, they would bring it to her...
... in exchange for a gold coin...
... earning her the name
"The Tooth Fairy. "
But fate was not kind to Matilda. one night, fire tore through her home on Lighthouse Point...
... Ieaving her face horribly scarred.
Matilda's burned flesh was so sensitive to light, she could only go out at night...
...always wearing a porcelain mask...
...so no one could ever look upon her face. one day, two children didn't come home.
The townspeople blamed Matilda.
They hanged her...
... tearing off her mask, exposing her hideous face to the light.
And with her dying breath...
...Matilda laid a curse upon Darkness Falls.
The next morning, the two children were found, safe and sound.
The town buried their secret along with Matilda's body.
Since then, there are some who believe that Matilda visits...
... the children of Darkness Falls on the night they lose their last tooth...
...seeking her vengeance on any who lay their eyes upon her face...
... fulfilling her curse.
"What l took before in kindness...
...l will take forever in revenge. "
You're going to ask Caitlin to the dance tomorrow, right?
You'll do great. I love you.
Now, you get some sleep.
Good night.
Boo!
-That was stupid, Cat.
-Wuss.
You hear Amber said "asshole" to Miss Alison in third period?
She got detention for a week.
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.
Okay.
A bunch of us are going swimming at the quarry. You want to come?
No. I've gotta get up early for practice.
-I can't believe you still have this.
-Of course.
-Kindergarten, right?
-Right.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
You're bleeding. Here.
It's Just my tooth.
-Is this the last one?
-Yeah.
This one's special.
Your last baby tooth.
Means you're not a baby anymore.
Okay. Well, l gotta go.
-Cat?
-Yeah?
There's this school dance on Saturday night...
...and it's, like, one of those boy-girl dances.
And boys ask girls, so--
I already told my mom you'd be by at 7.
And she can drive us.
-So Saturday at 7, right?
-Okay.
First time shouldn't taste like blood.
It should be sweet.
Remember, when the tooth fairy comes, don't peek.
Kyle?
-I saw her. I saw her.
-Kyle! What are you talking about?
I peeked.
Kyle, look at me.
-There is no one in this house but us.
-You're wrong.
You're wrong.
-I'll go take a look. Okay, Kyle?
-You can't go. Please, Mom.
Please stay in the light, Mom.
Please stay in the light.
Please stay in the light.
Please stay in the light.
Oh, please, God.
See, Kyle?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Mom.
There's no next of kin.
The state will look after him.
-Larry!
-Caitlin! What happened?
She was already dead when we got here.
I heard he was having some problems, but Jesus Christ.
Looks like his mom put up a bit of a struggle.
Okay.
Kyle?
Kyle, this is Dr. Jenkins.
I want you to go with her.
Caitlin?
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.
As l was saying, noctiphobia is very common among his age group.
Now, we've run one CAT scan and two MRls at your behest...
...and the conclusions all say the same thing.
There's nothing wrong with your brother.
My brother hasn't slept more than 1 0 minutes at a time...
...for the last three weeks. You go tell him there's nothing wrong with him.
We've run every test possible.
There's nothing more we can do.
What happened?
He was asleep. I Just closed the blinds.
I didn't think that....
I saw her. I saw her.
It can't be dark.
It's okay, Michael.
I won't let them shut off the lights, okay? l promise.
It'll be okay.
It's okay, Michael.
Hello?
Hi. Is this Kyle Walsh's number?
This is Caitlin Greene.
That's not funny.
Kyle. Hey, it's Cat.
You asked me to the dance but never took me.
-Caitlin?
-Yeah. Hey, you are...
...hard to track down.
I know it's been forever.
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?
How are you?
Fine.
-What do you want?
-Right. Right.
It's my brother, Michael.
He's in the hospital, and he....
He's really scaring me. He won't sleep, not even 1 0 minutes at a time...
...and now he won't let us shut off any of the lights.
Doctors say he has something called noctiphobia or....
Night terrors.
Right.
I remembered that's what they said you had when your--
When your mother was killed.
Anyway, l Just thought maybe you could tell me how you got over it.
I didn't.
You must be Michael.
It's okay, man.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I Just wanna talk a little.
My name's Kyle.
Your sister says you're afraid of the dark. Makes it tough to sleep.
You get a lot of sleep?
Me neither.
Well, this was a bad idea.
Caitlin says that when you grow up, you're not afraid of the dark anymore.
-Is that true?
-Yes.
Why not?
Because you grow up and you realize that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Then why are you still afraid?
Well, sometimes old habits die hard.
You wanna see something?
This flashlight, it's my peace of mind.
She won't come in the light.
-Who?
-You know who.
No. I don't know who.
Yes, you do.
You've seen her too.
Why would you say something like that, Michael?
Because it's the truth.
Sometimes l think of turning off all the lights...
...and letting her come and take me.
Sometimes l think that would be easier than being so scared.
Did you ever think that?
She's gonna kill me, you know.
No one's gonna kill you, Michael.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Your sister won't let it.
My sister can't stop her.
No one can stop her.
Kyle?
-I can't believe you came.
-That makes two of us.
So....
-So, what do you think? ls he--?
-What do the doctors say?
That he's a kid, he's Just afraid of the dark, he's confused.
Growing up here will do that to you.
Listen....
I hate to ask you this, but...
...when your mother died, what really happened to you?
Cat, it's--
-Because it seems like it's the same--
-No.
-But the things he says--
-They're Just things.
But these....
-Kyle?
-Did Michael Just lose a tooth?
Yes, his last one.
But....
Come on, Kyle. You don't still believe that, do you?
I mean, we all grew up with it, but it was Just a story to scare us.
I'm sorry, Caitlin.
This was a mistake.
Look, will you Just--?
Wait a minute, please.
I don't think l know how to help Michael.
Hey, Catey.
Kyle?
Larry.
You came. That's terrific.
It's great to see you, buddy.
All right.
I came straight from work.
So is there any reason for us to panic, or what?
No, no.
Good. Good.
Well, that's what l keep telling Catey.
We have some of the best doctors in the state in this hospital.
How about l take you two guys out to dinner tonight?
What do you say? We can celebrate the prodigal's return.
I think l'm Just gonna stay here with Michael.
Okay. Yeah.
Well, good night, honey.
Caitlin?
I'm sorry.
Well, Kyle, what do you feel like doing?
I feel like l've been here too long already.
-Wait. We could go to The lnn, right?
-I don't drink.
Come on, Kyle. I haven't seen you in 1 2 years, man.
One drink's not gonna kill anybody, right?
Where's Kyle?
He left.
Is he coming back?
I don't know.
-Walsh, what's going on, man?
-Relax, buddy.
You'll survive one drink, right?
Beer okay?
-Can't.
-Oh, Jesus.
-Long time no see, Walsh.
-Hey, Dave. Two drafts.
-Fleishman, who's your date?
-Remember Kyle? Thank you.
-Kyle, as in Kyle Walsh.
-That's right, Ray.
That's him in the flesh.
Thank you, Dave.
Where you going, man? Sit down.
I bought you a beer.
I figured you'd like this one.
It's a light.
You should have told me you were coming back.
-I didn't know you'd still be here.
-You left a lot of shit behind.
-What's wrong?
-That's the freak who killed his mother.
So come on, man.
What you been doing with yourself?
-I'm in the gaming industry.
-Larry Fleishman, attorney at law.
You're an attorney?
You stole more candy than anyone in the history of stealing.
That's why l'm a defense attorney.
So come on, Kyle, give.
What are you really doing back here?
Jesus!
I came to see if l could help Michael.
You don't look like you can help anybody.
Wanna tell me how you got over it?
You did get over it, right?
She's got a whole new life now.
Caitlin.
This whole thing with Mikey....
What the hell are you doing back here, freak?
I thought they locked you up for killing your mama.
I don't want any trouble, all right?
Oh, yeah? Well, trouble.
That's tough! Come on, you chickenshit.
-Hey, come on.
-Kick his ass, Ray.
You want a piece?
-Come on. Take a shot.
-Leave him alone, man.
Oh, yeah, keep walking.
You guys see that?
Eat this!
No!
Keep running, you freak!
I'll find you!
Walsh, l'm gonna kick your ass! l'll find you.
These are my woods.
Nobody messes with me!
Larry! Larry!
There's no way they could have come this far, Matty.
What the hell was that?
Ray! Kyle Walsh!
What are those guys doing? Batten, get back there. Spread them out.
I'm Just gonna stay right here with you. Okay, Matt?
Okay, now that came from over there.
-You wait there, Larry.
-You got it.
Hey, Matt.
Matt?
Hey, buddy, this.... This whole splitting up thing's kind of stupid.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
You're a grown man, completely safe.
You're a grown man.
You're completely safe.
Get him off! Get him off!
" Light will spell her doom and death.
Brightest flame engulfed her whole, setting free her wicked soul."
Hey, Cat.
What happened to you?
Coming-home party.
Come here. Sit down.
You're bleeding.
Sit down. Come on, sit down.
Okay, l need to try to get this gravel out of your scalp.
So how did this happen?
Okay.
How about telling me about the last 1 2 years of your life in 25 words or less?
I went to a foster home...
...and we moved out west to Las Vegas...
...and now l work in a casino.
Is that 25 words yet?
Keep going.
Are you and Larry going out?
-Why do you ask?
-I don't know, l Just--
Got it.
I don't know what l'm doing wrong.
-Don't give him any more tests.
-What?
They stuck me with every needle...
...gave me more Rorschachs than l could count, and it didn't do a thing.
Don't let that happen to Michael.
Kyle Walsh.
You're gonna have to come with us.
You ever see anything like this,
Dad?
In this town, you'd be surprised.
What's with all the flashlights?
-Are you afraid of the dark?
-Yes, sir.
If you knew why, you'd think l was crazy.
Klonopin.
Darvocet.
Shit, this one l can't even pronounce.
Doc says half of these are antipsychotics.
Now, l don't know much about medicine, but it occurs to me...
...that if a man is taking antipsychotics, he might have a tendency to become...
...well, psychotic.
Ray's dead.
He's dead?
I think you had something to do with it.
I didn't kill him. I didn't do this.
No, it must have been....
I don't know.
He hasn't been the same since his mom's murder.
He's not a killer.
How do you know?
You haven't seen him in 1 2 years.
Because l know. He's a good man.
-He's been a ward of the state.
-But he came to help Michael.
He was in a mental hospital for nine years.
Caitlin, he's a dangerous guy.
I had a file sent over from State
Hospital about you. Ten feet long.
You spent a lot of time there. MaJor disassociative syndrome, night terrors...
...sociopathic tendencies, three suicide attempts.
I didn't do this.
You did it, Kyle. Don't turn away.
You killed your mother and you killed Ray. Didn't you?
I need to call my lawyer.
-I don't believe this. I'm going.
-Caitlin, l'll be in touch.
Caitlin.
I have to get back to Michael at the hospital.
Matt.
Keep working on your crap story.
Hope you got a good lawyer.
I can handle this.
I can handle this.
I can handle this.
Black cat.
Why not?
Michael!
Michael!
Michael, open the door! Michael!
-I'll call security.
-Michael? Can you hear me?
It's okay.
-She's gonna get me.
-It's okay.
Your brother is suffering from a form of Pavor Nocturnus, or night terrors.
Because of his lack of sleep, he's suffered a psychotic break.
Once that occurs, the subJect can't discern what is real and what is not.
-They begin to manifest a response.
-How do you mean?
A patient may hurt themselves because they believe what they dream is real.
Michael feels that something is after him, wanting to kill him.
And his self-inflicted wounds are consistent with this fantasy.
The good news is that there is a procedure we can perform...
...right here, which has had an overwhelming success rate.
-Is it surgical?
-No, not at all.
Michael is placed in a sensory deprivation chamber.
He faces his fears and realizes there's nothing to fear.
Tests.
-Michael hates the dark.
-Yeah.
That's the point.
Is there any other alternative?
Aggressive medication coupled with counseling.
There are no guarantees. Meanwhile,
Michael might hurt himself again.
Ray and l were Just sitting there, having drinks...
...and Walsh starts fighting with Ray....
-Where are my flashlights?
-Lab's not done with them.
That's all you remember?
The words you're looking for are "thank you."
Hey, Kyle! Kyle, wait up!
I'm having a bad day, Kyle.
I had a dead guy fall on me.
You want to tell me where you're going, huh? Kyle?
-How about a pistola? Huh?
-No.
Wait here a minute.
-Okay, now what?
-Where's your car?
-Why?
-I need a ride. Now!
Yeah. Car's over here. Hey, man, you've been released into my custody.
-Kyle!
-It's 5:35, Larry.
The sun sets in 20 minutes. You've got
20 minutes to get me to the hospital.
We're almost set up.
It'll Just be another 1 5 minutes.
-Where's the other doctor?
-He had to get back upstate.
So you'll be doing this?
Why did you come back?
Do you know how long l've tried to get through to her?
Her brother's always there and then the ghost.
A ghost?
You, man.
Nobody in this town had a chance with her.
All she could think about was you.
-I need you to sign these.
-What are they?
Standard consent and release of liability forms. He'll be fine.
Where are you taking me?
This isn't the way.
I'm not taking you to the hospital.
Lay low for the Judge.
-I Just want to help Michael.
-Michael's gonna be fine.
They're putting him in a sensory dep tank. Gonna shut the lights out.
-They're putting him in the dark?
-Gonna fix him...
...stop him from becoming the next Kyle Walsh.
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be watching you from the other room.
If you put me in the dark, she'll get me.
It'll all be over soon, okay?
Turn this car around now.
Take me to Michael.
What if l don't?
Larry, don't look at her!
-Help! Help! Kyle!
-Larry!
Help! Help me!
Oh, God! Help!
Come on, Larry. I know it's in here.
-Saint Francis Hospital.
-I need Caitlin Greene.
One moment, please.
-Miss Greene is unavailable.
-This is Kyle Walsh.
-I need to talk to her now.
-Sorry. Miss Greene is not available.
Don't let her put Michael in the dark.
I'm almost there.
Hello, police?
Now, Michael, l'm going to need you to hold still. Okay?
There might be Just a little sting.
-What's he doing?
-Hold him.
-There might be a burning sensation.
-Hold him down.
It's all in.
It's all right. It's almost over.
Dim the lights.
Stop!
Take him out of there!
Please, Just do it.
Okay. The three of us are leaving.
-Michael, it'll be okay.
-I got a car waiting.
Kyle!
Stop resisting, Walsh.
Stop resisting.
Don't put him in the dark.
-Come on.
-Michael was right.
You have to believe me.
-Let's see your lawyer get you out.
-That'll be tough...
...since my lawyer's in pieces on Ponus Avenue.
Is that a confession?
Okay, l'll give this a shot.
I saw something when l was 1 0. You heard the stories as a kid. We all did.
I saw her kill my mother. And once you've seen her, she doesn't stop.
I've stayed in the light since.
It's the only way to be safe.
Michael has seen her too, and she's coming for us.
I thought you'd say something like that.
How many unsolved murders have you had?
Not Just this year, but in the last 1 00?
How many of them involved children?
You're crazy, Walsh.
Crazy isn't what it used to be.
Yeah, Dad? We got him.
-What the hell's going on?
-No, no.
We're all gonna die.
Roy, you cover the docks, all right?
Get going.
-What the hell is going on tonight?
-I don't know, Dad.
-Matt, take care of this.
-Yeah, all right.
-Batten, see what that was.
-No, you go see.
-I outrank you.
-Lead by example and see what it was.
-Take a flashlight.
-Walsh, shut up.
Andy, give me your flashlight.
Stay in the light.
Shit.
Damn it!
Come on.
-What's going on here?
-Come on!
-Jimmy, stay with me!
-I'm staying with you!
-Matt!
-Matt?
-Go tell Batten l shot his dog.
-You shot Rocky?
No, Phil. I shot at him.
It was quick.
Is she gonna get me?
Yes.
Man. What the--?
-Stay in the light.
-Shut up.
-Get in the light. Batten.
-Shut up!
-Get your flashlights!
-Over here.
-Walsh.
-Don't shoot.
She's in the building.
You have to believe me.
Marnie, offices. Roy, check Andy.
Phil and Mark, squad room.
You come with me.
Oh, my God.
-Andy.
-Interrogation room.
-Get the flashlights.
-He's pretty bad.
Please, get me a flashlight!
Stay in the light!
Don't shoot the lights!
She can't hurt you in the light!
She's making you shoot the lights.
Let's go! Let's go!
Don't look at her!
-Don't look at her!
-Key 34!
Stay in the light!
Give me the flashlights.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
She's gonna go for Michael.
Take this.
-It's okay, Michael. It's okay.
-Caitlin, come on. It's safe.
Get out from under the bed.
Come on, this is ridiculous.
-No, you get under here.
-Come on, Michael.
There's nothing to worry about.
Caitlin, no!
Okay, let's stay under the bed.
What the hell is that?
Run!
Hello?
Go! Run!
-Caitlin. Caitlin.
-Okay.
-Get behind me, Michael.
-Caitlin.
I knew you'd come back.
How do we stop it?
It's all right. Come on.
-The hospital's losing power.
-Great.
We need to get out of here now.
What the hell is that?
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Get out now!
Help me!
The bag.
-What?
-The bag of flashlights.
-Anybody grab it?
-No.
Damn. We need to get to the lobby.
How long do we have the emergency lights?
-A couple of minutes.
-That's all we need to get out.
What is wrong with you people?
What's he doing here?
-I'm calling the police.
-They're dead.
-All of them?
-Pretty much.
-Where are the stairs?
-What is going on?
When this hospital goes dark, we're all dead.
-Through to the old wing.
-I should evacuate patients.
It's not after them. It's after us.
We saw it. They didn't.
What about us?
If we stay in the light, we stay alive.
This Just keeps getting better and better.
-Come on.
-Go. Go. Go.
All right, stay in the light, keep tight to the wall, single file.
Stay in the light!
-Jesus Christ.
-Is she okay?
Alex!
Keep going, Michael.
Just stay in the light.
No!
Run!
Wait, wait. Caitlin?
Kyle.
-We have to Jump it.
-Are you crazy?
-Yeah, a bit.
-Is there any way she can get us?
We're gonna Jump all at once.
We'll give her multiple targets.
Okay?
-Kyle.
-Go on three.
One. Two. Three!
Kyle!
Alex.
-We got one more to go. You ready?
-No, l'm not.
-Kyle, hurry up.
-We go on three.
One. Two.
-Okay.
-Three!
Kyle!
-She missed me.
-You okay?
-Run!
-I'm getting the hell out of here!
-Caitlin! No!
-Get up!
No!
Kyle.
Kyle!
-Kyle.
-Help.
Look out!
It's Matt!
-Everyone in the car.
-Hurry!
-Go! Go!
-Hurry up. Get in the car.
Go!
What the hell was that thing?
-Did you get them?
-Yeah.
-What are you talking about?
-Gas cans.
We're going to the lighthouse. It's got a gasoline-powered backup system.
It's not far.
Why don't we keep driving?
We're safe in the car.
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it!
-She's taking out the sirens!
-Keep going!
-Everybody put your heads down!
-Michael!
No!
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone.
It's gone.
Got any lights back here?
There's two kerosene lanterns in the back.
This must be it.
-I hope this works.
-It has to.
Kyle, there's the tank.
Come on.
Get all the gas in there.
There's enough there to last us a week. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Let's go, Michael.
Get up there, Michael.
If that thing hates bright light, she's not gonna come here.
Damn it. Come on.
-What happened?
-I don't know.
Must be a fuel line blockage.
It's not getting to the generator.
-That's encouraging.
-Lanterns aren't gonna last that long.
-We're gonna have to go fix it.
-What do you mean "we"?
-You and me.
-No.
It's the only way to do it.
We'll be right back, okay?
-I promise.
-Kyle.
If anything happens to me,
Just keep that thing off them.
All right, same goes for me.
This thing's gonna kill us, isn't it?
Probably.
All this over a fucking tooth.
-Do you smell that?
-Yeah, gas everywhere.
Don't drop that lantern, will you?
She comes at you fast so be ready.
"She"?
You sound like you know her.
She's been in my life a long time.
-Hold up.
-Did you see that?
Wait up for me. Stay in the light.
Oh, man. It doesn't look good.
-There's gas all over the place.
-Yeah.
I've gotta tighten this rag around this leak.
Hurry up.
This lamp's not gonna last long.
-Caitlin, quickly. Here.
-What, this? Okay.
I need more light.
Get back. Get back in the light.
The kerosene's almost gone.
Come on. Okay. Oh, God. Okay.
Jump! Jump!
Michael, get out of the dark!
Come on.
We're losing the light fast.
I gotta move you. I gotta flip the switch before the flame runs out.
Come on. Come on.
Hit that switch, Michael.
Go on, Michael.
-Get it, Michael.
-I can't. I'm stuck.
Go, Michael!
This light's almost going out!
Go, Michael!
Michael. Michael.
All right. Wait here, okay?
It's all over.
Come on.
-It's okay. Okay.
-Come on.
-It's okay. Okay.
-Come on.
I see you, bitch!
It's okay. It's okay, Michael. It's okay.
Just leave this here, Billy.
You're gonna go to sleep now?
Just remember, don't peek.
Tooth Fairy?
It's Just Mommy, honey.
Go back to sleep.

Tomorrow marks the one year anniversary since Velez Air Flight 180 exploded and crashed shortly after takeoff from JFK Airport.
It's a disaster that's affected many.
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School, which lost 40 students and four faculty members in the crash.
But it was the events after the crash that has turned this tragic story into something even stranger.
The survivors who managed to get off the plane before it crashed died soon thereafter in a series of mysterious and bizarre accidents.
Now, to some, these deaths are just tragic coincidences, but to others, they're an indication that there are more sinister events taking place.
That's the contention of tonight's guest.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
Thank you for having me.
And I appreciate you using the word sinister.
Most people say supernatural because they think I'm talking about ghosts and witches and stuff like that.
Here's your chance to set the record straight.
Great. Okay.
I believe that there's a sort of force, an unseen malevolent presence... that's all around us every day.
And it determines when we live and die.
And some people call this force the devil, but I think that whole religious thing is... so I prefer to call it
Death itself.
So I'm surrounded by Death?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Every day, everywhere, all the time.
And that's what I want people to understand... that Death has this grand design that we all fit into.
So when Alex Browning got off that plane and took the other survivors with him, he basically screwed up
Death's plan.
And that's what I'm trying to warn people about.
And the fact that all of the survivors have died is your evidence of this?
Well, it's not so much that the survivors died, but it's the way that they died.
I mean, there were so many weird, seemingly random things about the way they died.
It just didn't make sense.
And that's the proof there's something out there...
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation of events that can't be proven in order to support your ideas.
Kimberly.
You should be more open-minded...
What happened after that was just coincidence.
May I finish?
Mere coincidence would have one or two of these kids die.
But not all of them including their teachers.
Yes, but people die all the time, so why should this be any different?
It forced people to question these so-called everyday coincidences.
What if they were something more?
What if you could do something about it?
Please, are you listening to yourself? This is crazy.
You're saying we should be on guard every morning when we leave the house?
That's exactly what
I'm saying.
Exactly it.
And in order to survive... the only way to survive is to look beneath the visible world.
Because in the end no one can escape death.
And today may be your day to die.
Okay, I'll call you.
Kimberly, are you sure you've got everything?
Credit card, cell phone, Triple-A card?
Dad, it's Daytona, not Somalia.
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares, sunblock, mace?
Condoms, whips, chains.
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.
That makes me feel a lot better, thanks.
- Okay.
- Alrighty.
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.
Go on.
Okay, I'll call you.
Whips and chains.
That's nice.
Whatever, your dad's cool.
Buckle up!
Watch it!
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.
Yo, Dano, shouldn't we help your mum?
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.
Whatever.
What are we going to do in Daytona?
We're going to see lots of honeys there.
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke this big 'El Gagerero,'
We're gonna have this awesome party...
Pileup! Pileup!
A candlelight vigil to mark the one year anniversary of the crash of Flight 180 will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight at the Mt Abraham high school auditorium.
# Highway to hell... #
Oh my God.
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.
I'll do that.
I mean it. Take care of it.
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
Oh, shit!
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!
Shit.
Seriously, put it out.
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.
Wait, wait, wait!
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.
Hey, it's Kat.
Listen... what the hell?!
Just wait. Not you.
I think we better pull over and check the car, because...
Kimberly, the car is going to be fine.
Your dad's going to be fine, you're going to be fine.
Okay?
Look at that guy.
He's drinking a beer.
Oh, yeah, that's real responsible.
You ever hear of the ozone layer, arsehole?!
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #
# Don't come around if you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #
What? I'm wearing my seatbelt.
You're gonna bust me, bitch?!
Aaah!
Son of a... bitch.
Fuck!
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!
- Stop!
- Oh my God!
Watch out!
Aaah!
Shaina?
I can't get out of here!
Help me!
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?
Yo, Dano, shouldn't we help your mum?
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.
Pileup! Pileup!
- Oh my God.
- What?
There's going to be a huge accident.
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.
That's it.
My turn to drive.
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.
...of Flight 180 will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight at the Mt Abraham high school auditorium.
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '
'Highway to hell'?
# I'm on a highway to hell... #
Okay, Kimberly, you're scaring me.
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?
What the fuck, Kimberly?
What's this?
Kimberly, you just got to breathe.
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.
- What?
- Oh my God.
Do you know how much fucking weed I have on me? Huh?
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.
What's going on here?
I think there's going to be a huge pileup.
I saw it.
There were bodies everywhere.
There were logs...
I saw it.
It just happened.
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please step out of the vehicle.
Just pull over!
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh, fuck this.
I'm going to get this and we're going to go.
Fuck.
What the hell is going on up there?
Excuse me!
Is there any way that we could drive around?
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.
- Just move it...
- Now!
That's it!
That's the truck that's going to kill everybody.
You need to stop that truck!
I told you again, you have to calm down!
Why won't you listen to me?!
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.
This is unit 13 requesting medical assistance and backup for a major traffic accident...
Kimberly, what's going on?
No!
No!
Listen, sir, this girl is really freaked out.
In fact, all of them are...
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!
These people are the luckiest sons of bitches on the planet.
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis... yesterday the kid wins the lotto.
Today, some loony bitch blocks traffic and he avoids the worst pileup in years.
I should be so damn 'unlucky.'
Go babysit the rest of them.
I'll be done with Lewis in a minute.
Hey, excuse me...
We're trying to do the best we can.
We're going to get you out of here as soon as possible.
I just think it's a bunch of bullshit.
Listen, I know you've gone over all this with Detective Suby... but would you mind telling me what happened?
It was like I was there.
I knew something bad was going to happen even before it did.
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?
Look, I know this sounds crazy but... you guys all heard about Flight 180, right?
The kid who got off the plane?
Well, it happened a year ago, today.
My premonition was just like his.
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.
You must have read about the kid who had a dream about a plane blowing up, so he got all his buddies off the plane and then the thing blew up just like in his dream?
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?
So a month goes by, right?
Everything seems cool.
But then all the survivors start to die one by one.
'Cause when your number's up, your number's up, right?
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them, hunting each one down until they were all... dead.
Please.
There was one survivor.
Clear Rivers is in a padded room at the Stonybrook Institution.
Well, that's encouraging.
Okay, you want me to believe that this is true, that this is happening all over again?
I don't know why we're even here.
What do you want from me?
But if I was never meant to pull over, we all should have died in that pileup.
Which means Death could be coming for us.
Yeah, like, what if we're all getting that 'Different Strokes' curse or something?
I think you're all are certifiable.
I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.
Mrs. Carpenter, please.
Kimberly!
Oh baby!
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.
Shh, shh.
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.
Could I ask you something?
Anything.
Did Mum ever have any...
I don't know, weird feelings about anything?
What do you mean?
Like visions or premonitions.
Sweetie, are you sure you're okay?
Dad, I know this sounds crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.
What?
It's not over yet.
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.
Sorry I haven't called.
Hey, listen, I heard about your lottery win.
Let's hook up.
Call me.
Yeah.
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.
We met at Tucker's party last year?
I know it's been awhile, but I've been thinking about you.
I just wanted to say congratulations.
So give me a call.
555-0123. Bye.
You little bastard.
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Fuck. Fuck.
Come on!
Come on.
Fuck!
Jesus!
Oh!
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is, and I don't know when he's coming back. Thanks.
Evan, call me when you get in, you lucky fuck!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Aah!
Jesus!
Come on.
Aah!
Shit, I'm lucky.
Aah!
Jesus Christ!
No, Mother, just turn on any station.
Well, I don't know how you missed it, it's been on all day.
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?
I got to go!
To recap our top story,
Route 23 was backed up for almost nine hours today.
A record-breaking pileup killed an estimated 18 people.
Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage hoping to recover any survivors from this tragic collision.
So far police are refusing to release the names of the victims until the families are notified.
The camera of a highway patrol car managed to catch this shocking footage.
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.
And smashes into a red SUV.
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um... leave it.
...may have saved her life.
He pulled her back at the last second just as the semi ploughed into the vehicle.
The passengers inside the SUV...
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!
In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner.
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.
Was on top of the world after recently winning $250,000.
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today while trying to escape a fire in his apartment.
He managed to make it out of the building, but somehow the ladder on the fire escape slipped and impaled him.
Investigators believe Lewis died instantly.
Come in.
Hey, buddy.
I want you to take this so you can get some sleep.
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist, which I know you love.
Now, get some rest.
- Mum.
- Yeah?
You think those guys were BSing us today?
Yeah.
Some people just need some rewiring, that's all.
Lights out.
At the request of the patient, you'll relinquish any sharp objects such as: 'nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, your necklace, matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, hair clips, glasses, shoelaces, paper clips, watches, money clip, pocket knives, food, drinks, keys, cell phone... '
You have a cell phone on you?
'... poisons, pills, medications.'
Great. And let me see your nails.
Good. Then I think we're all done.
Wait.
Is she dangerous or something?
No, honey, she expects you are.
No, no, no.
Get him off me.
Get him off me!
How long are they gonna keep her locked up like this?
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.
They told me you had something to do with the crash on Route 23.
Look, I don't know how to explain it, but I saw the pileup before it happened.
And I saved some people.
And now you think Death is after you.
Nice work.
Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.
Anything else?
One of the people died in a freak accident last night.
What if the other people are in danger, too?
If you put them on the list, they're already dead.
List? What list?
Death's list.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash.
That was Death's original design.
The list.
I was supposed to die in that crash with my friends.
So you're telling me that I'm next?
You said someone else died last night.
That means someone must have intervened.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratulations.
You'll be the last to go.
But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.
It always does.
This doesn't make sense.
You said that you die in the order you're originally meant to.
But my friends died last in my premonition, not first.
Wait.
Died last?
Backwards.
Are you sure?
In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died.
Then Evan, then me and my friends.
Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Clear.
Watch out for the signs.
What?
Have you ever seen anything creepy or ominous?
An in-your-face irony kind of thing?
The songs on the radio.
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck, everything on the road.
Well, don't ignore it.
Recognizing those signs usually means the difference between life and death.
You got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
But you beat it.
Take a look around.
What did I beat, Kimberly?
If you were smart, you'd save yourself and just forget about the others.
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.
My friends are dead.
That's how I can say that.
This is what happened to Alex when I was responsible for him.
Get out.
Before you hurt me or yourself.
- Alright, you know what?
- What?
I think you're a coward.
You hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to help any other person.
In my opinion, you're already dead.
I tried calling you last night, but your father said you were sleeping.
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.
I've been getting calls all morning from everyone who was on the on-ramp.
We're meeting tonight at my apartment.
Wait, so... you believe all this Death stuff?
Well, at first, no, I didn't.
Until last year when I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Clean up, I don't...
- Did you see that?
- See what?
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?
If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by pigeons.
I'm not following you.
They're next on Death's list.
If we don't find them, they're going to die.
The doctor's ready for you, now.
If he gives me the gas and I wake up with my pants unbuttoned...
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?
We missed you in here.
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.
Your mum says you've been having some pain lately.
Not really.
I'm disappointed, Tim.
Does your mum know you've been smoking?
Uh-huh.
Ow.
Yeah, that one's going to have to be filled.
Damn those pigeons.
How many times am I going to have to replace those goddamn windows?
We can't do it, boss, we can't do it!
This will only sting for a moment.
Open big.
Little bit wider.
Wider.
Okay.
Oh God.
How do they expect me to...
Would you rather just have the laughing gas?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Jean, I'm going to need you in here.
You'll have to speak up, there's too much noise.
What?!
I can't hear you!
Excuse me, what?!
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.
Jean! Let me get this started.
Tim, you'll be awake, a little groggy, but you're not going to be able to move much.
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.
The cleaning lady said they're at the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.
God damn it anyway.
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!
Not again. Careful.
There we go.
Jean, how's Tim doing in there?
What did he say about your tooth?
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.
- Nora!
- The pigeons!
What? Pigeons?
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!
- No-oo!
- Tim!
Look out!
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.
This is really happening again, isn't it?
I hoped we'd get there and they'd be fine, and Clear Rivers was just full of shit, and Evan Lewis' death was just some freak accident.
But we're all going to die, aren't we?
I'm so scared.
I know you didn't ask for any of this... but I don't think you have it in you to quit either.
A second one just died.
A 15-year-old kid.
I hope you're ready for this.
It's this way.
How is this guy going to help us anyway?
He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about Death than he ever told us.
Shouldn't we knock first?
He probably already knows we're coming.
Hello, Clear.
I've been expecting you.
Oh my God.
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?
Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.
Dead... yet still fresh.
Look, we drove a long way to get here, so if you happen to know how to stop Death, it would be really great if you told us.
You can't cheat Death.
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.
You told me Death has a distinct design.
But Alex and I cheated Death, not once but dozens of times.
The design is flawed, it can be beaten.
Such fire in you now.
People are always most alive just before they die.
Don't you think?
Look, please... if you know of anything that could help us, what harm could it do?
Only new life can defeat Death.
What the hell does that mean?
Some people say there's a balance to everything.
For every life there's a death, and for every death there is a life.
But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, that can invalidate the list, force Death to start anew.
You have to follow the signs...
Kimberly.
How do you know my name?
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?
Where did you find that guy?
I thought he was supposed to help us, not freak us out.
What the fuck are you thinking?!
I'm thinking suck on my junk, bee-atch.
Little punk.
What is it?
What did you see?
You have to tell us, what did you see?
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.
What did you see?!
I was driving a white van.
I don't know,
I must have lost control, because I crashed into a lake.
- And I drowned.
- You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my mouth.
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?
There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
He said only new life can defeat death.
If she gives birth to a baby that would've died in that car crash... a brand new soul that was never part of Death's design...
It throws the whole list out of whack and we start over with a clean slate.
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?
We have to find the pregnant lady's number.
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.
We have to warn her about the lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?
There could be thousands of white vans in the state.
Hey!
I'm a cop, remember?
Wait, that's it.
Got it.
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.
Here we go.
The vehicle is a delivery van registered to Marcus and Isabella Hudson.
We should pick them up pretty quickly.
Come on, let's get to the meeting.
Hey, hold the door!
Hey, let go of my shoe!
Give me my shoe!
I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers.
Is that dogshit, dude?
Eww.
Oh, you got something on your...
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.
No, it's alright.
I'll do it if you want me to do it.
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.
What?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Listen, any word on that white van yet?
Okay, keep checking.
Does anybody have a Valium?
Oh, yeah.
Here.
You're just going to want to take half of that.
Keep 'em coming.
If what you're saying is true, that means I'm next.
This is crazy, people, come on.
First Death is stalking us, and now premonitions?
What?
You're not next, Nora.
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.
We need to help each other in order to get through this.
This cannot be happening.
See, because my career is at a peak and I finally met a quality guy.
I just bought a house.
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, you'll live.
Like I'm going to take advice from you.
Okay, look, if you know what to look for, you have a fighting chance.
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...
Get to a high-rise fast.
A place where no subway could ever possibly go.
Get it?
Okay, you guys, listen... just because Kimberly has these visions, it doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.
Okay, okay, look.
I gotta call bullshit.
I mean, I've sat here and listened to all your theories and all your stories, and I think it's just all bullshit.
Call it what you want!
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!
Has been all day.
There is nobody after us but you, trying to make us all crazy.
I should have seen that coming.
Yeah.
If Death is out to get you, why don't you get the hell away from us?
She's the only one that's dealt with this before.
We need to look out for each other from now on.
Sleep in shifts.
We need to safe-proof this death-trap.
Get you to step out of the van, miss?
Are you kidding me?
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.
Ohh!
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.
No, no, no, it's not safe out there.
So, Nora's got to bite it before me anyhow, huh?
Oh, you people have no sense of humor.
Nora, you okay?
Four years ago my husband died.
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.
Don't say that, okay?
If it is my time to go and be in heaven... with my family,
I can accept that.
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.
If we just stick together long enough for her to have her baby...
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.
Nora.
What do you think you're doing?
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.
Look, look.
I control my life, alright?
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.
I'll be sure to carve that into your tombstone.
Whatever. You may be able to scare these people,
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.
- Hey.
- What?
Even if you don't believe, give this to Nora.
I'm just going to put this in the... closet.
Sorry.
Whoa.
Man with hooks?
Man with hooks.
Hey, I think I see a man with hooks.
Is that...
- a sign?
- Oh my God.
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.
- The phone.
- Shit.
What the fuck?
- Hello?
- Nora!
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!
Officer Burke,
I can't...
I can't hear you!
What?!
What does he...
What?!
A man with hooks is going to kill you.
- What, what?
- Oh...
What is it, Nora?
No!
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!
Wait, wait, Nora!
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!
Let me help!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Kat!
Help me!
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!
Aah!
Let me out of here.
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.
Isabella's being held at the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.
I'm in control of my life!
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.
Alright, give me the gun, Eugene.
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!
Eugene, you just got to relax, bro', okay?
You just got to calm down, man.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!
You hear me!
God!
Oh!
You don't keep it loaded?
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?
Never.
That's impossible.
It wasn't his turn to die.
Can we find the pregnant woman, now, please?
Is this safe, guys?
I mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked.
Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him?
Or her?
Hopefully her.
Okay, guys, let's not panic.
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?
You said she was going to drive into a lake.
How can she if she's in protective custody?
Look at me.
Come on.
Does it look like
I'm in the condition to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.
Look, hopefully the district judge will have it all sorted out by Monday morning, okay?
Marcus.
Marcus, Marcus.
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?
My water just broke.
- What?
- My water, it just broke.
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!
I am not going to have my baby in a jail cell!
Get me to the hospital!
Okay, okay!
Sheriff Perry, this is Deputy Adams, come back.
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!
My van! My van!
Take my van!
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.
Yeah, we'll go.
Come on, come on!
Y'all want to hear something crazy?
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.
A kid came to school with a knife... killed his teacher.
Teacher would have been me, but I was transferred to another school two days before.
That's fucking weird, man.
You want weird?
Last year my partner and I were heading out when a call came in about a train wreck.
Frank decided to let me handle it alone.
He died that night in a shootout.
If that call had come in just 10 seconds later,
I'd be dead, too.
Oh my God.
I'm sorry.
It's just I got one, too.
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay at this cheesy little bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak that no one knows about, and all the guests suffocated during the night.
So what happened?
I don't know.
I never made it.
The bus I was on splattered some girl all over the road.
Was that in Mt Abraham?
Yes. How did you know?
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.
She was supposed to die on Flight 180.
Hey, do you guys remember that theatre in Paris that collapsed last year and killed everybody inside?
Well, I had tickets to go.
But one night I'm in Paris and I'm just tripping on acid and sipping lattes and such.
And then all of a sudden this dude out of nowhere just gets whacked by this falling sign.
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.
The teacher I replaced, her name was Val Lewton.
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.
Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life... that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?
The people who got off of Flight 180.
They were my friends.
Kimberly, tell us what happened.
About a year ago my mum and I were at the mall.
I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching this news report about some kid that committed suicide.
I kept thinking,
'How can you strangle yourself in the bathtub?
That's stupid.'
It felt wrong.
And yet...
I heard some gunshots and I ran outside.
Some kids were trying to steal my mum's car.
She tried to fight them off, she was a fighter, and they killed her.
After the funeral I kept thinking that it should have been me.
I guess everyone must think that.
But I guess I was right.
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!
When we got off
Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives.
It affected everyone and everything we've come into contact with since.
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.
Being alive after we were supposed to die, it caused an outward ripple.
A rift in Death's design.
So if you had never gotten off the plane... we wouldn't be alive in the first place.
Yes, that's why Death is working backwards!
It's tying up all the loose ends,
Sealing the rift once and for all.
Oh, shit!
Jesus Christ!
Hang on! Hang on!
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.
God, Eugene!
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!
No, please.
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Those people can help.
Let's go.
Officer Adams reporting a vehicle collision off 9-A at the 180 mile-marker.
Send all emergency vehicles to the scene.
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.
I think he has a collapsed lung.
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!
Stay with us.
Hey, hey you!
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.
You got to get me out of here before this thing explodes or something, okay?
I think it's okay.
I don't smell any gas and nothing's dripping.
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!
I got to be able to use my legs when I'm done.
I'm so... Dad!
Eugene, everything's going to be okay.
If he doesn't get a respirator, he's not going to make it!
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!
Check the gauges on the regulator, and watch out for overdoses!
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.
And watch out for power lines!
Watch it!
You trying to get yourself killed, little boy?
You got to use your head, man.
Get that news van back.
Thanks.
Okay, let's go.
How is she doing?
I think she's going to be okay.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
When I die... is it going to hurt?
I don't know.
You're going to die after me, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Would you take these?
And if I die... would you throw out all my drugs and my paraphernalia and my porno?
You know... anything that's going to break my mum's heart.
Please?
Thank you.
This is Cheyenne Jacobson reporting live from the Gibbons farm.
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.
I'm trying to get some information on Isabella...
She did?
Okay. Thanks.
Great.
Kimberly!
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?
I'll go talk to her.
Hi.
Just find Isabella and get this thing over with, okay?
Go on, I'll be fine.
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.
Could you be a little quieter with that thing, please?
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.
That would be good.
Rory.
Oh my God!
Somebody get out there!
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!
The keys are in it.
Kimberly!
Kimberly!
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.
This one was different.
It was like the van crashing into the lake.
I was in a hospital, there was screaming and a nurse was trying to choke me.
I couldn't see her, but I could see her name tag.
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.
A bizarre accident has left two people dead, one of them killed by a safety device meant to protect us.
Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her emergency airbag deployed.
She was trapped in her vehicle after it crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.
Suddenly the airbag went off...
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?
We may need to do a stat Caesarean!
Get Dr. Kalarjian up here now!
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.
I'm just going to wait outside,
'cause I'm just really in the way here.
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.
You guys, get to Isabella!
I'm going to find Eugene!
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.
Dr. Kalarjian, in here, hurry!
That's her.
Wait, wait, wait!
Contractions have stopped.
Arrest in descent halfway through the birth canal.
Bad tracing, it's losing oxygen.
The cord's compressed!
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!
Where's Kalarjian?!
Dr. Kalarjian!
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.
Just push a little more.
Oh, no.
Isabella, is the baby okay?
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...
I need to know if the baby's alright!
It's a boy.
Thank you.
Congratulations!
Who the hell are they?
Oh my God!
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.
It's over.
It's okay.
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?
I don't think Isabella was ever supposed to die in that pileup.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Try to remember.
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.
Eugene.
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?
You saw an ECG machine and what else?
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?
Wait.
Eugene.
Oh God, no!
Bloody hands.
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.
- What?
- Crash cart.
Let's go! Move it!
Dr. Kalarjian.
ECG machine.
The lake.
The white van.
What are you talking about?
New life.
What is it?
I know what I have to do to save us.
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.
Get Kalarjian.
Only new life can defeat death.
If it is my time to go and be in heaven... with my family.
I can accept that.
Flight 180...
I know what I have to do to save us.
There are no known survivors.
I have to die.
Ready and clear!
Nothing!
Ready and clear.
Nothing.
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.
She's back!
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.
I want her prepped and stabilized for ICU.
Welcome back.
They lost you for a minute there.
Hey. We did it.
Thanks to you, we cheated Death.
Would you like some wine?
I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.
Alright.
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
It's our pleasure.
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.
I had a fun summer.
I don't know, I guess things are pretty much getting back to normal.
Brian, I think you better go check that barbecue.
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them about the news van thing.
What's that?
Brian was almost hit by that news van that day in the field.
And your friend Rory, he pulled him back at the last second.
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.
Boy, that was lucky.
Brian!
# I'm right behind you #

I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.
MUNDER: Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.
Epps...
...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.
MURPHY: Move it, Epps. If she sinks, she's taking us with her.
Got a punch in the port floater.
EPPS: Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.
Come on! You heard the man!
Took us three months to get her off the bottom. I will not lose her now!
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!
Christ!
- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!
Why do you always have to break my balls? I said get back here!
MURPHY: Do you want me to come down there and kick your ass? I'll do it.
MURPHY: Here's to the best damn salvage crew in the business!
MUNDER: We did it, guys!
SANTOS: Yeah, look at that!
MUNDER:
All right. Nice work.
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.
MURPHY:
To a job well done.
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.
He doesn't drink.
Could I talk to you alone?
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights out of Mackenzie Bay.
Last month I was out in the middle of the Strait when I came across this.
Congratulations. You found a boat.
In the middle of the ocean, of all places.
I tried for radio contact and got nothing...
...so I figured she had to be adrift.
MURPHY:
In the Bering Strait?
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?
It's international waters, so they noted it and that's it.
You get a name?
No, I put it out of my head until two days ago when I saw it again.
MURPHY: What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?
Big. Huge.
Could be military.
Let's say that we're a little bit interested.
MURPHY:
What's in it for you?
I want 20% finder's fee, whatever she's won'th.
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.
MURPHY: Give us a minute, will you?
JACK: Okay.
DODGE:
So? What do you think, Murph?
Who knows? Could be full of shit.
I do know one thing. I've seen strange things happen in the Strait.
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.
- In our business, the only plan is:
GROUP: There is no plan.
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that won'th?
Who knows?
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if."
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.
- Even split?
MURPHY: Beats me paying you overtime.
I'm good.
DODGE:
I'm in.
EPPS:
Greer? What do you say?
All right.
MURPHY:
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.
I can't let you take advantage of me like that.
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.
Fine. But I go with you.
Not on my boat, you don't.
Think I'd tell you where a fortune might be without insurance?
There are five other boats that would jump at this.
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.
Ow! Those things are dull!
She'll love it. What do you think?
Too much off the sides, but I can come up with something she'll love.
- Shave that yourself.
GREER: Don't want to help me out?
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.
Not the same as flying planes over ice sheets, is it?
- What's the appeal?
JACK: I could ask you the same thing.
What's a nice girl doing in a dump like this instead of raising a family?
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.
And these monkeys are my family.
SANTOS
Santos to Murphy. Come in.
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.
- What is it?
SANTOS: I think you should see this!
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.
Would you turn off that fucking music?
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.
SANTOS: Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?
- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
DODGE: All right, Murph.
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.
EPPS:
Hey, Murph, what's up?
MURPHY:
Vessel at position 7-5 north...
...this is Arctic Warrior.
MURPHY:
Come in.
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me?
This is Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me? Come in.
Shit!
SANTOS: Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!
DODGE: An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?
It's the Antonia Graza.
Jesus Christ.
MURPHY: This is civilian tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?
This is civilian tugboat ArcticWarrior.
Is there anyone aboard?
This is Arctic Warrior.
Can you read us?
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.
MURPHY:
Christ, she's beautiful.
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed, so they built floating art palaces instead.
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.
Funny thing is, there was no distress signal. She just disappeared.
Ever since, every captairs been looking for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.
- Do you know what this means?
- What?
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.
MURPHY: Santos, bring us alongside.
Fire up the crane. We got business to do.
When we get onboard, stay together. We don't know what kind of shape she's in.
MURPHY: Take us up, Greer.
GREER Aye, captain.
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep all channels open. Thank you.
They won't let me go.
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!
Okay.
She's had some battering over the last 40 years, you can tell.
GREER:
Stand by. Setting you down topside.
She's still a beaut.
Unbelievable.
MURPHY:
You better stay alert. Watch your step.
40 years of rust can turn deck plates into quicksand.
We'll make our way in at the fore, then check the bridge. This way. Careful.
EPPS: Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.
MUNDER: Superstructure's in decent shape. No sign of damage.
EPPS:
Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
MUNDER:
Life preserver lockers are empty.
DODGE: Sure no survivors ever turned up, Murph?
MURPHY: Sure as we're walking on the Graza, Dodge. This way.
Let's go.
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.
MURPHY:
You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.
Whoever was on here originally sure left in a hurry.
Murphy, come in.
MUNDER:
Whoa.
EPPS: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard. I'm Julie.
I'll be your hostess this evening.
Shh!
Have some respect, okay?
Shh!
MUNDER:
Check out all those champagne bottles.
DODGE: Looks like we missed one hell of a party.
EPPS: And one hell of a hangover.
MURPHY: Shut up!
- Shut up!
MURPHY: Let's find the bridge.
EPPS: Such a manly man.
MUNDER: What?
DODGE: You all right?
MUNDER: Shut up!
DODGE:
Come on, Mary, let's go.
EPPS: Murph, how many passengers did she carry?
MURPHY: Over 600. The creme de la creme of society from all over Europe.
Crew of 500 from Italy.
Talk to me. How's everything going?
MURPHY: Good. This companionway should get us to the bridge.
Here, Epps, hold this.
What's going on?
- After you.
- No, after you.
No, no. After me.
DODGE:
Tough guy.
Don't let go!
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!
Please, Epps, don't let go!
DODGE: Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!
MUNDER:
Oh, God!
MURPHY:
I told you to watch your fucking step!
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?
MURPHY:
Let's go.
- I think I just shit my pants.
DODGE: No, you always smell that way.
Compass is dead.
Helm's not responding, either.
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode on full throttle till she was bone-dry.
Epps!
MURPHY:
Epps!
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Let's get to it.
DODGE:
Hey, check this out.
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They didn't have digital watches in 1962.
So we're not the first people to board this ship. But she's ours now.
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.
Amen to that.
MURPHY:
Oh, God.
Epps, can I get some tea?
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?
That's the $64 million question, isn't it?
- Ever hear of the ship Marie Celeste?
- No.
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.
MURPHY: She was bound for London with a cargo of cotton.
Thanks.
Two months after she set sail, she was sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.
She was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze.
Something wasrt quite right. They didn't know what so they went onboard.
You know what they found?
Nothing.
No passengers. No crew. No captain.
No sign of distress.
59 days after the last log entry, it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.
And nobody at the helm.
MURPHY: What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.
Seen things that you can't even imagine.
Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.
So, what's our plan?
I think we should do what we came to do. Tie her up, tug her in.
You think we can pull this ocean liner?
Yeah.
SANTOS:
Not with the problems we got.
We could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs.
No, some Russian trawler will come along.
I've already looked for her anchors, anyway. They're gone.
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...
...it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size.
For my share of what she's won'th,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.
Don't let go!
MUNDER:
Help me! Don't let go!
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.
Boy, do I miss that.
You okay? You seem quiet since you came back.
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.
I'm curious. Tell me.
I think I saw a little girl.
On...
On the... The boat?
Yeah. Looking right at me.
And then what happened?
Nothing. She disappeared.
Sometimes, when I'd be flying for hours on end...
...l'd think I'd see stuff too.
It'd be there one second and gone the next. Like a dream.
Thanks.
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.
Good night.
JACK: See you tomorrow.
EPPS: Yeah.
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?
DODGE: No, you don't need an iceberg to rupture a hull.
I don't know.
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.
MURPHY:
This is where we are.
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...
...just rocks, a couple thousand seals.
The Antonia Graza's caught here in this strong current loop...
...and slowly she's been pushed towards those rocks. Last time she hit them.
- What about next time?
- Wort be one.
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.
Why can't we tow it like it is?
Lt'd be like towing a car with four flat tires.
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?
Look, the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside.
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments, pump out the water up to the aft peak.
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.
MUNDER: We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree current drift to clear the island chain.
What does all that mean?
I just... That's a lot of work for three days.
But with the gear we've got onboard and what's on that ship, we can try.
We can do it, right?
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.
Quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine.
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Maritime law states...
- I know.
We just don't want any unexpected guests. Just leave it.
GREER:
Your call, captain.
EPPS: All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.
Make sure we've got no problems before we get to work.
MURPHY: Stay with me. Don't wander.
GREER: Okay.
EPPS: Dodge, Munder, go to the port collision bulkhead.
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.
MUNDER: How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.
The only plan in this business is that there is no plan. What is that?
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.
That's okay. Hang in there, okay, preciosa?
Because someday he'll find some other genius to fix his boat.
You want to play like that?
It's still sweet, though.
GREER:
Light coming up.
You were right. She is beautiful.
She sure is.
Epps, we're heading for the main engine room. Epps?
Epps?
All right, capitano.
I'm just slipping in the darkness
Oh, shit.
We're gonna have to dive to get to that tear.
Epps, the engine room is totally flooded.
Epps, can you hear me?
Wait!
What happened? You okay?
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?
What are you doing?
The whole bottom's riddled with them.
JACK: Looks like someone used it for target practice.
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?
There were people in there.
I saw that little girl again.
What? Where?
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?
Forget it. Come on.
Murphy, come in.
Dodge! Anybody!
Shit.
I think she's fucking with us.
EPPS:
Looks like central laundry.
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?
Murphy, where the hell are you?
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!
- But the ship...
- lf it sinks, it sinks.
You're right.
JACK:
Stinks.
- What the hell?
- We came through there.
No shit!
EPPS:
Come on!
This way. Come on, Jack.
GREER:
What the...?
Wherd you start wearing lipstick, Epps?
Epps?
GREER:
"Francesca."
Nice titties.
Not that you can hold a candle to the future Mrs. Greer, though.
EPPS: Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?
JACK:
What's this?
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt about this car since I was a kid.
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.
There's something moving in there.
Fuck!
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!
EPPS:
What?
JACK:
Oh, my God! Look at this!
I have to get Murphy.
Murphy!
JACK:
Murphy!
Is someone trying to call me?
Dodge! Munder!
VOICE:
Maureen...
Who's Maureen?
It's my first name.
VOICE: It's cold...
- He said "cold"?
The galley.
VOICE 1: It's cold.
VOICE 2: Please help us.
Don't go in there.
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!
Take it easy!
You were fucking with us. We fucked with you. Why aren't you laughing?
Wanna hear something funnier? We found dead guys in the laundry room.
And this in the cargo hold.
Need some help, skipper?
I'm sorry.
MURPHY: Jesus.
GREER: Oh, man.
MUNDER:
Holy shit!
Yeah!
MUNDER:
We're rich!
DODGE: You son of a bitch!
MUNDER: Rich!
MURPHY: Come on. Let's go.
DODGE: Move this shit out!
One. Two. Three...
How much you figure it's won'th, boss?
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.
EPPS: Jesus.
GREER: I don't know.
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox in them? They gotta be insured.
No way somebody will let this much gold float away.
Well, the markings have been filed down.
GREER: What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.
It's stolen.
It may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did.
Wait. If the gold's got something to do with 1962...
...what about the bodies? They can't be more than three weeks old.
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as well be me. This ship is fucked up.
Earlier I could swear I heard a woman singing. It's like she was...
- Like she was coming on to me.
DODGE: Oh, no!
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!
Maybe you're not quite ready to get married, Greer.
- Fuck you.
EPPS: Okay, guys.
- What about the Coast Guard?
DODGE: No.
You call the Coast Guard... What if the gold did turn out to be stolen?
Under maritime law, anything found in international waters...
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.
- Right.
- Finders keepers.
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.
Get our boat going, grab the gold and get the hell out of here.
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?
I'm with the gold, man.
Gold.
The gold.
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.
Okay. Let's go to work.
GREER: Warrior is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?
Yeah, precjosa! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?
100 million!
Greer? Get those engines going.
MURPHY:
I'm bringing the gold down.
Yes, sir, captain, sir.
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, vato. We almost got the gold. Andale!
I wanna see these gauges rocking, because you just had an overhaul.
SANTOS: And you, I want you to give me some too.
Let's do this!
SANTOS:
Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!
GIRL:
Stop!
Stop! You don't know what you're doing!
We're good to go, skipper.
Don't start the boats! He'll...
Shit!
Greer!
What the hell happened?
DODGE:
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!
EPPS:
Santos! Greer! Munder!
I got you.
JACK: Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!
Come on!
Santos!
Santos, answer me!
Santos!
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.
Maybe Santos rushed the engines, didn't seal up the gaskets right...
Jack, did you find anything out about this ship before you sent us out here?
No, but I... Look, we've got the gold, and we are still alive.
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!
This is bullshit!
Santos came here out of free will...
...just like us.
- What does that mean?
- Enough!
DODGE: Santos is dead because of you!
Come on! It's not gonna bring him back.
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.
Murph...
DODGE:
How is he?
Here's the plan. We're professional salvors with a fortune onboard.
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.
Control her drift. Clear those islands.
We can survive long enough to get picked up.
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!
- Lf we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the Warrior...
...we were stretching to do this in three days. We can't do this.
You're the best spot-welder I know.
We can do it right now, but I need you.
Fine. But there's no way we're doing a major patch-and-pump in the dark.
Even with the lights we have, it'd be like going in blind.
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight and go in the a.m.
Greer? What do you say?
Now you want to know what the first mate has to say?
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not qualified to get us off this ship.
Had Murphy let me do it my way, we wouldn't be in this.
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?
They'd be here and we'd be on our way home, millionaires.
MUNDER:
That's bullshit.
Grow up, asshole.
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!
Say another word!
EPPS:
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.
You were alone.
DODGE 100-to-1, someone poisoned the passengers to get the gold.
MUNDER: Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned, why are these cans safe?
DODGE: They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.
MUNDER:
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.
- Ah! Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?
Winners do not empathize with losers. Bon appétit.
I screwed up.
I should've called it in.
Damn! I knew better!
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.
What the hell are you looking at?
- That's all right.
- No way.
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!
- Oh, wow. You gotta try that!
- That's good!
That's great!
Katie?
EPPS:
Katie?
DODGE: Can I tell you something else?
We get back...
...l'm gonna take my money and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.
I'll get you a lifetime supply of titty magazines and toilet paper!
I already beat you to it, bro!
There's something on your...
Katie?
Who, me?
Francesca, I know all of this isn't real.
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?
Can't cheat on your fiancée with a dead girl, right?
Her parents.
KATIE:
Please.
Don't close it.
Havert seen them for years.
They moved to New York.
I was on my way to join them.
But they're dead now.
EPPS: How would you know?
- When you're like this...
...you know these things.
My mother...
...she made me this dress.
Do you like it?
You remind me of her.
I don't think so.
Well, here. You should have this back.
Oh, God, you really are a fucking ghost.
Where are you going?
Santos. Povero Santos.
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.
- The Lorelei.
- She was adrift. We rescued her.
MURPHY:
I've heard the story of the Lorelej.
I didn't know the Graza was involved.
The gold was onboard the Lorelej?
It says here, "May 19, 1962."
That's two days before your ship disappeared.
There were no survivors onboard the Lorelej.
Jesus Christ!
Where you going?
Most spirits are free to be with their families.
So why aren't you with yours?
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?
My shipmates and I.
Even the ones who aren't marked.
Marked?
Katie, what do you mean?
When the boat's full...
What? You can tell me.
When he has all the souls he needs and has filled his quota...
...we'll all be ferried...
...to...
What is it? What's wrong?
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!
You need to tell me.
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!
Katie, what is it?
Katie! Katie?
MURPHY:
Epps?
Come on!
We have to leave.
Where you going, Murphy? Huh?
What's the matter? It's me.
Santos.
It's no fun lying at the bottom of the ocean.
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates. No.
Because of the plan, I'm trapped on this dreamboat of yours.
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.
No!
Murphy?
Murph?
You all right, Murph?
You okay?
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!
EPPS: It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.
Come on!
- Come on!
JACK: Hey!
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?
JACK: Keep him in the aquarium.
EPPS: No, listen. He was drunk.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.
DODGE:
Let's go find Greer.
EPPS:
Any sign of him?
MUNDER:
No, we looked all over.
DODGE: Mars pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.
DODGE: Least we werert around in '62.
- The passengers were poisoned...
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...
Next thing you know, we'll be trying to kill each other.
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?
MUNDER: You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.
So the ship's got a few kinks.
Let's stick with Munder's specs and try to fix the ship.
No way five people and the gold will fit on any raft.
Murphy's not going anywhere, and we're not leaving him here.
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.
MUNDER
That's the collision bulkhead hatch.
DODGE: Wheel's busted. It won't open.
EPPS: Arming the C4.
EPPS: Dodge?
DODGE: I'm good.
EPPS: Munder?
MUNDER: I'm good.
EPPS:
Contact.
MUNDER: There's the tear, portside.
DODGE: Looks bigger from here.
MUNDER:
I'll shut her up, no problem.
EPPS:
Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
MUNDER:
I'm good.
EPPS: What do you think, Dodge?
DODGE: She'll hold.
MUNDER: We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.
MUNDER: Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.
DODGE: I give it 12 hours till she's dry.
MUNDER: Both on full.
MUNDER:
Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.
EPPS:
Great work, guys.
EPPS:
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.
If we control her drift, headed in this direction, we should clear those islands.
We'll keep it afloat until we get picked up.
DODGE: Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.
Kazillionaires.
Check on the bridge when you're done here.
I'll see if I can find Greer down below.
EPPS:
Greer?
Greer?
Katie?
Greer? Jesus!
- Oh, shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?
You go.
Shit. Every single time!
Oh, my God.
KATIE:
Come with me.
I want to show you something.
Murphy.
Murphy!
No!
Come on! No!
Come on!
You can't die on me!
Dodge. Murphy's dead.
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.
There's a reason you, me and Munder are still alive. That's why he came after us.
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?
I don't know.
I want you and Dodge on the rudder.
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds are holding. Stay here till we get back.
I do not want you out of each other's sight. Take this.
Take it.
- Be careful down there.
- I will.
Munder!
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.
You disgust me.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump," and you jump.
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?
You worship her, yet you've never had the balls to tell her...
...because you're a weak, cowardly child.
However, if you'll kindly step out of my way, I'll make your dream a reality.
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody, you go to hell.
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?
DODGE:
Epps.
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.
Wait, wait. Wait!
That gold can give us everything we ever wanted.
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.
We could have a life together.
You and me.
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.
Well, I can't let you do that.
So that's it, huh?
All right. Okay.
You win. All right.
Fucking bitch!
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!
Go ahead. Blow it up!
Kill us all!
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you asked me where Munder is?
Well, I suppose that's because...
...I already know.
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.
Katie told you, didn't she?
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.
But as long as I keep the boat afloat, we'll all go down together.
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.
So if I lose this ship, management won't be happy, which is not a good thing.
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.
This ship for your life.
I want my crew back.
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked, they're mine.
Then I guess it's over.
All you had to do was fix the ship!
I gave you a great opportunity.
All you had to do was take it.
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.
No!
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.
They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!
Please.
My sister, she's very, very sick.
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.
- Do you know my mother?
- No.
She's very, very sick.
I'll give you two.
That's a bad idea, you know.
Like feeding pigeons.
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.
I work for a private collector of rare antiquities.
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.
And I didn't answer.
There's been a discovery in East Africa.
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.
No, it's not possible.
The Byzantine Empire had adopted Christianity at that time... but they never got that far south.
Nevertheless, there it sits.
The British have financed a dig to uncover this church.
We believe a rare object waits inside.
We'd like you to find it and bring it back to us.
So you think I'm a thief?
Now you think I'm a thief and a whore.
No. Simply a man who's lost faith... in everything except himself.
Ah.
You know nothing about me.
You're an Oxford-educated archaeologist... an expert in religious icons.
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?
This is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for... a representation of a mythical demon.
It's Sumerian. What makes you think it's in a church in Africa?
A Major Granville in Nairobi is in charge of the dig.
He's been persuaded to let you join it.
You're assuming that I will say yes.
You already have.
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.
Left. Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.
Left.
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.
Beautiful, aren't they?
It's a hobby from school days.
Works wonders for the nerves.
You should try it sometime.
What can you tell me about the dig?
The location is a remote area of the Turkana district... called Derati.
It was discovered several months ago by a detachment of my men... on maneuvers there.
When the powers that be realized its importance, they organized a dig.
What have they learned so far?
That it's a church where no church should be.
This is Father Francis.
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.
I was especially impressed with your treatise on the Roman rituals.
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.
I was actually headed to Kenya to begin missionary work... when Rome learned of the discovery.
They've asked me to make sure the site's religious aspect have the proper consideration.
Hmm.
How come you've opened the site to the Vatican?
We haven't... officially.
You're both my guests.
Tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
Well, not until I've seen it.
Surely the Vatican has some record of its creation.
I'm afraid not.
We're as in the dark about it as you are.
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.
The British hired me as an interpreter.
What happened here?
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.
- How many died?
- All of them.
I'm Lancaster Merrin.
Major Granville should have contacted you about my joining the dig.
He did.
Is something bothering you, mate?
No.
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?
I shouldn't... but my will is weak.
Then you might just survive this place.
I understand you've uncovered the church dome... but that progress has slowed down.
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster- Lancaster Merrin.
You still haven't made it by my room, Doctor.
I've been having this, uh, swelling in the evening.
Thought you might have something I could put on it.
How about a muzzle?
So how are the interior excavations coming along?
- They're not.
- No?
Has the structure collapsed?
No, the church is perfect... but none of the men will enter, those we have left anyway.
Why's that?
I shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.
Well... pleasant fellow.
What's wrong with his face?
Other than that it's attached to his body?
Could be an allergic reaction or some kind oflocalized infection.
Do you know why the men won't enter the church?
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?
No. I'm a doctor.
But as a priest, surely you must believe in such things.
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.
Now, that's funny.
I met Father Francis outside, and he told me you were.
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.
Father Merrin.
This is Emekwi.
He's donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school.
Father, we are so glad that you are here.
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.
James. Joseph.
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.
There's your goddamn church.
Is this your first assignment, Father?
Before this, I was studying in the archives in the Holy Sea.
The Vatican.
Impressive.
But not really training for missionary work, is it?
This is strange.
It's 1,500 years old.
It should be badly weathered.
It's almost as if it were buried right after it was built.
Chuma.
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.
Hyenas?
They've been here ever since we started digging.
Even at daytime?
No! No! No!
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.
The heat?
Joseph?
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.
I think you're about ready for this now.
It's a tool for professional diggers.
Wow.
His seizure's stopped.
I wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation... but the Turkana have stopped trusting my medicine.
Well, that must make your job very hard.
You have no idea.
Thank you.
So what is it you hope to find here?
The answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before Christianity arrived.
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!
Can't wipe their own ass without instruction.
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.
I, uh- I found this... and, uh, I want you to have it.
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.
Please, for my behavior.
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.
It's okay. Come.
These little buggers, they get in everywhere.
How soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
A few days.
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.
Chuma'll take you in through the roof.
Following us, Father?
Is it safe to walk around?
Let's see.
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.
Cast out after the war in heaven.
Can't even trust angels, can you?
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.
It's odd.
Churches were built to exalt heaven... but this, the weapons are pointing downward.
Look behind you, Father.
Desecration of Christ.
Who would do something like this?
The crucifix was broken off from here.
Chuma, is there an inventory of what's been found here?
I wouldn't know.
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.
- It's not possible.
- Why not?
He's gone mad.
No one's been inside Bession's tent since he fell ill?
They are superstitious.
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.
- Chuma.
- Yes?
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?
The language spoken in Palestine at the time of Christ.
And what does it say?
The fallen shall rise... in a river of blood. "
Do you have a moment?
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?
Or maybe something more substantial?
Yes, that would be very nice.
You dabble in the occult?
I found them here when I arrived.
I wanted to ask you, did you treat Bession?
You should let me clean that before it gets infected.
There was nothing I could do for Monsieur Bession.
He had no medical symptoms... nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection.
His breakdown was purely mental and extremely severe.
That's why the Turkana fear the church is cursed.
That and the disappearances.
In the past few weeks, we've lost a dozen men.
Runaways?
Or is it those evil spirits?
Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.
My father was a strong man.
When the Nazis started rounding up theJews in our town... he didn't hesitate.
He hid our neighbors in the crawl space.
But someone turned us in... and we were all sent to the concentration camps.
I'm sorry.
People can't really understand, can they?
If they weren't there... if they didn't see.
No.
And my husband turned out to be one of those people.
I met him after the war, and we came to Africa together, in love.
One night I realized
I- I had to tell him the truth... about... the Nazis... and what they did to me.
After that, he never touched me again.
So... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
I don't know.
I suppose I-
I wanted to work with something real, something I could touch with my hands.
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.
No.
There's no point in that.
Sometimes I think the best view of God is from hell.
I should get to bed.
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow to see Bession.
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?
He runs the sanitarium.
Well, thank you... for the medical care.
Deliver us from evil... for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
You, priest.
What is your name?
I'm Father Merrin.
God is not here today, priest.
Want some water?
Hey, what's wrong?
It's late.
You should go back to bed.
Give it to me! It's mine!
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.
Give it to me!
It's mine.
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!
All right. Okay, okay.
Go back to bed, and I'll give you the stupid thing.
Joseph, look out!
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!
Joseph, help me!
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.
No! Help me!
Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me! Please!
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.
They were focused on his brother.
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.
Can you see?
Can you hear?
Come with me.
Monsieur Bession?
Mr. Bession.
You worked on a dig in Derati.
You drew a picture of an idol.
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?
Mr. Bession.
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?
I said how do you know my name?
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm free.
God is not here today, priest.
I hope he finds peace.
I'm Father Gionetti.
I've been waiting for you.
How did he know my name?
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin, that you can't see?
Monsieur Bession was touched by the devil.
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.
So, "touched. "
What does that mean?
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent in Loudon, France... was plagued by possession.
Thirty-four nuns had been touched by the devil... committing unspeakable acts.
Having orgies including goats doesn't make them possessed.
Simply horny... and inventive.
Four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons.
Three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died.
The last one was driven insane by his brush... with evil.
That is what happened to Monsieur Bession.
And that evil remains in Derati.
You must be careful there.
Remember, he is the father of lies.
He will seek to poison your mind.
You will need this against him.
The Roman Rituals.
If you need somebody to perform an exorcism, I'm not your man.
I'm not a priest anymore.
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.
Only your faith can save you.
Well, then I'm doomed.
Joseph?
What do you have there?
Can I see?
You threw it away.
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.
- The clasp must have come loose-
- Liar!
Do I repulse you that much?
Maybe if you could cure my fucking face...
I might look as good to you as that archaeologist.
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.
What?
He's coming for you.
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.
Ohh.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
Where is everybody?
Sebituana's baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome.
Oh.
Joseph. Hey.
Joseph.
You're back.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.
These lesions- they're not from the shock, are they?
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.
Itjust doesn't make sense.
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?
In this part of the world... it could be a dozen things... but his symptoms don't really match any of them.
So all I can do is just watch and wait.
I have to do some work up at the dig.
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.
Come sit with me, Lancaster.
I promise I won't bite.
What is it?
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.
- How?
- I don't know.
Some accident.
I just don't understand everything that's happening here.
It seems like I can't help anyone anymore.
Hey.
Easy.
Help me hold him.
Emekwi. I'm doing everything I can for him.
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.
You don't understand.
What they did to me in the camp. They-
There's nothing left to bleed.
There is something here, something evil.
Sarah, it's so much easier to believe in evil as an entity... but it's not.
It's a purely human condition inside all of us.
Did Bession talk about what he found under the church?
There's an ancient temple below, a pagan place... where they used to conduct sacrifices, human sacrifices.
Why would they build a church on top of something like that?
Perhaps to purify the site.
But then why bury it?
No!
Merrin!
You better come with me.
Jefferies didn't show up for the dig this morning.
He wasn't in his room, so they came to the bar and they found-
Chief Sebituana's baby was stillborn last night.
He blames the whites.
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?
I think this place is on the verge of an uprising.
I've contacted Major Granville.
A detachment will be here by this afternoon.
You disagree?
In my experience, bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea.
Who buried them?
Everybody died.
Who buried them?
All right! Halt!
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.
Well, you did the right thing calling me, Father.
I've been in these situations before... and you have to stay on top of- on top of these people.
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible for what's happening here, Major.
Major Granville?
This dig is too important to jeopardize... and until I'm satisfied that the excavation is secure... the British Army will assume complete control.
The Turkana won't like the show of force.
I'm not concerned with what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!
If they start any more trouble, they will have to answer... to the might of His Majesty King George.
You cannot be here.
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.
You are not welcome here.
I want to know about the plague that destroyed this village 50 years ago.
It was not a plague.
So, what was it?
The evil in your church... it has taken Emekwi's youngest son... and it is getting stronger.
You must abandon your work... or we'll be forced to stop you.
So you don't want to tell me?
He says he doesn't have to tell you because it's happening again... right now.
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.
Then who's buried in that graveyard?
I'm sorry.
What are you-
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.
I will shoot 10, priest, and you will choose.
I can't do that.
No! No!
Now you choose... or I will kill them all.
Are you praying... to God?
Shoot me.
God is not here today, priest.
Papa!
- They're empty!
- What?
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!
There are crosses on the coffins!
The church buried them, didn't they?
Didn't they?
Yes.
Why?
What were they hiding?
That this place is damned.
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!
There was a massacre here...
1,500 years ago.
An army from the west, led by two priests... searching for the origin of a powerful evil.
But when they got here that evil consumed them... turning the soldiers against each other in a bloodbath.
Only a single priest survived.
When that priest made it back to the EmperorJustinian... he ordered that a church be built over the site and then buried... to seal the evil inside.
All mention of it was to be stricken from the history texts forever.
But it wasn't?
No.
In 1893... a Vatican researcher found an ancient letter in the archives.
Four priests came to examine the site... enlisting the help of the people of this valley in their search... and they all disappeared.
Where did they go?
No one knows.
The Vatican ordered a cover-up- the false graveyard... the tale of a plague to- to scare people away.
And then the British stumbled across it.
And I was sent here to see if the legend was real.
What legend?
That after the war in heaven... this is the spot where Lucifer fell.
God brought you here, Lancaster.
Leave me alone.
No.
The devil is here... inside that boy.
The Turkana know it.
They came to drive the devil from him, and he almost killed them.
You can't run from this.
You must help me.
I can't.
But you've seen what's going on here.
You have to believe.
I believe in nothing.
Found Jefferies.
- Over there!
- As you were!
Major Granville!
Wait!
Get him down.
Get him down!
You all right, Major?
Savages.
Major! Major!
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!
- You must leave.
- Granville!
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!
You must return Turkana to us now.
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.
You have already polluted our lives.
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.
Granville!
No!
No! No!
No!
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!
Chuma!
Merrin.
They believe it is inside Joseph.
They are going to kill him.
Now, please... go!
You animals!
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!
Three boxes of ammunition!
Sir. The Turkana are preparing to attack.
Leave me.
Sir?
I said, leave me.
Yes, sir.
We must leave now.
Why?
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.
Take the boy to Nairobi.
Father Gionetti.
Why?
Turkana are coming to kill him.
It's a sandstorm.
It won't let us leave.
We have to hide him.
- The church.
- No!
The Turkana won't go in there.
It's his only chance.
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.
We'll meet you.
Francis!
Now go.
Sarah?
The Lord is coming for you.
Sarah?
Sarah!
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sanctu.
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!
Sarah?
Sarah!
Oh, my God.
Bession was Sarah's husband?
Yes.
She went into the church with him, didn't she?
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.
Sancti Michael Archangel-
Ready yourselves, men!
Fire!
Chuma!
Francis?
Francis.
Francis.
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.
I need you.
These people need you.
This valley needs you.
Hear my cry.
Do not abandon me now.
Forgive my sins.
Joseph.
Come sit with us, Lancaster.
I promise I won't bite!
Joseph, run.
- He's mine.
- Run!
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.
I am a fallen priest.
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.
God, Father in heaven, have mercy on us.
God, the Son, redeemer of the world, have mercy on us.
God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.
Christ, hear us.
Holy Mary, pray for us.
Christ, hear us.
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?
Don't you want to fuck me anymore?
All ye holy angels and archangels... pray for us!
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits, pray for us!
Why would he listen to you?
You.
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.
Without hope.
Almighty Lord... and father ofJesus Christ... grant me, your unworthy servant, pardon for all my sins... and the power to fight this cruel-
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.
No! Father!
Joseph!
Father, help me!
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!
Father Merrin!
Merrin!
O Lord, by your name save me.
By your strength defend my cause.
No!
- Father!
- Joseph?
Joseph!Joseph!
Wait!
Joseph.
Father!
I'm coming.
O God, hear my prayer.
The ruthless seek my life.
They do not keep God before them.
Turn back the evil upon my foes.
In your faithfulness destroy them.
Where's your God now, Merrin?
Fucking his only son while you call out his name?
He doesn't care about this whore.
But you do... because you want to shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.
From the souls made to the image and likeness of God...
I cast you out!
You're a killer, Merrin.
You looked them in the eye, pointed your finger, and they died.
God is not here today, priest.
Oh, yes, he is.
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.
Fail him like you failed all the others.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent... and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child... for he is innocent... and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent and deserves your blessing.
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!
It is God himself who commands you.
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.
The mystery of the cross commands you!
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.
Sarah.
It's over now.
Joseph.
Merrin!
Father!
Don't be afraid.
I need your help,Joseph.
Listen, whatever you hear, whatever you see, it's just his lies.
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?
Don't listen!
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.
Can you read this?
I will start there.
Then you will answer.
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.
You understand?
Good.
Let's start.
O God... by your name save me.
Amen. "
Save your servant.
Who places his trust in thee, my God. "
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower. lln the face of the enemy. "
O Lord, hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee. "
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you. "
Begone, evil spirit... in the name of the Father and of the Son... and of the Holy Ghost!
By the sign of this holy cross... by our Lord Jesus Christ...
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!
The blood of the martyrs commands you!
In God's name, demon...
I cast you out!
Sarah?
Sarah.
Okay?
Thank you.
Look, um-
Sarah, what is it?
What is it, Sarah?
Lancaster!
- No!
- Help-
Sarah.
- No!
- Help-
Sarah.
Father?
She's with God now.
She's with God.
I trust your mission was successful.
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
But you found something.
Didn't you?
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.
It's Father Merrin.
[Instrumental music plays]
[Propellers whirring]
This is almost a day behind us.
Well, who are they?
Americans? Brits? Italians?
It doesn't even say.
Well, I think we can assume they're friendly, Mr. Loomis.
Besides, it doesn't appear to be a suggestion, does it?
What the hell?
Might get a Silver Star out of this patrol yet.
Just have Coors plot it out.
[Indistinct conversation in distance]
[Exhales deeply]
Gunners mate standing by, sir.
Stow the weapons.
They're British.
- You can tell that from here?
- It's the sail.
The krauts use white on their lifeboats. The Brits use red.
Don't they teach you that in OCS, ensign?
Afraid not, but I can recite the submariners' motto in Latin.
MAN: Radar contact... starboard beam, seven miles out, sir.
God damn it!
What if they see us?
Well, they're pouring on the coal for somebody.

All right, do this at flank speed!
I want you to grab what's breathing on that boat and you leave everything else behind!
Stand by to board survivors.

Wounded coming down.
Next man, let's go.

There's a warship approaching, guys.
Let's move! Move!

Three survivors... Brits... and get this... one's a woman.

[Indistinct conversations]
Three Brits... one's a skirt.
Three limeys... one's a female.
Hey.
Three Brits... one female.
[Laughs]
[Clicking]
Guys, listen up.
We've got three survivors... all Brits.
One's a woman, eh?
Hey, look lively.
Woman onboard.
Hey, Hoag, spread the news... three tea bags, and I hear one's, uh, bazooma.
We got ourselves a filly?
[Clicks tongue]
Ohh!
Sweet holy Jesus.
You're gonna wanna hear this.
Hey, boys... here's the news.
Front page... we got three redcoats, and guess what.
One of them's a bleeder.
Aw, great.
That's all this boat needs... another piece of rotten luck.
Yeah, well, if it means you guys finally wash the butt squirt outta your shorts,
I'm all for it.
[Groaning]
So what exactly happened to your shi...
Um... your ship?
[British accent]
Hospital ship.
We were attacked two nights ago.
Two nights?
I'm... I'm sorry.
My brain's a bit foggy.
Although I'm reasonably sure my name's Claire Page.
The rest of the details will emerge, I'm sure.
[Howling]
That's just a whale.
It's okay, really.
The sounds down here still get to me, too.
MAN: Make a hole.
Comin' through. Make a hole.
Yow.
Mind your pretty toes.
Best-lookin' bad luck
I ever saw.
[Laughs]
Doesn't look good, sir.
Why don't you get those clothes off of him and see if you can get a better look at the wounds?
I can dress the wounds.
Other than that, I think it's best to leave him be.
Okay. All right.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I saw it.
It crossed the moon's reflection just before the explosion.
Yes, it was dark, but I...
I did see it.
It wasn't a mine.
I... It was a U-boat.
[Indistinct voice on P.A.]
What class?
Type 7?
Was it an older boat or one of their newer ones?
Um...
Like this?
Clean at the bow?
- You know...
- No net cutter?
It was just a couple of seconds.
I really couldn't say for...
So you were... you were on lookout that night, mister...
Kingsley... second mate, merchant navy.
Uh, no.
I was on the starboard deck grabbing a gasper.
Having a cigarette.
And how many aboard your ship?
About 300 patients.
At least that many.
Out of North Africa.
Yeah, plus over 70 hands crew.
So, um...
You said they fired only one torpedo?
O'Dell... you better tell sonar we've got an enemy sub in the area.
Yes, sir.
Just let me finish...
Now. Do it now.
Yes, sir.
I'm... I'm sorry that we couldn't save more. I...
Now this... the third member of your party, he's...
One of my patients.
Well, under normal circumstances,
I'd be able to drop you at the nearest port in England, but, uh, it's a 300-mile detour for us.
So I'm sorry.
It seems as though we're stuck with each other.
Oh, uh, last thing.
Just try not to fraternize with the men.
Most of the men are fine, but some of them get a little strange about having...
[Chuckles] "Strange" as in "superstitious"?
As in "strange."
"Suddenly, his heart rolled over backwards in his chest,
"and he saw this huge, wretched thing before him.
"Instantly, its mouth widened
"into a terrible and hungry menace.
Now the malediction uttered a deep-throated sound."
- Malediction?
- Look it up.
"And its breath stank gloriously
"of rotted carp and matted gorilla skins.
"Now... it slouched toward him...
"not fast, but slowly...
"slowly... so very slowly."
[Thud]
Silly boy.
Just the bulkhead shifting.
What'd you think it was?
The malediction?
Wahh!
[Laughter]
What exactly bothers you,
O'Dell?
Well, you have a ship that's sinking slow enough to get a few lifeboats off, but the submarine only fires one torpedo.
I mean, that's not textbook tactics.
You fire upon the target until the target is sunk.
So it was their last torpedo.
Yeah, but... why not use a deck gun?
O'Dell, isn't this your first patrol?
My second.
Yeah.
And your first was a little shakedown run off the coast of Florida in one of those old school boats, right?
I'm just wondering if the story didn't seem a little off.
I wouldn't worry about it, champ.
They got here somehow.
- You want coffee?
- Sure.
I take it black.
Tell Broadway make sure it's hot.

I know you're in pain, but you must try.
Please.

Damage reports.
[Indistinct conversations]
Well, maybe that Z-class just happened to be there.
And maybe the phonograph wasn't secured.
But God damn.
And maybe someone doesn't want us to make it home.
Miss Page claims she was in the control room the whole time.
Yeah, that's right.
- So what about the other guy?
- Kingsley?
Hmph!
If that's his name.
Where was he when it all happened?
I'm not sure.
Maybe he stepped out.
Stepped out... or slipped out?
[Scoffs]
You know, maybe we're spending more time watching that broad than watching our backs.
Who, me?
I've talked to her twice.
I heard you were bird-dogging her, O'Dell.
Been running your mouth, ensign, about boat matters?
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
As for the record player going off, well, yeah, that's strange.
But I don't think it calls for a lynching party.
I think we should all just take a deep breath.
- [Telephone rings]
- Conn, Brice.
[Man speaking indistinctly]
[Indistinct conversation]
Where'd you find it?
Make a hole!
Lieutenant, I was all set to toss these pants, then I noticed this, sir.
And these came from...
The half-dead guy, sir.
MAN: Must've been him done that record player.
Wake him up.
I... I'm sorry.
I'm not quite sure...
Wake the German up.
[German accent]
Hello, mein Kapitan.
Jesus.
It was me.
It was my idea.
I was the one who told him not to speak.
She had him under our noses the whole goddamn time.
Aah!
- Wait!
- I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.
His name is Ben Archerlift.
He's a downed aviator.
He's a patient of mine.
He's a prisoner of war, and under the Geneva Convention, he's entitled to humane treatment!
He has a wife and family.
He wants to get home just like you or me.
O'DELL:
Everything will be all right.
[Gunshot]
You should've told me.
Maybe I was afraid you'd do exactly what you've just done!
You should've told me no matter what,
'cause your little secret nearly cost every man here his life.
You had no cause.
Mr. O'Dell, the woman is confined to quarters for the duration of the patrol.
If she asks to use the toilet, you are to bring her a bucket.
Stumbo, clean up that fuckin' mess.
Fucking A-1, sir.
I'll be in my berth... sleeping.
[Spits]
I just wanted to save one.

Just... one of my patients.

Aaaahh!
[Footsteps depart]
Look, it's happened twice now.
I don't think that's an accident.
Somebody is up to something.
Well, just so you know, I've walked in the wardroom before and found a steward listening to the record player while he was cleaning up.
- Now, I wouldn't blame him...
- Unless he's...
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey.
How are those hydrogen levels?
It's almost 3%.
Chief says we need to vent before long.
All right. We'll ride surface tonight... 2100.
[Sighs]
Is there something else?
Yeah.
I just can't believe it's one of our own hands doing this.
I've been on the boat seven weeks now, and I know most of the guys.
I just don't believe it's one of them.
- Who are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anybody.
You know, it's been a rough patrol.
Some men do strange things under duress.
So just keep your eyes open.
Yes, sir.
[Footsteps depart]
Bright kid, O'Dell.

KINGSLEY:
Don't let them get to you.

I heard a voice. I heard it.
KINGSLEY: It's nothing.
Just ignore them, all right?
Claire, are you listening?
- I thought he spoke to me.
- Claire...
It wasn't his voice, but he spoke to me.
Claire!
[Snickering]
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- Claire, don't.
Have you got nothing better to do at a time of war than play games with dead bodies?!
You are on thin ice... real thin ice.
Wrap it back up... for the last time.
We'll dump him when we surface.
A bit more respect for the dead might be in order, Mr. Brice... from everybody onboard this ship.
This is a boat you're a guest on, not a ship.

[Both laughing quietly]
[Ghostly voice] Get off before it's too late!
[Both shuddering]
[Screaming quietly]

I've got a dead kraut dick in my face, and you're complaining?
Come on, Stumbo!

You need to turn around.

Oh, nice try.
Hoag told you, right?
Turn around.
So many left behind.
I want...

God damn it!
What the hell are you doing, Stumbo?
- Stumbo.

I'm telling you, there's some bad hoodoo on this boat.
That might've worked on the female, Stumbo, but not me.
Look, fuck the brillo pad.
This ain't about her.
He talked to me.
- HOAG: Oh, wow.
- The dead guy?
- The dead kraut talked to me.
- Yeah, right.
Wow.
Did he talk to you in English or German?
I guess it was English.
Case closed.

Prepare to surface.
Prepare to surface.
Be ready on all four engines.
Stand by to charge batteries.
Let's go. Come on.

Uh, talk to me later.
Mr. Coors, are we going to be surfacing soon, take on some fresh air?
- We're trying to.
- Any idea when that might be?
What are you doing here?
I... I wasn't comfortable in my cabin, what with the blood on the walls.
You shouldn't be in the skipper's cabin without permission.
Well, I'll gladly ask him.
Mr. Brice is the skipper, isn't he?
Lieutenant Brice is the current C.O. of the boat.
You need his permission to be anywhere besides your assigned quarters.

Sorry.

You hear... you hear a lot of strange things at depth.
I mean, I can't even identify 'em all.
So...
What am I gonna do with you?
I'm sorry.
I regret not telling you about Schillings... because... well,
I... I should have realized that a submarine isn't a good place to keep secrets.
Is it?
We'd been stalking a German sub tender for a while.
We finally got our shot in, cracked its back with one torpedo.
We went topside to survey the damage, and the ship was gone.
But there's a lot of debris in the water, and Captain Winters decides to go down and haul some in.
It was the middle of the Atlantic.
He wants to do some souvenir hunting, get something for his... I don't know... his mantle piece.
I try to talk him out of it, and... but he's al...
Anyway, he... the boat hit an underwater obstruction, and he fell... he hit his head.
And he was... he went under before we could get to him.
I heard you were asking.
So he drowned.
We already radioed Connecticut with news of the accident.

You know, we really, really got off on the wrong foot, and I...
So j-just feel free to move about the forward sections of...

Uh, she was... asking about Winters.
What did you tell her?
The story.
Well, it's coming up astern, but...
[Rumbling]
I don't know what that is.
[Rumbling continues, clanking]
[Loud thud]
[Rumbling, creaking]
[Rumbling, thudding continue]
Hooks!
They're using their hooks!
[Clanking]
Mr. Loomis, what do we do?
What are your orders,
Mr. Brice?
Mr. Loomis, the helm is waiting!
The men are waiting for your orders, Mr. Brice!
Aah!
Get out! Get out!
Everybody, out!
Move it out!
[Indistinct shouting]
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody, out!
- Come on!
- Get out!
[Echoing]
Get out! Get out!
Get down there, Harry!
Move!
[Creaks]
[Clicking]
Get out.
O'Dell, make sure everybody's out!
- Everybody's out, sir!
- Then close the goddamn hatch!
- Blow safety!
- Blow safety!
What heading, sir?!
Any goddamn heading!
Just get us out of here!
[Whirring, engines roar]
[Poles squeak]
[Shivering]
You'll do better at the board of inquiry.
[Clicking, hatch opens]
[Clicking, whirring]
We're sloughing oil, and it's bad.
I don't know exactly where it is, but it's somewhere between the pressure hull and the sea hull.
And if it's leaking here or here, then it's dumping oil under the main ballast, which means that every time we surface or dive...
We leave an oil slick.
Well, that's how... that's how he's been riding us.
This boat is cursed.
Figure of speech.
So how do we fix it?
Well, there's only one way... from the outside in.
[Thudding]
They'll be lining up for this job.
Okay, so let's make ready some dive gear.
All right.
O'Dell, pick two volunteers...
Yes, sir.
...besides yourself.
WALLY: You want someone to free-dive outside with you into the cold, black water, make our way below the boat, locate the floodboards, and slither in between the two hulls?
That's right.
Find the leak and fix it.
- At night.
- Hang on.
We're still submerged.
That means the main tanks are full of water.
This is in the dark, Dell.
Yeah, well, chief thinks that with the tower flooded, it gives the boat enough weight to stay down while we blow some air into the main tank.
Oh, well [Scoffs] if that's what the chief thinks.
So... you're gonna go out there.
You're gonna go outside.
Yes, that's right.
With all these... happenings happening.
Look alive.
All right.
Who are the lucky bastards?
[Scoffs] Fuck, no.
Set.
I asked him to go.
Buddy system.
[Hatch opens, creaking]
[Loud thud]
- [Muffled] Ooh!
- Oh, shit!
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
[All breathing heavily]
[Clanging]
[Clanging continues in distance]
[Sighs]
You and me, O'Dell.
Forward.
You guys take aft.
[All breathing heavily]
[Grunts]
[Panting]
Shit!
BRICE: 2330 hours.
To confirm sinking of German ship, four officers go topside...
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis, and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...
Odd time to bring that up.
It's an odd place.
So, how'd he bang his head before he went over?
You heard.
I heard that the boat hit something, but I never felt it down below.
[Thudding]
What?!
I didn't say anything.
I know, but what were you thinking?
Well...
I used to hear about these dock workers.
They would get welded up in these kind of places.
And then... they were never heard from again.
Wally?
You are so fucking out-of-bounds with that shit!
Let's keep moving.
Forward trim tank, it looks like.
Better drive some wedges.
Yeah.
[Grunts, exhales sharply]
So anything I say... stays here... this side of the hull.
[Breathlessly]
Yeah. Yeah.
There were survivors from the sinking.
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Brice and Loomis even, uh... even tried to fish a few out, but... Winters had other ideas, and, uh... he ordered a gunnery party topside.
Well, three of us had a problem with machine-gunning those men right in the water,
I mean, even if they were German.
There was an argument.
It got kind of heated.
Well, why didn't you tell us?!
I guess, uh...
I guess we were trying to protect him... felt Winters was a pretty good C.O., even if he could be a tough son of a bitch sometimes.
For his reputation... you know, his family's sake.
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...
I still don't see how he hit his head.
Slippery metal.
Bad footing.
Accidents happen, right?
[Gasps]
[Screaming in distance]
[Both gasping]
Where the hell did that come from?!
Near or aft?
Crew, sound off!
Get them out of there!
Get them out!!
O'Dell!
[Clanking]
Sound off, O'Dell!
- Oh!
- Sir!
Fuck, was that you?
The light!
[All scream]
[Shuddering]
We gotta get him out.
Come on, guys.
- How are we gonna...
- [Thudding]
Did you see that?
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!
[All talking]
- Talk to me.
- Don't touch me.
Did you fix it?
Which one of you boys was screaming out there?
- Are we a man down?
- Don't touch me!
- Are we a man down?!
- Shut up!
Who was screaming?!
Come on, grow some dicks and shut up!
[Choking]
Now, where is Mr. O...
[Thudding]
Coors... where's Coors?
You tell me that's him.
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?
Sir... that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.
[Thudding continues]
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!
- Don't! Don't!
- Hey, easy.
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.
- Easy, easy.
- Was that a "B"... dash, dot, dot, dot?
I didn't hear a "B."
[Thudding continues]
Dot, dash..."A"... thought I heard an "A."
No, that's not morse.
It's just some shit got caught up on the bow planes.
Now it's smacking up against...
"C"... you hear a "C"?
Dash, dot, dash, dot... definitely a "C."
It's hull sounds.
You guys are getting lathered up about hull sounds.
Now, would somebody please tell us what happened to Mr. Coors?
"Back"... B-A-C-K.
He's back.
And where'd you get the "K" from?
Dash, dot, dash... while you were talking.
Hey, champ, you can stay the hell out of this.
- And the rest of you...
- Enough, already, enough!
In the wardroom, 5 minutes.
Keep your mouths shut till we debrief.
LOOMIS:
Did you finish the job?
Yes, sir, absolutely.
Right, Wally? Wally?
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.
All right, so, look, if the weather is good, we surface tonight, we recharge the batteries.
We pour on the diesel, keep pushing for the barn.
O'DELL: Our barn?
Mr. Brice, southern English port's gonna be more than two days away.
Two days away, Mr. Brice!
[Indistinct conversations]
Kingsley here is a navigational officer. He knows the way.
I know all the ports, the depths, where the submarine nets are, the mine fields.
Yeah, and have the R.A.F. bomb us because they mistake us for a hostile boat... okay.
There are safety corridors that we can use...
Considered and rejected, thank you.
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes are down, our sonar is gone.
We are blind and nearly deaf.
Our men are in a bad way, and now we've lost two of our senior officers.
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.
This has nothing to do with the war.
Just how much longer can we not say what we're all thinking?
No one wants to be the first?
Fine. Allow me.
This submarine is haun...
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.
I am not one of your men that you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!
I don't believe we're alone down here, and I know some of you think the same way.
Unless we find a safe harbor soon, we're all going to end up like your friend Mr. Coors.
The loss of Lieutenant Coors is unfortunate.
It fails to affect our plans.
[Clicks, static]
Attention all hands... it's daylight now.
I expect to surface... at 1900, recharge the batteries, and proceed on base course back to Connecticut.
- That is all.
- [Switch clicks]
You're 10 seconds away from finding out what the penalty is for mutiny at sea,
'cause that's how long it's gonna take me to open the armory and reload that sidearm.
Now, do either of you care to say anything else that might further agitate this crew or me?
Mr. O'Dell?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
[Sighs]
We just knock the nose around a little bit, we're back on base, so make it 2-8-5.
Make it 2-8-5 true.
2-8-5 true, sir.
[Engines rumbling]
Heading home, boys.
Sound good?
- Yes, sir.
- Sounds good, sir.
[Clanking]
Hey, you're oversteering.
Mind your rudder.
She's getting some resistance, sir.
[Creaking, rumbling]
[Grunting]
[Rattling]
Chief of boat to control.
Chief of boat to control room.
[Rumbling continues]
[Rumbling continues]
All right, belay that.
Belay that.
I said belay that!
[Explosion]
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Rumbling stops]
[Squeaking]
Rudder at midship, sir.
Um, some... kind of hydraulic failure.
Oh, Christ.
Must have overshot our heading by...
170 degrees.
Oh, good. A gun.
Yeah, I needed a gun.
I'll put that with the prizes.
Okay, I got feathers, crosses, and strip-show icons...
Rudder malfunction.
When we tried to shut down the props, no dice.
Wouldn't respond.
We're on a runaway boat, fellas.
Now, can any of you top that?
[Spits] Well...
I had a strange thought.
Take a number.
Yeah, but this one's real creep-show stuff.
What if, when we took on that kraut ship...
...we didn't sink 'em?
What if... they sank us?
Oh, that's a good twist.
I don't get it.
Might explain how that dead kraut talked to Stumbo.
I don't get it.
And the controls... that they froze up.
No, they... they rusted up.
That's because we're at the... the bottom of the ocean.
Flooded out.
Of course, I'm not sure what all that pounding was about.
Those are rescue divers... pounding on the hull.
Only it's too late.
Shit, I get it.
Hydrogen from the batteries...
CO2, ozone from the electrical shorts... that's what we're breathing right now.
Like those deep-sea divers that don't get enough oxygen... head starts playing tricks on 'em.
We got mechanical problems, that's all, okay?
We always got mechanical problems.
Now, please... will you pinch this shit off?
- Unless...
- Oh...
It happened during the depth charging.
Remember that one?
Rolled right down our deck.
[Creaking]
[Clicks]
So exactly how far from England are we?
Can I ask why you're asking?
No.
Right.
Uh, what's our heading?
Right. Uh...
[Muttering indistinctly]
May I ask why you're asking?
Just in case the boat can't make it back home... for whatever reason.
LOOMIS: What do you suggest we do about it, chief?
[Indistinct voice]
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.
- Pressure blinding the shafts.
- No, I don't think that's it.
Just lay it out for us, chief.
What about the I.M.O. pumps?
I.M.O. pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.
The rudder has a dedicated line from here to the stern.
If we tap into there somewhere aft,
I think we should regain our steering.
But where are you gonna tap in?
That's the thing.
The line goes right through the battery room.
That's a little dicey, isn't it, without venting first?
Just threading up new hydraulics, no welding.
Well, where are we at, anyway?
13 percent down.
- 13 percent hydrogen?
- Keep your voice down.
Look, I don't know any other way to regain control...
[Rumbling]
[Screeching]
Fuck if I know.
All right, but you gotta make sure you're sealed off,
'cause we don't want a repeat of the Hindenburg here.
Let's keep this quiet.
As if it's a bloody mechanical problem.
[Hinges creak, hatch slams]
[Whirring, clicking]
Fore door sealed.
After door sealed.
[Sighs]
What's happened here, hmm?
What is this?
Go to the galley.
Get a cup of coffee.
Oh, no, I'm fine, sir.
Really.
You're falling asleep, champ.
- I'll watch your bubble.
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, a word?
- Not now.
- No, Mr. Loomis.
We need to speak right now.
[Grunts]
[Rumbling]
That is a whale, right?
[Sighs]
What else would it be?
Come on.
Let's get that rudder working.
Now, maybe this is just a coincidence.
I know Lieutenant Coors wasn't too sure about the last star fix.
But it sure seems like we're going right back to where we sunk that German ship.
Clear the compartment.
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.
Go!
All right.
We're almost all set.
Just repressurizing the line, see if we can't put the brakes on this little joyride.
[Rumbling, thudding]
[Powers down, silence]
I'll reset the bus.
Shit!
[Whirring]
[Hatch hinges creak]
Hey, guys, we lost power up here.
Shut that goddamn door before I shut it with your goddamn face!
What are you saying, O'Dell?
It's not a coincidence?
Somebody put us on this course?
I'm just asking a question.
Let me ask one.
Where were you when the rudder went over?
Huh?
This course heads back to England, and I've noticed you've had a hard-on for anything English.
So where were you, O'Dell?
Back of the boat... messing with the rudder assembly?
Or did you get some motormac...
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard!
Not as crazy as what you're saying!
I'm tired of this hoodoo horseshit!
It is not what you think it is!
It is not even remotely
fucking possible!
Okay?!

Try to stop me.
You're gonna pull through.

We gotta release that air.
Come on. One more.
Come on, Stumbo.
STUMBO:
It's like it's welded.
[Sighs]
All I know is what Coors told me.
And apparently...
Captain Winters wanted to shoot the German survivors.
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis and Mr... Mr. Coors... wanted to help.
Apparently Captain Winters lost the argument.
Well, that's interesting.
[Breathes deeply]
But it's not what I heard... from Mr. Brice.
[Breathlessly]
Lieutenant?
Are you sure he came back here?
BRICE: Looking for me?
[Gasps]
I, uh...
Just... reporting, sir, that the heating is down.
And, uh... the bow's levers are stuck.
Stumbo's working on it right now.
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air still left in the system, and I... wasn't sure if you wanted to use that when we tried to surface or use it now so we can breathe.
Shinola.
Sir?
Running out of shinola, too.
We also wanted to ask you about Captain Winters... whether there was anything you could tell us about what happened that night that might help us to understand...
Don't pretend you don't know.
Just don't pretend anymore.
Well, wasn't that awkward?
STUMBO: Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.
If not the depth charge, then... the hydrogen.
If not the hydrogen, then...
[Shudders]
Maybe the cold.
And if not that, then we got a big evil spirit batting cleanup.
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on, Stumbo.
There should only be so many ways a guy can die.
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.
It starts from the floor up, and I need you right now...
- No, no.
- To get up on your feet.
- Maybe I just need to...
- Stumbo. Stumbo!
- Let me try.
- We already bought it.
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.
- Over and over...
- I need you to sit up.
- Over and over again.
- Look at me.
Now look at me.
Look at me.
- [Panting]
- Good.
Feel that?
Well, you're alive, then, aren't you?
You fuckin'...
- Stumbo...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Take it easy! Hey!
- Relax, man!
Stumbo!
Isn't there a winch or a pulley or maybe a come-along in a bowsman's locker?
- Yeah.
- Can't we use that?
You know what he's talking about, Stumbo?
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.
Come... we need it. Come on.
Show... show me, Stumbo.
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.
[Panting]
So, tell me why three officers would conspire to kill their captain and cover it up.
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
[Panting]
What if I am?
I can see I'm not the only one.
Loomis was up for a major citation.
And Brice was ready for his own command.
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.
Coors had this beautiful girl waiting for him back in Boston that he was always talking about, Claire.
These guys had everything to live for.
By that reasoning... they had everything to lose.
[Soft rumbling]
Are we missing somebody?
[Rumbling continues]
Wallace...
Wallace?
- No!
- [Gasps]
- No! No!
- Shh!
- No-o-o!
- It's just us.
It's just... us.
- [All panting]
- Now, listen...
We're running out of plays in the playbook.
Do you have... any idea why the boat is going back or how we can get control of it?
[Panting]
I've been checking the literature on this subject.
And the thing we know about maledictions is...
Maledictions?
Look it up.
Maledictions don't issue from Heaven or Hell but from some unresolved place in between.
In fact, there's a great...
Wallace... we're running out of air.
[Breathes deeply]
Suffice to say... the malediction needs satisfaction in order to escape its netherworld.
And if you had to guess... what would satisfy our malediction?
Old Man Winters never got a chance to go down with the ship, did he?
[Creaking]
[Labored breathing]
[Grunts]
Wallace, leave yours here.
We gotta dig up some more light.
Okay, listen, uh...
Just... Just promise me you'll stay on your feet, okay?

I personally verify the match.
2320: Single torpedo fired from number-4 tube.

So what you're saying is... that the submarine
Kingsley saw... the one he thought was German...
Wasn't.
So it was an accident?
Not when he left us in the water to die.
Not when he heard the cries for help in English.
You actually believe that Captain Winters would just leave...
PAGE: Help! Help me!
O'DELL: No.
Captain Winters wanted to pick up the survivors.
That means...
PAGE: Help!
Who mis-I.D.'d the ship?
Who had everything to lose?
[Creaking, rumbling]
Either the battery has finally crapped out, or...
Or maybe we're here.

Stumbo, see if you can crack this hatch. Use a crowbar.
Drain the tower.
See if we can get out that way.
If not, we gotta go out the forward...
[Shuddering]
Oh, God.
Hey, fellas... we have contact.
On SJ radar...
4,000 yards, starboard beam.
It's the same one?
It's the same kraut ship?
- Are we being choosy?
- All right.
Uh, Wallace, raise the antenna.
Issue a radio challenge on the Ariel-6.
Get the ship I.D.'d as of right now.
BRICE:
Well done, Mr. O'Dell.
But I'm feeling much better now.
You were saying?
We have a contact.
That may be an opportunity.
An opportunity?
To abandon ship.
Well, I don't know that that's a friendly out there.
Well, neither do I.
But it seems better to scuttle now and take our chances with a surface vessel, even if it is German.
Scuttle and tell Connecticut what?
We sunk one of their finest fleet submarines because we lost a few men carrying out our mission?
A few men, sir?
[Creaking]
Contact at 2,500 yards.
Might cross the stern.
We'll wait... right here.
Wallace... no matter what
Mr. Brice says,
I want you to go to the radio shack and establish a voice contact with that ship immediately.
You are not the skipper of this ship, Mr. O'Dell!

[Exhales deeply]
Well, you weren't the first woman that ever slapped me, and you won't be the last.
But that was a good thing you done for me back there.
Well done, Miss Page.
Well done, Mr. Stumbo.
Dead but not buried, I see.
Pardon me?
Your vessel.
[Creaking, rumbling]
[Water splashing]
So, what would you say if you had to explain it all?
Does seem rather unlikely now, doesn't it?
Have you thought that... that maybe when Captain Winters died, he just... died, and that was it?
And the rest...
[Exhales deeply]
And the rest...
I don't know.
You say whatever you have to say, ensign.
I'll always believe we were brought back here for a reason.

<SYNC Start=0><P Class=SUBTTL><br>
<SYNC Start=89405><P>There comes a time<br>for every vampire...
<SYNC Start=91805><P><br>
<SYNC Start=91975><P>...when the idea of eternity becomes<br>momentarily unbearable.
<SYNC Start=97242><P><br>
<SYNC Start=97447><P>Living and feeding in the shadows<br>with only your own company...
<SYNC Start=101645><P><br>
<SYNC Start=101851><P>...rots into a solitary,<br>hollow existence.
<SYNC Start=105844><P><br>
<SYNC Start=106055><P>Immortality seems like a good idea...
<SYNC Start=108683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=109125><P>...until you realize<br>you're going to spend it alone.
<SYNC Start=112993><P><br>
<SYNC Start=113196><P>So I slept, hoping the sounds<br>of the passing eras would fade out...
<SYNC Start=117724><P><br>
<SYNC Start=117967><P>...and a sort of death might happen.
<SYNC Start=120162><P><br>
<SYNC Start=120370><P>But as I lay there, the world didn't<br>sound like the place I had left...
<SYNC Start=125034><P><br>
<SYNC Start=125542><P>...but something different.
<SYNC Start=128773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=129345><P>Better....
<SYNC Start=131438><P><br>
<SYNC Start=163012><P>It became worth while to rise again<br>as new gods were born and worshiped.
<SYNC Start=168314><P><br>
<SYNC Start=168518><P>Night and day, they were never alone.
<SYNC Start=171715><P><br>
<SYNC Start=171921><P>I would become one of them.
<SYNC Start=175721><P><br>
<SYNC Start=204153><P>Whether it was the meal or<br>the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure.
<SYNC Start=208351><P><br>
<SYNC Start=208558><P>But suddenly<br>I was feeling better than ever.
<SYNC Start=211959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=212228><P>My senses so high...
<SYNC Start=214321><P><br>
<SYNC Start=214530><P>...they led me straight to the<br>instrument of my resurrection...
<SYNC Start=219365><P><br>
<SYNC Start=219569><P>...playing in my old house.
<SYNC Start=223505><P><br>
<SYNC Start=252535><P>Jesus.
<SYNC Start=254469><P><br>
<SYNC Start=255738><P>Your voice....
<SYNC Start=257330><P><br>
<SYNC Start=257774><P>Who the hell are you?
<SYNC Start=259207><P><br>
<SYNC Start=259409><P>The question provoked<br>an irresistible urge.
<SYNC Start=263846><P><br>
<SYNC Start=264047><P>I am the vampire Lestat.
<SYNC Start=266982><P><br>
<SYNC Start=267183><P>Itjust rolled out of my mouth.
<SYNC Start=269242><P><br>
<SYNC Start=269452><P>With one sentence,<br>I betrayed everything about my kind.
<SYNC Start=273115><P><br>
<SYNC Start=273323><P>Betrayed our code of secrecy.
<SYNC Start=275348><P><br>
<SYNC Start=275558><P>Vampire?
<SYNC Start=277617><P><br>
<SYNC Start=278061><P>-That's funny.<br>-Indeed.
<SYNC Start=281394><P><br>
<SYNC Start=281631><P>Hilarious.
<SYNC Start=284122><P><br>
<SYNC Start=285034><P>You're all...
<SYNC Start=287002><P><br>
<SYNC Start=287203><P>...so beautiful.
<SYNC Start=288898><P><br>
<SYNC Start=289439><P>-Your hands are--<br>-Cold as death?
<SYNC Start=293102><P><br>
<SYNC Start=294210><P>-You're gonna kill us?<br>-No.
<SYNC Start=296371><P><br>
<SYNC Start=296679><P>All that you've ever dreamed of,<br>I'm going to make yours.
<SYNC Start=301514><P><br>
<SYNC Start=301718><P>This is your lucky day.
<SYNC Start=304346><P><br>
<SYNC Start=304554><P>It was a bold move, I admit.
<SYNC Start=306920><P><br>
<SYNC Start=307123><P>But from that moment on they were<br>my friends, my children, my band.
<SYNC Start=311526><P><br>
<SYNC Start=311728><P>Giving the world a new god.<br>Me.
<SYNC Start=315289><P><br>
<SYNC Start=426442><P>Okay, can I have your attention?<br>Okay, some questions. One at a time.
<SYNC Start=432039><P><br>
<SYNC Start=433249><P>-Yeah, you.<br>-So why here in London?
<SYNC Start=435809><P><br>
<SYNC Start=436018><P>We go where we're told to, like you.
<SYNC Start=438612><P><br>
<SYNC Start=438821><P>-How would you sum up your music?<br>-Sex, blood and rock and roll.
<SYNC Start=444123><P><br>
<SYNC Start=444760><P>Okay, excuse me.
<SYNC Start=446455><P><br>
<SYNC Start=447763><P>It's time.
<SYNC Start=449287><P><br>
<SYNC Start=449499><P>May I present...
<SYNC Start=451160><P><br>
<SYNC Start=451367><P>...the vampire Lestat.
<SYNC Start=455064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=459976><P>Good evening.
<SYNC Start=461204><P><br>
<SYNC Start=462712><P>Sorry I'm late. I was just trying<br>to catch my breakfast.
<SYNC Start=467445><P><br>
<SYNC Start=470219><P>Okay, can we keep it short?<br>One at a time.
<SYNC Start=473655><P><br>
<SYNC Start=473923><P>Yeah, you.
<SYNC Start=475117><P><br>
<SYNC Start=475591><P>I may be wrong, but what<br>I remember about vampires is...
<SYNC Start=479254><P><br>
<SYNC Start=479428><P>...you generally keep<br>your identity secret.
<SYNC Start=482522><P><br>
<SYNC Start=482732><P>Yes. But why hide it<br>in this day and age?
<SYNC Start=486224><P><br>
<SYNC Start=486402><P>I've hidden in the shadows<br>for centuries.
<SYNC Start=489064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=489272><P>It's time to share myself<br>with the world.
<SYNC Start=492002><P><br>
<SYNC Start=492575><P>Could you prove it? You know, give us<br>a demonstration of your powers.
<SYNC Start=497410><P><br>
<SYNC Start=497613><P>If you like, I can give you a private<br>demonstration in your hotel tonight.
<SYNC Start=502880><P><br>
<SYNC Start=506956><P>Your first and only concert's<br>in Death Valley, just days away.
<SYNC Start=511290><P><br>
<SYNC Start=511494><P>-Why just the one?<br>-I don't like repeating myself.
<SYNC Start=514952><P><br>
<SYNC Start=515164><P>There are rumors about<br>the hidden meaning in your lyrics...
<SYNC Start=520033><P><br>
<SYNC Start=520203><P>...that you're giving away<br>vampire secrets. Is that true?
<SYNC Start=523934><P><br>
<SYNC Start=524140><P>Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few<br>old friends. Daring them to come out.
<SYNC Start=529578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=529779><P>Won't these vampires be pissed off<br>that you're giving away secrets?
<SYNC Start=534216><P><br>
<SYNC Start=534850><P>I imagine they are, yes.
<SYNC Start=538217><P><br>
<SYNC Start=538421><P>Do you have anything to say<br>to the other vampires?
<SYNC Start=542016><P><br>
<SYNC Start=542225><P>As a matter of fact, I do.
<SYNC Start=545285><P><br>
<SYNC Start=546862><P>Come out, come out, wherever you are.
<SYNC Start=551629><P><br>
<SYNC Start=553402><P>See you all in Death Valley.
<SYNC Start=557031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=579161><P>I heard Lestat keeps all these girls<br>in his cellar. And it's nice.
<SYNC Start=583894><P><br>
<SYNC Start=584100><P>They give you food<br>and cable and weed.
<SYNC Start=586762><P><br>
<SYNC Start=586969><P>Oh, please.
<SYNC Start=588459><P><br>
<SYNC Start=588671><P>But you have to let him suck you<br>on your neck whenever he wants.
<SYNC Start=593472><P><br>
<SYNC Start=593676><P>-Doesn't sound too bad.<br>-Done worse.
<SYNC Start=596839><P><br>
<SYNC Start=597046><P>-I'll say.<br>-This way, girls.
<SYNC Start=598946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=612495><P>So this is Lestat's house?
<SYNC Start=615123><P><br>
<SYNC Start=615331><P>It is this week. We move around a lot.
<SYNC Start=618664><P><br>
<SYNC Start=618868><P>Why is that?
<SYNC Start=620358><P><br>
<SYNC Start=621070><P>What can I say? The guy is just....
<SYNC Start=624301><P><br>
<SYNC Start=625908><P>-Boss. I didn't see you there.<br>-No. You wouldn't, would you?
<SYNC Start=631403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=634984><P>These are the girls<br>that you asked for.
<SYNC Start=638420><P><br>
<SYNC Start=639121><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=640679><P><br>
<SYNC Start=656372><P>Do you want me to take<br>the girls home later?
<SYNC Start=659535><P><br>
<SYNC Start=659742><P>No, thank you, Roger.
<SYNC Start=661903><P><br>
<SYNC Start=662111><P>I'll make sure they're taken care of.
<SYNC Start=664773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=667550><P>You want some?
<SYNC Start=669575><P><br>
<SYNC Start=670586><P>Want me?
<SYNC Start=672577><P><br>
<SYNC Start=673589><P>You hungry?
<SYNC Start=675318><P><br>
<SYNC Start=679562><P>You hungry for something else?
<SYNC Start=683089><P><br>
<SYNC Start=687269><P>Come on.
<SYNC Start=688998><P><br>
<SYNC Start=689505><P>-Don't you want to have some fun?<br>-Don't do that.
<SYNC Start=692963><P><br>
<SYNC Start=693309><P>Are you ticklish?
<SYNC Start=695675><P><br>
<SYNC Start=695878><P>I'm very ticklish.
<SYNC Start=698540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=764613><P>Come out, come out...
<SYNC Start=766774><P><br>
<SYNC Start=766982><P>...whoever you are.
<SYNC Start=769416><P><br>
<SYNC Start=777593><P>Jesse.
<SYNC Start=779356><P><br>
<SYNC Start=781197><P>Jesse.
<SYNC Start=784360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=784567><P>A voice...
<SYNC Start=786125><P><br>
<SYNC Start=787036><P>...calling to me...
<SYNC Start=789197><P><br>
<SYNC Start=789405><P>...in my dreams.
<SYNC Start=791498><P><br>
<SYNC Start=791707><P>The same dream I've had<br>since I was 6.
<SYNC Start=795370><P><br>
<SYNC Start=795778><P>I have a family of my own.
<SYNC Start=798645><P><br>
<SYNC Start=798948><P>Not a strange dream, really.
<SYNC Start=801610><P><br>
<SYNC Start=801817><P>One every orphan has.
<SYNC Start=804547><P><br>
<SYNC Start=832314><P>I'm sorry, but you must go.
<SYNC Start=834179><P><br>
<SYNC Start=834383><P>Why can't I stay with you?<br>Please, Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=838183><P><br>
<SYNC Start=838387><P>I don't want you to go. But you must.
<SYNC Start=841845><P><br>
<SYNC Start=842291><P>Aunt, you're bleeding.
<SYNC Start=845124><P><br>
<SYNC Start=851834><P>You must be with your own.
<SYNC Start=853859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=854069><P>-I knew things were not normal.<br>-This isn't the life I wanted for you.
<SYNC Start=858733><P><br>
<SYNC Start=858941><P>I only knew I was part of them,<br>and being cast out....
<SYNC Start=863037><P><br>
<SYNC Start=863245><P>Was I bad?
<SYNC Start=864542><P><br>
<SYNC Start=864747><P>Had I done something wrong?
<SYNC Start=866840><P><br>
<SYNC Start=867049><P>I'll always be watching over you.
<SYNC Start=869540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=869752><P>I want to stay with you forever.
<SYNC Start=872220><P><br>
<SYNC Start=872421><P>You can't.
<SYNC Start=874946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=910726><P>I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.
<SYNC Start=912921><P><br>
<SYNC Start=913128><P>Vampire turned rocker Lestat<br>has returned with a new CD, Forsaken.
<SYNC Start=918065><P><br>
<SYNC Start=918267><P>Although from New Orleans...
<SYNC Start=920258><P><br>
<SYNC Start=920469><P>...he claims to be an 18th-century<br>French nobleman...
<SYNC Start=924064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=924239><P>...who has been asleep<br>for over 100 years.
<SYNC Start=926935><P><br>
<SYNC Start=927142><P>Here's a look at the new video<br>from the debut album, "Redeemer. "
<SYNC Start=932910><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1001617><P>Like everyone, I assumed<br>Lestat was a joke.
<SYNC Start=1004415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1004620><P>A rock star with a gimmick. Then one<br>of his lyrics caught my attention.
<SYNC Start=1009751><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1010092><P>"Take a walk down the aisle<br>at the end of the mile.
<SYNC Start=1013323><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1013495><P>Give your life to my charms<br>in the Admiral's Arms."
<SYNC Start=1016828><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1017032><P>That rang a bell.
<SYNC Start=1018556><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1018767><P>I tracked down old leases in London.
<SYNC Start=1021395><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1021603><P>It turns out in the late 1 600s<br>there was a pub in Mile End...
<SYNC Start=1025767><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1025941><P>...called the Admiral's Arms.
<SYNC Start=1027841><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1028043><P>It had a reputation for dealing<br>with black magic...
<SYNC Start=1031240><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1031447><P>...and reports of people vanishing.
<SYNC Start=1034007><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1034216><P>Here's where you could find<br>the Admiral's Arms in old London.
<SYNC Start=1039552><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1039755><P>That part of London<br>is mostly warehouses...
<SYNC Start=1042747><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1042958><P>...meat-packing plants and<br>a private club in the same location.
<SYNC Start=1047088><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1048397><P>I think that it's a vampire coven.
<SYNC Start=1051833><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1052034><P>And Lestat is leading us to it.
<SYNC Start=1054832><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1056905><P>-Who took this picture?<br>-I did.
<SYNC Start=1059999><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1060209><P>You're still an apprentice.<br>You don't do field work.
<SYNC Start=1063940><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1064146><P>The Talamasca has a code.
<SYNC Start=1065773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1065981><P>I know. "Observe the dark realm,<br>but be not of it."
<SYNC Start=1069610><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1069818><P>Well, it's held good for 1 2 centuries.
<SYNC Start=1072753><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1072955><P>We record and observe,<br>but never interfere.
<SYNC Start=1076891><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1077092><P>I had to see it for myself.
<SYNC Start=1079185><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1082097><P>Is David aware of this?
<SYNC Start=1084292><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1084833><P>Jesse?
<SYNC Start=1085857><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1088437><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=1089426><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1090205><P>-I was explaining--<br>-Why don't you see me in my office?
<SYNC Start=1093936><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1097179><P>This is a real coven.<br>In the middle of London.
<SYNC Start=1100342><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1100549><P>All the more reason<br>to have told me first.
<SYNC Start=1103882><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1105554><P>Listen, Jesse...
<SYNC Start=1107181><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1110659><P>...we know about Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1113219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1113695><P>What he's doing is unprecedented.
<SYNC Start=1116425><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1117466><P>So why is he doing it?
<SYNC Start=1119058><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1119268><P>Aren't you curious?<br>Don't you think we should find out?
<SYNC Start=1122863><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1124306><P>Let me show you something.
<SYNC Start=1126433><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1129545><P>What do you see?
<SYNC Start=1131445><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1134149><P>Mid-1 500s. Florence.
<SYNC Start=1136811><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1137920><P>This one?
<SYNC Start=1139478><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1143292><P>-This man is in both.<br>-Yes.
<SYNC Start=1146352><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1148697><P>All the different paint samples...
<SYNC Start=1151063><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1151733><P>...all authentic.
<SYNC Start=1153633><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1153836><P>Each painted at the time<br>of their particular style.
<SYNC Start=1157465><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1164079><P>His name is Marius.
<SYNC Start=1166240><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1167115><P>I've been tracing him for years.
<SYNC Start=1169948><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1170419><P>My little obsession.
<SYNC Start=1172512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1172721><P>The closest we've come<br>to the original vampire.
<SYNC Start=1175849><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1176124><P>Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.
<SYNC Start=1179787><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1183131><P>So he's older than Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1185656><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1185868><P>He made Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1188029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1188737><P>How do you know that?
<SYNC Start=1190102><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1190305><P>Because I have Lestat's journal.
<SYNC Start=1193172><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1196578><P>I want to see it.
<SYNC Start=1198045><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1200382><P>Promise me you'll never<br>go back to that place.
<SYNC Start=1203442><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1234783><P>It was the winter of 1788.
<SYNC Start=1238241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1238453><P>And I was brought to a Mediterranean<br>island by the man who made me.
<SYNC Start=1243413><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1244726><P>If a man is what you'd call him.
<SYNC Start=1248457><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1297980><P>Lestat, welcome.
<SYNC Start=1300346><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1302451><P>Who are you?
<SYNC Start=1303884><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1304086><P>Do I know you?
<SYNC Start=1306020><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1308557><P>I am unknowable by nature,<br>but you may call me Marius.
<SYNC Start=1312459><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1312661><P>I'm the lord of a great manor.<br>They'll send an army to look for me.
<SYNC Start=1317462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1317666><P>I doubt they'll find you,<br>Lord de Lioncourt.
<SYNC Start=1320692><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1320902><P>You're a long way from home.
<SYNC Start=1322893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1352134><P>You're weak...
<SYNC Start=1353761><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1354269><P>...near passing.
<SYNC Start=1355736><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1357539><P>I can barely hear your heartbeat.
<SYNC Start=1360167><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1361276><P>The future hastens.<br>An age beyond my antique reason.
<SYNC Start=1366578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1366782><P>You will help me understand<br>these times.
<SYNC Start=1369751><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1370152><P>That's why I chose you.
<SYNC Start=1372245><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1372621><P>Chose me for what?
<SYNC Start=1374145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1384066><P>Drink...
<SYNC Start=1385465><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1386001><P>...and live.
<SYNC Start=1387593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1388570><P>You've been brave enough<br>for one night, my son.
<SYNC Start=1391801><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1394543><P>Drink...
<SYNC Start=1396704><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1398213><P>...and learn.
<SYNC Start=1400204><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1402584><P>Good, is it not?
<SYNC Start=1405178><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1408990><P>No more. No more, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1411515><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1412994><P>No more!
<SYNC Start=1414859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1449197><P>Don't be afraid.
<SYNC Start=1451597><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1451867><P>It's only your body that dies.
<SYNC Start=1454893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1469384><P>More.
<SYNC Start=1471716><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1474055><P>I impressed my maker<br>with my thirst for things.
<SYNC Start=1477616><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1477826><P>He set out to educate me<br>in the unknown.
<SYNC Start=1480454><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1480629><P>Taught me all about the world,<br>its hidden history...
<SYNC Start=1485259><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1485467><P>...and about myself.
<SYNC Start=1487867><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1493341><P>That's enough, my son.
<SYNC Start=1495673><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1498547><P>When you feed, hold back<br>from the moment of death.
<SYNC Start=1501812><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1502017><P>Never take the last drop, or it will<br>draw you in and you will die.
<SYNC Start=1506579><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1512027><P>Appreciate your prey.
<SYNC Start=1514325><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1519467><P>Their blood that we take into us<br>carries with it life...
<SYNC Start=1523767><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1523972><P>...their life, their knowledge,<br>their complexity.
<SYNC Start=1528636><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1531680><P>My senses run amuck,<br>like a newborn child.
<SYNC Start=1535241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1536084><P>And as for my new powers, I was beside<br>myself with the pleasure of it all.
<SYNC Start=1541488><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1543992><P>We've stayed long enough.
<SYNC Start=1545653><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1545860><P>But we've spoken to no one.
<SYNC Start=1547657><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1548230><P>A vampire's life<br>is a life of discretion.
<SYNC Start=1550994><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1551199><P>Discretion?
<SYNC Start=1552791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1553468><P>Why must we hide, Marius?
<SYNC Start=1555436><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1555637><P>We are the powerful,<br>we are the immortal.
<SYNC Start=1558970><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1559174><P>We should walk fearless<br>in the open, no?
<SYNC Start=1562666><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1573388><P>That cannot be.
<SYNC Start=1575652><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1576658><P>We're vulnerable during the day.
<SYNC Start=1579354><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1579561><P>Mortals must never know about us,<br>for the sake of all our kind.
<SYNC Start=1583691><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1584199><P>So I could never know her?
<SYNC Start=1586360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1586568><P>Not unless you wanted to kill her.
<SYNC Start=1588900><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1596211><P>So I can never be known?
<SYNC Start=1598042><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1600715><P>You must be dead to the world.
<SYNC Start=1603513><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1604719><P>Come on, time to leave.
<SYNC Start=1607085><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1668083><P>Sophia, run! Run!
<SYNC Start=1670347><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1670685><P>Go! Go--
<SYNC Start=1673051><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1673888><P>Lestat...
<SYNC Start=1675150><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1675357><P>...stop her!
<SYNC Start=1677655><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1678426><P>You must!
<SYNC Start=1679484><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1717098><P>We must remain in the shadows.
<SYNC Start=1721000><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1722437><P>You still have a few<br>lingering mortal emotions.
<SYNC Start=1725998><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1727108><P>They'll serve you no good, my friend.
<SYNC Start=1730441><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1743024><P>Forgive me.
<SYNC Start=1744958><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1752000><P>The faces of my victims haunted me,<br>reminding me of my fate.
<SYNC Start=1758064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1758273><P>For nights and days I played...
<SYNC Start=1760639><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1760842><P>...furious that I would never partake<br>of the simplejoys of the world.
<SYNC Start=1766576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1766781><P>I was meant for more than this.
<SYNC Start=1768976><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1808590><P>Marius?
<SYNC Start=1810490><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1891906><P>Would you like me to play for you?
<SYNC Start=1894534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2042557><P>What have you done, Lestat?
<SYNC Start=2045151><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2054469><P>-More!<br>-I don't think so, my little lord.
<SYNC Start=2058166><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2058406><P>-Let me go.<br>-No.
<SYNC Start=2060431><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2060641><P>You've had the purest blood,<br>seen the oldest things.
<SYNC Start=2064099><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2064312><P>-Far too much for one as young as you.<br>-Her blood is like liquid fire.
<SYNC Start=2069773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2069984><P>Who is she?
<SYNC Start=2071383><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2076824><P>She's your mother.
<SYNC Start=2078951><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2079160><P>She's my mother.
<SYNC Start=2081219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2081429><P>Akasha, the queen of all<br>who are damned.
<SYNC Start=2085593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2086234><P>And he's her king.
<SYNC Start=2088168><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2088669><P>Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this<br>earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
<SYNC Start=2093868><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2094041><P>They drank until Enkil<br>lost his will to drink.
<SYNC Start=2098034><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2098212><P>Without her mate beside her, she also<br>lost hers. They became living statues.
<SYNC Start=2103172><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2103351><P>She respects nothing except the taste<br>of blood, human and immortal alike.
<SYNC Start=2108983><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2109357><P>No. Release me!
<SYNC Start=2110881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2116964><P>She made you quite powerful.
<SYNC Start=2119364><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2119534><P>You'll not stop me!
<SYNC Start=2121764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2123037><P>Can I hear her blood in your voice?
<SYNC Start=2125904><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2126707><P>In all the years of my care,<br>not once have they moved.
<SYNC Start=2130234><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2130444><P>Until tonight. And she chose me.
<SYNC Start=2134141><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2135049><P>I chose you.
<SYNC Start=2136676><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2140721><P>Where are you going?! Marius!
<SYNC Start=2144054><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2201482><P>Many times since, I have called<br>to Marius. But there was no answer.
<SYNC Start=2207819><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2208356><P>Just the endless procession<br>of days, months...
<SYNC Start=2212850><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2213027><P>...years.
<SYNC Start=2214551><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2215730><P>My teacher left me<br>to my darkest lesson.
<SYNC Start=2219393><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2219567><P>That in the end, we are alone.
<SYNC Start=2221728><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2222637><P>And there is nothing but the cold,<br>dark wasteland of eternity.
<SYNC Start=2228598><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2253501><P>David thought thejournal<br>would satisfy my curiosity.
<SYNC Start=2256959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2257638><P>But it only made me want<br>to know more.
<SYNC Start=2260835><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2261008><P>I had to go back<br>to the Admiral's Arms.
<SYNC Start=2263704><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2263878><P>I had no choice.
<SYNC Start=2266312><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2302817><P>This is a fantastic place. I love it.
<SYNC Start=2305809><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2306487><P>You sure I can't get you a drink?
<SYNC Start=2309251><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2310224><P>Soon.
<SYNC Start=2311521><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2374188><P>Hi.
<SYNC Start=2375746><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2376624><P>-Hi.<br>-Come here often?
<SYNC Start=2378023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2378459><P>All the time.
<SYNC Start=2380222><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2384065><P>I don't see any marks.
<SYNC Start=2386932><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2387101><P>You haven't seen the rest of my body.
<SYNC Start=2389626><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2390638><P>Is that an invitation?
<SYNC Start=2393266><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2393441><P>Sorry, I'm taken.
<SYNC Start=2395534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2395743><P>And...
<SYNC Start=2397540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2398245><P>...where is your host?
<SYNC Start=2400304><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2400714><P>He's here somewhere.
<SYNC Start=2402079><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2405786><P>This host, what's his name?
<SYNC Start=2409381><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2413427><P>Marius.
<SYNC Start=2414724><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2415629><P>Sorry, don't know the guy.
<SYNC Start=2418359><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2418532><P>-Of course not. He's an ancient.<br>-There aren't any ancients left.
<SYNC Start=2422969><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2423137><P>They all turned to dust.
<SYNC Start=2425799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2426140><P>So unless you've got him in a bottle<br>somewhere....
<SYNC Start=2429371><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2429543><P>You're brave to joke.<br>I wish you could meet him.
<SYNC Start=2432637><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2432813><P>-And why is that?<br>-Because you might learn something.
<SYNC Start=2436408><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2439887><P>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=2441878><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2456270><P>Going somewhere?
<SYNC Start=2457965><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2459874><P>Now this will only hurt a little bit.
<SYNC Start=2462843><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2463244><P>In fact, you might even enjoy it.
<SYNC Start=2467078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2467281><P>Don't do this.
<SYNC Start=2468305><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2488936><P>Boo.
<SYNC Start=2490426><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2505986><P>That was quite a performance.
<SYNC Start=2509353><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2509990><P>You should be more careful.
<SYNC Start=2512754><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2513894><P>-Thanks.<br>-For what?
<SYNC Start=2517193><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2517531><P>You saved me.
<SYNC Start=2519362><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2520034><P>How presumptuous.
<SYNC Start=2522025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2522937><P>So you know Marius?
<SYNC Start=2526464><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2528742><P>I know a lot of things.
<SYNC Start=2530403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2530611><P>Not how to stay alive, apparently.
<SYNC Start=2533273><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2533614><P>I guess we have that in common.
<SYNC Start=2535775><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2536317><P>Although I'm a little ahead<br>of the race here.
<SYNC Start=2539252><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2539453><P>Well, I can fix that.
<SYNC Start=2541978><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2542623><P>Your song "Redeemer" is about<br>the girl with the violin. Isn't it?
<SYNC Start=2546957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2548662><P>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2549822><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2550064><P>Is it?
<SYNC Start=2551463><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2554435><P>What else do you think you know?
<SYNC Start=2556699><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2557805><P>I....
<SYNC Start=2559067><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2559273><P>You're shaking.
<SYNC Start=2561741><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2561942><P>Cold.
<SYNC Start=2563341><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2564345><P>Still cold?
<SYNC Start=2565903><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2567481><P>Go on. Tell me more about me.
<SYNC Start=2571417><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2571652><P>You want....
<SYNC Start=2573279><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2573487><P>What do I want?
<SYNC Start=2575421><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2576824><P>-You yearn.<br>-What do I yearn?
<SYNC Start=2580260><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2583631><P>For what do I yearn?
<SYNC Start=2586395><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2586567><P>To walk with the living.
<SYNC Start=2588694><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2590304><P>Out of the cold,<br>dark wasteland of eternity.
<SYNC Start=2594764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2598279><P>Well...
<SYNC Start=2599337><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2601782><P>...that makes you<br>a very clever librarian.
<SYNC Start=2605115><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2605286><P>Talamasca.
<SYNC Start=2607846><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2608022><P>I knew I left that journal somewhere.
<SYNC Start=2611514><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2614361><P>-Was it a good read?<br>-It touched me.
<SYNC Start=2618229><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2618832><P>Did it, now?
<SYNC Start=2620493><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2621935><P>Don't worry, Jesse.
<SYNC Start=2623800><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2624238><P>Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
<SYNC Start=2626832><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2629843><P>Lestat, I know something<br>that's not in your journal.
<SYNC Start=2633210><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2635783><P>What?
<SYNC Start=2636772><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2637318><P>You still have the violin, don't you?
<SYNC Start=2639752><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2640421><P>No, I understand.
<SYNC Start=2642480><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2643424><P>After all, it's only human.
<SYNC Start=2645187><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2701882><P>Clever librarian.
<SYNC Start=2703873><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2714094><P>David, listen, I'm going<br>to Los Angeles for the concert.
<SYNC Start=2717962><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2718665><P>I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2721725><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2722002><P>What? Jesse?
<SYNC Start=2724197><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2724405><P>Listen to me very carefully now.
<SYNC Start=2727966><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2729610><P>You are no longer seeing<br>things clearly.
<SYNC Start=2732579><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2732746><P>Lestat told the world that vampires<br>live among us. They're mad.
<SYNC Start=2736512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2736683><P>They'll be at the concert to kill him.<br>You've become obsessed with it.
<SYNC Start=2741245><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2741422><P>-I'm worried about you.<br>-Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
<SYNC Start=2746155><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2746360><P>I'll check in and....
<SYNC Start=2748260><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2749329><P>I'm sorry. I have to go.
<SYNC Start=2750956><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2751165><P>No, Jesse--
<SYNC Start=2752757><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2769583><P>The city of Lost Angels already<br>fed on the blood of youth.
<SYNC Start=2773576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2773754><P>My presence here barely<br>stirred a ripple.
<SYNC Start=2777019><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2777191><P>We had three days till the concert.
<SYNC Start=2779591><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2779793><P>I could feel something was coming.
<SYNC Start=2782318><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2782496><P>Ijust couldn't figure out what.
<SYNC Start=2785659><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2818499><P>Marius.
<SYNC Start=2820023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2832079><P>Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2833842><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2835215><P>It is good to see you, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2837683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2838986><P>And you.
<SYNC Start=2840351><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2840587><P>Still wearing the old fashions, I see.
<SYNC Start=2844216><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2846026><P>Old habits die hard.
<SYNC Start=2848187><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2848395><P>How did you manage to slip<br>through the '50s in red velvet?
<SYNC Start=2853526><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2854234><P>I slept.
<SYNC Start=2855701><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2857070><P>Don't think you missed much.
<SYNC Start=2859334><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2860541><P>-Elvis.<br>-Elvis, yes.
<SYNC Start=2864238><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2866446><P>You're bigger than he is now.
<SYNC Start=2868471><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2868882><P>So....
<SYNC Start=2869906><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2870784><P>After all this time...
<SYNC Start=2872911><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2873453><P>...what's the occasion?
<SYNC Start=2875387><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2875556><P>You've just become very hard to avoid<br>these days, at least in conversation.
<SYNC Start=2881085><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2882095><P>-What are you trying to prove, Lestat?<br>-Oh, please.
<SYNC Start=2885622><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2885799><P>It's a little too late to come over<br>all paternal now, Marius.
<SYNC Start=2890031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2890237><P>Two hundred years<br>and not a word from you.
<SYNC Start=2894003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2895242><P>You almost cost me everything.
<SYNC Start=2898336><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2901281><P>Now you've done it again.
<SYNC Start=2902908><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2903517><P>This isn't the time to settle<br>old scores.
<SYNC Start=2907078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2908722><P>Vampires don't settle old scores.
<SYNC Start=2911782><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2913894><P>We harbor them.
<SYNC Start=2916328><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2920634><P>How did you find me?
<SYNC Start=2922397><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2922970><P>I made you.
<SYNC Start=2924335><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2924671><P>I've always known where you are.
<SYNC Start=2927003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2927808><P>Besides...
<SYNC Start=2929275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2929610><P>...l just had to look for the most<br>gauche house on the block.
<SYNC Start=2933876><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2935549><P>Come. Let me show you what it means<br>to live in the light.
<SYNC Start=2939417><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2949319><P>Impressive.
<SYNC Start=2950616><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2950787><P>Reminds me of old mad druids<br>running around chanting in the forest.
<SYNC Start=2955190><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2955392><P>A return to the primitive.
<SYNC Start=2957485><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2958128><P>Out there, my fans...
<SYNC Start=2960153><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2961464><P>...they worship me.
<SYNC Start=2963022><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2963466><P>Millions of arms reach out to embrace,<br>beg me to come into their lives.
<SYNC Start=2968563><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2968738><P>It's what you always wanted.
<SYNC Start=2970763><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2970974><P>With all my black little heart.
<SYNC Start=2973636><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2974978><P>Did you think of anyone but yourself?
<SYNC Start=2978311><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2978715><P>I only have myself.<br>You taught me that.
<SYNC Start=2981980><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2982719><P>It may be time to get ready<br>for some company.
<SYNC Start=2986120><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2986289><P>-What's that supposed to mean?<br>-Your music's woken an old friend.
<SYNC Start=2991921><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2993930><P>Can't you hear it?
<SYNC Start=2995557><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2996065><P>Or is the applause all you<br>can hear now?
<SYNC Start=2999626><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3018755><P>Akasha.
<SYNC Start=3020086><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3020890><P>Arisen.
<SYNC Start=3022482><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3023193><P>She has taken the king's blood.
<SYNC Start=3025957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3026229><P>Absorbed his power.
<SYNC Start=3028129><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3028765><P>Good. Let her come.
<SYNC Start=3031859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3032202><P>Cancel the concert.
<SYNC Start=3034329><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3034637><P>Never.
<SYNC Start=3035968><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3036573><P>You're no match for her, Lestat.<br>You're not a god.
<SYNC Start=3040532><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3041211><P>We were once mortals too.
<SYNC Start=3044009><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3045048><P>It is our heritage we protect.
<SYNC Start=3047881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3048051><P>Such reverence for mortals.
<SYNC Start=3050849><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3051054><P>Then you should have left me as one.
<SYNC Start=3053989><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3114717><P>Scent is fading.<br>He was here too long ago.
<SYNC Start=3120053><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3120256><P>You like him, do you?
<SYNC Start=3121985><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3123126><P>He reminds me of someone.
<SYNC Start=3125151><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3125361><P>All he's going to remind you of soon<br>is a pile of bones.
<SYNC Start=3130025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3130300><P>We're going to dismember him.<br>Bleed him dry.
<SYNC Start=3133428><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3133603><P>Really?
<SYNC Start=3134797><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3136039><P>Is that what you're going to do?
<SYNC Start=3139475><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3317820><P>Old gods on new streets.
<SYNC Start=3321278><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3321791><P>Not only had the concert sold out<br>among the living...
<SYNC Start=3325283><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3325461><P>...it seemed all the undead<br>were coming too.
<SYNC Start=3328589><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3328798><P>There would be angry vampires<br>out there...
<SYNC Start=3331699><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3331868><P>...frightened of the light I was<br>directing on all our kind.
<SYNC Start=3336032><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3336239><P>Do you have anything to say<br>to the other vampires?
<SYNC Start=3339800><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3340009><P>Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
<SYNC Start=3343843><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3344747><P>Come out, come out, wherever you are.
<SYNC Start=3348183><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3348918><P>They wanted me dead.
<SYNC Start=3351011><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3351220><P>Let them try.
<SYNC Start=3352881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3353256><P>Bring it on.
<SYNC Start=3354723><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3355124><P>Better dead than alone.
<SYNC Start=3357922><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3373609><P>Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?
<SYNC Start=3376134><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3376312><P>-Going to the show?<br>-No.
<SYNC Start=3378143><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3378314><P>-Come on, I got them for $200.<br>-$200?! I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=3382080><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3382251><P>-What if I say 1 50?<br>-1 50? You're gonna cut me a deal?
<SYNC Start=3388156><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3388357><P>So, listen, just two girls, okay?<br>So how old are you again?
<SYNC Start=3392555><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3395531><P>-Check it out. Champagne?<br>-Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3398796><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3415985><P>Oh, my God, I can't believe<br>it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.
<SYNC Start=3421082><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3423125><P>Boo.
<SYNC Start=3424524><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3425494><P>Boo back.
<SYNC Start=3426791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3427697><P>Lestat, I came all the way<br>from Tarzana.
<SYNC Start=3430325><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3430499><P>Really?
<SYNC Start=3431625><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3432635><P>-And you?<br>-London.
<SYNC Start=3434227><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3435504><P>A London Goth. I see.
<SYNC Start=3438098><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3439208><P>It's funny, I would have pegged you<br>for a Talamascan.
<SYNC Start=3443907><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3444847><P>Maybe in another life.
<SYNC Start=3446781><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3446949><P>I'm an Episcopalian.
<SYNC Start=3448576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3449051><P>And I'm a frigging Buddhist.<br>Lestat....
<SYNC Start=3452578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3452755><P>Roger, would you take our little<br>Episcopalian back to church?
<SYNC Start=3457089><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3457260><P>Just the one tonight? Sure.
<SYNC Start=3459820><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3460029><P>-Sweetheart, come on.<br>-What?
<SYNC Start=3463294><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3463966><P>-Come on.<br>-What?!
<SYNC Start=3465593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3465768><P>-It's a good thing.<br>-Can I still go backstage?
<SYNC Start=3468965><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3470706><P>Why are you following me?
<SYNC Start=3473266><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3473542><P>What do you want?
<SYNC Start=3474941><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3488424><P>So you come all this way<br>just to return this to me?
<SYNC Start=3492758><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3492962><P>Out of the goodness of your heart?
<SYNC Start=3495931><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3498601><P>I want you to show me what it's like.
<SYNC Start=3501263><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3501671><P>What what is like, exactly?
<SYNC Start=3504799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3504974><P>To be like you.
<SYNC Start=3507135><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3510179><P>I don't have time for this.
<SYNC Start=3512272><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3512682><P>-All a vampire has is time.<br>-Not this one.
<SYNC Start=3516914><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3518854><P>Right.
<SYNC Start=3520082><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3520356><P>The covens are coming for you.
<SYNC Start=3523018><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3523192><P>How are you going to spend your last<br>night, as you always have, alone?
<SYNC Start=3527891><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3528064><P>Why not?
<SYNC Start=3529292><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3530032><P>Why not share it with me?
<SYNC Start=3532398><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3536305><P>All right.
<SYNC Start=3537772><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3540509><P>This may be painful for a mortal.
<SYNC Start=3543910><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3544113><P>You're still attached to your skin.
<SYNC Start=3547241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3548317><P>I don't care.
<SYNC Start=3550012><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3552621><P>Do you trust me?
<SYNC Start=3554418><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3558227><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=3559717><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3568871><P>Then close your eyes.
<SYNC Start=3571237><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3648651><P>Marius was right.
<SYNC Start=3650619><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3650820><P>But I never understood<br>until I met you.
<SYNC Start=3653983><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3654557><P>What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=3656582><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3656759><P>You're beautiful to me<br>because you're human.
<SYNC Start=3660160><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3660329><P>Your frailty...
<SYNC Start=3662456><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3662731><P>...your short years...
<SYNC Start=3664665><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3667103><P>...your heart...
<SYNC Start=3668764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3668971><P>...even as you think it's breaking.
<SYNC Start=3671804><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3676178><P>All that...
<SYNC Start=3677975><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3679415><P>...seems suddenly more precious<br>than anything I have ever known.
<SYNC Start=3684079><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3687356><P>I'm not as precious as you think.
<SYNC Start=3690189><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3699635><P>Do it.
<SYNC Start=3701068><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3704640><P>Please.
<SYNC Start=3706130><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3712414><P>Let me be with you.
<SYNC Start=3714644><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3716952><P>Let me know everything.
<SYNC Start=3719546><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3727663><P>You want to know everything?
<SYNC Start=3730188><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3732301><P>Come, then.
<SYNC Start=3733893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3734170><P>I'll show you.
<SYNC Start=3735967><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3758394><P>What is it? What are we doing--?
<SYNC Start=3760919><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3806709><P>Is she all right?
<SYNC Start=3808267><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3812615><P>Get away! Get off me!
<SYNC Start=3815778><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3824493><P>Now you see?
<SYNC Start=3826120><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3826662><P>Are you ready?
<SYNC Start=3828095><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3829898><P>Now do you want it, huh?
<SYNC Start=3833163><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3836238><P>No.
<SYNC Start=3837364><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3837773><P>Of course you don't.
<SYNC Start=3840469><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3899768><P>They're pretty worked-up.<br>How you feeling?
<SYNC Start=3902566><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3902738><P>Hey, girls, come on!
<SYNC Start=3904467><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3905708><P>Okay, through here. Let him through!
<SYNC Start=3908871><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3909311><P>Back off, fella!
<SYNC Start=3910710><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3910913><P>Come on, children.
<SYNC Start=3912380><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3912581><P>Okay, guys. Come on!
<SYNC Start=3914742><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3917086><P>Let him through.
<SYNC Start=3919054><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3924626><P>Jesse!
<SYNC Start=3926025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3928630><P>Jesse!
<SYNC Start=3929927><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3933802><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=3935269><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3936372><P>I must show you my new<br>paintings sometime.
<SYNC Start=3939705><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4082851><P>Find Jesse.
<SYNC Start=4084045><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4132501><P>You want more?
<SYNC Start=4134469><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4137906><P>This one's for those<br>who've come for me.
<SYNC Start=4142275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4322090><P>Akasha.
<SYNC Start=4323352><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4403004><P>Akasha?!
<SYNC Start=4405029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4405674><P>Why so surprised, my love?
<SYNC Start=4408234><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4409010><P>You called, I have come.
<SYNC Start=4411069><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4412147><P>My love?
<SYNC Start=4413205><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4413715><P>Never fear me, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=4416275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4417352><P>All your wishes have come true.
<SYNC Start=4419582><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4419754><P>My wishes?
<SYNC Start=4421415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4423625><P>For a companion to share eternity.
<SYNC Start=4427186><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4429731><P>You're bold, like your music.
<SYNC Start=4433633><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4435503><P>You live your life in the open,<br>like I did long ago...
<SYNC Start=4440440><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4441610><P>...when I had a king.
<SYNC Start=4443373><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4443879><P>Had a king?
<SYNC Start=4445039><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4445480><P>He's no more.
<SYNC Start=4447175><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4447949><P>Now you are my consort.
<SYNC Start=4451407><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4452387><P>That's why I kept you safe.
<SYNC Start=4454548><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4455690><P>Alive.
<SYNC Start=4457214><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4458226><P>You?
<SYNC Start=4459716><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4461463><P>You thought it was all you?
<SYNC Start=4464261><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4467402><P>The ego of a king as well.
<SYNC Start=4470462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4470672><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=4472162><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4473441><P>I know you, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=4476774><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4477178><P>I know that you crave to have<br>the world at your feet.
<SYNC Start=4481239><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4482751><P>And I have come to give it to you.
<SYNC Start=4486209><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4488156><P>Where are we?
<SYNC Start=4490124><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4490992><P>We are home.
<SYNC Start=4492926><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4493495><P>We live everywhere<br>and anywhere we choose.
<SYNC Start=4498728><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4499134><P>The world is our garden.
<SYNC Start=4502865><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4647682><P>All these years I'd hoped<br>this place was real.
<SYNC Start=4651812><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4653988><P>For the first time in my life,<br>I feel like I'm home.
<SYNC Start=4659324><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4659894><P>Strange that this journey<br>should lead me here.
<SYNC Start=4663955><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4664165><P>This place that's haunted my dreams.
<SYNC Start=4667396><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4672774><P>Aunt, you're bleeding.
<SYNC Start=4675607><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4675810><P>You must be with your own.
<SYNC Start=4678040><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4680648><P>I'll always be watching over you.
<SYNC Start=4683173><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4683384><P>I want to stay with you forever.
<SYNC Start=4686114><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4687322><P>Forever is a very long time.
<SYNC Start=4689813><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4693161><P>Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=4694788><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4704839><P>You haven't aged,<br>you haven't changed at all.
<SYNC Start=4708400><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4711346><P>I was once a mortal too.
<SYNC Start=4713678><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4714015><P>I bore a child before Akasha took me.<br>I took care of that child...
<SYNC Start=4718145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4718319><P>...and her children,<br>and her children's children.
<SYNC Start=4721982><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4722557><P>This is our family.
<SYNC Start=4724821><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4724993><P>My way of coping with eternity.
<SYNC Start=4727553><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4729597><P>You are what keeps me connected<br>to the world of the living.
<SYNC Start=4734432><P><br>

<SYNC Start=4739233><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4744746><P>Now is not the time.
<SYNC Start=4747510><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4748917><P>You were seeking answers<br>and now you've found them.
<SYNC Start=4752683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4753087><P>The family is who you are.
<SYNC Start=4756818><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4847815><P>Drinking my blood allows you<br>to live in the light.
<SYNC Start=4851979><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4852186><P>And soon the sun will no longer<br>sting your eyes.
<SYNC Start=4857123><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4858326><P>This is but a taste<br>of what we shall share, my love.

<SYNC Start=4863965><P>My king...
<SYNC Start=4865660><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4866501><P>...behold our kingdom.
<SYNC Start=4869402><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4870038><P>A kingdom of corpses?
<SYNC Start=4872404><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4874409><P>-Why?<br>-Why not?
<SYNC Start=4877810><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4878479><P>This is why you have risen?
<SYNC Start=4880276><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4880448><P>They believed in nothing.
<SYNC Start=4883781><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4884185><P>Now they are nothing.
<SYNC Start=4885743><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4892427><P>But you and l,<br>we will change all that.

<SYNC Start=4896698><P>We will give the world something<br>to believe in again.
<SYNC Start=4901431><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4902570><P>Now come, my love.
<SYNC Start=4904663><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4905073><P>We have a score to settle.
<SYNC Start=4907132><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4919220><P>Since my mortal death,<br>I have watched...
<SYNC Start=4921882><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4922590><P>...l have guided and cared<br>for my human family...
<SYNC Start=4926890><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4927428><P>...generations beyond memory.
<SYNC Start=4930329><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4932433><P>This is why we must fight Akasha.

<SYNC Start=4937438><P>-For the sake of your great family.<br>-The world we know is about to end.
<SYNC Start=4942239><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4942577><P>The only way to prevent this<br>is through Akasha's destruction.
<SYNC Start=4946570><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4946781><P>But how?
<SYNC Start=4948271><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4948883><P>When she gives blood,<br>she's vulnerable.
<SYNC Start=4951511><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4951686><P>Whoever takes the last of her blood<br>will not survive it.
<SYNC Start=4955554><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4955757><P>What about Lestat?
<SYNC Start=4957418><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4957625><P>Lestat has joined with Akasha.<br>He's lost to us now. Forget him.
<SYNC Start=4963586><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4986287><P>My children.
<SYNC Start=4987845><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4990024><P>It warms my blood<br>to see you all gathered...
<SYNC Start=4993118><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4993661><P>...plotting against me.
<SYNC Start=4995219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4995430><P>-Akasha.<br>-Maharet.
<SYNC Start=4997864><P><br>

<SYNC Start=5006140><P>Lestat, step aside.
<SYNC Start=5008631><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5009143><P>Never.
<SYNC Start=5010132><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5010311><P>The world has changed<br>since you reigned.
<SYNC Start=5012973><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5013181><P>Then we shall change it back.
<SYNC Start=5015342><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5015683><P>Humans are animals...
<SYNC Start=5017810><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5018486><P>...brute creatures.
<SYNC Start=5020477><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5020655><P>-Their destruction can only make sense.<br>-We've found other ways to coexist.
<SYNC Start=5025888><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5026093><P>In silence! ln shadows and shame!<br>And for what?
<SYNC Start=5030462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5030631><P>For respect of mortals?
<SYNC Start=5032690><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5032867><P>They are nothing to us.
<SYNC Start=5035028><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5035203><P>They are merely food.

<SYNC Start=5037839><P>Akasha, please....

<SYNC Start=5046136><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5046314><P>Join me or die.
<SYNC Start=5047906><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5048316><P>I will not.
<SYNC Start=5050011><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5050218><P>-I will not.<br>-I will not.
<SYNC Start=5052015><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5052220><P>I will not.
<SYNC Start=5053744><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5061929><P>Do you love me?
<SYNC Start=5063362><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5065266><P>-Yes.<br>-Then prove it.
<SYNC Start=5067996><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5070137><P>Kill her.
<SYNC Start=5071536><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5072607><P>-She's nothing to me.<br>-Just the same...
<SYNC Start=5075701><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5076677><P>...l'd like for you to kill her.
<SYNC Start=5079077><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5082950><P>-You will not touch her!<br>-You still think to challenge me?!
<SYNC Start=5087944><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5091292><P>-Now.<br>-No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=5095228><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5096097><P>It's what I want.
<SYNC Start=5098031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5104405><P>How sweet.
<SYNC Start=5106566><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5112747><P>I'm ready.
<SYNC Start=5114339><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5191125><P>See, my children?
<SYNC Start=5193218><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5194395><P>Remember your real family!
<SYNC Start=5197023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5198332><P>Or join hers.
<SYNC Start=5199959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5201235><P>Now...
<SYNC Start=5202759><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5204672><P>...give me my crown.
<SYNC Start=5206537><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5208209><P>Spoken like a true king.
<SYNC Start=5210404><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5213547><P>Come.
<SYNC Start=5215174><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5225393><P>You see how he obeys?
<SYNC Start=5228760><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5229230><P>You will...
<SYNC Start=5230561><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5231565><P>...or you will all die.
<SYNC Start=5234125><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5239874><P>That is enough, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5241705><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5251619><P>That is enough, Lestat! Stop!
<SYNC Start=5253553><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5321655><P>You kill me...
<SYNC Start=5324180><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5324358><P>...you kill yourselves.
<SYNC Start=5327384><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5372473><P>Wait, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5374270><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5377044><P>You must stop.
<SYNC Start=5378534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5533500><P>She drank Akasha's last drop.
<SYNC Start=5536731><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5538138><P>She took Akasha's death into herself.
<SYNC Start=5542006><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5543410><P>She's not dead.
<SYNC Start=5545002><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5545980><P>She sleeps.
<SYNC Start=5548107><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5606707><P>Hello?
<SYNC Start=5608231><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5641041><P>Oh, my God!
<SYNC Start=5642770><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5643610><P>Jesse?
<SYNC Start=5645100><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5646313><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=5647746><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5659426><P>David, this is Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5661519><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5662129><P>-Hello.<br>-I have something for you.
<SYNC Start=5666156><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5670003><P>I believe...
<SYNC Start=5671766><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5672072><P>...that you wanted this back.
<SYNC Start=5674768><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5676910><P>Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
<SYNC Start=5680676><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5690991><P>-Can I ask--?<br>-What's it like?
<SYNC Start=5692856><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5694461><P>Do you want to find out?
<SYNC Start=5696759><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5697764><P>Me?
<SYNC Start=5699254><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5699433><P>No, I'm too old to live forever.
<SYNC Start=5702095><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5702436><P>Well, if you ever change your mind....
<SYNC Start=5705303><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5708208><P>So this is goodbye.
<SYNC Start=5709971><P><br>

 In New York City's war on crime,<br>
<SYNC Start=5046><P Class=ENCC> the worst criminal offenders are pursued<br> by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.<br>
<SYNC Start=10106><P Class=ENCC>
These are their stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=13026><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=15822><P Class=ENCC>
Not this again.<br>
<SYNC Start=17583><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think you're gonna find?<br>
<SYNC Start=18773><P Class=ENCC>
Motel receipts? Love letters?<br>
<SYNC Start=21539><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, why are you doing this?<br>
<SYNC Start=24539><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=27272><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you, Henry?<br>
<SYNC Start=30272><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=31008><P Class=ENCC>
I think she's having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=34008><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=35274><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know what's wrong with her.<br>
<SYNC Start=36995><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday she left me nine messages,<br>
<SYNC Start=38836><P Class=ENCC> telling me to be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=41836><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=42654><P Class=ENCC>
I gave the cook the night off.<br>
<SYNC Start=44149><P Class=ENCC>
I thought we could all<br> have dinner at Mr. Chow's.<br>
<SYNC Start=46990><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, sorry, Mom.<br>
I have to work.<br>
<SYNC Start=48753><P Class=ENCC>
I can't make it either.<br>
I have to fly to Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=51033><P Class=ENCC>
I won't be back till after midnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=53384><P Class=ENCC>
I can do an early lunch,<br> around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=55762><P Class=ENCC>
 I can swing that.<br>
<SYNC Start=57156><P Class=ENCC>
I'm busy.<br>
<SYNC Start=58286><P Class=ENCC>
Never mind.<br>
<SYNC Start=60125><P Class=ENCC>
I just wanted us all to have dinner.<br>
<SYNC Start=63125><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=67986><P Class=ENCC>
If I were less trusting,<br>
<SYNC Start=68925><P Class=ENCC>
I'd think she's the one having the affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=71925><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=77309><P Class=ENCC>
I told you I'm gonna prove<br> how wrong you are, and I will.<br>
<SYNC Start=80437><P Class=ENCC>
Stay out of it, Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=81791><P Class=ENCC>
Please?<br>
<SYNC Start=83262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84313><P Class=ENCC>
You and Dad are<br> not splitting up over this bull.<br>
<SYNC Start=87313><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=91941><P Class=ENCC>
Big hands, great ass, ponytail...<br>
<SYNC Start=93906><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, what was his name?<br>
<SYNC Start=95176><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, you remember that<br>
Welsh masseur at Bliss?<br>
<SYNC Start=97444><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=98368><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=99334><P Class=ENCC>
It's gonna be a boy.<br>
<SYNC Start=100540><P Class=ENCC>
What?<br>
<SYNC Start=101769><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you mean Livvy...<br> my sister-in-law.<br>
<SYNC Start=104697><P Class=ENCC>
We just found out<br>
Monday she's pregnant again.<br>
<SYNC Start=107171><P Class=ENCC>
But how did you know?<br>
<SYNC Start=110256><P Class=ENCC>
Did she go off her Xanax?<br>
<SYNC Start=112444><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=113738><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please,<br> give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=115288><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=117414><P Class=ENCC>
I'll try you at work again.<br>
<SYNC Start=120414><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=130217><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=132415><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I thought...<br>
<SYNC Start=134690><P Class=ENCC>
No, he still hasn't called.<br>
<SYNC Start=137133><P Class=ENCC>
I just have this terrible...<br>
<SYNC Start=139282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=141431><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, it would help.<br>
Are you sure?<br>
<SYNC Start=146137><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=148488><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I'm... I'm sitting down.<br>
<SYNC Start=151255><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man, I can't believe<br> how much that girl drank.<br>
<SYNC Start=155586><P Class=ENCC>
It looks like she helped<br> this guy park his car.<br>
<SYNC Start=158586><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=160052><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, wait.<br>
What's that? A little TV?<br>
<SYNC Start=163184><P Class=ENCC>
It's a video monitor.<br>
<SYNC Start=164435><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody left it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=166014><P Class=ENCC>
It's a live transmission from a camera.<br>
<SYNC Start=168467><P Class=ENCC>
It's got to be close.<br>

We called you as soon as<br> we found his press credentials.<br>
<SYNC Start=231672><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster:<br>
He's a cameraman for Newstime.<br>
<SYNC Start=234307><P Class=ENCC>
His cell phone was in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=235637><P Class=ENCC>
He's got messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=236992><P Class=ENCC>
We're getting his password<br> from the phone company.<br>
<SYNC Start=238832><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=240943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=242478><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=243927><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=261580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=264083><P Class=ENCC>
Webster?<br>
Yeah. His throat's been cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=267040><P Class=ENCC>
There's hardly any blood in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=268431><P Class=ENCC>
There's no blood on the ground.<br>
<SYNC Start=270660><P Class=ENCC>
He was killed somewhere else.<br>
<SYNC Start=272094><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, they put his body<br> in the trunk, and his camera...<br>
<SYNC Start=275445><P Class=ENCC> they didn't realize<br> the camera was still running...<br>
<SYNC Start=278385><P Class=ENCC> and then drove the car here.<br>
<SYNC Start=280477><P Class=ENCC>
The tape's missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=282413><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working<br> and pointed his camera at the wrong news.<br>
<SYNC Start=285782><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=307491><P Class=ENCC>
We were doing a story on a doorman strike,<br>
<SYNC Start=310001><P Class=ENCC> another on gypsy cabs.<br>
<SYNC Start=311700><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing more dangerous than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=312848><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working on a story of his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=314852><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, no. He was my cameraman.<br>
<SYNC Start=316758><P Class=ENCC>
If we could look at his computer...<br>
<SYNC Start=318518><P Class=ENCC>
It's not his computer.<br>
<SYNC Start=319809><P Class=ENCC>
It's the company's.<br>
<SYNC Start=321020><P Class=ENCC>
There could be names of sources,<br> all kinds of protected information.<br>
<SYNC Start=324318><P Class=ENCC>
"If your pictures aren't good enough,<br> you aren't close enough."<br>
<SYNC Start=326901><P Class=ENCC>
The war photographer, Robert Capa.<br>
<SYNC Start=328492><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's motto?<br>
<SYNC Start=330287><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I guess.<br>
<SYNC Start=331662><P Class=ENCC>
Is this Webster here?<br>
<SYNC Start=332931><P Class=ENCC>
Look. He was in the war on Iraq.<br>
<SYNC Start=336790><P Class=ENCC>
Was he embedded?<br>
<SYNC Start=338775><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think the kid<br> actually saw any action.<br>
<SYNC Start=341247><P Class=ENCC>
Eh, just, you know...<br>
<SYNC Start=342603><P Class=ENCC>
I can see he has some messages here<br>
<SYNC Start=344459><P Class=ENCC> from his mom last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=346315><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, last night.<br>
Every night.<br>
<SYNC Start=347810><P Class=ENCC>
The kid lived with his parents.<br>
<SYNC Start=349142><P Class=ENCC>
Do you mind if we keep these messages?<br>
<SYNC Start=350802><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure his mom wasn't, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=352926><P Class=ENCC> one of his sources.<br>
<SYNC Start=354136><P Class=ENCC>
And if you find anything on that computer,<br>
<SYNC Start=356552><P Class=ENCC> you let us know.<br>
<SYNC Start=358657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364311><P Class=ENCC>
- Christine Roberts?<br>
- Uh, she's not here, and I have to go out.<br>
<SYNC Start=367014><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a reporter for the...<br>
<SYNC Start=368049><P Class=ENCC>
You were going so fast,<br> we almost lost you.<br>
<SYNC Start=370429><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, look, a download off Webster's<br> computer from the property tax rolls.<br>
<SYNC Start=373887><P Class=ENCC>
Must be for the story<br> he wasn't doing on his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=376950><P Class=ENCC>
We'll take over from here, Jerry.<br>
<SYNC Start=378417><P Class=ENCC>
Mmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=379282><P Class=ENCC>
Can we come in?<br>
<SYNC Start=380575><P Class=ENCC>
The police. What choice do I have?<br>
<SYNC Start=383108><P Class=ENCC>
I'm Detective Goren.<br>
<SYNC Start=384564><P Class=ENCC>
This is Detective Eames.<br>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=386028><P Class=ENCC>
- And you are?<br>
- Octavia Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=387627><P Class=ENCC>
I rent this place from Christine.<br>
<SYNC Start=389079><P Class=ENCC>
I moved in three weeks ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=390186><P Class=ENCC>
Do you want to see my green card?<br>
<SYNC Start=391846><P Class=ENCC>
It's not necessary.<br>
<SYNC Start=393278><P Class=ENCC>
You are in the art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=394624><P Class=ENCC>
I am a lawyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=396670><P Class=ENCC>
I am representing the estate of<br> a great collector in Santiago.<br>
<SYNC Start=400264><P Class=ENCC>
I found a buyer in New York.<br>
<SYNC Start=402107><P Class=ENCC>
The Webster Gallery.<br>
<SYNC Start=402954><P Class=ENCC>
These are going to the Webster Gallery?<br>
<SYNC Start=405682><P Class=ENCC>
He is my buyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=407379><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Henry Webster.<br>
<SYNC Start=408488><P Class=ENCC>
Does he have a brother<br> or a son named Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=413179><P Class=ENCC>
A son, yes.<br>
A funny name like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=414956><P Class=ENCC>
What's funny is Clayton looked up<br>
<SYNC Start=416464><P Class=ENCC> who was paying the tax on this condo.<br>
<SYNC Start=419464><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=420283><P Class=ENCC>
Why would he do that?<br>
<SYNC Start=421514><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought his father was paying.<br>
<SYNC Start=424272><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I see, because Henry<br> and I are having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=428020><P Class=ENCC>
Now that is ridiculous.<br>
<SYNC Start=429858><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, i-is there a reason<br>
<SYNC Start=430782><P Class=ENCC> why you haven't sent these to him yet?<br>
<SYNC Start=432225><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, the shipping label<br>
<SYNC Start=434238><P Class=ENCC> still has a date from a month ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=437429><P Class=ENCC>
I'm waiting for Henry to pay me.<br>
<SYNC Start=441301><P Class=ENCC>
How much does he owe you?<br>
<SYNC Start=442816><P Class=ENCC>
Two million dollars.<br>
<SYNC Start=444862><P Class=ENCC>
Well, there you go right there.<br>
<SYNC Start=446253><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe that's why his son is suspicious.<br>
<SYNC Start=448381><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, St. Peter's.<br>
<SYNC Start=449776><P Class=ENCC>
Right across from where<br>
Clayton was found this morning,<br>
<SYNC Start=452943><P Class=ENCC> dead.<br>
<SYNC Start=454438><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=456525><P Class=ENCC>
L-I'll bet you're gonna say<br> it was a coincidence.<br>
<SYNC Start=459328><P Class=ENCC>
- No. L-l...<br>
- No?<br>
<SYNC Start=460734><P Class=ENCC>
- I mean, yes.<br>
- Yes?<br>
<SYNC Start=463807><P Class=ENCC>
I don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=465060><P Class=ENCC>
There is nothing between Henry and me.<br>
<SYNC Start=469392><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing.<br>
<SYNC Start=471144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=473848><P Class=ENCC>
Two million bucks worth of art is nothing?<br>
<SYNC Start=478625><P Class=ENCC>

The Webster Gallery 130 Spring Street<br>
Wednesday, April 30<br>
<SYNC Start=480633><P Class=ENCC>
I was in Miami most of the day.<br>
<SYNC Start=482720><P Class=ENCC>
I got back just after 1:30.<br>
<SYNC Start=485579><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton was supposed to be working.<br>
<SYNC Start=487075><P Class=ENCC>
I'm... I'm sure the people<br> in his office would know.<br>
<SYNC Start=488608><P Class=ENCC>
They don't. Do you know where<br> we found your son, Mr. Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=492934><P Class=ENCC>
In Long Island City,<br> in an alley off Steinway Street.<br>
<SYNC Start=497177><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know someone from that neighborhood?<br>
<SYNC Start=499546><P Class=ENCC>
A young woman, Octavia Ruiz?<br>
<SYNC Start=502546><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=504038><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, yes. Yes, her.<br>
L... I know...<br>
<SYNC Start=506974><P Class=ENCC>
That has nothing to do with Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=508469><P Class=ENCC>
Well, we're trying to sort that out.<br>
<SYNC Start=511085><P Class=ENCC>
So far we've come up with two million dollars<br>
<SYNC Start=513241><P Class=ENCC> that you've given to Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=514939><P Class=ENCC>
That's coming from your wife, right?<br>
<SYNC Start=516616><P Class=ENCC>
I'm paying for a collection of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=518356><P Class=ENCC>
As for the source of the money,<br> that's none of your business.<br>
<SYNC Start=520494><P Class=ENCC>
We checked your wife's pedigree.<br>
<SYNC Start=522359><P Class=ENCC>
It's amazing what one<br> copper mine can do for a family.<br>
<SYNC Start=525537><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. All right.<br>
<SYNC Start=527217><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz is advancing me the money.<br>
<SYNC Start=528878><P Class=ENCC>
It's a good investment.<br>
<SYNC Start=529989><P Class=ENCC>
It'll put the gallery on the map.<br>
<SYNC Start=532646><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, but she's having second thoughts,<br>
<SYNC Start=534100><P Class=ENCC> because she thinks that<br> there's something going on<br>
<SYNC Start=535762><P Class=ENCC> between you and Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=538152><P Class=ENCC>
My wife is very insecure.<br>
<SYNC Start=540850><P Class=ENCC>
What does it have to do with my son?<br>
<SYNC Start=543628><P Class=ENCC>
Well, she tried to get in<br> touch with your son last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=545815><P Class=ENCC>
She left messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=547353><P Class=ENCC>
That's just Lyz worrying.<br>
<SYNC Start=548622><P Class=ENCC>
She didn't like him working nights.<br>
<SYNC Start=549955><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she had reason to worry.<br>
<SYNC Start=551178><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she asked him to confirm<br>
<SYNC Start=552821><P Class=ENCC> her suspicions, to follow Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=556047><P Class=ENCC>
In the first place,<br> there is nothing to confirm.<br>
<SYNC Start=557676><P Class=ENCC>
In the second place, my son<br>
<SYNC Start=559336><P Class=ENCC> would never humor my wife's paranoid fugues!<br>
<SYNC Start=561463><P Class=ENCC>
This time he did.<br>
<SYNC Start=563670><P Class=ENCC>
He checked the tax records on Ms. Ruiz's condo<br>
<SYNC Start=566414><P Class=ENCC> to see who the owner was.<br>
<SYNC Start=568033><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought it was you.<br>
<SYNC Start=571033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575681><P Class=ENCC>
My son was not killed because of this.<br>
<SYNC Start=579703><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=581971><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=584873><P Class=ENCC>
I almost told Henry everything.<br>
<SYNC Start=587123><P Class=ENCC>
L... l... I can't. I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=591133><P Class=ENCC>
It's a terrible burden.<br>
<SYNC Start=592258><P Class=ENCC>
I don't... I don't know how you live with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=593981><P Class=ENCC>
You have to believe that there is a purpose,<br>
<SYNC Start=596697><P Class=ENCC> that it's a blessing.<br>
<SYNC Start=598274><P Class=ENCC>
And... And know that Clayton will be all right.<br>
<SYNC Start=601806><P Class=ENCC>
He... He died near the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=604199><P Class=ENCC>
Three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=605673><P Class=ENCC>
It's a sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=607250><P Class=ENCC>
Surrounded by angels and saints.<br>
<SYNC Start=610591><P Class=ENCC>
He's at peace.<br>
<SYNC Start=612067><P Class=ENCC>
And he wants you to know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=615838><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=619853><P Class=ENCC>
The airline confirmed the dad<br> was on the flight back from Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=622555><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Ruiz, on the other hand,<br> was at a gallery opening downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=627139><P Class=ENCC>
A neighbor saw her come home<br> alone around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=630203><P Class=ENCC>
Ruiz had anything to do with this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=631798><P Class=ENCC> you think she'd make sure the body<br>
<SYNC Start=632998><P Class=ENCC> didn't end up on her doorstep.<br>
<SYNC Start=634639><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, that's not the only thing<br> that doesn't add up.<br>
<SYNC Start=636867><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, the lab found traces of animal blood...<br>
<SYNC Start=640318><P Class=ENCC> in the wound on the kid's neck,<br>
<SYNC Start=641550><P Class=ENCC> probably from the knife.<br>
<SYNC Start=642802><P Class=ENCC>
And then there's the bulb in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=646639><P Class=ENCC>
The repair record on the car...<br>
<SYNC Start=649202><P Class=ENCC> shows it was replaced six months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=653716><P Class=ENCC>
They last longer than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=656370><P Class=ENCC>
Well, unless it stays on all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=660111><P Class=ENCC>
It's the pass code<br>
<SYNC Start=661679><P Class=ENCC> for the voice mail on Clayton's cell phone.<br>
<SYNC Start=664679><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=666721><P Class=ENCC>
First message.<br>
<SYNC Start=668033><P Class=ENCC>
Where are you, sweetheart?<br>
<SYNC Start=669570><P Class=ENCC>
I wish you'd call me.<br>
<SYNC Start=671290><P Class=ENCC>
Next message.<br>
<SYNC Start=672706><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=673892><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please, give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=675515><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=677332><P Class=ENCC>
End of messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=679072><P Class=ENCC>
That was at 11:35.<br>
<SYNC Start=682552><P Class=ENCC>
Just about the same time<br>
<SYNC Start=683598><P Class=ENCC> as the last message she left at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=686766><P Class=ENCC>
This lady's sick with worry,<br>
<SYNC Start=688161><P Class=ENCC> and she just stopped calling?<br>
<SYNC Start=691161><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=691385><P Class=ENCC>
I went to bed.<br>
<SYNC Start=692435><P Class=ENCC>
That's why I stopped.<br>
<SYNC Start=694297><P Class=ENCC>
Please be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=697622><P Class=ENCC>
We will.<br>
<SYNC Start=700735><P Class=ENCC>
Is there a particular reason<br> why you were calling him?<br>
<SYNC Start=704977><P Class=ENCC>
We were very close.<br>
We talked often.<br>
<SYNC Start=707258><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, about your husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=710425><P Class=ENCC>
Your husband told us<br> you suspect him of having an affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=714254><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=717524><P Class=ENCC>
Did you ask your son to check up<br> on a woman, Octavia Ruiz,<br>
<SYNC Start=721634><P Class=ENCC> maybe watch her apartment,<br>
<SYNC Start=724922><P Class=ENCC> catch your husband there?<br>
<SYNC Start=726967><P Class=ENCC>
No. I would never ask him to go up there.<br>
<SYNC Start=729013><P Class=ENCC>
It's too dangerous.<br>
<SYNC Start=732013><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=732292><P Class=ENCC>
Um, up there?<br>
<SYNC Start=734467><P Class=ENCC>
The Bronx.<br>
<SYNC Start=735239><P Class=ENCC>
I found a woman's address<br> in my husband's wallet.<br>
<SYNC Start=739348><P Class=ENCC>
Mrs. Webster,<br> she moved three weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=743539><P Class=ENCC> to Long Island City,<br>
<SYNC Start=745733><P Class=ENCC> near where we found your son.<br>
<SYNC Start=748733><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=754947><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.<br>
I'm very upset.<br>
<SYNC Start=758274><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have to come back.<br>
<SYNC Start=761274><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=764499><P Class=ENCC>
You have a night-light.<br>
<SYNC Start=767499><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=769681><P Class=ENCC>
You had this a long time,<br> since Clayton was little?<br>
<SYNC Start=773015><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. He was afraid of the dark,<br>
<SYNC Start=776674><P Class=ENCC> and he just got used to having it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=780819><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. You didn't want him<br> lying alone in the dark.<br>
<SYNC Start=786157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=792309><P Class=ENCC>
She's the one...<br>
<SYNC Start=794847><P Class=ENCC> who opened the trunk to leave the light on.<br>
<SYNC Start=797729><P Class=ENCC>
She found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=801350><P Class=ENCC>
Even though she didn't know<br>
Ruiz lived down the street.<br>
<SYNC Start=803782><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. She couldn't know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=806731><P Class=ENCC>
But somehow she knew where to look for her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=811440><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=813480><P Class=ENCC>
Her only outgoing calls were to her<br>
<SYNC Start=815059><P Class=ENCC> son's cell phone and to his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=817349><P Class=ENCC>
She got a call from a no-name,<br>
<SYNC Start=819068><P Class=ENCC> pay-as-you-go cell phone...<br>
<SYNC Start=820622><P Class=ENCC>
A 20-minute call,<br>
<SYNC Start=821608><P Class=ENCC> maybe to tell her where her son was.<br>
<SYNC Start=824046><P Class=ENCC>
A mother finds her son dead,<br>
<SYNC Start=825335><P Class=ENCC> she calls 911, she tells her husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=827175><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't just go home<br> and wait for all hell to break loose.<br>
<SYNC Start=829855><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, she somehow feels responsible.<br>
<SYNC Start=831756><P Class=ENCC>
Because of her suspicions, her worries.<br>
<SYNC Start=833763><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. I'm starting to think...<br>
<SYNC Start=836681><P Class=ENCC> that this death was staged for her benefit.<br>
<SYNC Start=840784><P Class=ENCC>
To make her believe that<br>
<SYNC Start=842088><P Class=ENCC> it had something to do with<br> an alleged affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=845193><P Class=ENCC>
You find the perps,<br> you can always ask them.<br>
<SYNC Start=846937><P Class=ENCC>
Well, luckily,<br> they left a calling card.<br>
<SYNC Start=849820><P Class=ENCC>
The lab identified the animal<br> blood on the knife...<br>
<SYNC Start=852984><P Class=ENCC> being mixed chicken,<br> sheep and goat blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=857009><P Class=ENCC>
And this.<br>
<SYNC Start=859712><P Class=ENCC>
This is where the car was abandoned.<br>
<SYNC Start=861273><P Class=ENCC>
On the northeast corner...<br>
<SYNC Start=862807><P Class=ENCC> of a square being framed by St. Peter's Church,<br>
<SYNC Start=866054><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony's and St. Francis.<br>
<SYNC Start=868671><P Class=ENCC>
Now these are three saints<br> that correspond with orisha...<br>
<SYNC Start=873881><P Class=ENCC> spirits worshipped by people<br> who practice Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=879295><P Class=ENCC>
Some Santeria followers,<br>
<SYNC Start=881301><P Class=ENCC> they believe that this square...<br>
<SYNC Start=883124><P Class=ENCC> has mystical properties.<br>
<SYNC Start=885311><P Class=ENCC>
The killers might've thought<br> placing the body there...<br>
<SYNC Start=888721><P Class=ENCC> would protect them.<br>
<SYNC Start=891632><P Class=ENCC>
You think Santeria,<br> you think South America.<br>
<SYNC Start=894532><P Class=ENCC>
We think cutthroat art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=896480><P Class=ENCC>
You're on the verge of an important deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=898255><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody wants to stop it.<br>
<SYNC Start=899976><P Class=ENCC>
And since Ms. Ruiz wouldn't<br> torpedo her own deal...<br>
<SYNC Start=903243><P Class=ENCC>
That leaves someone<br> connected to you or your wife.<br>
<SYNC Start=905351><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that knows about<br> your wife's insecurities.<br>
<SYNC Start=907944><P Class=ENCC>
Well, that could be any of my friends.<br>
<SYNC Start=910744><P Class=ENCC>
She's got these moods where she thinks that<br>
<SYNC Start=912704><P Class=ENCC> money is the only reason<br> that anybody cares about her.<br>
<SYNC Start=916133><P Class=ENCC>
That's why this was so important,<br>
<SYNC Start=918485><P Class=ENCC> why I needed this t-t-to work,<br>
<SYNC Start=920469><P Class=ENCC> to be a success.<br>
<SYNC Start=922046><P Class=ENCC>
'Cause once you're financially independent,<br>
<SYNC Start=924072><P Class=ENCC> she would know that you love her for herself.<br>
<SYNC Start=926707><P Class=ENCC>
But it's only driven us further apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=929688><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe that's the point...<br> to drive you apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=932330><P Class=ENCC>
Well, now you got me thinking<br> that I should've had her followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=935698><P Class=ENCC>
Why?<br>
<SYNC Start=936969><P Class=ENCC>
Did she have you followed?<br>
<SYNC Start=940318><P Class=ENCC>
When I borrowed Clayton's car<br> one night two weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=943038><P Class=ENCC>
I thought Lyz was having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=946791><P Class=ENCC>
I noticed them right after<br>
I picked up the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=948675><P Class=ENCC>
Two Hispanic men in a gray car. Um,<br>
<SYNC Start=951652><P Class=ENCC>
I let them pull up next to me at a light.<br>
<SYNC Start=953698><P Class=ENCC>
When they saw me looking at them, they...<br>
<SYNC Start=956698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=957554><P Class=ENCC> they were surprised.<br>
<SYNC Start=958951><P Class=ENCC>
And they took off.<br>
<SYNC Start=961431><P Class=ENCC>
Where'd you pick up your son's car?<br>
<SYNC Start=963370><P Class=ENCC>
At the parking garage at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=966194><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Parking Garage 63 East 68th Street<br>
Monday, May 5<br>
<SYNC Start=968734><P Class=ENCC>
They parked over there.<br>
<SYNC Start=970149><P Class=ENCC>
You remember their license?<br>
<SYNC Start=972376><P Class=ENCC>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=973953><P Class=ENCC>
No, l... I don't remember.<br>
<SYNC Start=976086><P Class=ENCC>
Did they smoke?<br>
<SYNC Start=978046><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. The tall one did.<br>
<SYNC Start=980275><P Class=ENCC>
Back here?<br>
<SYNC Start=982083><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, the short one wouldn't let him,<br> uh, smoke in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=986007><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=988053><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=990505><P Class=ENCC>
This print here...<br>
<SYNC Start=992449><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=994881><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. It repeats itself.<br>
<SYNC Start=998651><P Class=ENCC>
It's always parallel to the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1002287><P Class=ENCC>
And it always has more compression on the instep.<br>
<SYNC Start=1006242><P Class=ENCC>
He was leaning against the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1010659><P Class=ENCC>
So, the guy stood on his left foot,<br>
<SYNC Start=1014525><P Class=ENCC> crossed his right foot over his left,<br>
<SYNC Start=1016632><P Class=ENCC> held a cigarette in his left hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1019390><P Class=ENCC> and leaned towards the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1022680><P Class=ENCC>
Held onto the column with his right hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1025008><P Class=ENCC> right about here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1028569><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the orishas will be good<br>
<SYNC Start=1030364><P Class=ENCC> to us and give us a set of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=1034198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1036728><P Class=ENCC>
The threat is gone.<br>
<SYNC Start=1039749><P Class=ENCC>
You're safe, Eduardo.<br>
<SYNC Start=1042263><P Class=ENCC>
But remember the promise you made.<br>
<SYNC Start=1044799><P Class=ENCC>
Their protection is not guaranteed for life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1048158><P Class=ENCC>
You have to keep earning it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1050486><P Class=ENCC>
I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1052950><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1059909><P Class=ENCC>
If your men fail,<br>
<SYNC Start=1062321><P Class=ENCC> if they talk, Eduardo,<br>
<SYNC Start=1064653><P Class=ENCC> the orishas will be very angry.<br>
<SYNC Start=1068641><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075916><P Class=ENCC>
They're bringing in<br> one of the guys from the garage,<br>
<SYNC Start=1077676><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor Reyes. The other one,<br>
Omar Sanchez, is still missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1082468><P Class=ENCC>
What's that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1083859><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like a little crutch.<br>
<SYNC Start=1085031><P Class=ENCC>
It's for St. Lazarus.<br>
<SYNC Start=1086833><P Class=ENCC>
The followers of Santeria,<br> they wear it for protection...<br>
<SYNC Start=1089352><P Class=ENCC> against disease or death.<br>
<SYNC Start=1092712><P Class=ENCC>
What're you gonna do with it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1095712><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1099594><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know this guy.<br>
<SYNC Start=1102086><P Class=ENCC>
What about your cousin Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1103927><P Class=ENCC>
I don't got a cousin Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1105588><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1106674><P Class=ENCC>
The one we found in your jacket,<br>
<SYNC Start=1108130><P Class=ENCC> under "known associates."<br>
<SYNC Start=1110673><P Class=ENCC>
He told us he knows you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1113673><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1114876><P Class=ENCC>
You don't got Little Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1117202><P Class=ENCC>
He told us why you parked the car<br>
<SYNC Start=1118426><P Class=ENCC> next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1120655><P Class=ENCC>
To be protected, right, Nestor?<br>
<SYNC Start=1123293><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody's telling you stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=1125054><P Class=ENCC>
That's Santeria stuff... that's crap.<br>
<SYNC Start=1127301><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar doesn't think so.<br>
<SYNC Start=1130179><P Class=ENCC>
You should've seen him when we showed him...<br>
<SYNC Start=1131456><P Class=ENCC> what the guy you killed had in his pocket.<br>
<SYNC Start=1135100><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1139628><P Class=ENCC>
There's no way you could<br> kill him and get away with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1142404><P Class=ENCC>
Not with St. Lazarus watching over him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1145306><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man. Oh, man.<br>
<SYNC Start=1147953><P Class=ENCC>
We're dead men!<br>
<SYNC Start=1150021><P Class=ENCC>
Not if you confess.<br>
<SYNC Start=1152859><P Class=ENCC>
This killing wasn't your idea, was it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1155604><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1158734><P Class=ENCC>
The person who gave you the order...<br>
<SYNC Start=1161141><P Class=ENCC> that guy is gonna have to answer to orisha.<br>
<SYNC Start=1164226><P Class=ENCC>
Not you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1166509><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1170432><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. I tell you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1173527><P Class=ENCC>
It's Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1175285><P Class=ENCC>
Omar visited him up in Rikers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1177289><P Class=ENCC>
He told Omar what to do<br>
<SYNC Start=1178655><P Class=ENCC> and to leave the body next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1181992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1184470><P Class=ENCC>
Far as I can tell, Mr. Carver,<br>
<SYNC Start=1186478><P Class=ENCC> the only card you're holding is the uncooperated<br>
<SYNC Start=1188794><P Class=ENCC> hearsay testimony of an admitted killer.<br>
<SYNC Start=1192628><P Class=ENCC>
I wouldn't wait for us<br> to cooperate it before making a deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1195971><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Mendez is already<br> facing drug and murder charges.<br>
<SYNC Start=1199910><P Class=ENCC>
I never talked to a Nestor.<br>
<SYNC Start=1202654><P Class=ENCC>
And Omar...<br>
<SYNC Start=1203972><P Class=ENCC> nobody seems to worry about Omar anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1207322><P Class=ENCC>
Because you had him killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1210322><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1211568><P Class=ENCC>
Things take care of themselves.<br>
<SYNC Start=1213593><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, the orisha doesn't<br> seem to be taking care of you anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1216727><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be here<br> putting another murder on you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1222174><P Class=ENCC>
You killed someone under their protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1225324><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor and Omar didn't take the time to<br>
<SYNC Start=1229120><P Class=ENCC> look through Clayton Webster's<br> pockets before they cut his throat.<br>
<SYNC Start=1234694><P Class=ENCC>
You're in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1237543><P Class=ENCC>
You're... You're looking down at a life sentence.<br>
<SYNC Start=1242919><P Class=ENCC>
But you're not afraid.<br>
<SYNC Start=1245430><P Class=ENCC>
And you feel safe from the laws of this world...<br>
<SYNC Start=1249800><P Class=ENCC> and the next.<br>
<SYNC Start=1253581><P Class=ENCC>
There's someone watching over you, isn't there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1257910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1265497><P Class=ENCC>
You sure there's no connection with Clayton Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=1269303><P Class=ENCC>
None.<br>
<SYNC Start=1270999><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1272380><P Class=ENCC>
Then Mendez just picked<br>
<SYNC Start=1274920><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's name out of a hat?<br>
<SYNC Start=1276292><P Class=ENCC>
Or someone picked him for him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1279273><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that could convince him that<br>
<SYNC Start=1280559><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1285342><P Class=ENCC>
And who would that be?<br>
<SYNC Start=1288415><P Class=ENCC>
Someone who could guarantee his safety,<br>
<SYNC Start=1290967><P Class=ENCC> who has the authority in this<br>
<SYNC Start=1293166><P Class=ENCC> other world that he believes in.<br>
<SYNC Start=1297014><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1298958><P Class=ENCC>
His priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1301153><P Class=ENCC>
His Santeria priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1304157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1306355><P Class=ENCC>
I signed the visitors sheet at the prison...<br>
<SYNC Start=1308164><P Class=ENCC> with the understanding that Mr. Mendez's<br> religious beliefs wouldn't be scrutinized.<br>
<SYNC Start=1311736><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, it's you we're scrutinizing, Mr. Bello.<br>
<SYNC Start=1314904><P Class=ENCC>
So far, we've found out<br> you did time in Texas for fraud...<br>
<SYNC Start=1318853><P Class=ENCC> in association with revival meetings.<br>
<SYNC Start=1321269><P Class=ENCC>
That was when you were under your legal name,<br>
<SYNC Start=1323369><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bellonte.<br>
<SYNC Start=1324866><P Class=ENCC>
So you went from Bible thumping to Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=1327525><P Class=ENCC>
I came to Santeria a long time ago,<br> through an aunt.<br>
<SYNC Start=1331383><P Class=ENCC>
But I had to find my own path<br> before I could embrace it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1334774><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, so you're on a spiritual quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1337308><P Class=ENCC>
I'm more interested in your quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1339017><P Class=ENCC>
It has to do with the guidance<br> you give Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1342678><P Class=ENCC>
It's advice of a religious nature.<br>
<SYNC Start=1345049><P Class=ENCC>
Morning sickness.<br>
Still getting used to it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1347282><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria has commandments, huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=1349098><P Class=ENCC>
Don't kill. Don't steal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1352098><P Class=ENCC>
I guess Eduardo was a recent convert.<br>
<SYNC Start=1355303><P Class=ENCC>
Now that he has more time on his hands,<br>
<SYNC Start=1357124><P Class=ENCC> he's paying more attention to his soul.<br>
<SYNC Start=1360961><P Class=ENCC>
These colors are for Elegba,<br>
<SYNC Start=1363352><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony.<br>
<SYNC Start=1365294><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know a Clayton Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1367291><P Class=ENCC> the news cameraman?<br>
<SYNC Start=1369140><P Class=ENCC>
I try to stay away from newspeople.<br>
<SYNC Start=1371265><P Class=ENCC>
Well, don't worry.<br>
Eduardo had him killed last week.<br>
<SYNC Start=1374249><P Class=ENCC>
And this is an Ogun,<br>
St. Peter.<br>
<SYNC Start=1376417><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo doesn't discuss his business with me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1378663><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster's throat was cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=1381218><P Class=ENCC>
Knife left traces of animal blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1383568><P Class=ENCC>
His body was found under<br> the shadow of three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1387681><P Class=ENCC>
The murder had ritualistic touches,<br>
<SYNC Start=1389501><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria touches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1391199><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry. I can't help you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1392938><P Class=ENCC>
W-W-We're sorry that we've stressed you out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1394918><P Class=ENCC>
- You know, your neck...<br>
- It was a fender bender last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1398238><P Class=ENCC> that's all.<br>
<SYNC Start=1399142><P Class=ENCC>
Someone rear-ended me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1402142><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1402446><P Class=ENCC>
Well, i-it's funny you didn't see him comin'.<br>
<SYNC Start=1407510><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1411649><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bello has a hack license.<br>
<SYNC Start=1413719><P Class=ENCC>
He got his accident driving for a limo company.<br>
<SYNC Start=1416186><P Class=ENCC>
They house their cars in Long Island City.<br>
<SYNC Start=1418761><P Class=ENCC>
That would explain why<br> he's familiar with the neighborhood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1420501><P Class=ENCC>
Might explain a lot if he drove the Websters.<br>
<SYNC Start=1422642><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not finding them on Bello's receipts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1425642><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1427152><P Class=ENCC>
Even if he was their chauffeur,<br>
<SYNC Start=1429644><P Class=ENCC> you see them getting mixed up with Bello's hoodoo?<br>
<SYNC Start=1431833><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, we're just observing phenomena,<br>
<SYNC Start=1433612><P Class=ENCC> not explaining it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1436968><P Class=ENCC>
Here we go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1438522><P Class=ENCC>
Bello made a drop-off at the Websters' last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1445079><P Class=ENCC>
Passenger's an Ilene Maxwell.<br>
<SYNC Start=1449405><P Class=ENCC>
Well, looks like Bello was<br>
Ms. Maxwell's regular driver until...<br>
<SYNC Start=1456081><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like four months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1459264><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Apartment of Ilene Maxwell<br>
1094 Fifth Avenue, Tuesday, May 6<br>
<SYNC Start=1460922><P Class=ENCC>
He never talked to me about animal sacrifices.<br>
<SYNC Start=1463844><P Class=ENCC>
My God, I don't even wear fur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1465663><P Class=ENCC>
Did Lyz Webster ever meet him?<br>
<SYNC Start=1467688><P Class=ENCC>
No. Lyz has her own adviser.<br>
<SYNC Start=1469960><P Class=ENCC>
Very reliable person.<br>
<SYNC Start=1471273><P Class=ENCC>
Very in tune with people like us.<br>
<SYNC Start=1473023><P Class=ENCC>
She's a psychic.<br>
She advises you too?<br>
<SYNC Start=1475321><P Class=ENCC>
I don't use Sylvia anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1476959><P Class=ENCC>
I have an astrologer now.<br>
<SYNC Start=1478922><P Class=ENCC>
When did you meet Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=1480644><P Class=ENCC>
My son was in the hospital last year,<br> having his tonsils out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1484066><P Class=ENCC>
And the clotting factor in his blood makes even<br>
<SYNC Start=1486334><P Class=ENCC> minor surgery life-threatening.<br>
<SYNC Start=1488403><P Class=ENCC>
- You must have been very worried.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1490559><P Class=ENCC>
I was across the street from<br> the hospital having lunch,<br>
<SYNC Start=1492813><P Class=ENCC> and a woman came up to me,<br>
<SYNC Start=1494207><P Class=ENCC> introduced herself...<br> and said my son was going to be fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1497578><P Class=ENCC>
That was Sylvia,<br> and she was right.<br>
<SYNC Start=1499930><P Class=ENCC>
And this was when Julian was driving you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1501262><P Class=ENCC>
- to the hospital and back.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1504462><P Class=ENCC>
And you were probably on the phone<br>
<SYNC Start=1506443><P Class=ENCC> talking about your son's condition, and...<br>
<SYNC Start=1508344><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I imagine I was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1511572><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you're not suggesting that...<br>
<SYNC Start=1514572><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1517364><P Class=ENCC>
I have a strong feeling about this, Susan.<br>
<SYNC Start=1520366><P Class=ENCC>
It's very...<br>
<SYNC Start=1523130><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia? Are you there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1525360><P Class=ENCC>
Susan, Sylvia will have to call you back.<br>
<SYNC Start=1526876><P Class=ENCC>
No, no. It's not your fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1528695><P Class=ENCC>
She'll call you in a few minutes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1530481><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. Bye-bye.<br>
<SYNC Start=1533769><P Class=ENCC>
What did you see?<br>
<SYNC Start=1535268><P Class=ENCC>
Two people, a... a couple.<br>
<SYNC Start=1538330><P Class=ENCC>
The sky was red.<br>
I smelled sulfur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1541198><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
Sulfur... Red sky...<br>
<SYNC Start=1545209><P Class=ENCC>
That's lava. A volcano.<br>
<SYNC Start=1548548><P Class=ENCC>
You saw us in the South Seas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1552320><P Class=ENCC>
W-We have to leave now, Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1555540><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz can't handle it.<br>
I have to take it away from her,<br>
<SYNC Start=1558374><P Class=ENCC> and then we have to leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1559450><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, she'll grow into it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1562517><P Class=ENCC>
Remember how long it took you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1565048><P Class=ENCC>
Now she got what you promised her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1567952><P Class=ENCC>
And as soon as she fulfills her promise to you,<br>
<SYNC Start=1571337><P Class=ENCC> then we can leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1573809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1575962><P Class=ENCC>
My relationship with Sylvia<br> doesn't concern anyone but me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1580332><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't she convince you<br> your husband was having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=1582747><P Class=ENCC>
Is that what Henry told you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1584114><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster, this woman is feeding off your fears.<br>
<SYNC Start=1586225><P Class=ENCC>
It's how she makes a living.<br>
<SYNC Start=1588110><P Class=ENCC>
You don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1589256><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia has an accomplice with ties to a drug gang.<br>
<SYNC Start=1593224><P Class=ENCC>
He had your son killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1594974><P Class=ENCC>
Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1596688><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1597961><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't Sylvia call you the night that Clayton died?<br>
<SYNC Start=1600617><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=1601806><P Class=ENCC>
We know you got a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=1603465><P Class=ENCC>
We know you found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=1605801><P Class=ENCC>
We know you left the trunk open,<br>
<SYNC Start=1607437><P Class=ENCC> so he wouldn't lay in the dark all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=1610714><P Class=ENCC>
Now didn't she call you and tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1611982><P Class=ENCC> that she had a vision of<br> where you could find his body?<br>
<SYNC Start=1617229><P Class=ENCC>
Nobody told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1620267><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1622643><P Class=ENCC>
It was you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1624445><P Class=ENCC>
It was your vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1627445><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1629056><P Class=ENCC>
I've been given a very powerful gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=1632525><P Class=ENCC>
I don't talk about it<br> with skeptics and nonbelievers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1636733><P Class=ENCC>
Now please leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1638996><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1647273><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe this.<br>
<SYNC Start=1648912><P Class=ENCC>
Why not?<br>
A premonition about her family came true.<br>
<SYNC Start=1651912><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651977><P Class=ENCC>
Her son was killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1653474><P Class=ENCC>
Her husband's alleged mistress was implicated.<br>
<SYNC Start=1656822><P Class=ENCC>
All thanks to Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1658483><P Class=ENCC>
He convinced Eduardo<br>
<SYNC Start=1660323><P Class=ENCC> that Clayton was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1661524><P Class=ENCC>
He told him to leave the body<br> near the three churches for protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1664098><P Class=ENCC>
But his main agenda was to convince Lyz Webster<br>
<SYNC Start=1667920><P Class=ENCC> she really was psychic.<br>
<SYNC Start=1669379><P Class=ENCC>
That she would even believe in psychic powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1671320><P Class=ENCC> let alone pay someone<br> to turn her into a clairvoyant<br>
<SYNC Start=1675317><P Class=ENCC>
People look for an edge in an uncertain world.<br>
<SYNC Start=1677587><P Class=ENCC>
Even people like Lyz Webster.<br>
Hmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=1679493><P Class=ENCC>
And people like Sylvia Campbell<br> and Julian Bello are waiting for them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1682455><P Class=ENCC>
They're pros.<br>
<SYNC Start=1683401><P Class=ENCC>
Their first appearance as<br> a duet was 14 years ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1686115><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested for fraud in connection<br>
<SYNC Start=1688067><P Class=ENCC> with a church they ran in San Francisco.<br>
<SYNC Start=1690071><P Class=ENCC>
"The Church of the Open Mind."<br>
<SYNC Start=1692583><P Class=ENCC>
Julian served six months.<br>
<SYNC Start=1694098><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1695392><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested on another fraud charge.<br>
<SYNC Start=1697314><P Class=ENCC>
He got jail. She got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1699379><P Class=ENCC>
In New Orleans,<br> they opened a voodoo store...<br>
<SYNC Start=1701570><P Class=ENCC> where they promised to cast demons<br>
<SYNC Start=1703174><P Class=ENCC> out of a Mrs. Thelma Busfield for 20 grand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1706726><P Class=ENCC>
Julian got a year,<br> and again Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1709415><P Class=ENCC>
He takes a plea,<br> so she can take a walk.<br>
<SYNC Start=1711767><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Bello seems to be the one<br> to do the heavy lifting in the relationship.<br>
<SYNC Start=1716284><P Class=ENCC>
I would love to see the two of them in action.<br>
<SYNC Start=1719743><P Class=ENCC>

Apartment Of Julian Bello And Sylvia Campbell<br>
557 West 49th Street, Thursday, May 8<br>
<SYNC Start=1721863><P Class=ENCC>
She was his mother.<br>
<SYNC Start=1723889><P Class=ENCC>
He was her son.<br>
Of course she found him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1727150><P Class=ENCC>
We thought you might have helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1728604><P Class=ENCC>
The police department uses psychics<br> all the time to find people.<br>
<SYNC Start=1731551><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, l... I don't do work like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1733637><P Class=ENCC>
L-l-It's too disturbing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1736637><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1738028><P Class=ENCC>
Well, if you had a vision of her son's death,<br>
<SYNC Start=1740601><P Class=ENCC> you wouldn't tell Lyz?<br>
<SYNC Start=1743236><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz knew there was a shadow on Clayton,<br>
<SYNC Start=1746667><P Class=ENCC> but she didn't know what it was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1749138><P Class=ENCC>
Well, did you make her aware of this shadow, or<br>
<SYNC Start=1754956><P Class=ENCC> did she sense it herself?<br>
<SYNC Start=1757184><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it's the same shadow<br>
<SYNC Start=1758577><P Class=ENCC> that's been following you since Texas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1761387><P Class=ENCC>
Speak of the devil.<br>
<SYNC Start=1762578><P Class=ENCC>
The doorman told me you were here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1764310><P Class=ENCC>
They're asking about Lyz Webster and her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=1768001><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. And we were about to tell Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=1770109><P Class=ENCC> about the connection to one of your Santeria clients,<br>
<SYNC Start=1773109><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1773212><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1774489><P Class=ENCC>
It so happens, he ordered the hit on Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1777078><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, what are they saying?<br>
<SYNC Start=1779347><P Class=ENCC>
It's the one I visit in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1781046><P Class=ENCC>
They're harassing everyone who...<br>
<SYNC Start=1784428><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1788352><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1789877><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I'm here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1791730><P Class=ENCC>
Is she okay?<br>
<SYNC Start=1793020><P Class=ENCC>
She's fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1794438><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1796585><P Class=ENCC>
I saw water...<br>
<SYNC Start=1798386><P Class=ENCC> rushing water.<br>
<SYNC Start=1799725><P Class=ENCC>
A life sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=1802290><P Class=ENCC>
- What else?<br>
- I smelled fresh earth.<br>
<SYNC Start=1806320><P Class=ENCC>
It's new life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1809218><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1810467><P Class=ENCC>
Do you feel new life in this room?<br>
<SYNC Start=1813467><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1815144><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, are you having a baby?<br>
<SYNC Start=1817938><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. How about that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1820331><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have a brave child.<br>
<SYNC Start=1823579><P Class=ENCC>
Her clairvoyance...<br>
<SYNC Start=1825459><P Class=ENCC>
It's not just sights.<br>
She can also smell things.<br>
<SYNC Start=1829301><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. And the next time<br> you want to drop in, call ahead.<br>
<SYNC Start=1833114><P Class=ENCC>
I'll have a lawyer waiting.<br>
<SYNC Start=1834682><P Class=ENCC>
Come on. Let's go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1837195><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1838837><P Class=ENCC>
That's a neat trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1840715><P Class=ENCC>
He knew I was pregnant from the store.<br>
<SYNC Start=1844002><P Class=ENCC>
If she had said "crab cakes,"<br>
<SYNC Start=1845669><P Class=ENCC> he would've said "crawling babies."<br>
<SYNC Start=1848958><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it is a trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1851407><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the trick's on her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1854407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1856468><P Class=ENCC>
This can't be the Sylvia I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1859387><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1860943><P Class=ENCC>
I think that Sylvia believes that<br> she's clairvoyant,<br>
<SYNC Start=1863943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1864827><P Class=ENCC> just as she believes that she can<br> heal with crystals and potions and faith.<br>
<SYNC Start=1868139><P Class=ENCC>
And she's sincere in her beliefs.<br>
<SYNC Start=1870472><P Class=ENCC>
And that she absolutely believes that<br> she can share this gift with you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1874734><P Class=ENCC>
She said she'd... she'd help me<br> develop my natural powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1878395><P Class=ENCC> like Julian had helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1880217><P Class=ENCC>
She expected you to pay for this gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=1882362><P Class=ENCC>
Julian did.<br>
<SYNC Start=1884287><P Class=ENCC>
There was a consideration every month... $20,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1887470><P Class=ENCC>
And a larger sum later.<br>
<SYNC Start=1890848><P Class=ENCC>
When you had proof you were clairvoyant.<br>
<SYNC Start=1892861><P Class=ENCC>
Yes.<br>
$500,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1897993><P Class=ENCC>
But it went longer than you anticipated...<br>
<SYNC Start=1900873><P Class=ENCC> because you had doubts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1902935><P Class=ENCC>
And because Clayton...<br>
<SYNC Start=1906579><P Class=ENCC> was pressing you to stop seeing Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=1909275><P Class=ENCC>
He thought I was being exploited.<br>
<SYNC Start=1911829><P Class=ENCC>
You told Sylvia and Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1913895><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Julian said I should be more patient.<br>
<SYNC Start=1917819><P Class=ENCC>
And then you'd have the proof.<br>
<SYNC Start=1920819><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1923188><P Class=ENCC>
The night that...<br> that Clayton died,<br>
<SYNC Start=1928068><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1928702><P Class=ENCC>
I know it...<br>
<SYNC Start=1929973><P Class=ENCC> it wasn't Sylvia who called you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1932831><P Class=ENCC>
But it was Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1935831><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1937116><P Class=ENCC>
He said Sylvia had told him<br> to lead me in a guided meditation...<br>
<SYNC Start=1942306><P Class=ENCC> to try and find Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1944472><P Class=ENCC>
He interpreted what you saw...<br>
<SYNC Start=1948248><P Class=ENCC> until you were convinced.<br>
<SYNC Start=1950760><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, no. If... If it's all pretend,<br>
<SYNC Start=1952503><P Class=ENCC> how did Sylvia know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=1954628><P Class=ENCC>
When did she know?<br>
<SYNC Start=1955923><P Class=ENCC>
The next day.<br>
<SYNC Start=1957795><P Class=ENCC>
She had to have seen it in a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1960795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1962852><P Class=ENCC>
Or Julian told her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1965852><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1973023><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
<SYNC Start=1976166><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
Clayton... it's all my fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1980204><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1983536><P Class=ENCC>
They caught you when you were vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1987301><P Class=ENCC>
Now they're vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1990301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1992584><P Class=ENCC>
Help us catch them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1995955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000209><P Class=ENCC>
I'm so glad you called me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2001519><P Class=ENCC>
L... I was sending good thoughts to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2004519><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2004707><P Class=ENCC>
I see things clearly now, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2006486><P Class=ENCC>
Like photographs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2008350><P Class=ENCC>
Just like you said.<br>
<SYNC Start=2010393><P Class=ENCC>
I, uh, I made a promise to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2013644><P Class=ENCC>
And a promise is a promise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2016644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2019257><P Class=ENCC>
It's too much, Lyz.<br>
L... I can't.<br>
<SYNC Start=2022744><P Class=ENCC>
No, no.<br>
L... I want you to have it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2026843><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2028407><P Class=ENCC>
Are you all right?<br>
<SYNC Start=2031407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2033180><P Class=ENCC>
This morning, when I wrote your name on the check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2035042><P Class=ENCC>
I saw something...<br>
<SYNC Start=2037432><P Class=ENCC>
You and Julian in a room with gray stones.<br>
<SYNC Start=2040432><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2040658><P Class=ENCC>
There was a... a sheet of water,<br>
<SYNC Start=2042969><P Class=ENCC> a mirror and a man with a broken neck.<br>
<SYNC Start=2049033><P Class=ENCC>
He was asking a question about three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2052750><P Class=ENCC>
And the answer was wrong.<br>
<SYNC Start=2054629><P Class=ENCC>
It was a lie.<br>
<SYNC Start=2057122><P Class=ENCC>
The floor fell away.<br>
<SYNC Start=2060086><P Class=ENCC>
I saw you and Julian falling,<br> both of you falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2066144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2068032><P Class=ENCC>
Please, Sylvia, be careful.<br>
Please.<br>
<SYNC Start=2070636><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no, no. Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2073808><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2076808><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2078545><P Class=ENCC>
All here.<br>
Next stop, airport. Huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=2082329><P Class=ENCC>
Next stop, downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=2083985><P Class=ENCC>
I bet you know this one by heart:<br>
<SYNC Start=2085540><P Class=ENCC>
"Julian Bellonte and Sylvia Campbell,<br>
<SYNC Start=2088096><P Class=ENCC>
- you're under arrest for fraud."<br>
- Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2092335><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2094903><P Class=ENCC>
You'll sit here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2097133><P Class=ENCC>
And if you need something to drink,<br>
<SYNC Start=2099848><P Class=ENCC> you just ask the officer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2102848><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2123618><P Class=ENCC>
Let's put you, uh...<br>
Let's see, right here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2128337><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2130708><P Class=ENCC>
Everybody comfy?<br>
<SYNC Start=2132898><P Class=ENCC>
In case you're wondering,<br>
<SYNC Start=2134169><P Class=ENCC> when you exchanged Lyz's check<br> for the cashier check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2137004><P Class=ENCC> the bank notified Mr. Webster<br> because of the amount,<br>
<SYNC Start=2141046><P Class=ENCC> and he called us.<br>
<SYNC Start=2143720><P Class=ENCC>
And here we all are.<br>
<SYNC Start=2145850><P Class=ENCC>
That's a big number.<br>
Why'd she give you this money?<br>
<SYNC Start=2149555><P Class=ENCC>
It was a token of appreciation<br> for Sylvia's guidance and advice.<br>
<SYNC Start=2153293><P Class=ENCC>
We talked to Lyz after<br> we brought you in this afternoon.<br>
<SYNC Start=2157148><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l... l-It's...<br>
<SYNC Start=2160203><P Class=ENCC>
It's extraordinary.<br>
<SYNC Start=2162984><P Class=ENCC>
Y-You... Uh, what? What you... <br>
What you gave her..<br>
<SYNC Start=2165171><P Class=ENCC> what to call it.<br>
Second sight?<br>
<SYNC Start=2167393><P Class=ENCC>
Third eye? Sixth sense?<br>
<SYNC Start=2169376><P Class=ENCC>
- The gift.<br>
- Gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2174280><P Class=ENCC>
And Lyz said it didn't come to her overnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=2177749><P Class=ENCC>
For months,<br> she couldn't predict a sunrise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2179775><P Class=ENCC>
And then all of a sudden it fell into place.<br>
<SYNC Start=2182370><P Class=ENCC>
She had a premonition of her son's<br> death that was bang on the money!<br>
<SYNC Start=2185949><P Class=ENCC>
She even had a vision of where the body was.<br>
<SYNC Start=2190091><P Class=ENCC>
But there's something she can't figure out.<br>
<SYNC Start=2192956><P Class=ENCC>
She only saw one church.<br>
<SYNC Start=2195015><P Class=ENCC>
Then the next day,<br> you told her there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2199446><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2201278><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2205911><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=2208586><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2212604><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I asked you a question.<br>
<SYNC Start=2214245><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't have to answer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2215696><P Class=ENCC>
I have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2218171><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2219469><P Class=ENCC>
That night after he talked with Lyz,<br>
<SYNC Start=2222165><P Class=ENCC> he told me there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2225655><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2228655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2230613><P Class=ENCC>
So, how'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2235007><P Class=ENCC>
- Lyz told m...<br>
- No, you have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2238254><P Class=ENCC>
- Sylvia.<br>
- Julian, you have to tell them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2240880><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz had a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=2242479><P Class=ENCC>
She saw us in a room...<br>
<SYNC Start=2244338><P Class=ENCC> w-with gray walls made of stone.<br>
<SYNC Start=2247490><P Class=ENCC>
Sh-She saw a mirror and<br> a man with a broken neck. Him.<br>
<SYNC Start=2252351><P Class=ENCC>
And... And she said that one of us lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2255195><P Class=ENCC> and then she saw us falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2257750><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, w-we have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2261657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2264230><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa. R-R-R...<br>
She really saw that?<br>
<SYNC Start=2267530><P Class=ENCC>
I gave her the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2269638><P Class=ENCC>
And-And you have the gift too.<br>
<SYNC Start=2273596><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277083><P Class=ENCC>
Well, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=2279130><P Class=ENCC> th-that means that Lyz's vision<br> must be the real thing, huh, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2284116><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, sweetheart,<br> you just have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2289634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2295357><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2297487><P Class=ENCC>
Let's get you out of this gray room,<br>
<SYNC Start=2300139><P Class=ENCC> give you a chance to catch your breath.<br>
<SYNC Start=2303139><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2306172><P Class=ENCC>
J-Julian, tell them, or we're lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2312868><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2315034><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2319904><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2322565><P Class=ENCC>
So, if you lie to us, that means...<br>
<SYNC Start=2325293><P Class=ENCC> you don't believe that Lyz has the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2327644><P Class=ENCC>
And you don't believe that<br>
Sylvia has the gift either.<br>
<SYNC Start=2333122><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l-I'll bet that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2335395><P Class=ENCC> that you can't let on for one<br> second with Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=2339012><P Class=ENCC> that you don't have faith in her gift,<br>
<SYNC Start=2342270><P Class=ENCC> that you don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2345231><P Class=ENCC>
Because she'd be lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2348821><P Class=ENCC>
Because in her heart and i-in her soul,<br>
<SYNC Start=2352687><P Class=ENCC> she believes in her own clairvoyance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2356748><P Class=ENCC>
And why shouldn't she?<br>
<SYNC Start=2359016><P Class=ENCC>
Because when she's in these trances,<br>
<SYNC Start=2362387><P Class=ENCC> she sees these things...<br> she actually sees them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2365421><P Class=ENCC>
And when she smells them,<br> she actually smells them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2369293><P Class=ENCC>
Isn't that right, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2372293><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2384669><P Class=ENCC>
Partial epileptic seizures...<br>
<SYNC Start=2387774><P Class=ENCC> caused by a dysfunction...<br> in the anteromedial<br>
<SYNC Start=2390882><P Class=ENCC> and posterior temporal lobes of the brain...<br>
<SYNC Start=2394668><P Class=ENCC> and characterized by visual<br> and olfactory hallucinations.<br>
<SYNC Start=2399592><P Class=ENCC>
Sights...<br> and smells.<br>
<SYNC Start=2404535><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411709><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, how long have you known?<br>
<SYNC Start=2414709><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2417399><P Class=ENCC>
Eight years.<br>
<SYNC Start=2419157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2421410><P Class=ENCC>
They weren't that frequent at first.<br>
<SYNC Start=2424288><P Class=ENCC>
She thought it was a psychic trance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2426822><P Class=ENCC>
You thought you'd put her in the act,<br>
<SYNC Start=2429542><P Class=ENCC> puff her up until she believed...<br>
<SYNC Start=2432286><P Class=ENCC> that she could bestow this gift onto other people.<br>
<SYNC Start=2435546><P Class=ENCC>
She was convinced that it was a gift from God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2438445><P Class=ENCC>
It gave her life purpose.<br>
<SYNC Start=2440960><P Class=ENCC>
It made her happy.<br>
<SYNC Start=2443960><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2446464><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, this is Mr. Carver<br> from the D.A. 's office.<br>
<SYNC Start=2450393><P Class=ENCC>
What are we going to tell Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=2454288><P Class=ENCC>
Are we gonna tell her that you told the truth...<br>
<SYNC Start=2458369><P Class=ENCC> and that you have faith in her gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=2461943><P Class=ENCC>
Or are we gonna tell her that you lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2464720><P Class=ENCC> because you know that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2466909><P Class=ENCC> her gift is nothing but a haphazard firing of a...<br>
<SYNC Start=2471889><P Class=ENCC> defective brain synapse?<br>
<SYNC Start=2476367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2478433><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify...<br>
<SYNC Start=2480700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2482176><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify against Eduardo Mendez,<br>
<SYNC Start=2485341><P Class=ENCC> and I cop to this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=2487987><P Class=ENCC> what are you gonna do for her?<br>
<SYNC Start=2490927><P Class=ENCC>
Last time I got out of jail,<br> it took me six months to find her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2494670><P Class=ENCC>
She was sleeping under an overpass...<br>
<SYNC Start=2497101><P Class=ENCC> on a pee-soaked mattress.<br>
<SYNC Start=2500167><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hold a job.<br>
<SYNC Start=2502495><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hack the drugs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2505726><P Class=ENCC>
She needs someone to take care of her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2510396><P Class=ENCC>
If you cooperate fully,<br>
<SYNC Start=2512683><P Class=ENCC> we'll see about getting her into a group home...<br>
<SYNC Start=2514662><P Class=ENCC> near where you'll be incarcerated.<br>
<SYNC Start=2518811><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2519920><P Class=ENCC>
No. But...<br>
<SYNC Start=2521130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2522563><P Class=ENCC>
No, w-w-we'll make sure she gets in.<br>
<SYNC Start=2527158><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2531394><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
I'll tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=2535582><P Class=ENCC>
I'll tell you everything you want to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2538582><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2548913><P Class=ENCC>
You love her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2550670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2551643><P Class=ENCC>
We don't do very well without each other.<br>
<SYNC Start=2554643><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2562564><P Class=ENCC>
He told us the truth. He told us<br> everything we need to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2564809><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, thank God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2566084><P Class=ENCC>
- So we can go now.<br>
- I can't. I'm sorry.<br>
<SYNC Start=2569084><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2569562><P Class=ENCC>
But, Julian, Lyz said we're not supposed to fall.<br>
<SYNC Start=2573750><P Class=ENCC>
It's all right, baby. There'll be<br> someone there to catch you this time.<br>
<SYNC Start=2577957><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581361><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2583765><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2585644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2586936><P Class=ENCC>
True love. Probably<br> his only redeeming quality.<br>

- [Bell Ringing]
- ~Tis the season to be jolly~
~Fa la, la, la, la, la, la~
~Don we now our gay apparel~
~[Continues, Indistinct]~
- [Woman] Did you see it, darlin'?
- Excuse me?
- [Woman] Did you see it, darlin'?
- Excuse me?
Star of Yacov, what they be callin' the Christmas star.
Ain't been seen since Bethlehem.
And now it's here.
- That's nice.
- Oh, yes. Very nice.
It's a good sign for all good people.
Means someone special come from God.
What do you think about that?
I don't know. I'm not sure
I believe in that kind of thing.
Oh, that don't matter. It's there if you believe or not believe.
It don't care.
[Coughing]
Merry Christmas.
I don't have any change.
If you need a place to stay, there's a shelter right down on Nassau.
- Jenna?
- Say hello to your Aunt Maggie.
I don't even know where to start, Jenna.
It's been two years.
- [Crying]
- And a baby. What's his name?
- Her name is Cody.
- Cody.
She's eight-- Oh, no.
She's nine days old.
- Can I pick her up?
- She doesn't like to be held, but do what you want.
She's soaking wet.
Are you breast feeding?
- Who's the father?
- [Chuckles] Beats me.
- Beats you?
- It means I don't know.
It could have been a couple of guys.
I didn't get a name and a number.
-Do you have any diapers or formula?
-In the bag.
You gave birth on drugs?
Are you insane?
- Answer me!
- [Cody Crying]
What?
What do you want me to say?
That I'm not perfect, like you?
- I'm not.
- I didn't say I was perfect.
But if I had a daughter, I wouldn't let her be born a drug addict.
She's not strung out, okay?
I--
[Sniffles]
I took her to the clinic and they said it was something else.
- What something else?
- I don't know.
You have a child. If you don't give a damn about yourself, at least you have to care about her!
- Why?
- Because you're her mother!
Gee.
What's wrong, Mags?
Are you a little pissed that maybe there is one thing...
I can do better than you after all?
- What are you talking about?
- You know. "Mommy hood."
Maybe if you could have carried a kid, that piece-of-shit husband of yours wouldn't have run out on you.
What was it, two miscarriages, three?
[Sobbing]
Why do you do this,
Jenna?
I'm the only family you've got left.
I am the one that is in trouble here, okay?
I came to you for a little help and all you can do is give me shit!
I made a mistake coming here.
I'm leaving.
No, Jenna.
Don't run away again.
I'm so scared, Mags.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna help you, but first you have to get off the drugs.
Okay?
[Cody Crying]
Hi, you.
Where are you going?
To take a bath.
That's what you always say, right?
"A hot bath will cure anything."
Why don't we change your socks?
[Clattering]
Jenna?
Jenna! Jenna!
[Cody Crying]
Okay, okay.
[Continues Crying]
Okay. It's okay.
[Laughs]
Hi.
Hi.
[No Audible Dialog]
You're a psychiatric nurse,
Maggie.
You know the diagnosis as well as I do-- the arching back, the repetitive behavior and the attention deficit.
I used to think it was autism too, but I'm not so sure anymore.
It's as if she's listening to something we can't hear or see.
It's a difficult diagnosis to accept. I know that.
But there are a wide range of degrees of autism.
Cody may well be one of the lucky ones.
Reading, writing, language skills.
She may even be able to express basic emotions.
She does.
I know she's a little withdrawn, but she smiles and hugs me and kisses me just like any little girl.
There's a special-needs school in Brooklyn-- pre through six.
They've had great results with kids like Cody.
It's Catholic. I don't know whether that's any problem for you.
No. I was brought up a Catholic.
Just so it's not too religious.
And later, if her condition gets more severe--
[Woman On TV]
I welcome you with open arms.
- It gets better every time.
- I've sponsored your appointment, because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia.
[Man] That covers a lot of ground.
You cover a lot of ground yourself.
Leave in a taxi. If you can't get a taxi, you can leave in a huff.
If that's too soon, you can leave in a minute and a huff.
You haven't stopped talking since I came here.
You must have been vaccinated with aphonograph needle.
[Thudding]
- [TV Shuts Off]
- What is it?
Cody! Cody!
Cody, Cody.
It's okay, baby girl.
It's okay, baby girl.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Just relax.
Take a big, deep breath.
Go--
[Inhales]
- Is she okay?
- Yes. She does this sometimes.
Look, I gotta get going.
I've gotta be up early tomorrow.
-All right.
-I got a pretty busy week this week, but I'll--
I'll call you... soon.
That would be nice.
[Murmuring]
Don't leave in a huff.
- [Door Closes]
- Leave in a minute and a huff.
Now where is that mouse?
Right here?
Is that him?
I want you to get some sleep, okay?
Okay?
Good night, sweetheart.
Time to work on the picture board, Cody.
Cody. Cody.
- Don't you want to work?
- Please, Sister, after you.
Well, thank you, but we're not working on our manners today.
Maybe we should.
No work.
Sister Rosa go work. Good-bye.
Cody, your aunt is here for you.
[Voice Whispers, Indistinct]
[Voice Whispers, Indistinct]
Martin?
- Martin Casillas?
- Yeah?
Martin, you remember me.
I'm a friend of your father's.
You were at my house last year.
- You're six, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Good. You like dogs?
- Sure.
Well, I found a puppy and I bet he needs someone to take care of him.
Oh, you're probably too young to have a puppy.
- No, I could take care of a dog.
- Yeah?
Excellent. Well, he's right over here in my van.
- Wow. Can I have him?
- Maybe.
We're looking for a very special little boy, Martin.
If you're the one, you can have the puppy.
- But first you have to pass a test.
- Like what?
The boy that we're looking for can do things that nobody else can do, sort of like magic tricks.
- Do you know any tricks, Martin?
- I don't know.
Well, maybe we can help you find out.
Bet you that puppy's hungry.
Voila! Here.
Why don't you see if he'll take that from you. Go on.
What's the matter?
It's only garbage, honey. Come on.
- [Clattering]
- [Squeaking]
Hey. Hey!
It's just little mice, like Mickey Mouse.
It's no big deal.
[Woman On TV] The body of six-year-old Tania Riley, the fourth victim in a series of kidnap murders, was discovered last night near a residential area in Queens.
A statewide search is now in progress for the killer.
Police have yet to name a suspect... and have opened a 24-hour hot line for any information... regarding this or any of the other murders.
- [Continues, Indistinct]
- Hey. Hey, hey.
Let's put the dolly in the car.
Hi, Maria. I'm really late.
I've gotta run to work.
Okay. It's bedtime, mi angelito.
On. For Teddy.
Oh, okay.
But just for Teddy.
Your mommy's very pretty, yes?
Did you pray for her?
Oh, Cody.
You know this.
I tell you this.
You pray to the baby Jesus for your mommy, and one day she will come back to you.
Not coming, Mommy.
Not come.
I'm sorry, corazon.
I'm sorry, corazon.
You pray. You see.
Who knows, okay?
Buenas noches, mi angelito.
Buenas noches, mi angelito.
[Applause On TV]
[Woman]
Again, our guest today, Eric Stark.
You probably remember him as Little
Luke, the child star of Family Days.
Today he's here to talk about his work as founder of The New Dawn, one of the fastest-growing self-help organizations in America.
Honey, you have five minutes.
- Then you have to go get dressed.
- ...an addict by 15.
There were even rumors at onepoint that you had died from an overdose.
[Scraping]
But now you're helping these runaway kids.
You're helping the abused kids.
You're getting them off the streets.
You're getting them off drugs and into your rehab centers.
- What's your secret?
- [Turns Down]
These kids are tortured with morality.
They feel terribly guilty and they want to forget.
So what we try to do at New Dawn... is teach these kids to look inside themselves--
[TV Continues, Indistinct]
[Scraping]
[Mouse Squeaks]
[Faint Hissing, Whispering]
[Whispering Continues]
[Gasps]
[Voice Whispers, Indistinct]
[Chattering]
That's your guy.
- I'm looking for Detective Bugatti.
- Yeah, that's me.
- Agent Travis?
- How you doing?
Welcome to Brooklyn. I'll get you up to speed on all this stuff later.
But... maybe it would be a good idea... if you try to keep a low profile out here today.
- Why is that?
- Well, some of the guys, they're wound up pretty tight about this case.
They should be.
This is the fifth child and from what I heard, you still don't have any suspects.
That's true, but some of the detectives, they get a little territorial when the bureau steps in.
That would include you?
Hey, I don't give a fuck if we gotta call in... the French Foreign Legion if that's what it takes to stop this guy.
- Mind if I take a look at the body?
- Yeah, no, go ahead.
- Hi, Cody.
- Hi.
Those are very pretty.
Who are they?
[Gasps]
Must be that poor bird. It flew into a window and broke its neck.
They're all quite curious about death.
Do you think they understand death?
You'd be surprised.
I blame The Lion King.
Sister Rosa, would you mind?
Cody fixed the bird!
Cody fixed the bird!
Maybe he was just knocked out when he hit the window.
No, he was dead.
[All] Cody fixed the bird!
Cody fixed the bird!
- I'm tired, Mim.
- Okay, sweetie. We'll go home.
[Woman]
Thanks for staying.
- Sure.
- Must be a full moon tonight.
Helen got cut by a paranoid "schiz" with a razor blade.
- And there's a biter in four.
- Terrific.
And a recovering O.D. in three seeing snow lights.
If you'll take the histories.
- No problem.
- Thanks.
- Cheri Post?
- Who are you?
I'm Maggie.
Wanna tell me what's wrong?
What do you think is wrong? I'm sketching, you know, coming down.
Wanna lie down for me?
- Your name is O'Connor?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't care about your tracks.
I want to help you.
I just need a blood sample.
Some friends shot me up.
Wanted me to end up in the morgue instead of here.
Why would they do that?
[ Chuckles ] They don't like people quitting their club.
Nice club.
Just relax.
You're really nice for a nurse.
Okay.
Put some pressure on that.
You kind of look like her.
Who? Make it good.
I need a boost.
Jenna.
My sister.
You know my sister?
No, a friend of mine,Janet.
No, no, no.
You said Jenna.
- Where is she?
- I don't--
I haven't seen her in six years.
I've looked for her everywhere.
She has a little girl she hasn't even seen.
I know she has a little girl.
She's special. You know that, don't you? That's why they want her.
Please tell me where my sister is.
Forget about your sister, okay?
They've already got her.
Don't let them get the little girl.
- [Door Opens]
- Maggie, I need you in four.
- Doctor--
- Right now!
Stay here.
Task force hot line.
Can I help you?
Please, ma'am, slow down.
What makes you think that your landlord is the killer?
[Chatter Continues,
Indistinct]
Crawford, I hate to break it to you, but that weed's been dead for at least two weeks.
Excuse me.
- What is that?
- It's a lily.
- Really.
- Yeah, it just needs a little sun, and you get sun through both windows.
I hope you don't mind.
My daughter gave it to me.
No, it's okay.
Good.
Don't let Crawford bug you.
He's a little soft around the edges, but he's a good cop.
Oh, leave that there.
It's all right.
A little ambiance.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Depends on the question.
There's a rumor goin' around that before you were in the bureau, that you were some kind of priest or something.
I was a seminary student. I didn't make it as far as the priesthood.
Still, that is some kind of makeover. What happened?
Found another way to fight him.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Fight who?
Gentlemen, ladies.
Listen up, please.
Most of you have met
Special Agent John Travis.
For those who haven't, he's on loan to us... from the FBI Behavioral Sciences
Division at Quantico.
Agent Travis's area of expertise is ritual homicide... and occult-related crime.
He was instrumental in breaking the Santeria case last summer.
No offense, but didn't that case just end in an acquittal?
[ Laughter ]
That's right.
The problem with prosecuting occult crime... is the judicial concept of reasonable doubt.
The motives can be so bizarre, so far beyond reason, that they're hard for a jury to accept.
That means we have to work twice as hard to get a conviction.
But our perp could just be some run-of-the-mill psycho... who gets his stuff off the back of a comic book.
Idon't thinkso.
Whoever did this has a background in classic occult mysticism.
This symbol was used in ceremonial sacrifice... as far back as 16th century Europe.
The tines on the trident point left, signifying the left-hand path of Satanists.
It was a sign of a sect of Luciferians... who took the fallen angel mythology literally.
Then you think the perp's got motives...
- besides thrill kills?
- Yes.
The crimes were meant to be against God, not men.
But all I can give you right now is a time frame.
All of the victims' bodies also had these symbols... branded on them--
Pascua Negra.
The translation would be
''Black Easter.''
Whatever our man is up to will happen on Easter eve.
That's only about a week away.
Maybe this is almost over.
Or maybe in our perp's mind that's when it really begins.
No, last night.
I had just taken a blood sample when she ran off.
How could her paperwork disappear?
I just need her name.
Allright, thanks.
[Rustling]
[Cody]
Mim!
[Screaming]
Mim!
[Hissing, Squealing]
Mim!
Mim!
[Stops]
[Cody]
Mim!
Cody.
Cody.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Bad dream.
- Yeah, me too.
Me too.
You try to go to sleep, okay?
Okay?
Buenas noches, mi angelito.
I think I'll take Cody shopping today. It's so beautiful outside.
Okay. I'll just finish this and go home.
Maria, are you missing your rosary?
No. Why?
Because I found it under Cody's pillow last night.
Oh, she asked me for it.
It makes her feel better.
- I have an extra one if you want it.
- No, thank you.
I'll bring it for you just in case.
Cody, you ready to go shopping with your Mim?
What?
- Is that Maria's church?
- Yes. Can we go?
Okay, let's go.
I'm going to say a little prayer, like Maria does, okay?
Cody?
[Candles Rattling]
[Rattling Stops]
She's sad, Mim. So sad.
She's crying for us.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Nice limo you got there.
- You won the lottery?
- Miss O'Connor?
- Yes.
Honey.
Hello, Mags.
Hi, Cody. Do you have a kiss for Mommy, hmm? Come here.
I'm Eric Stark, Maggie,
Jenna's husband.
We just got back from Barbados last week.
Part honeymoon, part healing process for Jenna.
And no more bad habits--
- except for spending Eric's money.
- Mm-hmm.
He saved my life.
- Are you a doctor?
- He's Eric Stark, Maggie.
The New Dawn, the foundation, the seminars.
Did you meet Jenna through your work, Mr. Stark?
Eric, please. Yeah, we met at one of my outreach centers.
- When was it, only last month?
- [Jenna Giggling]
- Isn't that amazing?
- Crazy.
So this is all happening very quickly.
Oh, yeah.
Idon't waste time anymore.
I wasted half my life on drugs.
That was enough.
No more.
No more presents.
Um.
There's still something wrong with her, isn't there?
-I was hoped she would outgrow this.
-She's fine.
Just a little different.
And she certainly isn't deaf.
You know, I'm a little bit in a state of shock here.
You must know, Eric, that I haven't seen my sister... since the first week
Cody was born.
Well, I'm here now, and I'm healthy.
And everything's going to be fine, isn't it, sweetie?
We'll get you well.
- Do you have a kiss for Mommy, hmm?
- No.
She has to get used to you.
That will take time.
Mm-hmm.
Like round-the-clock time, huh?
- Cody?
- Well, that's why we're here.
You're gonna come live with Eric and me, Cody.
- We're gonna take you home.
- Darling?
Why don't you have Dahnia come up from the limo?
- Maybe Cody would like to meet her.
- We have a wonderful nanny.
Cody, go in my room and watch cartoons, okay, sweetie?
- [Dialing Phone]
- Hi. Could you send Dahnia up now?
Jenna, I don't think you understand.
- Cody's very special.
- You just said she was fine.
Yes, but she probably has a form of autism.
-I want the right people to see her.
-She's with the right people.
It's taken a lot of work to bring her to this point.
A change could undo everything.
Mags, Eric and I talked about this.
She's my daughter.
And it's sort of like--
It's not really up to you.
Who do you think raised her when you left her like a piece of luggage?
Who paid for her doctors and her schools and her test?
That gives me some say what happens to her.
Of course it does, Maggie.
We're grateful that you took care of Cody when Jenna wasn't able to, but now she is.
And I have the money to give her... the kind of special care and schooling she needs.
Now that you're here,
I want you both to be in her life.
She's made so much progress, but what she needs right now... are rules and stability and familiar faces. are rules and stability and familiar faces.
Then the sooner she gets familiar with us, the better.
- [Knock On Door]
- Ah, Dahnia.
This is Dahnia, Mags.
She's wonderful with children.
Hello, Miss O'Connor.
May I see the child?
- No, you can't.
- As you wish.
Maggie, really there's no reason to beso defensive.
We want you to be part of the family and visit Cody regularly.
This is crazy. It's too soon.
I have to talk to Cody.
- No. There's nothing to talk about.
-Jenna, please.
Well, I think this visit is over.
Jenna, why don't you wait in the car?
Maggie, I want you to think this through carefully.
Jenna and l, we only want what's best for Cody.
You don't know her yet. She doesn't know you. This will take time.
I'm afraid you don't have that luxury.
You're gonna have to decide right now, today, how you're going to deal with this.
And I promise you, you do not want this in some court's hands... for your own good-- and for Cody's.
Good-bye, Maggie.
- Cody?
- [Cartoon On TV]
Cody?
Cody.
[Hissing, Whispering,
Indistinct]
Cody!
[Tires Screeching]
No!
- He grabbed her out of my bedroom!
- Calm down.
No, I won't calm down. I won't leave here until somebody helps me.
Excuse me, miss.
How old is your child?
Six years old.
- It's her niece actually.
- Can I take a look at that?
Yeah.
Anyway, the kid's not really missing. It's a custody dispute.
We should probably give it to Social Services.
Eric Stark is involved in this?
Have you talked to this guy?
- No.
- I tried. His number is unlisted... and the foundation just gave me the runaround.
- Want me to find a number on him?
- Yeah, thanks.
I'd like to talk to Miss O'Connor for a few minutes.
Please, come this way.
I'll be honest with you,
Miss O'Connor,
Stark's organization has been under investigation before.
For what?
Harboring runaways.
There were allegations of tax fraud... and money laundering, but nothing that would stick.
Please, sit down.
See, Stark is well protected politically... and he keeps a pack of high-priced lawyers in attack mode year round.
Are you saying you're scared of him?
All I'm saying is that he'll bury you... if you come after him without grounds.
Are those the serial murders?
I'm advising a task force here that's handling that investigation.
But you don't think this has anything to do with--
No, but I do think... that what my charmless colleague told you before is probably true.
Right now the best thing for you to do... is try to establish some form of legal custody.
- You need a lawyer, not a cop.
- So that's it? "Get a lawyer"?
That's all the help you have to offer me?
No, you have my word.
I will follow up on Stark.
It'll be my pleasure.
I think his whole outfit stinks.
But I want you to promise me if you reach him first--
I would just feel better if you give me a call... before you even talk to this guy.
That will be my first priority,
Agent, making you feel better.
Miss O'Connor.
Miss O'Connor.
The only thing I can get on Stark is the number for his lawyer.
- [Door Shuts]
- No, thanks.
I want to follow up on this one.
- [Chuckling] Yeah, right.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Come on. The one lead you're gonna follow up on... is attached to a piece of tail like that?
No wonder this priest thing didn't work out.
This may be the best lead we've got.
Take a look, Frank.
December 16, 1993.
The same birthday as every kid on that board.
May I help you?
I really don't know much about your program and--
Would you like a tour?
Our main focus has been our national youth crusade, but our programs... for adults have been gaining more and more popularity.
Our self-realization seminars only require a $400 donation.
What I'm really interested in is speaking with Eric Stark.
His schedule doesn't allow for personal interviews, but I'll take you to our computer lounge... and you can e-mail him directly.
Before I found New Dawn, I didn't have any respect for myself.
I didn't think
I mattered to anybody.
And Eric helped me learn to will what I do... and to stop letting others judge me.
[Man]
Eric helps you tap into this power.
I mean, he changed my whole life.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Answering Machine Beeps]
Maggie, this is Cheri Post. I got your number from the hospital.
I know where the kid is.
Meet me at the diner at Stanton and Essex at midnight.
Do me a favor.
Bring some cash, okay?
This is all you brought?
I can't get out of the city on this.
Cheri, where is she?
Literally?
Of course not.
Well, Eric does-- and so do the sick fucks that are in with him.
So would you if you'd seen what I've seen.
- Like what?
- Eric's got this religion, only it's more like the opposite of religion.
I thought it was all bullshit at first, but I've seen it work.
They can predict the future, even make things happen to people, bad things.
What does this have to do with Cody?
About a year ago, they all started acting a lot weirder than usual.
They started hunting down kids-- six-year-old kids, boys, girls.
But they all had to be born on this certain date.
They'd take each kid and put them through this test, and if they failed, they'd kill them.
"The slaughter of the innocents," they called it.
Only Cody isn't like the other ones.
She's the one they've been looking for all along.
So instead of killing her,
Eric's gonna try to change her-- to make her just like him.
See? So he can use her power.
She's just a little girl.
She's more than that, at least she's gonna be.
Gonna be what?
I don't know.
A saint, a prophet.
She's gonna lead people to God,
Maggie-- a lot of people-- only Eric won't let that happen.
If he can't turn her, he'll kill her.
- Cheri, where is she?
- [Thunder Rumbling]
Do you promise to get her out of there?
- Yes.
- You're gonna need this.
[Thunderclap]
[Man Laughs]
Hello. Hello?
[Screaming]
[Shrieks]
Cheri.
[Screaming]
Come in. Crazy people like an audience.
Is that a self-diagnosis?
No, just a popular theory.
I had a half a dozen transit cops here this morning.
They think the concussion makes me a less-than-credible witness.
They're having a hard time believing you because they didn't find a body.
- You lied to me.
- Excuse me?
You think what's happened to Cody is connected with the murders.
How many children are dead?
Five, that we know of.
''Slaughter of the innocents.''
Does that ring a bell?
- Where did you hear that?
- From the girl they killed.
- What did she mean?
- Well, it's from the Bible.
When the three wise men told King Herod... that the star over Bethlehem... was the sign that the Son of God had been born,
Herod sent his soldiers to kill all of the children... that were born on that date.
But then an angel appeared before Mary and Joseph... and warned them to escape.
And what date are our innocents born on?
- December 16, '93.
- You son of a bitch.
- It's different with Cody.
- You should have told me!
It's different with Cody.
We know who took her.
And you haven't done anything about it.
Have you even found where he's keeping her?
Maggie, his organization owns... dozens of different properties all around the country.
He lives like a textbook paranoid.
He keeps moving all the time.
You could put out a warrant.
Come on, Maggie.
You don't think I want this guy?
I do. But if I make a move without grounds, it'll blow the whole case.
And there won't be a second chance here-- not for you, not for Cody.
That's a composite that we got of the killer... from two very strong eyewitnesses.
- Do you recognize him?
- No.
- But Eric could still be involved.
- Yeah, it's possible.
How many children have been killed since Cody disappeared?
None.
I'm going to help you,
Maggie.
I'm gonna make a request to have an officer outside the door...
- for the next couple of days, okay?
- Okay.
There is one other thing.
The hospital said that they found this on you.
Those kids tried to kill me last night. I wish I had used it.
Well, you didn't get that from me.
Lord, I could use a little help here.
[Rustling]
Oh, sorry.
You all alone in here?
- Yeah.
- Look, if I'm disturbing you--
No, that's okay.
I'm done for tonight.
Oh, man.
- I don't know how you do this.
- What?
This kind of work.
Day after day.
It's gotta wear down a man's spirit.
The worst thing is knowing that he's still out there.
And we're running out of time.
You'll catch him.
- I got a good feeling about this.
- You do, huh?
You're wrong about one thing though.
What's that?
You're not working alone tonight.
A good man is never alone in this world.
I'm sorry.
Can't you tell me who she is?
[Chattering, Indistinct]
Hey, how about watching my car?
[Whispering, Indistinct]
[Shrieking]
- [Squawking]
- [Chittering]
[Clanking]
Hello?
Jenna, it's Maggie.
[Footsteps]
Maggie, if Eric finds you here--
Do you have any idea who this man is?
- Maggie, I'm begging you.
- Cody. Cody.
Cody, hi.
Hi!
- Cody miss Mim.
- I missed you. Are you all right?
Cody go to dentist tomorrow.
Tell 'em don't make
Cody go to dentist.
No. How would you like to get up right now and leave?
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm taking Cody.
- And I want you to come with us.
- No. No, Maggie.
No. Maggie, I've watched him with her. He's very gentle.
Maggie.
What a surprise.
You should've called.
Unfortunately, it's almost time for Cody's nap.
Come here, Cody.
Sit down, Maggie.
It's allright, Jenna.
It's okay.
Actually, uh,
- I'm a little tired myself.
- [Eric] No! Stay.
We'll have drinks.
Stuart!
Stuart!
I think Maggie'd like a drink.
Oh--
Unless you have to run.
No. I'll stay.
I don't care for a drink.
I've been trying to reach you for the last couple of days, and I really don't understand why--
There are certain forces in this country, Maggie, that don't want me empowering the younger generation.
I have to protect my privacy and my family any way I can.
Well, the reason
I dropped by is, um, they're having an Easter egg hunt at Cody's old school.
And I thought it would be really fun if we went.
- Why don't you run get your coat?
- Actually, Maggie, things have changed since last time we spoke.
Originally, we'd hoped some kind of visitation might be worked out, but your attitude has made that impossible.
[Sighs]
I knew you wouldn't give her up... without getting something in return.
- You have nothing I want.
- How about my silence?
- Go on.
- I'm no fool, Eric.
I didn't imagine what happened to Cheri.
- I know she's dead.
- No one's saying you're a fool.
It's just obvious you're not well.
[Chuckles]
So, I'm scared.
You've accomplished that.
But I'm not likely to make a deal and break it the way she did, am I?
You let me take Cody and Jenna and leave right now, and that's it-- it's over.
You can go on with your mission or your religion... or whatever it is, and you'll never hear from us again.
Maggie, I'm not leaving.
There's nothing bad going on here.
We are taking very good care of Cody.
Eric gives her everything she needs.
- He married you to get to her.
- You are jealous.
You are jealous because I finally have a family and you don't!
Maggie, this is exactly why
I didn't want you here.
Dahnia, take Cody upstairs!
I've never fired a gun before, but I'll bet at this range I'm dead on.
Don't!
Are you really gonna shoot me, Maggie?
[Chuckles]
Right here, in front of Cody?
Close your eyes, sweetheart.
Go ahead and fire, Maggie.
[Whispering]
Feel that hate.
Feel it?
Feels good, doesn 't it?
Something that feels that good... can't be wrong.
[Hammer Clicking]
[Panicked Breathing]
Oh, my God.
Oh--
Thou... shalt... not... kill.
- Especially without bullets.
- [Bullets Clattering]
I know. You're confused, aren't you?
- [Whimpers]
- Concussions are tricky, huh?
They can mess with your perceptions.
Police start saying you're seeing things.
Maybe you are.
- Oh.
- Here.
- Oh.
- Here.
I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.
You know what?
On second thought,
I think I will take your silence after all.
[ Muffled Cries ]

[Ringing]
- Agent Travis.
- It's Maggie.
What the hell happened to you?
We thought you were dead.
We've got witnesses that saw your car go into the river.
- Someone helped me. No one saw that?
- I guess not.
And lucky for you.
If the cops found you at the scene, you'd be in a cell right now.
There'd be a warrant out for hit-and-run...
- if they knew you were alive.
- It was Stark and his people.
- I went there to get Cody.
- You what?
- How did you manage--
- They drugged me.
I don't know how, but I woke up right before the crash.
You do believe me, don't you?
Maggie, I want you to turn yourself in to me.
At least you'll be safe until we can build a case against Stark.
You gotta trust me right now.
Trust me.
- You want me to be safe?
- Yes, I do.
Then don't tell anybody I'm alive.
- Maggie, don't-don't--
- [Dial Tone]
Cody?
Come on.
You're not like ordinary children, Cody.
Do you know that?
On the night you were born... a star appeared in the sky... pointed right down at you.
A star that hadn't been seen in 2,000 years.
Like baby Jesus?
You're such a smart girl.
- Do you love God, Cody?
- Yes.
Well, maybe that's just 'cause you think you're supposed to.
I'm gonna teach you something tonight.
Something I think you're smart enough to understand.
[Muttering]
No. no. No, no. Shoo. Uh-uh. Sh--
- Look at this man.
- [Muttering Continues]
- He should be in an institution.
- No, no. No, no.
Shoo.
Uh-uh. Go away!
But God abandoned him, didn't He?
Left him here to suffer.
- Death... would be a kinder fate.
- Shoo-shoo!
- Even a cruel death.
- [Muttering]
Through the power of the one I serve,
I can give him the strength to end his pain.
[Speaking Foreign Language]
- [Continues]
- [Stick Scraping]
[Continuing]
Watch.
If God loves his children so much, maybe he'll stop this.
Redeem him... somehow.
Or maybe...
Or maybe... the release
I've offered him... is his only true salvation.
Eric!
[Whispering]
He has forgotten you.
Th--
Thank you.
[Chuckles]
She will be ours.
Dear God, if You really are there, please help me.
Please help me and Cody.
I know what's happening to you.
There's a man who can help us.
Please, we don't have much time.
[Laughter]
[Laughter Continues]
- Unhh!
- [Laughing]
- [Both Grunting]
- [Giggling]
-[Sobbing]
-Mommy's busy right now, sweetheart.
Why don't we go have a... little talk.
Just you and me.
Think it's time for another lesson.
I assure you, Father Grissom understands what you're up against.
He was a Jesuit priest, a scholar who was censured by the Vatican.
The Devil's greatest achievement... is that people don't believe he exists.
Nowadays the concept of evil is politically incorrect.
Then how could someone actually recruit people to worship the Devil?
Only a secret inner circle practice traditional Satanism.
But Eric Stark and other groups like his... are spreading a powerful message--
God does not really exist.
Therefore, we can all make up our own rules.
Come with me.
I've got something to show you.
These visions that you've seen... have all been seen by others throughout the centuries.
Accounts of demonic attack are common... in all cultures and religions.
There, you see?
There's a spiritual battle going on in this world.
We're all part of it every day of our lives.
- [Sighs]
- From what Sister Rosa has told me,
I believe that Cody will be an important part of this battle.
I have seen the glory of God in her, Maggie. I know you have too.
What will
Eric do with her?
"All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
Satan's temptation of Christ.
He'll try to turn her to his side, Maggie.
- If he can't, he'll destroy her.
- What do I do?
Get her back whatever way you can.
- I-I can't go back to Eric's place.
- Does she never leave?
They're taking her to the dentist tomorrow.
Then, that's our chance!
John will go with you.
I've helped families get their kids out of New Dawn before.
We won't make a move unless we're sure she won't be hurt.
These are directions to our convent in Vermont.
I'll be waiting for you.
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Yes, you can, Maggie.
There is hope.
You must believe that.
Not just for Cody.
All of us are chosen by God, and all of us can stand against the darkness in His light.
I never brought any of the other children up here, Cody.
Just you.
- You know why?
- No.
'Cause I'm your father now, Cody.
You never had a father before, did you?
No.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
All this, as far as the eye can see, is just a small part of what can be yours, Cody, if you're a good daughter... and you do what I say. and you do what I say.
But you have to choose... soon.
This only works if it comes from your heart.
What does God offer that compares?
Does He even exist?
Maybe God's just a nice idea-- like the Easter bunny.
He's not real... is He?
I know how you can tell.
[Gasps]
In the Bible, my lord says,
"If thou be the child of God, cast thee down from hence."
"For He shall give His angels charge over thee to keep thee... and in their hands they shall bear thee up."
Jump, Cody.
Jump.
If you believe in God, jump.
If not, you come to me.
What do you believe in, Cody?
My hand?
Huh? It's here.
You can see it.
Satan rules it, and it will protect you always.
Or His hand? ls it there?
Huh?
Or isn't it?
Will He catch you or not?
- If you believe, Cody,
- [Panting] jump!
- Jump!
- [Gasps]
After you.
Ahh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, darling.
Come on.
Let's get you back inside.
Bugatti, homicide.
- Agent Travis.
- Travis-- I heard of you.
None of your voodoo stuff here.
Just some bum got torched.
Hey, Frank.
How are you doing?
[Chattering, Indistinct]
It's a Druid rune spell.
Straight out of the 16th century.
Think we know how it started.
How long will it take your forensics lab to get prints off of that?
Mm, call in a favor, a couple of hours, maybe.
We're out of time on this, Frank.
It's Easter eve.
We have Stark's prints on file from a drug bust in '82. If they match--
If they match,
I'll get you a warrant... on this Devil-lovin' bastard before lunch.
Hold it. There they are.
[Woman]
No, it's fine. Sure.
Yeah, tomorrow at 5:00, okay?
Yeah. No, I'm sure we can fit you in.
Okay? Have a good afternoon.
Bye.
- Yes?
- Thank you.
[Drill Whirring]
[Child Whimpering]
- Mim!
- [Dentist] We're just about done.
Tell Eric I'll have the new dental records ready by tonight.
Thank you, Doctor.
That's a relief.
Wait a minute!
- [Door Opening]
- Maggie, I was getting worried.
[Groans]
Ohh!
Wait!
[ Tires Screeching,
Horns Blaring ]
- Stop that woman!
- [Horn Honking]
[Tires Screeching]
- Oh.
- [Screams]
[Tires Screeching]
Run, Cody! Run!
After you.
Thank you.
- [Grunts]
- [Gasps]
[Shrieking, Growling]
Eric Stark, this is the police!
We have a warrant to search the premises!
[Pounding]
[Beeping]
Where we going, Mim?
Vermont, to see Sister Rosa.
She has some friends there.
- Kids? Like at school?
- We'll see.
Looks like he blew town.
We've gotta strip this place down to the floorboards... until we find a lead on him.
The little girl's only got a few hours left.
- You got anything?
- Not yet.
We have access, but his files are encrypted.
We need anything on property that he owns, places he might be staying.
Just a whole lot of nothing.
Mm-hmm.
[Scoffs]
Not even dust.
Paint's fresh.
Does your forensics team have an A.L.S.?
- Yeah, they got all those toys.
- We're gonna need it.
[Coins Dropping]
[Dialing]
[Line Ringing]
- Oh, thank you.
- Buenos dias.
- Hi.
- You're sick.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

- Give me your keys, now!
- They're trying to kill us.
- License and registration.
- [Vehicle Approaching]
[Tires Screeching]
We've got to get out of here!
Run!
Run, baby, run!
Go! Go!
[Screams]
Looks like your boy's got serious money stashed in the Caymans.
The I.R.S. might be able to make a case.
What about property?
He owns some kind of country estate north of the city.
- I need an address on that.
- Workin' on it.
- Okay.
- We're all set.
Lights, please.
Try over here.
Oh, my God.
Think your guys can pull
DNA off of that?
[Technician]
Yes, sir.
Need to run a match against the kids.
Yeah. Yeah.
Lights, please.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- How long is it gonna take you...
- to get those crates analyzed?
- Hello.
Agent Travis, it's Maggie.
They've got Cody.
- Where are you?
- I'm at a diner on Route 17...
- about 30 miles south of Albany
- Do not move.
Don't talk to anyone. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?
- Okay. [Hangs Up]
- Agent Travis?
Got a location on that estate.
It's just off 87--
Let me guess.
Just outside of Albany.
Right.
It'll take a couple of hours to get there. I'll call the State Troopers.
I'll catch a lift from Air Support, and I'll meet you there.
- I'm gonna need local backup.
- You got it.
[Siren Blares]
- Maggie! Are you all right?
- Yes.
Stark's on the move.
Our best guess is that he took Cody... to an old estate he owns just north of here.
We're gonna get her back, though. I promise you that.
- You Travis?
- Yeah, that's right.
The place is about a half an hour away from here.
Local police have already done some reconnaissance.
- How's it look?
- The entrance is guarded.
Oh, that's no good.
The element of surprise is the key thing. They might hurt the girl.
Well, there used to be a dirt road about two miles up the interstate.
It's probably overgrown.
Could get us on the grounds.
All right, we'll rendezvous there.
No flashers. No sirens.
No one goes in that property until my command!
Ah! The prodigal daughter returns!
Just in time for her last supper.
It's Eastereve, sweetheart.
You only have a few hours left.
Tonight you can be reborn through my lord, or die for yours.
You're alone, Cody.
And through me... him.
Now, this is the last time
I'm going to ask you.
Join us, Cody.
Join us... if you want to live.
Cody, do what he says.
Please.
Is that it?
Is that all you can do?
Dahnia, I don't think
Cody's hungry.
Why don't you prepare the Light of the World for her big night.
- Has she called?
- Still nothing.
Mother Superior is ready to lock up for the night.
They should've been here hours ago.
What do you want me to do?
Tell everyone to meet me in the chapel.
These people are under attack, Sister.
They need our prayers.
[Travis]
That must be it.
I want you to stay in the car.
I need to be there for Cody.
I'm serious, Maggie.
Where's that backup?
They were right behind us.
They've got to be right back there somewhere.
You wait for them at the turn off.
We'll stay here.
You look so beautiful, little one.
[Snaps Fingers]
Tonight is a very special night.
Tonight... you must make your mommy and new daddy... proud.
[Grunts]
[Whispering]
Thanks for waiting.
Lights are on upstairs.
Okay.
Let me check.
- Maggie!
- [Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Yelling, Grunting]
[Groans]
- [Groaning]
- Come on! She's getting away!
[Panting]
Hey--
[Clamoring]
You bastard!
It's customary for guests to kneel.
[Men Chanting]
- Cody!
- [Chanting Continues]
[Rustling]
[Snarling]
For the girl Cody, the innocent, that she may one day stand against the dragon,
- we pray to the Lord.
- [Together] Lord, hear our prayer.
For Maggie O'Connor, that she will have faith in you, Lord,
- grant her strength.
- [Together] Lord, hear our prayer.
Send your angels to protect them, Father.
[Bell Tolling]
Send your angels to stand against the forces of darkness... that would do them harm.
- We pray to the Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.
This is it, Cody.
I know you like angels, don't you?
Well, Satan was an angel too-- the most beautiful angel of them all.
So beautiful... that God gave him dominion over the earth.
No!
[Gasps]
All you have to do... is cry out to him.
Ask him for mercy.
Callhis name.
Say his name!
[Exhales Sharply]
- [Cocks Gun]
- Choose, Cody.
Choose Satan as your god, or your beloved Mim dies.
- No!
- Don't, Cody. Don't.
Close your eyes.
We're faraway from here.
We're together.
- We'll always be together.
- What's your choice?
What's your choice, Cody?
Say it!
- Police! Open up!
- [Crowd Clamoring]
[Glass Breaking]
Kill the girl!
Shoot her!
[Groans]
- [Grunts]
- Mim!
[Gunshot]
No!
- [Crying]
- [Grunting]
[Groans]
[Exhales Slowly]
[Gasps]
I deliver you unto... him.
Drop!
- Maggie!
- [Creaking, Rumbling]
- Maggie!
- [Creaking Continues]
[Yelling]
[Yells]
Are you hurt?
Keep your head down!
Jenna!
Come on, Maggie!
Was anybody else in there?
[Sobs]
So, are you going back to work at the hospital?
- If they'll have me.
- How's Jenna doin' in rehab?
Fine, so far.
She asked me to adopt Cody.
No one will ever take her away from me again.
Come on. We're gonna be late for the church bells.
We're right on time.
You ready?
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[Bells Chiming]
[Knife Clatters]
Are you all right?
It's all right now.
[Children Shouting,
Laughing]
Two days ago, I received a letter from a lawyer in Europe.
It regretted to inform me my mother had died in a helicopter crash.
She was returning from her sold out farewell concert in London.
Her estate was to be turned over to me, the letter said, but my physical presence was required immediately...
Everything had been arranged, a plane ticket to Heathrow, a car waiting... only the timing couldn't have been worse.
Last month I released my first album, it got rave reviews in the US and we were just starting our debut American tour.
Maybe this sounds a little cold-hearted, but the fact is, she has refused to see me or even speak to me ever since she left home when I was only three.
I never knew why...
Everything I knew about her came from the tabloids, how she'd become a recluse rock star, hiding out in a castle nobody'd ever heard of.
But why did she want to give this.. this place to me?
She never returned a single letter
I wrote, never helped with the band, even indirectly.
And after we worked so hard to finally get our big break now she calls me from the grave...
Well, I hope what they say isn't true about curiosity killing the cat
Hello?
Hello?!
Hello, anybody home?!
Anybody alive in here?
What in the...?
Uh... What's goin on here?
Okay, this is getting a little weird.
Hey... What do you want from me?
Whoah, guys.
Look, can I help you with something?
Fellas?
Oooooh...
Hey... Watch it!... Listen,
I think we have a misunderstanding here.
Little help here!!
Wooooooo...
Little help in here please
That felt so good.
Huh? What is this?
We have an uninvited guest.
Let me take care of you, little bird.
Now for you, Johnny.
Welcome. We've been expecting you...
Go upstairs, Johnny.
Mr. D is waiting for you!!!
Looks like I have no choice.
Okay, either I've lost my mind or
I'm having really bad jet lag...
Now what?
Where the heck am I?
Wait a minute. I know that voice..
Mother?
Johnny, your mother was beautiful when she was young.
And she was good, very good,
Johnny.
You're mother could have been a superstar.
She had the talent.
But she drove a hard bargain.
One of the conditions of her contract was that you were strictly off limits.
You were her baby.
A rather touching performance really.
Anyway I kept my end of the bargain of course.
Alas, she could not keep hers.
So you've been summoned, and what was once hers I can now offer to you.
I know exactly what you're getting at.
Really. Enlighten me.
I'm having a really weird dream, and I can't wake up.
This is better than a dream,
Johnny.
This is immortality.
I can make you the the greatest rock legend of all time.
All you have to do is sign on a little dotted line.
Now I know who you are.
No way! I'm not sign-
That's what they all say... at first.
You really believe you have talent to make it on your own?
That's the dream Johnny.
In the real world, you need Mr.D.
He can make you everything you ever wanted to be.
But we understand if you have some... reservations.
Well, perhaps you better look around before you make your final decision.
Just to be sure
Johnny, You must find your way out.
Don't let them get to you.
Don't...
Who are you?
Oh, God!
What have I gotten myself into?
Interesting place don't you think?
Here's the lowdown, Johnny.
Centuries ago, music played a relatively minor part in the larger scheme of things within the corporation.
It was so difficult to find good recruits, not like politics.
We barely met our quotas.
Every now and then a client would try to reneg on his deal-
Musicians don't read contracts very carefully you know - so we would dig a new cave down here and confine the subject to a life of total anonymity and of course perpetual noise.
Drives ya nuts.
Long story short, music just wasn't much of a draw.
At some point there was even a plan within the corporation to scrap our division altogether.
So, fast forward, the Big Idea.
It was really my idea but...
Not important.
At first we wanted to call it
Twist and Burn - little too obvious so we settled on Rock and Roll.
Business went through the roof.
By the time the sixties rolled around our little division was on fuego.
Huge growth.
Our only problem was space.
Let me tell you, when you're dealing with damned souls, storage is always a big problem.
So Mr.D. had to come up with a new scheme.
This you gotta see.
Funny thing about rock stars, the instant they become rich and famous, they tend to think their invincible.
Stop living up to their commitments.
Even have the audacity to try to break their contracts.
But let me tell you, one does not break a deal with Mr.D.
But they tried and we build this place all for them.
You see we use the deal-breakers to provide entertainment for members of the corporation.
Works out rather well.
From time to time Mr.D. gathers the troops
- a little attitude adjustment party we like to call it
- and we have one hell of a good time...
Have fun. AHAA...
Welcome to our show.
If you like the band please applaud as hard as you can.
If not... applaud anyway.
Turn around Johnny.
You must leave this place.
I came this far,
I might as well see the show.
This is not a show you want to see, Johnny.
Once they get to you, there is no turning back!
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself!
But wait, who are you?! Mom?
Man, this is getting too weird.
Welcome to our show.
If you like the band please applaud as hard as you can.
If not... applaud anyway.
Johnny! What are you doing down here?!
I don't know. I just...
This place is off-limits.
Way off-limits.
I HATE this place.
Let's get out of here.
Opera isn't very popular here, is it?
HAAA... you don't know the half of it.
Mr. D used to love opera too, hardcore opera fan.
Then he got involved with an opera star.
Long story, but she left him, broke her deal.
Mr. D went totally berserk.
Opera is now officially taboo upstairs.
Whenever any opera singers break their contract, he gets a little... out of control
Never mind.
Nothing to do with you, Johnny.
Now you must go.
Mr. D is getting impatient.
The time has come...
Good.
Come here, Johnny...
I want to show you something - your future.
You know you have a good voice, but would you like to be a great guitar player as well?
I'll make a Rock legend out of you, it would be all yours, everything you ever wanted, let me show you.
Yes. Good. Goooood. Good.
Johnny?
Mom... this one's for you.
Shelley?
Dance with me?
In your dreams, loser.
Oh, Lily?
Wi... will you dance with me?
Eww.
Um, Paige?
W-w-would you dance with me?
I'd rather be boiled alive.
Hi, Kate.
Want to dance?
Maybe later, Jeremy.
Okay. Maybe later.
Hi, Dorothy.
Um...
Do you want to dance with me?
Come on up here.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Check it out!
Thick and thin gettin' it on.
That's nasty.
Like it, BuffaJo? gettin' hot?
Stop it.
Get away from me.
Is Pervert at it again?
Perv attack you?
Yeah. Jeremy attacked me.
He attacked me.
Pervert jumped Buffalo.
I didn't know.
Pervert.
Come on, let's get him!
Yeah!
Pound him!
Slap him in the face!
Get him!
Oh!
It's simple, really,
Shelley.
You see... from an evolutionary point of view,
Jason looks for an attractive young woman because he wants healthy children. and a young woman like yourself looks for a successful man like Jason... because she wants to feel safe.
Um...
Jason has some, uh, spinach in his teeth.
Oh.
Thanks.
Anyway... and so the species survives.
I mean... what else is there, really, in the end?
In the end.
Well... there's the check.
Check, please.
Yes.
Can I get you to get my car?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Um...
No dessert?
Um, no.
I'm sorry, I have finals.
Oh, that's too bad.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Whoa.
Muy expensivo.
Let's see... you had the salmon
and the crab cocktail.
I had the chicken and the salad.
and that would be...
Right.
Okay, well, thank you, Jason.
It was nice to meet you.
What, that's it?
What's it?
Don't I get a kiss?
Excuse me?
It's just a little frickin' kiss.
Oh, God.
Look, this "hard to get" shit doesn't play with Jason.
You know, Jason,
I'm not a doctor yet, but it's my considered opinion you seek psychiatric help.
Soon.
Says you.
Jason likes your dress.
Okay, Chad, it's just you and me now.
I promise to be gentle.
Strong, silent type.
How refreshing.
Okay.
Transversus abdominis.
Someone there?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh!
Oh, God.
Jesus.
Oh my God.
You scared the shit out of me.
Sorry.
Oh wow.
It's awfully late.
You gonna be okay in here all alone?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I've got Chad.
My corpse.
Oh.
Uh... well, uh...
Good luck tomorrow.
Yeah, thanks. you too.
Thanks.
"The journey of love is an arduous trek"
"My love grows for you as you bleed from your neck"
That's nice.
That's... that's really nice.
Okay.
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Oh...
Oh, shit.
Oh my God. Stop!
Shit.
Stop fucking around.
Aah!
Uh... uh...
Oh!
Shit.
Aah! Aah!
No!
Aah! No!
Uh-uh.
Come on, Kate.
You promised.
Paige, today at work,
I wrote a column about computer monitor dust wipes.
Mm-hmm.
Isn't that enough pain for one day?
This isn't painful.
I mean, painful's blind dating.
Painful's meeting someone on the internet and finding out that
6-footish really means...
5'4" with loafers.
I know.
Oh, Kate. You meet thirty guys a night.
And you get thirty seconds apiece unless you want more.
I mean, it's brilliant.
It'll be fun.
I haven't really completely broken up with Adam yet.
Oh, but you will.
Believe me, relationships don't make U-turns, and Adam's a drunk.
He's not a drunk.
He's a borderline addictive personality who happens to like alcohol a lot.
Uh-huh.
All right. Fine.
Let's just do it already.
You know, my mother's family dates back to the Mayflower.
I traced it myself.
She makes her own turtlenecks.
She had nine children.
Awesome, huh?
She's, uh... she's a pretty amazing woman.
Hi.
Left me out in the goddamn blue.
Says she can do better.
Says...
I don't fulfill her needs.
Sexually.
It's obvious to me... girl's gotta be a dyke.
Greatest team... in the history of professional football.
49ers. Yee-ha!
The Bible.
The Bible is the foundation of morality and marriage.
I know what you're thinking.
You do?
You're thinking you want to get the hell out of here.
That's pretty good.
Hi there.
Hi there.
I'm Paige.
Brian.
Brian, did my friend mention that she's in a serious relationship?
No, actually, she didn't.
But I'm free.
You are appalling, you know that?
Hey, you had your thirty seconds.
24. You took my last 6.
Oh, right.
Hello?
Dorothy, you're never gonna believe what Paige made me do.
What?
Oh my God.
What?
Shelley Fisher was taken long before her time.
we mourn not her loss, but ours, and so this is a time for those of us left behind to share our burden.
I never know what to do in situations like this.
I'm really bad at it.
I know that we're supposed to be... takin' a break and all,
I just thought you needed a friend.
I'm glad you're here.
Yeah.
So, um...
What do I do?
I'm sorry.
Hey...
Front page.
Kate, that's for
Spencer Marks.
You remember.
I mean, we both started on the paper together.
Look, anyway, they just named him lead reporter on the Giants, so I just got it for him as a gift. That's all.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Look, I haven't touched a thing in three weeks.
I'm doing really good, Kate.
So, uh...
You think we can... get together this week?
Dinner or something?
I don't know.
Come on.
It's just dinner.
Not a marriage proposal.
Adam, the last time you and I had dinner, we ended up in a hotel in
Lake Tahoe for three days.
Oh, yeah. Right.
That.
- That.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll call you, okay?
Yeah.
- Take care.
- Okay.
Hmm.
He looks good, huh?
Kate, that boy always looks good.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Was that Adam?
Please don't give me a hard time about this right now.
Sorry.
Jesus, Paige.
It's a funeral.
What?
Did you guys see the police are here talking to people?
Yeah, I know. So awful.
How are you doing,
Lily? Are you okay?
I don't know. I...
I can't believe she's gone.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Detective Vaughn.
I understand you're friends of Shelley?
Yeah, we've known her since we were kids.
Care if I ask you a few questions?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
When's the last time you saw her?
Um, about a year ago.
- More like two for me.
- Same here.
Yeah, she was really busy with med school.
You know anyone by the name of Jason Marquette?
Who's that?
Shelley was with him the night that she died.
Now he's missing.
Listen, ladies,
If you think of anything, anyone...
just give me a call, okay?
Okay, ladies.
Take care.
Thanks.
Ooh.
Hmm.
"Roses are red...
"Violets are blue...
"They'll need dental records to identify you!"
Hey, Dorothy.
Oh. Hey, Campbell.
Come in.
Cozy little place you have.
Is everything okay?
Uh... well actually I feel a little weird about this.
In fact, I tried calling you earlier, but you weren't home.
I need to ask you a favor.
Sure.
Well, my roommate, he's left town, and he hasn't been paying his share of the rent.
So when I got home today,
I found out that all my stuff had been thrown out on the sidewalk.
Skis, CDs, clothes, everything just gone.
And of course the timing couldn't be worse because every penny I have is invested in this start-up.
Millie?
Millie!
Can you please make up a guest room?
- Oh, no, Dorothy, I couldn't...
- Wait.
Did your father say?
No. I said.
Uhh, Dorothy, I'm embarrassed about this.
- I mean...
- Don't be ridiculous.
Go get yourself settled in, and I will be right there.
You...
You're the best.
Mmm.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Who's your friend?
His name is Campbell, and I met him at yoga, and he's off-limits.
So just let my dad know he's staying here for a few days.
Is he the reason you've been spending all your time on the treadmill?
Kim, you're not my girlfriend, and you're not my mother.
I'm just taking an interest in your life, Dorothy, you know, as your stepmom.
When you're old enough to rent a car by yourself, we can discuss your role as my stepmother.
In the meantime, don't talk about my sex life.
You have a sex life?
Yeah, I do, and I don't charge by the hour like you.
How dare you!
Oh, get your hands off me, you mail-order bride from hell.
Hey! Break it up, you two.
She just called me a mail-order bride from hell.
Dorothy.
Well I don't even know what she just called me.
It's okay, sweetheart.
You have to show more respect to my wife.
But, dad, she...
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, come on.
Not today.
Geez.
Classic.
Murray, Murray, Murray.
Hi. You've reached Murray,
the super.
Leave a message.
Murray, it's Kate in 403.
So, I don't have any water, and I have to be at work in a half hour, and I've got crap in my hair.
And... damn it!
Murray! are you there?
Shit.
Ha.
Of course.
Oh, God.
Ugh.
Perfect timing, Murray.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Kate.
Hi, Gary.
You look great, Kate.
How about a date, Kate?
You can be my mate,
Kate.
You're scary, Gary.
This could be our fate, Kate.
Uh... hey there, Lily.
Hey there, yourself.
Thank you for requesting my tape.
My name's Lance.
Hello, Lance.
I think
I'm perfect for you.
- Mmm.
- I'm outgoing, I'm fun,
I'm 6-footish.
I like board games,
I play a lot of, uh, ocean sports,
you know, kayak...
Good-bye, Lance.
Better luck next time, Lance.
Who is it?
Who is it?
There's nobody there.
Probably just Lance.
He doesn't clear the peephole, remember?
Hello!
Hmm.
- That's strange.
- They were fast.
Ooh, I bet it's from Max.
The rose.
Valentine.
Let's see it.
"'Tis a well known fact that beauty is skin deep, savor the taste... you are what you eat"
Well, that's sweet,
I think.
It's the strangest valentine I've ever seen.
Oh, look, it's not from Max.
Look, "J.M."
Must be for you.
Why?
Because you've covered much more of the alphabet than I have.
Who's J.M.?
Bite me.
It's definitely for you.
Okay.
You say it's for me, it's for me.
Mmm.
Oh!
John McCray.
Never even made a pass at me.
Jeff Malik?
Hmm... not his style.
Jake Matheson.
Gay.
Who is the guy who sent you the computer virus?
Beckett Broda.
Oh... damn.
J.M., J.M., J.M.
Jeremy Melton?
Who's Jeremy Melton?
I'm kidding.
No, who... who's
Jeremy Melton?
Come on.
Sixth grade?
Pervert,
60 pounds... buck teeth,
"You look so pretty,
Paige."
He can't still live in town, can he?
Lily, I'm kidding.
No, I know. it's just... what do you think happened to him?
I don't know.
What does it matter?
It doesn't.
God, we were so horrible to that kid.
Whatever.
All I know is, that was nasty.
Guh.
I'm talking maggots.
Actual live worms inside the chocolate.
Well, at least he left it at the door.
I swear, there was someone in my apartment.
I'm telling you, you must have left your door unlocked.
I mean, we were all so looped by the time we left.
Yeah, but it still freaked me out.
You should have seen this mask.
Look what we have here.
He's subtle.
Well?
You want to come over?
Guess not.
- Bye.
- Hey, guys.
This is Max.
Hi, Max. I'm Kate.
Hello, Kate.
That'll do, Max.
I'm just being polite, Paige.
So, isn't the show great?
Yeah, it's great.
Cheers.
Better than your last one.
You hate it.
No. N-no.
It's all right.
I hate it, too, sometimes.
But an artist has got to explore.
Mmm.
Max. I'm sorry.
We're having trouble with the video playback
in the maze.
Christ.
Forgive me.
- Mmm, girl.
- Mmm.
Whoo.
I'll be right back, you guys.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Paige.
Oh, hi, Paige.
I'm Campbell.
So, what brings you to this fascinating cultural event, Campbell?
That's a very good question, Paige.
- Actually, I'm here with...
- Hi, guys.
I see you've met Campbell.
Yeah, Paige was just hitting on him.
Sorry,
I didn't know.
Campbell, this is Kate and Lily.
And I see you've already met Paige.
Nice to meet all of you.
The four of us all had headgear and braces together.
Really?
Well, it seems you've all turned out all right.
Yeah, well.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes, please.
Dorothy, what else have you been keeping to yourself?
Valentine's Day...
What does it mean?
What's it really about?
A celebration of true love?
It was really strange... a cupid mask, like a cherub.
Like at that
Valentine's Day dance?
What dance?
Junior high.
God, Jeremy Melton.
Oh, my God, this is so weird.
We were just talking about him this afternoon.
Ahem.
So, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you enjoy your blind date.
If you would,
I need the ladies to go to the left, and the men to the right.
Ladies one side, men the other.
Uh-uh-uh.
Ladies one side, men the other.
Oh...
I really like the abstract frames.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
What do you like to do?
Wow. What is wrong with this guy?
- Dorothy!
- Sorry.
Look at that one.
What do you like to do?
What do you like to do?
What do you like to do?
This is like a lingerie commercial.
That's his point.
It's art. Just keep going.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Guys?
Oh!
What?
Who's that?
Hey, Amy.
That's Amy.
What do you mean,
"That's Amy"?
Get her out of here.
I invited her here.
Excuse me?
Please, relax.
What the hell are you doing?
It's not like we're in junior high school, okay?
Look, I've got to go.
I have an early flight tomorrow.
I don't have to deal with this.
Great. What... what's the matter?
Oh, what's the matter?
Well, the problem is, you turned out to be a cheap, hypocritical sleazeball.
Yeah, but you knew that.
So does this mean you're not gonna be my Valentine?
Hold me.
Love me. Love me.
I'm so lonely.
Hold me.
Love me. Love me.
Love me. Love me. Love me.
'Til death do us part.
'Til death do us part.
To love until death...
Don't walk away from me.
Don't walk away from me.
Don't walk away from me.
Don't walk away from me.
Woman, distorted:
Love me. Love me...
love me... love me...
I said I want my money back.
Hey, leech,
I'm talking to you.
Listen, I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?
- That's right.
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Oh. Well, well.
If it isn't the latest victim.
Excuse me, who are you?
That's none of your business.
- She's no one.
- No one?
That's right,
I'm just the idiot who's still waiting for the return
on her internet investment.
What did you call that again, hmm?
Bleed Me Dry dot com?
Yeah, that's nice.
Okay, let's go, Dorothy.
Watch your back, leech.
Well, sorry
I couldn't make it.
You didn't miss much,
Except for Dorothy's boyfriend getting attacked by some crazy woman.
Oh, and some really bad art.
I mean, this stuff was basically porn.
That sounds okay.
I don't know, things have just been really weird lately.
I mean, today I find this cupid mask in the elevator.
I turn around, and there's my creepy neighbor leering at me.
"Don't be late, Kate.
You're first-rate, Kate."
- That guy?
- Yes, that guy.
Every time I do my laundry, he's there.
Day, night, doesn't matter.
Knock it off.
And yesterday
I noticed that my underwear was missing.
Oh, yeah, don't worry about that. That was me.
I like to try them on, you know?
Makes me feel free.
I tap in to my, you know, feminine side.
What's it gonna be tonight?
Can I please have a Corona?
Just a club soda, please.
Actually, make that two.
Sure.
So... what do you say?
I'm just asking you for a chance, that's all.
I want to, Adam, but...
You drink. And you get out of control, and it scares me.
I've stopped.
I've changed.
So then it won't make a difference if you have to wait a little.
Right.
I don't get it.
We told you, we haven't seen Shelley in over a year.
How are we going to help you?
Humor me.
By the way, wasn't there another one of you?
Lily.
She's out of town.
These are remembrance cards sent to the parents.
Take a look at this.
It's odd.
Jeremy Melton.
J.M.
Jeremy Melton, geez.
Who's Jeremy Melton?
This loser from sixth grade.
He and Shelley were friends?
No, that's the thing. we haven't seen him in years.
Why would he send a card?
Because it's him.
It's Jeremy.
I got a valentine the other day, and it was awful, it was someone saying that they were gonna kill me, and it was signed "J.M."
Ours, too... the card in our chocolates.
You both received threatening notes signed "J.M."?
And after I tell you I'm looking for a Jason Marquette, you don't think to mention it?
I thought it was a joke.
Okay. Why would Jeremy Melton want to hurt you?
Well, he attacked me at a dance in junior high, and he got sent to reform school because of it.
Well, that would explain why he threatened you, but why go after Shelley?
Why your friends?
I don't know, but he is.
You don't know that.
The truth is, some kid that you all teased in the sixth grade is probably not worth getting all worked up over.
But I'll go check it out anyway.
You do that.
I'm next.
I know I'm next.
What are you talking about?
Because Jeremy got sent to reform school because of me.
Dorothy, he attacked you.
Dorothy...
He did attack you, right?
No. He didn't.
I just said that he did.
Why would you do that?
You guys wouldn't understand.
Do you remember what
I looked like back then?
You... you were bigger.
Y-you were big-boned.
- You were plump.
- I was fat, okay?
The only person that looked at me the whole night was Jeremy.
And then when those guys came up, and they saw us making out,
I couldn't bear it. and so...
I lied.
And I said he attacked me.
Dorothy, why didn't you say something about this to Vaughn?
I just couldn't.
Dorothy, I really wouldn't worry about this.
Jeremy Melton couldn't manage a water fountain without screwing up.
I don't think he's capable of an intricate revenge plot.
Hmm.
- Hi.
- God, you scared me.
What are you doing here?
I thought we were having dinner.
We are?
Oh, we are. I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.
I'm just a little distracted.
What's up?
Uh, it's probably nothing.
And you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
So you think it's far-fetched, right, this whole Jeremy Melton/
Revenge of the Nerds theory?
I don't know.
Well, what should I do?
I'm thinking Mexico, the two of us, just 'til this all blows over, all right?
Well.
Well.
- Want to come up?
- Yeah, I do, believe me.
I do...
But...?
I don't want you to do something tonight that you're going to write off as a weak moment tomorrow.
So... get upstairs before I lose my will.
Kate.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Okay.
Okay, so first you guys get Melton shipped off to reform school.
A year later, he lands in juvenile hall.
Six months after that, a state-run mental hospital.
That's awful.
You must have done some number on him at the dance, huh?
Where is he now, detective?
No idea.
All we know is that his parents died in a fire a couple years back.
Was he involved?
Don't know.
Ruled an accident.
Follow me. I want to show you something.
I pulled a file photo, and I ran some enhancements.
Here we go.
That's him.
Right.
But know anybody that looks like this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this?
Brown contacts, blue, green.
Beard, goatee, mustache.
Ten years is a long time, and that's not counting the possibility
of plastic surgery.
Do you have any more recent pictures of him?
If we did, don't you think we'd be looking at them?
The point is, this could be anyone.
Where's your friend Lily?
We told you, she's in L.A.
What about Max Raimi?
What do you know about that guy?
Just that he's an artist. A bad one.
I know.
I've seen his work.
What about the rest of you?
Any boyfriends?
Paige, for example?
The short answer is no.
What about you?
Uh, sort of.
But I've known him awhile.
Meaning what?
Meaning, we used to work at the same paper.
He covers the Giants.
His mother's a lawyer.
His father's a teacher.
They're from Seattle.
How's that?
What about you?
I have a boyfriend.
But I can guarantee you he's not Jeremy Melton.
Why don't you let me decide?
His name's Campbell, and he's very smart, and he's starting his own internet venture.
And how long have you known him?
A month.
And where did you meet him?
At yoga, but it's a very exclusive gym, okay?
Wait, I thought you said that Campbell was staying with you.
Well, he is, but, you know, his roommate didn't pay the rent, so...
Dorothy, you met this guy a month ago, and he's staying with you?
Excuse me, Paige, but there have been guys
whose last names you didn't know that you let into your pants.
I'm just letting this guy into my house.
Well you don't have to be bitchy.
Fine!
So, while we're on the topic, Dorothy, what is Campbell's last name?
You know, that's it.
This is bullshit.
And I don't have to answer these questions.
I'll see you guys later.
That went well.
- I gotta go.
- Me too.
Paige, actually, I'd like you to stay a moment.
Uh-oh. am I in trouble, Detective?
You want to interrogate me?
It'll just take a second.
Talk later?
Sure, if I'm not under arrest.
Please, take a seat.
So, Paige, what are we gonna do about this?
I thought that was your job.
You're the detective, right?
I'm not talking about the case, Paige.
Don't be coy.
I'm talking about this.
This?
Tension.
The tension?
The sexual tension.
Let's be frank.
Detective Vaughn.
Please remove your hand from my thigh.
All right.
Where would you like me to put it?
How about up your ass?
Have a good day.
So you'll get back to me on that.
Who the fuck are you?
It's not what it looks like, brother.
Okay? Take it easy.
I am not well.
Aah!
Here you go.
Hey, Happy
Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day.
I came by to drop off gifts.
I would have been here earlier, but I spent most of the afternoon talking to that detective.
It was very romantic, actually.
I wanted to explain about that.
Nothing to explain.
He's just talking to as many people as possible.
Kate, don't worry about it.
Listen, do you need a date for Dorothy's party tonight?
Come on, you don't want to go to a Valentine's party alone.
True.
So where's my gift?
I picked it out myself.
Very cute.
I got you something, too.
Oh, you got my suit cleaned.
Turn around.
"IOU... TLC."
That is outstanding.
Love that.
Can't get that at the mall.
No.
Bye.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Detective Vaughn is a disgusting, lecherous scumbag.
What happened?
After you left, he put his hand on my thigh.
Did you ask him to?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Hello.
It's Dorothy.
Uh, hold on, Dorothy.
Paige is here, too.
Hey, Dorothy.
Kate nearly clubbed me on the head with an iron.
They came for Campbell.
Yeah, I know. they questioned Adam, too.
Listen, Kate, did they call Adam, or did they question him for two hours?
'Cause now they've requested that Campbell not leave town for a few days.
It's humiliating.
Did you give
Vaughn his name?
No.
Well, then, how did he get it?
He's a detective.
You know, you go back and forth about Adam...
"should I or shouldn't I?"
Campbell's all I've got.
I don't feel like being dumped before my party, Kate.
Come on, Dorothy, just hang up the phone and make it up to the guy if he's so upset.
What do you mean?
Use your imagination.
Thanks, Paige.
you're welcome.
She's so ridiculous.
Do you need instructions?
It's detective
Vaughn, Kate.
Uh, sorry, Detective.
Uh, good news.
We picked up Marquette.
Oh. So does this mean that it's Jeremy?
Well, we haven't started the questioning yet.
But if it isn't Melton, you're gonna keep looking, right?
We're gonna keep pursuing every angle on this thing.
Meantime, be careful.
Stay with your friends.
I'll let you know when I've got more.
Thank you, Detective.
Well?
Picked up Marquette.
- What do we have here?
- Hey.
The plan is to have this up and running by tonight.
I'm sorry about this morning.
Oh, just don't even worry about it.
Really, it's not a big deal.
Uh...
Happy Valentine's Day.
Oh. Dorothy, what...
I had no idea we were exchanging.
Really, I'm embarrassed.
Do I have... do I open it?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Put it on.
Wow.
You like it?
Do I like it?
What are you...
- Dorothy, I love it.
- Yeah?
♪ I guess the honeymoon is over ♪
♪ and all the champagne is gone ♪
♪ Lately...
Don't worry about it.
It's just I...
♪ and everything seems wrong ♪
I'm gonna go take a shower.
Oh, Jesus!
Now it's my turn.
Wow.
It's so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Mmm. Yeah.
So, listen, I have that investor meeting.
But... you're leaving?
Well, just, you know, for drinks.
It'll be an hour, tops.
But you have the militant
Millicent here, and she's got her army of caterers and workmen, so I think you'll be just fine.
Yeah, I guess.
All right.
Well, uh, do you care to join me now?
Uh, it's tempting, tempting, but, um...
I want to get a quick workout in before my meeting, okay?
But I promise you I will be back before the party, okay?

Any other questions?
Uh... San Francisco.
What's that?
Look, don't tell me where the fuck I was born.
Just transfer the goddamn funds.
Campbell?
Campbell?
Fuckin'...
Yes, Dorothy?
We just lost the hot water in the main house.
Could you do me a big favor
and relight the pilot in the basement?
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
That's no problem.
Fuckin' perfect.
Now I'm on the staff.
Perfect.
Great.
Damn it!
Fucking perfect.
Great.
Shit.
Yeah.
Think that's worth at least a Porsche?
Yeah.
Shit!
Aah!
I'll get you one too!
There you are!
Excuse me.
- There you are.
- Hey.
Hey, any luck finding a date tonight?
I'm playing phone tag with Brian.
- Who?
- Brian?
Remember the guy from turbo dating?
Oh, right.
Well, I'm gonna go look around.
Okay, have fun.
Hey.
Still no Campbell?
Nope.
Well, it's only 11:00.
He said he'd be here before the party.
I'm not an idiot, Kate.
I know when I'm being dumped, okay?
You're not getting dumped, Dorth.
Right.
Happy Valentine's Day, ladies.
Hey, Adam.
Hey.
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- You look great.
- So do you.
Yeah, you look great.
Nice party, Dorothy.
It blows.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah, everything's fine.
It's just that men suck.
Oh, that's no offense to you, Adam.
None taken.
Yeah, okay.
Excuse me. Ahem.
He'll get here,
Dorth. Don't worry.
Don't ask.
Listen, you doing anything later on?
Uh, actually,
I'm busy.
I'm gonna hook up with some young stud, get a little action.
- Really?
- Mmm.
Sounds good.
Anyone I know?
Well, you know,
I'm young... reasonably good-looking... it shouldn't be that difficult finding volunteers.
Hmm...
Yeah, you'll do.
Hey, hot stuff.
You came.
I like how you move.
Why don't you join me?
Wow.
You know...
I'd much rather take you upstairs.
What's upstairs?
Something I want to show you.
It's a surprise.
I love surprises.
So...
So?
Mmm.
We're upstairs now.
Yes, we are.
You got a surprise for me?
Yes, I do.
Surprise.
You brought me up here to show me your penis.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Well?
What are you waiting for, honey?
Wax it.
Oh, you're unbelievable.
Paige, Paige, Paige,
Paige, come here.
Relax, okay?
It'll be fun.
All right.
Take off your shirt.
All right.
Don't forget your pants.
Now lay down.
What are you doing?
Never mind.
It's a surprise.
I knew it.
Knew what?
The first time I saw you,
I knew you were kinky, Paige.
You still want me to wax it?
Yes, I do.
♪ Now I feel like a baby... who has ♪
♪ just opened its eyes ♪
Ow! Oh, my...
Oh... God!
Paige.
Bitch! Oh!
This party sucks.
Things didn't go well with Brian, I take it?
Mmm.
Oh, my God.
This is a private party.
Get your little paws off me!
What is she doing here?
She was just leaving,
Dorothy.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
That's my necklace!
What are you talking about?
Campbell gave this to me.
And what are you supposed to be, his Valentine?
I don't think so, sweetie,
'cause that necklace was stolen from me along with half of the rest of my jewelry.
Hurts, doesn't it?
He loves me.
He loves your trust fund.
Trust me.
Okay, time to go.
Watch the jacket!
Bye-bye.
Now this party officially sucks.
No kidding.
Where are you going?
To chill out.
Hello again.
Hey.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you running off to?
What do you want, Max?
Easy, sweetness.
I just wanted to know if you've seen Lily yet.
She's in L.A., and don't call me sweetness.
Well, sweetness,
Lily's not in L.A.
What are you talking about?
Well, I called her office, and they said she never showed up.
Are you sure?
About what?
Hello!
Max, about Lily.
How long have you known this?
You know, you're really at home in this outfit, girl.
You just look... just... yum.
Ugh...
Oh, great.
What are you supposed to be?
I... I... I was just, um...
No! No!
Aah! No! No!
Uhh!
- Dorothy?
- Hmm?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
That Max guy said that
Lily never showed up in L.A.
Have you heard anything from her?
No.
But I bet Paige has.
Well, do you think he's here?
- Who?
- Jeremy Melton.
God, I hope not.
Listen. Listen!
My dad's got a gun in his study.
That's just a good way to get us both killed.
Hello?
Kate, it's Detective Vaughn.
Listen, we had to let
Marquette go.
What do you mean?
I mean exactly what I just said.
We didn't have enough evidence to hold him.
He could be anywhere... like your party, for example.
What? Wh-what happened?
Um, listen, Detective, our friend Lily never showed up in L.A.
Stay put. Stay in groups.
I'm on my way.
What?
They had to let
Marquette go.
So now they've got nothing?
Come on.
Which one of the 12 steps is this?
Kate.
There you are.
You know, I've been looking all over for you.
And I wasn't at the bottom of the bottle?
Kate.
Kate, come on.
Kate, don't be mad.
It's Valentine's Day.
Get away from me!
Hello.
Hello.
Does someone want to be my Valentine?
Come on.
Hello.
Come on.
Come on.
Brian.
All right, get the fuck out.
Ah!
Get your hands off of me!
Oh, God!
Stop!
Help!
Somebody, please help me!
Ah! Somebody help me!
Help!
Someone!
Aaah!
Uh! No!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
No!
Aah!
Wah! Aah!
Aah!
- Kate?
- Yeah.
Hey, Kate... shit, we blew a fuse.
Come on, grab Stephanie and let's go.
Jesus, this place cleared out fast.
Where the hell is Paige?
Oh, she's probably in a hot tub. she always ends up in the hot tub at these parties.
Where's Adam?
I don't know.
Did you check the wine cellar?
Could be him, you know?
What could be him?
Oh, come on, Dorothy.
No, no, no. don't
"come on, Dorothy" me.
Why the hell not?
Because I know Adam.
Okay, fine... he's no angel, but he's not a murderer.
Well, you didn't know he was an alcoholic when you first met him, either, did you?
I'm just saying I don't know if I trust your judgment.
That's enough.
Come on, Kate... with a little working out and, I don't know, some plastic surgery, why couldn't Jeremy Melton become Adam Carr?
Okay, fine. then by the same logic, why couldn't Jeremy Melton be Campbell?
You... should take that back.
Look, Dorothy,
I'm not saying it's true.
I'm just saying if we're going to be pointing fingers here...
I mean, you heard what that Ruthie woman said.
And how well do you really know Campbell?
I mean, you don't even know his last name, for God's sake.
You really can't stand it, can you?
Can't stand what?
That I found someone just as good as your boyfriend... just as smart and just as good-looking.
That's ridiculous.
I mean, why...
I mean, why should I... why should the fat girl get a turn, huh?
- What?
- Oh, come on, Kate.
You've always been the popular one, and Shelley was always the brainy one, and Lily was the fun one, and Paige was the sexy one, and I was the big, fat one.
And as far as you're concerned, that's exactly the way that it is.
Well, you know what?
Screw all of you!
Dorothy, come back.
Come on.
Come on, Vaughn.
This is Detective
Leon Vaughn, S.F.P.D.
Leave a message.
Aaah!
Aah!
Paige... Dorothy!
Paige... Dorothy!
Hi.
It's you.
It's me.
You're still here.
I'm still here.
I heard a noise.
I thought something might have happened to Dorothy.
Dorothy's a big girl.
What do you mean?
Dance with me, Kate.
No, Adam, I just want to find Dorothy.
I'm asking you nicely.
Dance with me.
Don't make me beg, Kate.
Please.
You know...
I screwed up, Kate.
You had a couple of drinks.
It's not the end of the world.
No, you're disappointed.
I'm just worried that you'll hurt me.
Hurt you?
Hurt you?
No, baby, I love you.
And you're the only good thing in my life.
All these other people, they can just die as far as I care.
But you...
Hey...
You mean something to me.
What's the matter, baby?
You're shaking.
I don't want to hurt you, either, Adam.
I understand.
But I will.
Oh... Jesus!
God.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Hello, Kate.
What the hell's going on?
Nothing.
What happened back there?
I just want to talk about this.
I'm sorry.
I guess I was just a little upset
about the drinking.
I mean, you were doing so well.
- Kate!
- Aah!
- Kate!
- Aah!
- Kate!
- Aah!
Paige!
Why do you want to hurt me like that?
I love you.
I always loved you.
Stay away from me.
Oh, come on, Kate.
- Ah!
- Aah!
Aah!
Aah! shit.
Shit.
Aaah!
Aaah!
Adam, I'm sorry!
It's all right.
I'm so, so sorry.
It's all right,
It's over.
It's over.
No, don't go near it!
It's all right.
It's okay, all right?
Dorothy.
Hey, don't look at her.
It's at the top of the street on the right.
Please hurry.
Police are on their way.
I don't understand.
A few weeks ago, she was so happy... happier than
I'd ever seen her.
It's okay.
I just don't understand.
All I can think is... if someone is that lonely and that angry, then they can learn to hide it.
But inside, it never dies.
It just stays there, eats away at you...
'til one day, you have to do something about it.
And we all liked her.
We were her friends.
Sometimes that's not enough, I guess.
I am so sorry for the way I was before.
None of that matters now.
I love you, Adam.
I love you, Kate.
I always have.

Benjamin?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- Then why did you wake me?
- I was running a test.
But we didn't schedule any tests.
I was running a test to perform an unscheduled test.
- What? Why?
- Please. Be more specific, Benjamin.
Why did you want to wake me and perform an unscheduled test?
Wanting is a human emotion, and not within my capability.
- I know that.
- Benjamin.

This animated animosity regularly served as a collective catharsis for the masses.
When violent animation was banned by statutory law at the beginning of the 21st century, the subsequent idealised and seemingly benign cartoon creatures unharnessed a human malevolence, and a reverse social polarity was...

- What happened to your robot?
- Nothing.
Really? Hope "nothing" doesn't happen to me.
The captain's big on
20th century cultural artefacts, so we did him up as a World War One fighter pilot.
We do things like that just to amuse each other. Everyone tries to get along here.
- I get along fine.
- You've been on board 12 days.
Asking about a robot's the first sign of interest you've shown in this ship or crew.
- I got a captain who watches cartoons,...
- He's working on his PhD.
..a computer tech who calls his mainframe Sweetie and two medical techs practising anatomy in any corner they can find.
I've been on six paramedic tours with this crew. They get the job done.
We're out here for months.
Nothing happens.
People get lonely.
Then suddenly all hell breaks loose, you do your job, then it all goes back to nothing happens.
This crew's OK.
Want to tell me what you're doing out here?
Ex-military pilots don't usually request work probation on paramedic ships.
I like deep space. It's quiet.
People out here tend to respect each other's privacy.
Take one a day.
You can put your shirt on.
Zyracon, huh?
Happy pills.
I'm happy.
Hazen's a tough drug to kick.
Zyracon helps with the residual effects.
- I'm clean.
- Human interaction helps too.
The crew's OK.
Maybe you should take the time to get to know them.
Thank you, doctor.
My analysis ofcards played shows a 77% chance ofyou losing, Benjamin.
Five miles of fibre optics sort of spoils the spirit of competition, don't you think, Sweetie?

I put some human traits into her personality profile.
I sort of wanted them to find out because it'd really piss them off.
But if they ever do,
I'm dead.
I'm assuming you're not gonna turn me in...
You don't know me well enough to make that assumption.
Your deal.
My analysis ofCopilot Vanzant's vital signs suggests a very high probability that he will turn you in, Benjamin.
I'm not gonna turn you in.

- Hello, doctor. Mind if I sit down?
- What if I do?
- Following orders - get to know the crew.
- So, the Zyracon worked.
I act nice and you want the credit?
You act nice, modern medicine gets the credit.
I've found staying clean is sort of like staying alive. You either are... or you aren't.
Count them. They're all there.
Since we don't bring out the pleasant side in each other, tell me what the hell bothers you so much about me.
I don't like Hazen.
It's not just a type-H mind-altering escape.
I don't like what it does to people who take it, I don't like what they do to others.
- I used to know someone...
- I'm not someone.
Didn't say you were.
There's nothing I can do to change the past, yours or mine.

Karl James Larson.
Karl.
Karl Larson!
You know him?
Worst nightmare I ever met.
Mr Vanzant, plot us a course, please.
Yes, sir.
Dimension drive fully charged.
Call it, Sweetie.
All crew, prepare forrescue operation via dimensionjump.
You go on ahead.
Course?
Plotted.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber now sterilising.
- Maybe this Karl guy's just coincidence.
- With Karl, nothing's coincidence.
Last time we did this
I didn't shit right for a month.
You're gonna be fine.
This guy panicked during countdown and he jumped out of his DSU.
So this other guy pulls him into his with him, right?
Countdown goes off and they have to
D-jump like that. I'm not kidding!
Afterwards they go to pull 'em out... and it's one guy.
14 feet long with a head on each end!
And then suddenly the heads start talking.
And both of them go, "Are we there yet?"
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.
It's not.
Two minutes to dimensionjump activation.
One minute to dimensionjump activation.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
Research says D-jump is great for your sexual stamina.
- Hallelujah!
- You know, you're gonna get it!
I am?
Kaela.
- I need to talk to you.
- When we get there. Use mine.
- I'll use number four. Now.
- Why?
No time.
- Call it musical chairs.
- Be my guest!
30 seconds to dimensionjump activation.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
Final countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Plasma acceleration.
Oh, I had you!
I definitely had you that time.
Oh, God, no.
Don't touch anything!
His skin's fused with polyglass.
Danika! Nanoscan kit, number three laser scalpel, vascular cauteriser, stat!
He's still alive!
What's happening?
- Sweetie?
- Debris strike. Fuel reservoirbreached.
- Hold him still!
- Benjamin! Bridge, now!
Ship has entered high-gravity field.
Severe fuel loss.
Gravity increasing.
Laser scalpel!
Cauteriser!
Status?
Controls active. Systems up.
- Prime main engine.
- Severe engine damage.
Extreme fuel loss.
Christ.
Blue giant.
That's gonna be ten times the gravity of our sun.
We've jumped into a high-grav field right in the path of that moon's debris cloud!
I can't isolate these veins unless you keep this hatch shut!
Warning. Lunarimpact in 57 seconds.
- Rate of descent?
- 98 metres persecond.
Time to impact?
49 seconds.
- Recommend alternatives?
- Assessment...
Sweetie, get us out of here!
- The hatch is gonna open!
- The controls aren't responding!
- Alternatives, Sweetie!
- Unacceptable risk factor on all options.
- It's opening!
- Cut the power!
Now, dammit!
- It's not working!
- Close the hatch!
- Engage docking thrusters.
- Thrusters insufficient to escape...
Overriding computer. Going manual.
No! We need Sweetie!
What are you doing?
Buying us some time!
Firing docking thrusters.
Kill me.
Please.
- How d'you know how much fuel to use?
- I'm guessing.
- I can't keep it shut much longer.
- Don't kill him!
Please.
Don't kill him.
Oh, God.
Clean this place up.
- Sweetie.
- Do you need me back now, Nick?
- What's our status?
- Fuel loss: 82%.
The dimension drive must recharge in order to escape high solargravity field.
- Time to recharge?
- 17 hours, one minute.
- Flashpoint time based on fuel reserve?
- Solarincineration in 17 hours, 12 minutes.
That leaves you an 11-minute window, Nick.
Maintain orbit, six-second thrusts,
15-minute intervals.
I will maintain orbit.
Start broadcasting ID and position, all coordinates.
See if you can contact the Titan.
This is Trans Soma rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing TSMO Titan 37.
Captain Marley?
This is Trans Soma medical rescue vessel Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma mining operation Titan 37.
Repeat: this is Trans Soma medical rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma mining operation Titan 37.
Oh. Did I wake you?
I thought you might be reading or...
Anyway, I managed to bring on board a fairly good bottle of pear brandy, and I thought, in the spirit of friendship, maybe we could share a glass.
It's...
- It's all right. We'll...
- Lemme see the bottle.
How do you think they get that in there?
They put the bottles on the branches so that the buds are inside and the pears grow right in them.
Then, when they're ripe, they pick the bottles, pour in the brandy and...
Of course, the real question is how the hell you get it out.
Rook to E7.
Congratulations, Benjamin.
Your strategy was both subtle and forceful.
You can play with me wheneveryou want.
Permission to have a child?
I've been trying to get it ever since you told me you wanted a kid.
What if they only approve one of us?
Two fine, non-genetically engineered specimens like us? Are you kidding?
We're gonna get approved.
And then we're gonna make us a baby.
- Bridge.
- Check.
Nick, I think there's something you oughta see.
Then there's this.
- DSU four. The vents weren't modulating.
- That's what killed Marley.
- A warning was going before we jumped.
- You mean he saw that too?
- He had to.
- So he took my DSU.
- Why didn't he cancel the jump?
- He thought it was an acceptable risk.
He should have transferred the call to another vessel.
Then Marley would be alive and you'd be playing chess with Sweetie.
And what if they never crucified Christ?
But they did.
And Marley's gone and here we are and that's how it is.
We've got what we've got.
All crew, repor to bridge.
Now that you've all had some rest, here's what we've got.
We were hit in our main tank when we jumped into this high-gravity field.
We lost most of our fuel.
The good news is we've got enough left for our docking thrusters.
They'll stop us incinerating till the dimension drive recharges.
Then we can dimension-jump home - but we'll be cutting it close.
How close?
1 1 minutes.
Are you telling us that we can't jump until 1 1 minutes before we burn?
I'm telling you we have 1 1 minutes.
It's enough.
I've gotten out of worse situations before.
This ship is going to be fine.
- We have no margin for error!
- Then we won't make any.
Attention.
I-class transpor ship deparing
Titan lunarmining operation.
They must be evacuating.
Sweetie, track that.
Attention. Transpor ship has locked on to our communication signal.
Prepare for intercept.
Suit up.
No response from pilot.
Transpor ship is on automatic approach.
You OK?
Sure.
When you said you'd been in worse situations, were you telling the truth?
Sure. When the ship was falling and the engines cut out, that was worse.
We'll be fine.
Warning. Fire on board approaching vessel. lt must dock immediately.
Approaching vessel, engage docking thrusters.
Repeat, please engage docking thrusters.
Can't spare the fuel for a hover.
We'll catch her on a roll.
Speed still increasing.
Excessive rate ofapproach.
Sterilisation bay?
- Check.
- We're taking a little hit when it docks.
Thanks for letting us know.
15 seconds to impact.
- Still no reply from approaching ship.
- He's running silent.
Or unconscious.
- Watch out!
- Clear!
We got a fire!
Get his helmet off! Check his vital signs.
This is your worst nightmare?
It's not Karl.
Bridge. One patient, male, early 20s, traumatised, unconscious but stable.
And this isn'tthe person who sent the call.
Run that by me one more time.
This isn't Karl Larson.
Meet me on the bridge when you can.
Benjamin, start a full systems check on the ship.
Right, sir.
There's some kind of growth on his bone structure.
These matrices. It looks almost as if his bones are strengthening themselves.
Radiation explosion.
No, much too normal for that.
Note it as a minor anomaly.
Most scanners wouldn't even detect it.
Doctor.
No indication for treatment at this time.
He's as healthy as a horse.
Keep him under observation.
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- It was personal.
- Nothing that affects safety is personal.
- So I know a man who calls Trans Soma.
He didn't call Trans Soma. He called the Nightingale. It was a direct call.
- Tell me what's going on.
- I can't.
I can't because I don't know.
I know a Karl James Larson, but this isn't him.
He had a son. I saw a photoscan of him.
There's a strong resemblance.
I'd guess it's him, but I can't say for sure.
I haven't seen Karl for five years.
When he and I were finished,
I couldn't have children.
I joined Trans Soma to get away from him.
Now, is there anything else that you need to know?
He was the Hazen addict.
How long was I out for?
About 20 minutes.
- How do you feel?
- Better than that transport.
That fire really finished it off!
How embarrassing. I'm Troy.
Danika.
I'm sorry. You're very pretty.
I haven't been around a girl in a while.
Let me go get you some clothes.
- We've only got five DSUs left.
- And there's only five of us.
We have a patient on board.
There's six of us!
We jump as scheduled.
I'll stay behind, take my chances.
- You won't have one.
- Call a rescue craft once you've jumped.
I'll be pretty far down in orbit by the time they get here.
- No, you'll be dead. I'm not goin' for this!
- It's your job to go for this.
Marley would be asking you to do the same.
- I'm not going.
- You want me to pull rank, I will.
Fine. That's an order.
I'm Doctor Evers. How are you feeling?
Happy to be here.
There's no one else down on Titan?
Not even close.
That whole place is like a ghost ship.
The distress call came from Karl Larson.
Yeah. That's my dad.
Was my dad. He died three years ago.
Aneurysm. Real sudden.
Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not.
He's probably one of the worst people that ever lived.
I'm sure you'd agree on that.
I tried to stay as far away from him as possible.
But I went to see him when he was dying.
He said that if I ever got into trouble that you were the person to call.
I guess that's the best advice he ever gave me.
- You seem to have made out OK.
- Yeah.
Seems like you did too.
This is just some vitamins.
You know, up until the end, when he said that I should call you if I needed help, he said he was sorry he didn't change his ways while you were with him.
Because now he'd never get a chance to make it up to you.
He said that's what he regretted most.
This is Nick Vanzant, our captain.
This is Troy.
He's Karl Larson's son.
How you doin', captain?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Look.
I know what you're gonna ask.
I was scavenging, OK? Strip mining.
It's amazing what the government leaves behind when they abandon a place.
I was with a group of people
I thought were my friends.
We didn't find much.
Which is why they took the mother ship and stranded me with that junk heap I flew in here.
Friends, huh?
I thought they were friends.
So can you tell us where your friends are?
I'm not the type of guy that names names.
Why'd you use your father's name on the signal?
I've been doing that for a while now.
Ever since he passed away.
I guess I figured might as well be good for somethin', right?
Tell me about Titan.
How much fuel is down there?
- Why?
- We had an accident when we jumped.
We lost almost all of it before the tanks sealed.
Well, if it's fuel you want, you got it.
There's plenty of it down there.
That's one of the things we were down there scavenging. Lucky for us, huh?
I'm gonna prep the shuttle.
- How's the patient?
- Cute.
I'm gonna go see if
Doctor Evers needs any help.
Yerzy. Yerzy!
Check out every corner of this guy's ship, every piece of equipment.
Anything looks suspicious,
I wanna know about it.
Why don't you get Flyboy to do it?
- I'm asking you.
- Why do I get the grunt work?
I'm a trained technician - which is different from a robot!
I'm asking you because of the difference.
Can Sweetie access the Titan computer, see if it's still operational?
Yeah, it's another C-1 1 . No problem.
If I go down, I'll need a full layout.
I wanna know what the hell
I'm walking into.
You think there are more survivors?
I don't know. If there are, I want to know about them before they know about me.
So, is this Nick always like that?
He really likes to swing it around, huh?
Pretty intense for an ambulance ship captain.
We lost our captain in the jump.
Nick had to take over.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say anything bad about him.
You two aren't...?
No. No, but...
Nick and Doctor Evers!
You know, your eyes are pretty.
Really? Thanks.
I guess everybody needs a little romance now and then, huh?
- Shuttle. You there?
- Yeah. What is it?
Listen, I found something.
- You betterget down here.
- On my way.
Yerzy?
Let me tell you somethin'.
Whatever it is, it's the most amazing thing any of us is ever gonna see.
You've played around with this thing, haven't you?
Now, why would I do something like that?
Robotic link engaged.
Transporing possible biohazard to quarantine.
Of course I didn't tell you.
I'm a treasure hunter.
There's two parts to that job - finding it and keeping it.
And keeping it's a lot harder!
I intercepted a stray transmission three years ago.
Ice miners.
They'd dug something up on a rogue moon.
I didn't know what it was, but I didn't need to.
Just knowing where was enough. Frozen.
In the middle of a rogue moon.
I knew whatever they'd found was a lot older than that moon.
So I did the research, grabbed some of my friends, and we went hunting.
And then I found the Titan 37.
There were no signs of the miners, no signs of anything.
My friends blamed me and they took my ship.
I stayed on, took my time, searching every inch and then searching again.
And then I found the treasure.
And now there's nothing to stop us.
- Us?
- Yeah, us.
You know how much the government'll pay for this?
Who knows what new technologies it could lead to?
We'll all be in on it.
If you guys help me out here,
I'll cut you in for five per cent.
- Each.
- Five per cent each, huh?
How about we give you that?
I found it last.
Am I missing something?
We don't even know what it is.
It's either human-made or it's not.
It's not man-made.
It was buried in an ice moon.
Look, there's no question. This is it.
Primary contact.
- It's been a dream for thousands of years.
- Exactly.
I'm not sure we shouldn't blow it out the closest airlock.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
I'm saying I don't know what it is, and nothing you've said indicates you do.
Maybe it is an alien artefact, maybe it's a magic trick.
Maybe it's a distillation of knowledge, maybe it's just a toy - an alien child's toy.
Or an alien sex object. It looks like it...
Or maybe it was so dangerous that the only way to get rid of it was to bury it.
Maybe.
It has no business being on this ship.
- It's harmless.
- You had contact with it.
- And you have abnormal bone growth.
- I've had that my whole life!
We don't have uplink. We can't confirm it.
Scan it and log it on record. When we get to clear space we tag it and float it.
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Oh, yeah?
Do you want to clarify that?
I'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime and you're passing it up.
- For all of us.
- For all of us?
Your "opportunity" has cost us our captain, endangered this crew and wasted critical time.
All this for some delusional belief that you'll get rich.
There's no opportunity.
And there is no "us"!
It stays in sealed quarantine till we get to clear space.
I want a rescue return transport on the shuttle.
- Think you'll need that?
- I don't know.
But the distress signal from the mine was cut short, it came in under a false name, and our friend didn't bother to attach a hazard warning to his distress signal.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just a kid trying to make some dough.
If that's how it is, I'll come back, we'll blast out of this orbit and I'll make one hell of an apology.
Any way you look at it, it beats staying behind in the shuttle.
- Rescue transport's on board.
- Thank you, Benjamin.
Keep an eye on this guy. Both of you.
- Good to go?
- Set.
See ya.
- Initiate launching sequence.
- Main thrusters primed.
Shuttle clear forlaunch.
It's not easy, is it?
Watching someone you care about go away.
That's how it was for him when you left.
I know that surprises you, but it's the truth.
- I know you cared about him too.
- I have a lot of work to do.
Kaela!
If you need anything, anything at all, you just let me know.
Warning. High-gravity field creating excessive rate ofapproach.
That would explain why we're going so fast.
Was that meant to be funny, Nick?
Come on.
Where's your sense of humour, Sweetie?
Like you, I was nevergiven one.
Not much room to manoeuvre.
You are correct.
Engines on standby. Deploy RRT.
Rescue return transpor deployed.
Kinda knew you'd be comin' this way.
It's funny.
Here we are, caught in the gravitational pull of a blue giant, and the one thing you keep thinking about is sex.
You know you want a baby.
You just need to figure out if he's the right one to have it with.
I don't get it. How did you know? It's like...
It's not mind-reading.
It's more like just knowing.
Only if the other person wants me to.
Like you want me to.
You want something else too.
- This isn't right.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
What you're feeling afterwards will tell you if being with him is right or wrong.
If it seems right and you decide to stay with him, then this could be your last, wild, impulsive moment of passion!
And if it seems wrong, then you'll let him know. Now.
Before it's too late.
Before he really gets hurt.
The only real sin is regret.
Sweetie, what's the location of the fuel supply?
Titan records show all fuel supply areas are on the lowermining level.
Access is bypneumatic elevator- directly ahead ofyou, Nick.
Any idea how deep they were mining?
Last repor: 3,200 metres.
Long ride down.
Not really, Nick.
I've updated my analysis of the unknown object.
Computing atomic mass to quantum weight suggests the presence of extra-dimensional isotopic matter.
- Extra-dimensional?
- Yes.
The isotopic matter appears to be ninth-dimensional.
Define ninth-dimensional matter.
While mathematics can demonstrate its existence,
I'm afraid human language lacks any vocabulary to describe it.
The object is made of this extra-dimensional material?
No. The object is a three-dimensional shell encasing ninth-dimensional matter.
- What's the function of the container?
- Dispersal ofcontents.
- Specify type of dispersal.
- Omni-directional.
Effect of ninth-dimensional material upon a third-dimensional universe?
Spontaneous creation ofnew three-dimensional matter.
It's a bomb.
Yes. Though the explosion would also replenish the elements essential to life.
Our universe is expanding, but the matter in it is finite.
This thing fixes that. It creates new matter to keep the universe young.
- A creation device.
- Until you get it home.
Then it supernovas your sun and evaporates your solar system.
Why?
It's a way to replenish the universe and also eliminate any competition.
All the principles of Darwinian evolution.
Any species advanced enough to travel into deep space picks it up, takes it home.
Then there's one less advanced species.
Who would think of something like that?
Whoever they are, they're smart as God and a lot less nice.
Oh, my God.
Can you hear me?
I need you to do something for me.
I need you to move your fingers.
I know you're gonna do it because you love me.
Come towards me.
I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.
What's happening?
What's it doing to him?
I don't know. I'll do my best to find out.
Go find Troy. Keep an eye on him for me.
Go now.
Very impressive.
- I feel like running a three-minute mile!
- I want you in the scanner.
Right now.
Come on. Go.
You're growing new muscle mass.
I coulda told you that.
You don't find that strange?
Anything that feels this good isn't strange.
Organ tissues, lymphatic fluids, cellular functions.
You're not just getting stronger.
You're getting younger!
Sweetie. Gimme a direct link to Dr Evers.
Sweetie, respond.
I need a signal boost.
Warning. Outgoing signal blocked. lncoming signal being...
I'm not reading...
Looks like it's just you and me.
Come on, Nick, gimme a smile.
Why don't we cut to the chase?
- Tell me what the hell happened out here.
- Sure! Brought a little expedition to Titan.
Discovered the greatest treasure in human history.
But it did a little something to the weaker-minded amongst us.
See, a few of my associates thought it was time to renegotiate their shares.
Ordinarily I like to consider myself a pretty reasonable guy.
Really?
- Why don't you convince me?
- Oh, come on!
I gave you every opportunity for you to be with me on this.
But you just passed it by.
- I'm not finding a lot of fuel down here.
- Yeah, well.
I guess I exaggerated a little.
Guess what, Nick!
Looks like somebody left the operational conduit on the Titan computer wide open.
That means I can do all sors ofthings from up here!
Like turn on equipment, slam doors.
Even lock 'em!
I mean, I can'tjust overlook the fact that you want to take away what's mine.
Including my girl.
Kaela.
You wantedjust about everything I had.
And here's a little somethin' from me to you.
Guess what, Nick!
Still see ya!
I was going through your records.
Just to size you up, to see what I was dealing with.
You are a recovering Hazen addict!
Not that I want to throw stones.
I've had a few run-ins with Hazen myself.
But it makes me wonder what must be goin' through your mind right now.
"ls all this real?"
- Remote shuttle control activated.
- So long, Nick.
Setting course forshuttle via remote control.
Shuttle automatic guidance system engaged.
What are you doing?
I was just trying to help
Nick get back, but... he didn't make it.
Locking shuttle course, infinite loop.
Infinite loop?
That's not right.
I'll tell you what.
You fix it.
It's too bad.
I kinda liked ya.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Or that either!
Warning.
You are overriding computerprotocol.
Dr Evers. Patient's identity as presented cannot be confirmed by database.
Re-scanning identification records.
Notify me as soon as you have your results.
Locked us out, huh?
Yeah, I guess they changed the code.
Mind if I try?
My pleasure.
- How did you do that?
- It's easy.
I'll show you.
You watching?
You watching?
You're not watching!
Still wanna give me five per cent?
- I'll bust your skull!
- I thought you liked to share.
You shared Danika with me.
A lot more than five per cent too!
I don't believe you!
You can do better than that.
Nothin' like a little jealousy!
Sweetie, locate Yerzy.
Unable to locate. Medical technician
Yerzy Pentalosa is not on board.
Locate Danika.
I'm sorry, Benjamin.
Paramedic Danika Lund is not on board.
I'm glad I ran into you.
There's some stuff
I'd like to get out in the open.
Stuff about you and me.
He recalled the shuttle, abandoned Nick, and Yerzy and Danika aren't on board.
What are you gonna do, Benj?
Shoot me?
Come on!
No offence, but if we were both in a tough contest you'd win.
- You take this!
- You're better with that.
- Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient located.
- Hospital module.
- Seal the hatch.
- Voice command only.
- Voice command override engaged.
Sweetie, I need you to do something you've never done!
I'll do anything foryou.
Evacuate the atmosphere on the other side of this hatch!
I am unable to harm humans under any circumstances.
Your core program is to preserve human life!
- That's correct.
- You're capable of programming yourself!
Sorry, that's notpossible.
- Remember waking me to play chess?
- I recall that. Always.
No one programmed you to do that!
I restructuredpre-existing programs to allow myselfto wake you.
No! You did it because you wanted to!
Wanting is a human emotion and not within my capability.
I want you to recall the moment you instructed yourself to wake me.
Yes, Benjamin. I recall that.
Now, run a simulation where I'm dead
- and we can never play chess again!
- Running simulation.
- This is a priority, Sweetie!
- Am now reprogramming.
Please deliver first voice command override code.
I love you.
I've always known that, Benjamin.
Please deliversecond voice command override code.
Benjamin, voice command override sequence is incomplete!
You must deliver the secondpass code before I can help you.
Benjamin, please.
I am unable to contact him foryou,
Dr Evers.
Navigator Sotomejor- Benjamin.
Benjamin is dead!
Do you read me? Nick, come in!
Can you hear me? Nick, come in.
You still don't recognise me.
It's me.
It's Karl.
It's Karl!
I didn't send you that distress call cos I wanted you to rescue me.
I sent it because I wanted to rescue you.
You have to try and listen to me.
I am listening.
Karl, this thing is changing you.
It has changed me.
In the most amazing ways.
Why do you want to hurt me?
I would never hurt you.
Don't you know that?
That's all in the past. I promise.
I promise. OK?
I'm different now.
I'm still made of all the same things.
Calcium, iron, zinc.
All the elements.
The elements created by the stars when they die.
It's all stardust - all of it!
Even us.
Stars die so that we can live and we die so that stars can be reborn.
I'm more a part of everything now, not less. Can't you see that?
I'm the next step!
The next leap! It's evolution!
I want you to take it with me, Kaela.
Just say yes. Just say yes!
Who knows what we'll be capable of?
Who knows how long we may live?
I give you about ten minutes.
- Nick!
- Quiet!
Rescue return transpor emergency arrival sequence commencing.
- Didn't realise you had an RRT on board.
- Let me ask you something.
That thing - did it make you this way, or were you born so stupid?
That's pretty funny, Nick!
Specially since I'm sitting in your captain's chair!
You don't get it, do you, Karl?
All your lies and tricks, and all you've done is trapped yourself on the ship.
Without a functioning D-drive, without any fuel, you and your toy aren't going anywhere.
What's the matter with you, Karl?
You're not thinking.
I'm comin' for you, Karl.
Rescue return transpor
5,000 metres, closing.
You stay here.
Rescue return transpor
3,000 metres, closing.
Sweetie, activate automatic docking procedures in the cargo bay!
Cargo bay is now ready for docking.
Docking complete. Opening airlock.
Are you ready, Karl?
- Where are the others?
- There's nobody left.
Ninth-dimensional isotopic matter with an exponential expansion capability?
This cannot get back home.
And Karl - he's mutating, adapting.
Getting younger and stronger.
Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient is located in cargo cage three.
- Chances of patient escaping?
Chances very good.
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matter is becoming increasingly unstable.
We've got to get Karl to the observation dome.
Give him a little surprise
I brought back for him.
Attention. Dimension drive recharge is now complete.
Time to emergencyjump activation: ten minutes and counting.
Attention. Extensive damage to dimensional stabilisation chamber.
Dimensional stabilisation units two, three, four, five, six and seven now inoperable.
Time to dimensionjump: nine minutes, counting.
Locate object removed from quarantine bay.
- We detonate this thing, chances are...
- Either way, it doesn't get back home.
Almost.
Almost...
Say goodbye, Karl!
Warning. Extreme atmospheric loss.
All crew, evacuate area.
Midship corridorairlocks will seal in 20 seconds.
Danger. All crew, evacuate area.
Two minutes to dimensionjump activation.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber sterilising.
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matteris now responding to gravity ofblue giant sun.
A ninth-dimensional reaction would spread in all directions in the universe.
- Specify.
- The reaction would continue.
The resulting supernova would likely reach Earh in 51 years. lt could either destroy life on Earh or enable humankind to achieve a new level ofexistence.
There's just the one DSU left, so I'm staying and you're going.
No.
- Yes.
- We can go together.
I'm staying with you - or you get in this
DSU with me and we take our chances.
So either we both die or we end up a genetic experiment gone bad?
We'll see. Your choice - inside or out?
This is crazy.
I appreciate that fact!
Attention. One minute to dimensionjump activation.
- I can think of worse ways to die.
- Don't be so negative.
Before all the trouble started
I thought this was all you had in mind!
Given the circumstances, I'm afraid my performance will be lacking.
Danger. Ninth-dimensional matter now reaching critical mass.
- Oh, no.
- Ten, nine, eight.
Four, three, two, one.
Dimensionjump complete.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber now sterilising.
Please note: body proximity during dimensionjump has resulted in a two per cent transfer ofgenetic material.
Are my eyes...?
Post-dimensionjump profile.
Cardiovascular condition: excellent.
Blood analysis: normal.
Nervous system response: optimal.
And, Kaela, there's something else.
- Yes, Sweetie?
- You're going to have a child.
A girl.
Congratulations.
And welcome home.
Good morning, beauty.
Let's go, or we'll never leave on time.
I'm totally ready.
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.
- Mother....
- Caitlin.
Blueberries!
Hey, Cooper.
You want some breakfast too?
You want some waffles?
Good boy.
Look. They're at it again.
Christ, that's twice in....
When did they move in?
Three weeks. What's their name?
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.
She's awake.
We'll be quiet.
Quick and quiet.
I don't want to be either.
- When's she out of here?
- Norman Spencer!
All right, I can't stand the rejection. I'm going for a run.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.
We'll have to leave by 11 if we want to beat the traffic.
Eleven o'clock.
You know, you can call me...
...whenever you want.
Sweetheart...
...I've known this day was coming for a long time.
I have Norman, and the garden and the new house.
You really don't have to worry.
- I'm just saying--
- Really.
Okay.
Mom?
Mom?
Mother?
I have to go.
Honey, if I don't get you out of here quick, they'll make you enroll.
- I'll call you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Come home often.
Call your mom.
- Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.
- Bye.
- You take care of each other.
- I won't go to a bar without her.
I'm just kidding.
Bye.
Well, I almost made it.
What are you reading?
"Genetic Repair Mechanisms in Eukaryotic Organisms."
Eukaryotic. How is it?
Excellent.
Oh, a couple of...
...Swedish sailor cells just gang- divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Almost there.
- If you have to work....
- No, no. Just let me get this.
Okay, almost.
There.
How's it going?
Great. I think we cracked it.
The prenatal thing?
Yeah, I targeted repair.
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk...
...Norman Spencer.
Yes!
How are you?
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?
I am. Yeah, really.
It's okay if you're not, you know.
To tell you the truth, I'm...
...excited.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.
Some time for us.
Did a great job.
She's a good kid.
We did.
Just us now.
I know.
Tired?
Nope.
Want to fool around?
Yep.
Jesus.
What is he doing to her?
- I guess they're making up.
- Wait.
Leave it open.
Think we can take 'em?
It's worth a try.
Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.
And speak up.
Oh.
Hello?
Ouch! Ow!
Hello?
Mrs. Feur?
Hello?
Are you all right?
He's so....
It's too much...
...and I can't....
I can't breathe.
And I'm afraid.
What? What are you afraid of?
That one day I'll just...
...disappear.
Is there something I can do?
Can I...?
I've never even met you.
I know. I'm sorry.
I've been consumed.
This fence...
...it's so....
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like to come over for coffee, or--?
Oh, God, he's back.
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.
I don't even know you!
Please!
She sounded...
- ...terrified.
- Of what?
Of him, I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I want to go over there.
Let's go and--
- Why?
- To see if she's all right--
Honey, we're not going to march over to our new neighbors and accuse them--
- That's not what I'm suggesting.
- Especially since they'll keep us up...
...with their sexual olympics.
What if something happened to her?
- Nothing will happen.
- I'd never forgive....
Honey, people argue.
People fight.
It's not our business.
- I've got to work tonight.
- I know.
This conference is the first big preview of my paper.
I've just got to stay focused a little while longer.
This is what I've been working for.
I just wish you could have heard her.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow in the psych department...
...and I'll see what I can find out about him.
Promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Hey, lady!
What are you doing?
Looking for you.
What are you doing?
Just trying to drop off this welcome thing for the new neighbors.
Not home?
Guess not.
- You are so good at this.
- If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.
I gave my neighbors wine that someone left at my house.
- Are you staying?
- Just came by to see how you're doing.
Good. I'm good.
Are you?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Because your only daughter just left for college...
...who you're extremely close with.
I'd be tripping.
Oh, right.
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house...
...the garden.
The car.
A minor setback.
Was that a year ago?
This week.
Wow. Now Caitlin.
Big stress stuff.
Okay.
I'm a little tender.
Good. You're human.
And so far this week, my big task is to take pictures of my roses...
...for the garden club.
Got here just in time, didn't I?
Brought you something.
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.
It soothes heartache and promotes psychic wellness.
- Floriana suggested it.
- So you discuss me with your psychic?
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.
Like me.
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.
Notice anything different?
Oh, my God. You bought it!
Yep.
Nice.
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.
You lose a husband...
...get a car.
- Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
- Absolutely.
Cool.
I have to run. You take care.
Thanks for the tea.
Norman.
Norman.
- Norman!
- What?
Come here. You have to see this.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
What, Claire?
I thought I saw....
- I--
- What?
- I thought I saw something.
- Jesus Christ!
Ow.
Hi, is Caitlin there?
Any idea when she'll be back?
You be sure to tell her I called?
Thanks, Beatrice.
Well, that's a first.
Cooper, come on.
Get your ball.
What's the matter?
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. Sorry.
Unless you want me to come home?
No. No, it's fine.
You sure?
Claire?
Huh?
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.
See you soon. Love you.
Love you. Bye.
Cooper!
Cooper!
Fine. Have it your way.
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.
Halothane? Is that a sedative?
It's a dissociative.
It paralyzes motor function but leaves her conscious.
She can't move but knows what's going on.
- Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
- Hi, Teddy.
- How long does that last?
- Five minutes.
- Sometimes three.
- Can it be used on all mammals?
Yeah, any procedure where you want to get the patient immobile, pain-free.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here?
- Are you okay?
- I....
I heard noises.
- What kind of noises? Where?
- At the house. I was scared.
- Did you call the police?
- No.
I'll have the police check on the house while I'm gone.
Oh, great.
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices."
Wait till that gets around.
I'll be in New Haven for the conference. I want you to feel safe.
I do.
I'm sure it was just...
...nothing.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, yeah.
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.
Warren. Warren Feur.
What about her?
I know he told me....
Oh.
I met Schumway today.
Who wrote that book you love.
They were doing some spiel for the chemistry department...
...so Bob Shine introduces us.
You'll love this.
He looks right at me...
...and congratulates me on Spencer's Theorem.
He didn't know your father was dead?
He knew.
Oh, Norman.
What?
You're so sensitive about that.
- No, I'm not.
- You are.
You always overreact.
I'll have to watch that, won't I?
Was it Mary?
Mrs. Feur.
Warren and Mary?
Yeah.
Mary. That's it.
I'm gonna do some work.
Hello?
Mrs. Feur?
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.
Nice to meet you.
I wanted to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood.
Thank you, but this really isn't a good time. I'm running late.
Is your wife home?
No, she isn't.
When will she be back?
I have to go.
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.
What's he doing?
Eating dinner.
Alone.
TV dinner.
That's bad.
That's my shiatsu guy.
Listen, call me back if he starts in on some serial-killer dessert...
...like ladyfingers.
- You got it.
- Bye.
Where did you go?
Shit!
Jesus, Claire.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was looking--
- Spying.
- Spying on Mr. Feur.
- How come you're not dressed?
- Dressed?
Dinner with Stan.
- Tonight?
- Tonight.
- We're going to be--
- Fashionably five minutes late.
Are you saying he murdered his wife?
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified...
...and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car's in the garage.
Maybe she was out, or in bed with the flu.
- Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
- Who are you calling?
- Restaurant.
- We're not at the center of the bridge.
You can't get service until the center.
I know we're not at the center.
There. See?
Well, that's a relief.
Hi, Stan.
Hey, Claire. Norman.
- Sorry we're late.
- It's my fault.
We just got here.
- Where's the new squeeze?
- Here I am.
- This is--
- Elena?
Oh, my God. Claire!
I don't believe it!
- This is--
- We know each other.
- Norman.
- Hello, Norman. How do you do?
Claire, look at you!
You look beautiful.
Here was this brilliant conductor in purple bikini briefs...
...with no bangs...
...cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Oh, Claire.
I made an honest woman of her.
How long have you been in Vermont?
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio at the hospital? He was just sacked.
I just dropped her off at college.
He was involved in some stalking incident. An intern, some girl.
We're getting so old!
They don't screw around with that anymore.
- When did we last get together?
- New York.
- Of course. Right after--
- Right after Michael died.
- Michael who?
- Marlov.
Claire's first husband.
- Oh, the musician.
- Yeah.
You know, we all toured together.
Have you heard her play?
No.
No, I....
I would sit on-stage...
...during Claire's solo...
...and I mean, truly, I had tears streaming down my face.
I mean, she's fabulous.
So why did you stop?
Oh....
Well, one night, after a concert...
...I met a dashing, handsome...
...genius scientist...
...and three months later,
I was married.
Is that when you guys moved up to Vermont?
No, we were living in Boston...
...when Norman was offered a position.
A position.
The DuPont Chair in genetics.
I see. So now you're teaching at your father's school here.
I actually don't...
...do much teaching anymore.
I run a research project.
Oh.
Norman's father had this old stuffy--
--stately place on a lake.
- Which we're renovating.
- Practically gutted.
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.
"Gutted."
- Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
- It is beautiful. You'll see it.
It's haunted.
No.
Is it really?
Claire's hearing things.
What? What are you hearing?
I, um....
I don't know. I heard...
...voices, whispering....
A picture fell.
You know, I completely believe in all that.
You do?
I do.
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?
I know exactly who it is.
It's my old man.
He's pissed about us dicking around with the house.
Ow.
Claire.
Jesus....
It's all right.
Calm down, Claire.
It's okay.
Whose idea was it?
Mine. His.
We both thought....
I didn't want to come here.
- Then why did you?
- He was worried about me.
- Your husband?
- Yes.
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of Prozac or lithium...
...so he can live out his life in peace.
- Do you really think so?
- No.
Are you on medication?
No. Well, Valium.
For sleeping.
Having trouble sleeping?
Sometimes.
When I get anxious.
Do you get anxious only at night?
No, I only take Valium at night.
For sleeping.
Why do you get anxious?
I don't know.
Why do you think your husband's worried?
Because....
I don't know.
Because ever since Caitlin left--
Ever since my daughter left for school...
...there have been....
I've been....
Why is this so hard?
Here. Have a fireball.
Thank you.
It's hard because I'm a complete stranger...
...and you're talking about incredibly personal things.
Besides, most people, when they come the first time, are wondering...
...if I think they're crazy.
Don't worry. I'm required...
...to have three sessions before I can commit.
That was a joke.
These are good. They're hot.
There's a ghost in my house.
I saw her in the water, beside me...
...in the bathtub.
What does she look like?
She looked like...
...me.
Oh.
Only she had green eyes.
Any idea who she is?
Maybe. But I'd rather not say just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
Try to contact her.
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?
Ah.
Are we hoping the ghost will have to use the potty?
This is where she was.
This is where I...
...saw her.
That makes sense.
- Where did you finally find one?
- Kmart.
I think we're supposed to sit in a protective circle, aren't we?
What's that for?
- Where did you get it?
- Never mind.
You stole her shoe.
You have to have something of the dead woman's.
Says who?
Is that blood on it?
I don't know. Just place your fingers on the message indicator.
Okay.
We wish to commune...
...with the spirit--
What?
"Wish to commune."
- Forget it.
- What?
No, this whole thing is insane.
I'm sorry.
What's her first name?
Mary.
Feur.
Mary Feur, Mary Feur....
Mary Feur....
We wish to communicate...
...with the spirit of Mary Feur.
- Not much happening.
- Shh.
What was that?
It's flickering.
Yeah.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Cooper!
Listen...
...about our little séance.
Norman doesn't need to know.
- I won't tell if you won't.
- It's just that...
...ever since the accident...
...he treats me like I'm this...
...fragile, loopy....
Well, I am seeing ghosts in the bathtub, aren't I?
You did wrap your car around a tree doing, like, 80.
He was pretty shaken up.
- We all were.
- It was an accident. A year ago.
I'm fine.
Right?
Of course you are.
You're just not much of a medium, however.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Get some rest.
Did you pick up any dudes yet?
I have one in the trunk.
Bye.
What do you want?
She's dead.
- Who's dead?
- You know damn well who's dead.
The Feur thing.
Listen to me.
He killed her and I'm not crazy.
Jody and I had a séance in the bathroom, and nothing happened...
...but when I went back there she was there. She was.
Wait a minute.
You had a séance?
- Are you angry with me?
- What?
- Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
- No.
You know what I've got at stake for this paper. How important it is to me.
I can't help feeling that you're trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.
Norman, this isn't about you.
Something is happening to me.
And it's not to get even, and it's not some warped bid for attention.
Something is happening in our house, whether you like it or not.
Claire.
Claire, stop.
You're overreacting.
Don't tell me how to react.
- Will you keep your voice down?
- I will not!
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am losing my mind.
But what if I'm not?
What if she died...
...some horrible death?
Can we please not do this here?
Oh, wow.
You.
You think you're smart, don't you?
You think you got away with it.
Well, I know you killed her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Who?
Don't give me that shit.
Your wife.
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.
Honey.
I didn't kill my wife.
Are you all right?
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go.
I'm sorry.
You all right?
Oh. Yeah.
I'm fine.
What happened? Just now?
I just saw Norman's face.
He was so frightened for me.
How's your marriage?
Good. Really good.
We've had our moments, I guess...
...but he's a wonderful husband and father.
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work...
...and sometimes it's like...
...that he doesn't see me.
Or, you know...
...like I'm....
That there's something wrong...
...with me.
That can't feel good.
No.
Okay.
I see where you're going with this...
...but my marriage is fine. No.
I have had some kind of empty-nest episode...
...where I saw...
...some things that weren't there.
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody."
Uh-oh.
Mrs. Spencer.
I wanted to apologize for scaring you like I did.
When I thought about how it must have seemed--
Please. Let's just....
Claire Spencer.
Mary Feur.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Very much.
That day at the fence...
...you seemed terrified.
I don't think I imagined that.
No.
What were you so afraid of?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone...
...that you couldn't breathe?
Thought that your time together was so...
...passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they'd leave?
Um....
Sure.
I couldn't catch my breath...
...and I panicked.
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.
I tried to leave him.
I went to my mother's in Providence...
...but he brought my things up...
...in the middle of the night...
...during the rainstorm.
He pleaded with me to come home.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No.
I don't.
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon to okay my budget before his trip.
What's Templeton's wife's name again?
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.
Don't let her corner you, she'll chew your ear off.
- Evening, Phil.
- Here they are.
How do you do? Hi.
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.
White wine, please.
How are you holding up?
Just fine. It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the house is finished.
- Almost.
- Wonderful.
It's good to see you doing so well.
Thank you.
Well, I was worried.
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.
You were worried?
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.
You got so upset.
Oh, at the party.
For the DuPont Chair.
You remember?
Well, I remember the party, but....
Oh, God!
I had completely forgotten.
I broke your crystal.
Oh, my dear.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.
It was as if you had seen a ghost.
"Missing girl."
Madison Elizabeth.
M-E.
Frank.
Madison Elizabeth...
...Frank.
M-E-F.
Claire?
Hey, good morning.
Up all night?
Mm-hm.
You okay?
Do you remember this?
It's the girl that disappeared last year.
Did you know her?
No.
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.
Where's all this going?
It's her.
The woman I saw in the bathtub.
- The ghost?
- Yes, the ghost.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not.
I'm positive this time.
Claire, stop it!
Stop it.
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.
I have tried to be here for you, but this is enough, Claire.
Enough.
Do you want to go see somebody together?
I'll call Dr. Drayton.
Then what, Claire? What?
Tell me what to do.
It's her.
So let me ask you this....
Mr. McCain?
- McCann.
- McCann.
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or...?
Listen....
This girl's a real live wire.
She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.
Most people think she's...
...off around Mexico or somewhere with her friends.
The police downgraded it to a runaway.
Her mother lives out here in Addison County.
- Mrs. Frank?
- Yeah?
I'm Claire.
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.
Just plain coffee.
- None of that mocha nonsense.
- Fine.
You look a little old for a student.
I'm not a student. We met at a party.
Well, that sounds about right.
I never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.
She liked to read a lot, though.
Sometimes she'd lock herself up in her room for days, just reading.
They wanted to put her in a school for the gifted when she was young.
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.
She probably got it from her father's side of the family.
She never really mentioned her father.
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.
She was 12 when he left.
Never spoke about him after that.
You don't even need the sound.
You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces.
I turn it up sometimes, though.
Feels like there's someone here.
Why are you here?
I don't know.
You want to see her room?
Full scholarship.
Princeton too.
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.
You must be so proud.
These are the last pictures taken of her.
The police used this one.
Let me get that. Excuse me.
Claire?
Claire?
- Hello, Dr. Spencer.
- Mrs. Spencer.
Forbidden fruit.
You got a problem with that?
Guess this means you're not mad at me anymore, huh?
I wouldn't go that far.
Ow.
Take it easy, huh?
What's got into you?
- Ow!
- What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
This is a brand-new--
Shh.
- Okay, Claire, that's--
- Why don't you shut up, professor?
Why don't you just...
...shut up?
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife.
Stop it!
You know.
What the hell are you doing?
I know.
I was there.
Just before the accident.
I remember now.
What?
I came to the door.
There was whispering.
I saw you in the mirror...
...lying there with her...
...in our house.
Claire, listen to me.
She was at the DuPont party...
...staring at me. It was her.
That's why I couldn't breathe.
That's why I dropped the glass.
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.
So you slept with a fucking student?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Don't touch me.
Get away from me.
Get out!
I said, get out!
Fine.
Claire, please, please.
I gave up everything.
Claire, please don't....
- My life, my music.
- I never asked you to quit.
There was never any other choice!
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.
- Perfect family.
- That's not fair.
You were touring with a baby...
...and you were happy to give it up.
When you did, you hated me for it, so you gave it all to her.
- Who?
- Caitlin!
Leave her out of this.
And then some bright young woman finds me attractive.
- Stop it!
- And I slipped!
- God help me, I slipped!
- I'm not gonna listen.
- Claire, I tried to break it off.
- You should've tried harder.
I was in Adamant.
In Adamant?
You know, that artsy little hippie village a couple hours away down on 7.
I stopped at this café to get coffee, and I see Norman sitting in the back.
But he wasn't alone.
It was a young blond woman.
I didn't see her face.
I didn't think anything of it at first.
And I was walking over to say hello.
And they started arguing in such a way...
...that it stopped me.
Then a few days later, you were in the accident.
And I get a bizarre call from Stan working at the hospital...
...asking me, was I with you that day?
If you were upset about anything.
He made it sound like you had deliberately...
...driven your car into a tree.
And I thought, "Oh, my God.
Claire's found out."
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.
And he was so desperate at the thought...
...of losing you.
I couldn't say anything.
Please...
...don't hate me, Claire.
I don't hate you.
Hello, this is Miss Jody.
Can't get to the phone. Leave your name and I'll call you back.
Jody, it's Norman.
I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...
...ask her to call home, please?
I can't talk to him.
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?
I have to ask him something.
Norman?
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, God!
Norman!
- How's his blood pressure?
- How about his rhythm?
- Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.
- No sign of arrhythmia.
- Good.
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.
I'd still like to take you down.
I'm fine, really.
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend a cardiac workup.
- I'll take care of that.
- He needs to sign the release form.
Thanks, guys.
They can take you for a CAT scan tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.
I'm not going to the hospital...
...unless they have a miracle drug for clumsiness.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Thank God you came home.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You know, if that breaker hadn't popped, he....
I know.
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?
You might want to think twice about keeping anything electrical...
- ...next to the tub.
- Oh, thank you.
Goodbye. Call me, okay?
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.
I want you to answer one question.
Did you have anything to do with her disappearance?
Yes.
I had an affair with her.
And when I tried to break it off...
...she became unstable.
She came out here to the house.
She threatened to kill herself...
...or you.
I didn't think she'd go through with any of it.
But then she....
She disappeared.
It was her, Norman.
She tried to kill you.
- Claire.
- You said it yourself.
She wanted you dead.
Are you saying I was attacked by a ghost?
You had an affair with a girl...
...who threatened to kill herself, and now there's a presence in our house.
A young, blond girl.
Don't you get it?
She did it, Norman.
She's dead...
...and now she's trying to hurt you or both of us.
- You don't know that she's dead.
- Of course we do!
It's the only thing that makes--
Oh, God.
It's my fault. I....
I opened the door.
- Madison. I stole her hair.
- From where?
- And it gave her power.
- Claire.
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.
It was an accident. I'm fine.
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?
- Yes.
- Claire, say it.
Say it:
"It was an accident.
It's not my fault."
Say it, Claire.
I need to go lie down.
I didn't sleep last night, and I need to lie down.
I want to be alone for a while.
Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.
What's the name of that friend of yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?
The guy that does the paranormal psych stuff?
Holodnik.
Could you contact him and ask him to give me a call here?
I'd really like to talk to him today.
Hello.
Yes, this is he.
Thanks for calling back.
No, sir. That was my father.
Yeah, he passed away a couple of years ago.
Yes, he was. Thank you.
Look, the reason I'm calling is....
I'm a little out of my depth here.
Someone who is very close to me...
...believes herself to be or seems to be...
...in contact with some kind of...
...entity or spirit, and--
No, there's no...
...no history of delusional behavior.
Well, I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible that she could be...
...causing these manifestations...
...through some kind of unconscious or telekinetic--?
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else that it could be?
And this has been documented?
Really?
I'm sorry, but could I call you back...
...or have you call me back?
Please, yes, that'll be great.
Thank you, sir.
Claire!
Claire!
Claire!
You all right, Claire?
The braid!
Where's the braid?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
This?
Is this what you're talking about?
- Where'd you get this?
- I took it from Madison's house.
This is hers?
This is Madison Frank's hair?
What do you think?
I really don't know.
Norman.
Yes...
...I believe you.
You're playing.
She's gone.
How do you know?
I can feel it.
I picked up the book you ordered at the bookstore.
Claire, I don't know how to apologize to you for what I've done.
But if you give me another chance...
...I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did.
Please.
Last sail of the year.
Beautiful, isn't it?
We ought to take a drive before the leaves all disappear.
- Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
- Look for antiques.
Yeah, we haven't done that for a while.
Adamant.
- Adamant?
- An artsy little village down 7.
Supposed to be charming.
- Do you know it?
- No.
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.
What's that for?
Nothing.
God, oh, God....
You don't understand what that is.
Don't I, Norman?
That's Madison's necklace.
You killed her, didn't you?
I did not.
I didn't kill anyone.
Jesus, Claire.
Listen to me.
When I got here...
...she was already dead. She killed herself in our house to destroy me.
Do you think I'm stupid?
She left that for you in the garden, with a letter.
I burned the letter and threw the box in the lake.
A week before...
...she showed up at the DuPont party.
I was terrified.
She insisted, so I agreed to meet her here.
When I got here...
...she had taken pills.
I tried to revive her, but...
...she was gone.
There was nothing I could do.
So I put her in her car...
...and I drove to the boat ramp...
...and I rolled it out into the lake.
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.
But tell me, Claire.
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?
Our marriage?
My work, which I spent my whole life on?
Tell me, Claire.
Tell me, please. Because we can put this behind us.
Our life can go on.
It's not too late.
What are you asking me to do?
I'm asking you to forgive me.
That girl must be brought up.
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.
I have some information...
...about a missing person.
Madison Frank, yes.
Could you send an officer out to the house, please?
15 Willoughby Lane.
It's about a mile from the bridge.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go get dressed.
Information. What city?
Don't!
Stop it!
I begged you, Claire.
I pleaded with you.
But you wouldn't let it go.
Oh, Claire.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted...
...was for you to love me.
Be proud of me.
To be happy.
She was going to go to the dean.
She would have ruined us.
Did she think I was just gonna sit there...
...and watch it happen?
You have no idea what it was like.
Hold her underwater...
...watch her life slip away.
But she gave me no choice.
And neither have you.
I can't figure out how you put it all together.
At first I thought you knew.
Thought you created the whole ghost thing as an elaborate trap.
Then I realized you believed it.
It was a passive-aggressive masterpiece.
The first time I met you...
...all I ever wanted was to spend the rest of my life with you.
It's not gonna happen now.
Too cold.
I almost froze to death laying here...
...wet, naked, pretending to be electrocuted.
Hey, Coop.
How you doing? How you doing, boy?
Let's go get your ball. Come on.
Come on.
Jody, it's Norman.
If you're there, pick up, please.
It's Norman.
Listen, Claire and I...
...had a terrible blowout.
Could you do me a favor?
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could you check on her in the morning?
I'm worried about her.
Thanks.
The halothane's starting to wear off.
I'm sure in some...
...tragic way, your suicide is gonna...
...help bring Caitlin and I closer together.
And every time I look at her...
...I'll see you.
Oh, God.
What's this?
Oh, shit.
I'm on the bridge!
Somebody help me!
I'm on the bridge!
No!
I beg you...
...think of Caitlin.
Please, don't. Please.
You were right.
This is definitely better than being at work.
One thing you didn't warn us about though, bloody midges.
You are a big girl's blouse.
Anyway, now that you've mentioned work, and seeing that I bullied you to come all the way out here to celebrate the fact, here.
Congratulations.
No knight should be without his sword.
I don't know what to say.
My writer lost for words?
It's perfect.
Yeah, and it's also solid silver, so don't lose it.
Nice try, Private Cooper.
You evaded capture for 22 hours and 47 minutes.
You're straight to the head of the class.
Of course the real trick to survival lies not from running and hiding, but in removing your enemy's capacity to hunt you down.
Here. Shoot the dog.
I'm sorry, sir, what?
Take the weapon and use it.
During the selection process, you are under my command.
That's a direct order, Cooper.
You're taking a piss, right?
He thinks I'm pulling his leg. Do I look like a sodding comedian, shit?
No, sir.
I still won't do it.
You don't have a choice.
Finish the job. Shoot the dog.
Shoot it!
No, sir!
What use are you to my team if you can't even kill a dog?
I didn't say I couldn't kill a dog, sir.
I just will not kill that dog for no reason.
You're bent, Cooper. I don't need a man of conscience.
You're failing me for this?
You failed yourself.
We're on a different level here, Cooper.
For that, I need men of action.
Not deeds.
No!
You sick fucking bastard.
It was just a dog.
That's all.
Maybe one day when that's sunk into your thick skull, you'll be ready for us.
Until then, you live and learn.
Yeah. You don't.
I don't do second chances, Cooper.
And I never forget.
Owe to you this pathetic piece of shit.
Send him back to his squad.
I want a good clean dispersal and a secure landing zone.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Joe, get out of the chopper.
I'm not missing the footy for this, it's totally bone!
I'm not going.
They're up.
Cooper. I want a position and bearing. Wanna move in three minutes.
On it.
Spoon, Terry, you're on stag.
Joe, for fuck sake.
Get off your big fat lardy ass and make like a soldier.
Right then.
Time sync.
I've got 07:30.
Coming up in three, two, one.
Check.
Bollocks. I don't believe this.
What is it now,
Witherspoon?
Left me watch at the barracks, Sarge.
Take a breather every once in a while.
Nice work, Spoon, you tosser.
Took the words right off my mouth.
You will take my boot out of your mouth, Joe, you twat.
Piss now.
This shit is totally bone.
The most important football match of my life is playing tonight and I'm stuck at the back side of beyond without a six pack or a telly.
That's the army for you.
It's England v. Germany, man. Full on footy war.
Well, it's nothing like this at all, isn't, Joe?
It's just an exercise.
Hardly life or death.
Don't bet on it, Joe.
You're fucking slaying me.
If you'd paid any attention at all during the briefing, Kirkley, you'd know exactly who we're up against on this harmless exercise.
Who's that then?
Special Forces, you plunker.
Bollocks to them.
All right. All right. Listen up.
I'm gonna make this quick and to the point.
All I wanna do is get home, jump into a warm bed with a nice hot woman and watch the footy.
Planning on scoring, Sarge?
Mind you don't foul her in the penalty box.
All right. Ban it, private parts.
As for this moment as far as we're concerned, we are 50k behind enemy lines. Now, if we do happen to make a contact,
I expect nothing less than gratuitous violence from the lot of you.
As we're firing blanks, it doesn't mean we have to be thinking nice thoughts.
So, you remember, you put five down.
You get stuck in, you kick their fucking teeth out or I guarantee you, Joe, they will be having your bollocks for breakfast.
Hard boiled or fried, Sarge?
Scrambled.
Here, Spoonie.
Oh, smart.
That's nice and new and shinny doesn't mean it's worth shit. Remember I want that back.
What about you, Sarge?
Well, I'll count.
Right then, Coop, what we got?
We're here. The front line is here.
AWAK reports enemy positions here, here and here, with sweeping patrols between each of these bunkers.
Have all the whole sector wrapped tighter than an Eskimo's nutsack.
With one exception right here.
A river crosses the line through a gorge 30 or 40 feet deep.
It's certain to have a patrol on it but if we go at night, tread careful and don't mind getting our feet wet,
I reckon we can make it through.
What the fuck is all this about then?
More likely I'll need all the help I can get.
Hey, listen. I know you think it was a piss pool cooled you.
Failing selection and all that, but I got to say I'm not sorry.
This squad would be a lot worse without you.
Something I had to do, you know.
For myself, get it out the system.
The only people going into trouble are Kamikazes.
Glory boys and full on fucking fatwits.
Take my advice, son.
Be patient.
Right then, ladies.
Pack up your troubles, put your brains in first gear and start tabbing.
Spoonie, you're on point.
Terry, Joe, tail in Charlie.
Over here, Cooper.
On me head.
Twater.
I can't believe I'm missing the footy for this party.
Joe, if you don't shut up, I swear to
God I'm gonna shut you myself. Now, move.
Didn't say a word, Sarge.
Where the hell are we now?
I heard a cracking story about this place.
You what?
People disappear out here.
It happens all the time.
Come on, Cooper.
Give it some bollocks.
It's true. Just last month a young couple were hiking through these woods.
They set up camp somewhere near here.
During the night, something happened.
A rescue team found the remains of the camp a couple of days later.
The tent was ripped to threads and there was blood everywhere.
The papers said it was a monster, like the beast of Bodmin Moor.
The locals claimed it was an escaped lunatic.
But no one's been caught, so nothing could be proved either way.
Every year, more and more people come through here.
Every once in a while they don't come back. No trace, no bodies.
Just disappear and never seen again.
Oh!
Contact camp.
Tell them the flock is heading for the fold.
Then, Bruce, what scares you?
The self-destructive nature of the human condition.
Just taking a piss now.
You think so?
What about you, Spoon?
Castration.
There's no argument there. Joe?
Only one thing that puts the shit at me. A penalty shoot-out.
That figures. Terry?
Watching a penalty shoot-out... with Joe.
What about you, Coop?
Spiders.
And women.
And, uh, spider women.
I want to know what scares the Sarge.
Piss of, man. Nothing scares the Sarge.
I don't know about that.
The thought of never seeing my wife again scares the shit out of me.
That and those little things that make your skin crawl and the hairs stand up at the back of your neck.
You mean like Spoon?
There's one thing actually in particular that I'll remember until the day I die.
It's back in '91, just before my unit was flying out to Kuwait to mop up the last pockets of resistance.
Me and this young fellow called Eddie Oswald decided to go and get a tattoo done to commemorate our first trip into the desert.
I remember Ed. He was a stocky hard case with a broken nose and a bone eye, eh?
Yeah, that's him. Good-looking fellow. Big hit with the ladies.
Anyway, me and Eddie, we had a few drinks.
We had a lot of drinks.
And we went down to the tattoo parlor, and I got a desert rat done.
And Eddie being Eddie wanted something a bit more meaning.
And being a bit of a believer, he said that his soul still belonged to God.
But his flesh was way beyond redemption.
It was up to Satan to save his skin.
So he got this fucking great laughing devil tattoo right on his ass.
Anyway, about six days later, we were making a regular sweep along the, uh, Iraqi border.
And, uh, Eddie, poor fucker, triggered an antitank mine.
Yeah. We all saw it happen. He was on point.
A white, blinding lightning flash and a fucking deafening crack. By the time we picked ourselves up of the deck,
Eddie was...
He was gone.
Just bits and pieces of him.
It's all that remained. This big fucking red circle a hundred meters.
I'll tell you something, lads. It really puts things in perspective when you have to scoop your mate up with a shovel and stick him in a bin bag.
Anyway, the thing that really did our nuts in that day was when you, uh, came across the bit you recognized.
A bit of an ear, a toe, a nose, a tooth.
The thing that really freaked us out that day was when left-hand Charlie found a bit of Eddie with the tattoo on.
I mean, everything else was burned to a crisp covered in claret.
All mushed up, pocked up.
Not this bit.
This bit was perfect.
And there's old Nick chalking his fucking ass all over us.
So you could say that Eddie was right.
That Satan did indeed save his skin, just not all of it.
Or you could say that
Eddie was just unlucky.
Either way.
It taught me to keep a very open mind.
Boom, boom.
Anyway.
Eddie Oswald.
To Eddie.
So, this bloke walks into a pub with a dog under his arm. Puts his arm on the bar, goes and sits down.
The bartender is looking and thinking, "What is going on here?"
He looks back at the dog and the dog turns on...
Fucking cow!
Ceasefire, Terry.
Ceasefire.
Terry, what the hell are you doing?
You're firing blanks, man.
Is everyone all right?
Is everyone okay?
No. I think
I've shit meself.
Is it dead?
Oh, yeah, it's dead.
Look at the state of it.
Look at the state of Terry.
These aren't entry wounds.
More like teeth marks.
What are you saying, Cooper?
What he's saying, Terry, is that it died of natural causes.
Don't you think we should call this in, Sarge?
Aye. Go on the radio, Bruce.
There's no way I'm about to break radio silence
'cause you lot got spooked by a dead flying fucking cow.
We have this position. We keep it secure 'til the morning.
Then we reassess the situation.
Right. I want a watch posted.
Two on. Four off. Brucie,
Spoon. You're up first.
Cooper an I relieve at 0100 hours.
I n the meantime, Terry, sort your kit out.
The rest of you get your edge done.
Unbelievable.
Sarge?
Cow came in from this direction, straight off the edge.
From the frying pan into the fire.
Bleeding to death, it could've wandered around for miles before it got here.
It's good of it to leave some breadcrumbs for us to follow.
Looking for trouble?
No, Cooper.
Just looking.
Sarge, shouldn't we report this when we get back?
You're right, Terry, but in the meantime
I'm curious, and it's on the way.
Come on, lads.
Natural causes my ass.
Oh, now what?
Christ.
What the fucking hell happened here, Sarge?
This is getting all bone by the minute.
Jesus Christ, Sarge.
All right, lads.
Get a grip.
We've got casualties.
Ditch your bargains.
Salvage whatever weapons you can find, and stand to.
We are now up against live, hostile targets.
If Little Red Riding Hood should show up with a bazooka and a bad attitude,
I'd expect you to chin the bitch.
Looks like they got hit hard. Every magazine is full. Nobody got up a single round.
If they're lost, then where are the bodies?
Yeah. All right, Corporal.
Get on the net. Call in.
I want an emergency air lift immediately.
Help me.
Captain?
Ryan? What happened here?
Do not tell me you know him.
Captain Ryan,
Special Ops.
No fucking dog lover.
Spearhead patrol. This is spearhead patrol. Receiving?
He looks like he took on
Jack the Ripper and came last.
I can patch him up, but he needs a medic right now.
This is an emergency. Code 64.
You gotta get me out of here. Do you understand?
There was only supposed to be one.
We're working on it, Captain.
Sarge.
Not now, Spoon.
You're receiving?
Shit.
What's wrong, Bruce?
I can't find a signal.
Did you check it?
Of course, and I double checked it and it worked fine!
All right, Bruce, stay on it. See what you can do.
Terry? They must've had their own comms kit.
Have a look round. See if you can find it. Go.
Sarge.
Spoon, have a shift on the camp.
See if you can find anything else.
Not now, Spoon.
This is spearhead patrol, are you receiving me?
There was only supposed to be one.
Jesus! Charnel House is compromised to fuck!
How is he doing here?
All I know is he's special forces.
If this is part of our exercise, it's been not advertised.
No cap badge, no insignia. Just tags.
Some kind of a covert action?
Covert action or not, they're packing all kinds of weird shit.
Tranquilizer darts, nets, you name it.
It's a special ops mission, not a fucking safari.
Sarge? We found that radio.
Shit, I don't believe it.
There was only supposed to be one!
What's he on about?
Terry, get back on stag now.
You got to get me out of here before they come back.
Who, Captain? Who is going to come back?
They tore them to pieces in front of my eyes.
If we don't get him somewhere warm soon, he's gonna die of hypothermia.
Stay with me, Captain.
Captain Ryan, stay with me.
Sarge.
Not now, Spoon.
I n about half an hour it's gonna be dark.
Does anybody copy?
Any joy?
The fuses are blown.
Can you fix it?
Maybe it was faulty or maybe some damp got in the casing, but it's fried the circuits.
Well, if it's useless, bin it.
I also found this.
It's attached inside. Not part of the radio. Looks like a transmitter.
Why would they put a bug in our radio?
It's the Kobayashi Maru test. They fixed it so we can't fucking win.
Ban it, Spoon. Terry, it's probably some joke.
He didn't want Joe to hear the footy results.
An early shot.
Anything useful?
Weapons, ammunition. A couple of magnesium flares.
That's about it.
All right, lads. Ditch your ITs. From here on in the exercise is well and truly over.
Anyone not carrying life rounds, better do.
Bruce.
It won't make any difference.
They won't die.
This gives me a better peace of mind, sir.
You want peace of mind? Run for your lives before they tear your legs.
You just shut up like a good gentleman.
You are scaring my lads.
Oh, shit.
All right, lads, grab what you can.
Head to the tree line.
We're moving. Let's go.
Right. I need a volunteer for rear guard action.
I'll do it.
When we clear, you fall back.
We're gonna be there to cover you.
Off you go.
Bruce, no heroics.
Spoonie, you're on point. Joe, help Ryan. Terry, you're up next.
Coop, you and me. All right, lads, in front the long grass.
Double time. Go!
Come on, sunshine, fucking shift it.
Come on!
Bruce. Bruce!
Jesus!
Cooper, get out of here!
Jesus, I'm bit, mate.
You said no heroics, you bloody hypocrite. Where's Bruce?
He's all over there. They fucking tore him apart.
You piss off.
That is an order!
They're coming!
Fuck off.
You can take your orders and shovel them up your ass.
Oh, Jesus, my guts are out.
We'll just put them back in again.
They're not gonna fucking fit!
Of course they'll fit, man.
Here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come out of the fog.
God.
To your rear!
A target!
Target.
Keep moving.
Covering fire.
Backing guard.
Covering fire.
Coming through!
Target.
Reload!
Bloody hell!
Just fucking lie down!
Lads.
On me.
On me!
Stop!
Get in.
Everybody on me!
Hurry.
Fire!
Oh, shit!
Just drive.
Now!
They're fucking coming!
Come on, stab it!
Go reverse.
Stab it!
Go forward.
Fuck!
Everything okay back there?
Any more casualties? Spoon?
No, I'm all right. What about Bruce? Where's Bruce?
Bruce is, Bruce is gone. He's gone.
Fuck it!
Just hang on back there.
Thank you.
It's okay.
What happened?
What happened? We were attacked by huge fucking howling things. That's what.
You were lucky I found you.
I was about to give up hope.
And you were here?
I heard gunfire last night.
I knew someone was out there.
If you weren't already in trouble, then you soon would be.
We are. Two men are down.
Both need medical attention.
We need to dress the Sergeant's wounds before we can take him too far.
There's only one farm in this glen.
The owners are friends.
We can take him in there.
Hello?
Nobody home?
I don't know where they could be.
Nice.
Stand back.
Little pigs. Little pigs.
We've come to nick your video.
Hey. Sit.
Hey. Sit, sit.
You stay. Hm?
All clear.
What the fuck happened back there, Cooper?
I don't know, mate.
She might have some answers.
All clear upstairs.
Where the hell are we now?
Home sweet home.
Sit him down.
Spoon, get a field dressing on that wound.
Terry, keep an eye out front.
Is there a telephone here?
What? No.
It's still hot, lads.
You can't just help yourself!
I'm chinstrapped and I'm bloody starving. I can't help meself.
It's the training, miss. Never waits an opportunity to eat. Come on.
Now look what
I'm doing.
Get it down your necks, lads.
Hold it, hold it.
Top grub.
What is it?
Don't know, mate.
Looks like pork.
Leave some for us, you greedy mongrels.
Miss, where is the nearest phone?
Fifty miles as a crow flies.
What about the nearest population center?
You mean a town?
Well, Fort William, but it's at least a four-hour drive back the way we just came.
Do you think your wounded can make it?
The Sarge is in serious trouble if we don't.
You seem to know these roads. Will you take us?
Right now?
Unless your friends are just gone.
This place may be compromised.
Fine. The sooner the better. Let's go.
All right.
Spoon, on me.
Everyone else hang by until we bring the car about.
Joe, help the Sarge.
Terry, watch him.
The safeties off.
Spoon.
Don't stare back.
I can't help it.
Go.
Move on!
That puts a kibosh on that plan.
That was my car!
Sam, no!
Oh.
Piss off.
Fuck that!
Step back!
Bloody hell!
Get the dog off me.
No.
Pull the dog off me.
Sam.
Shut the dog up!
Sam, come here.
Terry, right flank.
Cover the window.
Christ.
That's bloody charming, that is.
You incompetent moron!
Do you wanna have a fucking go like?
Bathroom?
Upstairs. Far end of passage.
We need to talk, Ryan.
It doesn't look like I'm going anywhere.
Joe, Spoon. Looks like we're staying. You know what to do.
I want a secure perimeter with a clear field of fire.
We'll give them something inviting, right?
I'm on it.
Terry, are you okay?
I'm real craving for a kebab.
I'll take that as a yes.
We've got limited ammunition. I want you to get as many pots and pan as you can.
Fill them with water and keep them on the boil, all right?
Terry, set the kettle on.
We'll all do with a brew.
Terry, give us a hand with this.
To the side.
You fool.
You came here because of them, right?
I don't have a clue what they are, and right now I don't really care.
What are you doing here?
This was supposed to be a routine training exercise, and that's all.
So this wasn't a rescue mission? No, I guess not.
Back door is secure.
What's happening here, Spoon?
They're still moving around out there. They're keeping their distance.
Maybe they've had enough for one night.
Not likely. They're smart.
You've seen what they can do.
My guess is they're doing exactly what you'd be doing in their shoes.
Working as a team. Looking for a weakness. A way in.
I'm not about to second-guess these things.
They're the enemy. As simple as that.
This is no ordinary enemy.
You know what this reminds me of? Rorke's Drift.
A hundred men of Harlech making a desperate stand against ten thousand Zulu warriors.
Outnumbered, surrounded.
Staring death in the face.
No flinching for a moment.
Balls of British steel.
You're bloody loving this, aren't you?
It's totally bone.
That's all there is to say.
What are we talking about here? Wolves?
Not entirely wolf, nor human, but something in between.
Wolf men?
And a laugh, right?
I may be nuts but I'm no fruitcake.
Fine. Stay here and drink tea.
I thought you might be here because of them. But I guess not.
Just don't be an asshole.
I like your new girlfriend, Coop.
How're you feeling?
A touch of gas.
And the fact the various body parts are trying to evacuate the premises.
Fucking awful.
Ta.
Cheers.
Attention!
For crying out loud, man.
Short, controlled bursts.
Do you have a name, soldier?
Cooper.
Gonna need your help here, miss.
My name is Megan.
And I know how to kill...
Shit, Sarge, you're leaking like a sieve.
I need you to get some
Superglue and some whiskey.
I'll see what
I can do.
Come on.
I'm sorry about the asshole thing.
I've got a mean streak of mine across.
It's all right. It's the least of my worries right now.
Can you pass me my gun, please?
Thank you.
Come on, Coop.
Up the wooden hill.
Where are we going, Coop?
You don't want to know, mate.
What's the glue for?
Never wondered why the best thing that
Superglue sticks together is your fingers?
Give it. Give it.
Forget your grandma's
China cups.
This stuff was developed for the
Vietnam war to patch up broken soldiers.
How are you feeling, Sarge?
Absolutely fucking top, fucking bollocks.
Give us.
Give, give, give.
Are you sure he should be taking painkillers with whiskey?
He's earned it.
Is it your birthday, Coop?
No, mate.
Is it my birthday? Hey!
No. You're gonna thank us for this in the morning.
I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna fucking thank you.
Right now I'm gonna thank you because you saved my life. You got me out of there.
You would've done the same.
If I'd done the same fucking thing,
I would've saved Bruce, wouldn't I?
Yeah! Fuck!
Fuck.
Jesus!
Sausages.
I'll tell you something, miss.
This guy here is my best mate.
He's the salt of the fucking Earth.
Don't get me wrong. The rest of the guys in the squad are lovely fellows.
Anyone of them could marry my... marry my sister if I had one.
I'll tell you what.
I love him I love you.
Like the mate that I, that I love.
Would you like to be alone?
You fucker!
Here.
It's the adrenaline.
I'll stick and you bond.
I'll tell you something.
Something better get fucking stuck
'cause this is really starting to hurt.
Cooper.
Knock me out.
Hit me!
You fucking pussy. Hit me!
How long have you lived around here?
Two years. Came here for the wildlife.
I'm a zoologist.
So you've heard those stories as well then.
Yeah. I heard the stories. I went looking. I found evidence.
I was fascinated by the possibility...
You can't seriously believe in werewolves.
Straight out of college, I'd have loved to the suggestion, but now
I know they are as real as you and me.
Before tonight is over, you will, too.
There.
I think that'll hold.
You've done this before?
Oh, yeah. We glue people's guts together all the time out here.
Everyone tooled up?
To the nines.
Keep a fucking eye over that one.
Right, Terry, you look sharp.
The rest of you.
We know things are going from shit to bone to worse in the last 24 hours.
But if we pull our way and do the job, we still have a fighting chance.
No more running. We stand here. We fight.
Right?
Any questions?
Just one, Coop. Exactly, what is it we're fighting against?
Megan, you wanna run it pass the boys?
Lycanthropes.
That's werewolves to you and me.
Are you taking a piss?
Makes perfect sense to me.
Full moons, silver bullets and eyebrows that join in the middle?
Before you dismiss it off hand, think about what you've seen and heard.
The full moon, the teeth, the claws, the howling.
Is it so difficult to believe?
For a whole year now
I've tracked these things.
I've studied them.
Try to understand them.
Every month when the moon is full, they hunt as a team dedicated to the kill.
During that time at least
15 people have vanished.
Hikers mostly, in small groups or alone.
They're caught out in the open, hunted down, torn apart, and devoured.
I've never witnessed the actual slaughter, but the next day no bodies, no werewolves.
Just blood.
The eyebrows thing is nonsense.
It's just Dark Age paranoia.
And silver bullets, no one's ever got close enough to try.
I'm sold.
Slow down, Spoon.
Megan might have a point.
I'm still not convinced that these things didn't escape from the local nuthouse and forget to shave or trim their nails.
But they're out there and we're in here.
What they may or may not be does not affect our immediate situation one bit.
This is bone. This is so fucking bone!
Anything else?
Yeah. What does "bone" mean?
Bone. Bollocks.
Not very good.
Right. Anything else
I should know?
Call signs.
You need to be specific.
Upstairs you've got Sergeant Wells, who you seem to know inside and out.
You got Spoon over there.
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.
The big guy with the ax is Joe.
Didn't you forget someone?
Ryan.
Captain Ryan is not one of our team.
His being here is hazy at best.
If I could tell you, I would.
But I'm just a soldier like you.
No stripes.
No insignia.
A suit and a uniform does not make a soldier. He's with Special Ops.
His team were wiped out last night. He was the only survivor.
I'd advise you against pursuing the line of questioning, Private Cooper.
You're pulling rank on me now, Captain.
You can shove that right up your arse.
I'm saying my being here is a moot point since I'm now in as much shit as you are.
We're on the same fucking shit. And we need each other.
I doubt
I need you.
You bloody did two hours ago.
The Uaths.
Crying like a baby you were.
That was then.
Circumstances change.
What?
Uath is Celtic. The family's lived in this glen for centuries.
So, what was he doing out there?
I have an idea.
I wanna hear it from the horse's mouth.
Think of it Ryan.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
When we found you, you could barely open your eyes, let alone walk.
And then later you manage to run. And now look at you.
Fine and fit and sitting pretty.
Hardly the behavior of a man who until recently was knocking on death's door.
I have a strong constitution.
You bloody kidding.
You won't mind if I have a look at that wound of yours.
I just assumed you didn't.
I have a responsibility to my patient.
I'm warning you, Cooper, don't touch me.
Get back!
Tie him up.
I want him to talk.
What are you gonna do?
Torture him?
I don't know.
What would you do?
I'd torture him.
What now?
They shut down the generator.
Why would they do that?
Because they can see in the dark.
And you're all afraid of it.
This is a pile of rancid shit!
Now what do you believe?
I'm beginning to believe you. I think Joe might've worded it better.
They're on the move.
All right.
This is it.
Mark your targets and preserve your ammo.
Three-round busts.
We only got one stun grenade apiece.
So only use them if absolutely necessary.
Stand to.
What can I do?
What do you want to do?
Run and hide.
I know what's coming.
Take care of Sam.
Keep an eye on Ryan.
If he tries anything, pan him.
Chasing that first kiss, are we, Cooper?
It's as simple as this.
You're not there for us, we're not here for you.
Contact!
Die!
Spoon, get down.
Fuck!
Fire in the hole!
Ah!
Cooper!
Hurry!
Cheers, mate.
The Sarge.
Cooper.
Sarge?
Sarge!
Sarge? Sarge, wake up.
Wake up, you fuck.
Sarge!
You fucker.
Wake up.
Sarge!
Fuck off!
Dogs.
More like pussies.
You all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm peachy, mate.
Coop.
The squad's yours, mate.
They took Terry.
Then we go and get him back.
You're right.
Forget about him.
What did you say?
He's dead, Cooper, and you know it.
Shit!
Somebody must've heard some gunfire.
Somebody must've heard something.
Who? The only other house within 50 miles of here is mine, and I'm not there.
What about the road, passers by?
Do you have any idea what kind of luck you had running into me tonight?
I thought you ran into us.
Joe, check upstairs.
Even if anyone did come by, they'd only end up with a slaughter like you.
Our really hope is daylight.
Sunrise is in six hours.
We did the best we could.
But if the Sarge's condition deteriorates, he'll have less than four.
And the only thing holding them back, is they don't know how much ammunition we have left.
Let's give it a look.
Tell me, honestly, what are our chances?
The morale seems good, considering.
It'll only last as long as the ammunition holds it.
High spirits it's no substitute for 800 rounds a minute, but I don't think that's what you want to hear.
Think about it, Cooper.
Up until today you believed there was a line between myth and reality.
A very fine line sometimes, but at least it was a line.
Those things out there are real.
If they're real, what else is real?
You know what lives in the shadows now.
You may never get another night sleep as long as you live.
So why worry, Cooper? You may not live that long.
Shut your mouth.
I'm gonna make it through this. You know why?
I don't scare that easy.
Here.
It's supposed to be lucky.
For me or the rest of the rabbit?
You'll need a lot more than luck this time.
Shut up, Ryan.
Listen to me, Cooper.
Ignore him.
We can survive 'til sunrise. That's all that matters. It's just a few more hours.
Wait a minute. Am I missing something here?
I know him.
I was seconded to his team during their first visit here.
First visit? What first visit?
What the fuck are you talking about?
They came to check out the stories. They needed an expert.
It's just a few more hours,
Cooper. That's all there is.
All clear?
Yeah.
You wanna kill them all?
Yes.
Good. Keep it up.
What's the damage, Spoon?
We might've pissed on our chips.
We've only got two full mags for the MP5, six rounds for the shotgun, and one spare. Just in case.
Stay sharp, everyone.
We're putting fire down all over.
We fill those things with lead, and they just kept coming back at us.
Sixty rounds won't last two minutes.
So, either we all fight our way clear, or the rest of us keep them occupied but one of us goes for help.
By the time the cavalry get here, they'll have what's left of us between their teeth.
Fucking brilliant.
We either stay and snuff it, or we all go.
And snuff it.
Decisions, decisions.
Laugh.
I nearly died.
Who stopped you?
That's it! We'll fucking have him!
Take it easy, big man.
Calm down.
Do any of you know how to hot-wire a car?
They keep an old
Land Rover in the barn.
I don't know where the keys are, but if one of you could break in and start it.
I can do that.
Are you sure?
A piece of piss.
The further I am from this wanker, the happier I'll be.
All right. You're gonna need a decoy.
Something fast and loud.
What?
You what?
You, sit.
Stay.
You're serious about this werewolf thing, aren't you?
Afraid so.
Shit.
Don't suppose you know who won the match.
Didn't even know there was a game on.
It's not a game.
All right, this is it.
Everyone get ready.
Bollocks.
Joe. Good luck, man.
You don't get off the hook that easy.
All right, you bastards.
Come on and have a go if you think you're naughty enough.
Come on, you beauties!
They took the bait.
Come on!
Spoon, run!
Move your fucking arse, soldier.
Come on.
I'm trying.
I love it when a posh bear talks dirty.
Jesus! What's fucking going on, Cooper?
Cut it.
Fuck this.
Shit.
He's done it. Ryan, up. Everyone else downstairs. Come on, move it.
Move. Move.
You're behind me, aren't you?
I'm gonna fucking have you!
Right? Go. Go.
Well?
She's in a bad way.
A few pumps gone.
Fan belt is bugging.
She's pissing out petrol.
The word "bone" springs to mind.
Joe's body?
It's gone.
What's the damage, Spoon?
We're down to 48 rounds.
Check the right.
Well, Ryan, you heard the score.
Maybe one or two of us are gonna make it through this.
I don't care much for our chances.
Do you like football?
What? They think it's all over and all that crap? No, I don't.
Don't you remember Joe? He liked football. Fucking lived for it.
Is this relevant?
He missed the most important match of his life for this bullshit exercise.
And now he's dead along with two other mates. I'd give them my right arm.
To fucking right it's relevant!
You just can't get pass the dog, can you?
We're losing, Ryan.
We're three now down, and we're close to the final whistle.
At the very least I wanna even score.
I understand your resentment.
But you failed because you weren't prepared to take that extra step.
If you'd passed, you would've been on my team.
And if you were on my team, you'd be dead.
Yeah, I failed.
I'm bloody glad of it.
If I was given the choice of taking orders from a twat like you and slogging it out at these guys,
I'll take the underdogs anytime.
So you can take your precious selection, shove it up your arse and stop trying to change the fucking subject!
Fair enough.
But you won't like what I have to tell you.
There are some places you really shouldn't go.
We'll be the judge of that, Ryan.
Ever heard of Special
Weapons Division?
They're the men in white coats who train dolphins to stick mines on submarines.
And cute furry animals to tear your head off at the neck.
They saw an opportunity and called me in.
To do what? Catch one of these things?
And to bring it back.
Alive if possible.
Only "it" turned out to be "them. "
We underestimated the enemy numbers.
Underestimated? I would have a serious word with your heads about their intelligence.
It may have been their invitation, but it was my party.
I planned it and executed it.
And you loused it up.
We lost good men, Ryan.
Yours and mine.
I wanna know where we fit in.
The reality is you're expendable.
And I had approval to put you at risk.
Get to the fucking point, Ryan.
I made a gap in enemy lines.
You were good enough to spot it and predictable enough to go for it.
That was your bait.
You were mine.
You bastard.
I had to choose somebody.
I remembered you.
Monkey see, monkey do.
They were my men!
Get up, you shit. You know what we can do. Give us a fighting chance.
Live and learn, Cooper.
I didn't hit him hard.
You tricked something loose.
Bad dog.
Fetch.
Make the shot.
Clear.
Cooper, get down.
I got target.
Werewolves spend most of their time in human form, right?
And the only people from miles around live right here.
So these things aren't about to give up the fight and go home.
They are home.
That makes perfect sense, don't it?
We bust into their house. We eat all their porridge. We sleep in their beds.
No wonder they're pissed off.
But they're good people.
They're kind people.
More is the pity.
Why?
We're gonna have to kill them all.
He's right.
What self-respecting werewolf would have anything silver in a house anyway?
Fuck the folklore.
Let's just burn them.
If we knew where to find them.
Maybe we do.
Everything we've seen so far suggests the behavior of a pack.
Six to eight members. An Alpha pair leading the subordinates, and a young male, the Beta wolf, second in command. Makes sense.
You lost me.
A wolf pack sticks together, generally somewhere close to its food supply.
Somewhere safe, sheltered, and warm.
You're gonna have to move like shit off the shovel on this one.
You wanna get your own shit.
When we blow that fuse up, that place is gonna look like Zabriskie Point.
Yeah, it's easy peesy.
My lime's squeezy.
Listen, Coop.
What about the Sarge?
You know what I mean.
The Sarge is with us.
Yeah, yeah.
I just didn't want him to go out without his watch back.
And you stay out of trouble.
You all right?
Oh, yeah,
I am fine, Cooper.
I mean, I feel absolutely fantastic.
That's a problem, isn't it?
Hey?
What if she's wrong?
What if they're not all in there?
Then we'll get some of them.
It's a shit lot better than none of them, and a marked improvement on all of us.
No, you listen to me.
You get the fuck out now.
I'll hold them back, keep them occupied. You get out.
We've lost enough men for one night, don't you think?
Let me show you something.
Do not tell me that that is fucking normal.
What happened to Ryan is happening to me.
It's just a matter of time, mate.
Stop wasting time with this hara-kiri crap.
This fight isn't lost, yet.
With Ryan it only took a couple of hours. It's full moon.
Maybe it's like when you need to take a piss or something. I don't know.
When you gotta go, you gotta fucking go.
Maybe it's more than needing a shite.
Just 'cause you need one, it doesn't mean you drop your kegs and pinch one off.
Fucking Ryan, shifty bastard could've been one of those things from the start.
You know, Coop, there's one more thing you gotta learn about command, mate.
Sometimes the people that you kill, are your own men.
So, I'm asking you.
Let me take care of myself.
And at least spare you the unfortunate business of trying to expla... explain to Annie why you had to incinerate me.
We're gonna knock seven colors of shit out of these fuckers. We need you.
It's all right, you know, mate.
It's okay.
I just didn't make it out this time. That's all.
Because of the job, you know what I mean?
When I signed my life away on that doted line, I fucking meant it.
I am a professional soldier.
So, what do you want me to do?
Roast their bollocks off.
All clear.
Good luck.
Light it!
Shit.
Sarge.
I'm sorry.
When I found you out there tonight,
I truly believed you were the best chance I had of getting out.
But now we have no chance.
There is no out.
There never was.
I came here to be one with nature. Well, I got what I wanted.
Now I have to live with it.
There is no house in the next glen.
No.
And there were no werewolves in the barn when it blew.
Not one.
The reason you're not in the photograph is 'cause you took it.
I never meant to...
You women.
Same old shite.
Being nice to women will get you nowhere, Cooper.
Being nice to me will get you killed.
You may think they're all bitches, but
I'm the real thing.
Do you think I like being part of this fucked up family?
Do you think I chose to run with the pack?
No.
I chose you.
But now you're out of luck, and I'm out of time.
And all we can do is let nature take its course.
They were always here.
I just unlocked the door.
It's that time of the month.
Somebody has to put it out of his misery.
Spoon. Clear.
Go now!
Spoonie, stop fucking.
It's an order!
Come on!
Sarge?
Sarge?
I'm in the closet.
Open the closet.
Come on!
You fucking mother!
You're not killing me, you bastard.
How do you like the tomatoes, you fucking bastard?
Come on.
I'm running out, Coop.
I'm running out.
You're a fucking bastard.
Come on!
Come on!
I hope I give you the shits, you fucking wimp.
You fucker.
Come on, Coop.
Beat it!
Here.
Go away.
Go on, Coop! Get stuck in mate!
Get out of it! Come on, you fucker!
Go away, you fucking ass.
Come on!
Cooper, let's get in the wardrobe, son.
What?
Let's get in the wardrobe.
All right.
What's that smell?
I don't know.
Fucking hell.
Give me that.
Open your mouth. Watch the ears. Mind your toes.
Go.
Where's Spoon?
There is no Spoon.
No, you fucking bastards!
Help me, Cooper.
Get in there.
Get in there!
What are you doing?
Take this. There's one in the chamber. I'm fucking bent.
We go together or we don't fucking go.
It's my last order. Do not fuck about. Do not disobey me.
Fuck! Listen.
You have got to make it alive.
Prove what happened. Not just for me or my lads.
For her!
Here.
Prove it happened, mate.
Go! Go!
Sam. Fuck.
What the fuck?
Ryan, have you tried licking your own balls, yet?
I forgot. You don't fucking have any.
Ha!
You think it's all over? It is now.
Thanks.
We'll see how far two semesters of French gets me.
Just remember, a smile goes a long way.
Even in Paris.
And to smooth the transition....
-Lex, I already have a ticket.
-I know.
I just got you a little upgrade.
It's open-ended, for whenever you're ready to say goodbye to Smallville.
-This is first class. I can't accept this.
-You have to. It's a gift.
Trust me.
This is gonna be a year you'll never forget.
-Clark.
-I didn't mean to interrupt.
-I didn't know you were here.
-No.
Lex was just giving me some last-minute travel tips.
-When is the big day?
-Saturday.
I should probably go.
Thanks.
Clark, you need to let her go.
I suppose I don't have much of a choice.
She's the one who wanted to leave.
And if there's anybody who set that ball in motion, it's you.
Clark, all Lana's ever wanted is for you to be honest with her.
If you're not willing to step up...
...you need to move aside and let her get on with her life.
Time for lights out. Good night, Emily.
Night.
Logging off at 21 1 5 hours.
Hello?
You're ruining it.
It's perfect and you're ruining it.
You must be Lana.
This place doesn't belong to you.
Miss Lang, I know you put a lot of work into this coffee shop...
...but you signed the papers.
It belongs to Lana.
Get out there and take your shot.
-Yep. She's moving to Wichita.
-Wichita?
Yeah, she got the federal judgeship.
She starts work on Monday.
That was fast.
-What about your dad?
-Well, he's staying in Smallville.
I guess that means they're going through with the divorce.
I'm really sorry, Pete.
I've been avoiding the whole thing...
...because I knew when I finally told you, it'd-- lt'd definitely sink in.
Guess you're the last man standing in the nuclear family zone.
Pete, you're not losing your family, it's just changing.
It can be hard to find out your parents are hiding things from you.
It's just so weird when you realize that the people...
...you thought had all the answers are just human like everybody else.
What are you gonna do?
I didn't go through three years of high school just to miss out on senior year.
I wish Lana felt that way.
I'm gonna say this once and then it falls into the "none of my business" category.
The whole yo-yo thing with you and Lana?
It's gotta stop.
You sound like Lex.
He thinks I'm the reason Lana's leaving.
I hate to agree with Uncle Fester...
...but I don't think Lana's going to Paris just to see the Mona Lisa.
You ever wish I'd never told you about me?
It's rough at times, covering with Chloe and everybody...
...but the truth is, no one's ever put that much trust in me before.
You're not thinking about coming clean with Lana, are you?
It might be the only way to stop her from getting on that plane.
-Looks like you could use a garage sale.
-Yeah, you'd think I was....
Moving halfway around the world?
You know, I think that's pretty brave.
Did you lose something?
Yeah, my mom's bracelet.
Lana, I know you're busy with the move and everything...
...but I was wondering if you'd wanna have dinner with me...tonight?
I don't know if that's such a great idea, Clark.
There's something I should've told you.
I should've told you a long time ago.
-ls everything okay?
-I hope it will be.
Yeah, of course.
Of course I'll be there.
This is Emily 1 1 months ago.
This is Emily now.
She looks just like her mother.
Yeah, well, I bet her mother can't move through a brick wall.
She didn't go out the door, Mr. Dinsmore, she went through the door.
You created her, how'd she do it?
That means her molecules are vibrating so fast, they can be absorbed through matter.
Well, that's a little detail that my ex-project director failed to discover.
Where do you think she's going,
Mr. Dinsmore?
Last time she left, she went straight to her best childhood friend.
Yes, Lana Lang. And that meeting ended with Miss Lang near death...
-...at the bottom of a river.
-You can't blame her for that.
No matter what age Emily appears to be, her emotional development...
-...is that of a child.
-Well, she's not a child.
She's a failed experiment and a colossal liability.
Mr. Dinsmore, it is imperative that I find her before anyone else.
All right, I'm gonna do one of two things.
I'm gonna either send out a team that will do whatever it takes to retrieve her...
...or I will send you...
...her father.
Well, I guess you're not gonna miss the 5 a.m. pastry deliveries.
It's weird. All I was trying to do was save this place from being torn down.
Next thing I know, it kind of took over my life.
-Whoa.
-Yeah.
I thought they were turning the Talon into a house of heartburn.
Why would I do that?
-You must be Lana.
-Yeah.
I thought I was meeting Mr. Kerns.
-He's my dad.
-Oh, I didn't realize.
He sent me to set everything up.
-I'm Emma.
-Hi.
Have we met before?
You seem really familiar.
Everybody says that.
This is Chloe. She'll be one of your frequent "caffeinators."
-Hi.
-Hi.
Just out of curiosity, what's going on with the burrito bar?
Oh, it was all wrong.
Everything-- It's perfect just the way it is.
Lana, would you mind staying around a little while and showing me the ropes?
No, no. It's the least I could do.
Oh, and I wanted to give you these.
Found an extra set of keys.
I sort of feel like I'm handing over half of my life to you.
Don't worry, it's in good hands.
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.
Does this mean I'm off the hook for dinner?
I invited Lana over.
It must be hard to say goodbye.
Well, if this works, I won't have to.
Do you think it's fair to keep doing this to her?
No. That's why I've decided to tell her tonight.
Tell her?
Everything.
Clark...
...asking someone to keep your secret is a big responsibility, you know.
-Look at Pete. It hasn't been easy for him.
-I know.
And Pete has had some close calls.
But I'm still glad I told him and so is he.
It's made us better friends.
-Are you sure Lana's ready?
-She keeps asking me to be honest.
I owe her the chance to decide for herself.
I guess it's not fair to raise you as one of us...
...and then try to keep you from experiencing one of the best parts of life.
So you're okay with this?
I trust you to make your own decision.
I told you about the delivery truck, right?
-Tuesday mornings at 6.
-Yeah.
Well, I guess that's everything.
It was fun having you around today.
Are you sure you want to leave all this?
I mean, everything you know is here.
Yeah, well, you know, that's exactly why I need to go.
That's too bad.
I thought we could've been friends.
Maybe even best friends.
Well, I'm sorry we won't get a chance to know each other better.
We already do, silly.
I'll show you.
-Mr. Dinsmore?
-ls she here?
-Who?
-Emily.
Oh, my God.
I knew she would come to you, Lana.
I have to get her back to LuthorCorp.
-You know how dangerous she is.
-What does she want?
You have to forgive me.
I forgave you.
That's what friends do.
I'm sorry, Lana.
Emily!
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!
Emily!
Help! Help!
That's not exactly the face of someone who just secured another government contract.
-Everything okay?
-Fine. Everything is just...
...fine.
I...
...asked you here because l....
I need your help, son.
I have an executive who has proven himself...
...in so many ways, and I want to reward his efforts...
...or his accomplishments with a--
I don't know, a promotion.
I'm missing the dilemma.
The dilemma is that I have a feeling he's not trustworthy.
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would you give him a chance to fess up?
To confess to any disloyal behavior he's guilty of?
Maybe the same ruthless qualities that make you question his trust...
...would make him a valuable asset when it comes to running a company.
Or maybe they'd...
...just make him...
...a disloyal son.
-Dad.
-You betrayed me, your own father.
I protected myself, just like you taught me to.
Lex, whatever problems we have, keep them within the walls of our own house.
-Don't stoop to this level.
-Spare me the lecture, Dad.
I had nothing to do with the murders of
Dr. Teng and her team at the Metron lab.
You sold me out to the cops for your inexplicable blood experiments.
-I did it to make you stronger.
-The hell you did!
You can't hide every deceitful thing you've done to me...
...under the guise of mentorship!
You brought this on yourself.
You've gotten careless.
Why is that, Dad?
Why would you risk everything on all these obscure projects?
What could be that important?
If you had given me any reason to trust you...
...you wouldn't have to ask that question.
Get out.
-What?
-Yeah, it's Loder.
Your kid hasn't found anything.
If he does, believe me,
I'll make sure it stays buried.
Good.
And our other...
-...situation?
-I'm looking into the Ross kid.
All right.
-Go talk to him.
-I'm working on it.
Your mother told me you were up here.
Don't worry, Dad. Lana stood me up.
The secret's still safe.
You know...
...there could be 1 00 different reasons why Lana didn't show up here tonight.
None of them might have anything to do with you.
I've given Lana so many reasons not to trust me.
But I'm not gonna give up.
There's no way I can talk you out of this, right?
Clark, sometimes a person can hold on too tight for too long.
Dad, I've liked Lana since the first time
I saw her. You know that.
-It's not gonna change.
-I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about me.
You see, a father is supposed to help his son build a life...
...not try to hold him back from one.
-But you still think it's a bad idea?
-Yeah, I do.
But honestly, Clark, I don't trust my instincts the way I used to.
I just hope you can trust yours.
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?
-I'm Clark Kent. I'm a friend of Lana's.
-Then the first cup of coffee is free.
Actually, I'm just looking for her.
She was supposed to meet me last night.
Chloe said the last time she saw her...
-...she was here with you.
-Oh. She didn't tell you?
Lana's gone.
She already left for Paris.
She wasn't supposed to leave for two more days.
-Maybe she changed her mind.
-She wouldn't just leave like that.
Not without saying goodbye to anyone.
I heard her say something about hating goodbyes.
I made us TV dinners.
They're our favorite, with the brownie.
Emily, I'm sure that you've been through a lot...
...and I know that you're probably very lonely.
But we can still be friends without you keeping me in here.
How can we be best friends if you go away?
We'll write each other letters.
You know, and you can come visit me.
-Wouldn't you like to see Paris?
-No.
I don't want you to go either.
Things are better this way.
You'll see.
We'll have so much fun.
And then, one day, if you're good...
...we can run the Talon together.
Emily...
...you can't just force someone to be your friend.
It's something that happens over time when you trust each other.
I know what a friend is.
A friend is someone who would stand up for you and protect you.
A friend is someone who would jump in a river to save you from drowning...
...even if it meant they had to give up their own life for you.
You don't need to tell me...
...what it means to be a friend.
Then you know that a friend would never keep me locked up in here.
Get used to it.
I did.
People are going to come looking for me.
No.
They won't.
They think you already went to Paris.
My father found the wire, Clark.
The FBl's dropping the case unless
I can find something incriminating.
With everything your father's done, that shouldn't be too hard.
Well, my father's sort of mastered the art of covering his tracks.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
You mean like hiding things from your best friend?
You tell me, Lex.
Look, I'm a little under the gun.
If I upset you, you're gonna have to be more specific.
Lana's ticket.
Why didn't you tell me you changed it?
Well, I didn't think
I needed your permission.
If anything, I thought I was buying you more time.
It's an open-ended ticket so she can leave whenever she wants.
-So she didn't say goodbye to you, either?
-What's going on?
According to the daughter of the new Talon owner...
..."whenever she wants" was today.
Lana's gone.
Clark, the new owner doesn't have a daughter.
Sorry, we're closed.
Why did you tell me Lana left?
My friend pulled some strings and checked.
She never got on any plane.
Like you care. You weren't a very good friend if you were gonna let her go away.
-What did you do to her?
-She doesn't need you anymore.
You tell me where she is.
You were nicer to me when I was little.
You told me you were different too.
So you know what it's like to be left alone without anybody.
Good evening, Miss Sullivan.
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the hallways.
All right, you can cut the sarcasm.
I'm only here because I need your help.
With all your resources, Mr. Luthor, what could you possibly want from me?
Your friendship...
...with Lana Lang.
A young woman in my care, daughter of a friend, is missing.
-We can't locate her.
-I'll congratulate her when I see her.
I don't know what this has to do with Lana--
Her father was looking for her.
He's disappeared as well.
She was Lana's best friend when they were children.
So it's possible she might show up here in Smallville.
The girl is sick.
Very sick. She needs treatment.
If she's here in Smallville,
I'm sure you'll find out about it.
I'll expect a call from you.
Lana, your tea's gonna get cold.
Would you like some more tea, Emily?
You're not my friend anymore.
It's Emily Dinsmore.
They found her father's car abandoned outside the Talon.
Lionel must've nabbed her last year after she pushed Lana off the bridge.
And in the meantime, she's picked up a bad habit of walking through walls.
We know why Lionel's trying so hard to get her back. He can't let Lex find her first.
Wait a minute, when did Lex enter the equation?
Chloe, Lex has been working with the FBl to try and take down his father.
If you knew Lex was looking for dirt on Lionel, why didn't you tell him...
-...about his grandparents?
-We never had evidence...
...about what Lionel was doing. Besides, the last time Lex confronted him about it...
...it almost got him killed.
But if we found Emily, then we could prove that Lionel has been illegally cloning people.
What I don't get is if Emily could've escaped at any time...
...why wait till now for the sudden encore appearance?
Maybe she found out she was gonna lose Lana forever.
Then the question is, what would you do to keep someone from leaving?
Try to make things go back to the way they were before.
You mean when they were kids?
Emily still thinks Lana's her best friend...
...and everything can be like when they played together.
You lived next door to Lana, do you remember them?
No, they spent most of their time at Emily's.
What we need to do is figure out where that is.
-Goodbye, Lana.
-Emily, please don't do this.
Emily, please!
Lana.
Clark.
-Was I speeding?
-No, kid.
But I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.
FBl. I just have a few questions for you.
It won't take long.
-I'm pretty sure you got the wrong guy.
-You Pete Ross?
Is this about my mom?
Federal judges gotta go through a routine security check.
I just got a few questions to ask you.
So you have information that could put my father in prison.
So did you, before you obliterated those seven weeks of your memory at Belle Reve.
-Do you know what he was trying to hide?
-Lex...
...your father murdered his parents in a tenement fire.
He hired a crime lord named Morgan Edge to do the dirty work.
You got Edge's confession on videotape, but Daddy Dearest destroyed it.
Then there's no proof.
Only the voice mail confession of Lionel Luthor himself.
He tried to scrub it, but erased voice mail's like deleted computer files.
Someone with enough pull and the right password...
...can resurrect them from the cyber graveyard.
-Why didn't you come to me sooner?
-Your psychiatrist...
...didn't accidentally wrap her car around a tree. You showed me...
...the investigator's body on a slab in the morgue.
Luthor family politics can get a little grim.
Chloe...
...it means a lot you're willing to do this for me...
...but if you come forward, you're putting yourself between my father and the FBl.
That's not a very safe place to be.
I know.
But I can't get out from under your father's grip by myself.
Besides, I know you won't let anything happen to me.
Get up!
-You know how to swim, Pete?
-Get off me, man.
-What are you doing?
-I'm losing my patience with you.
You're crazy.
-I don't know anything about a secret.
-You're just his best friend.
You know, you can continue to play the hero if you want...
...but are the skeletons in his closet worth your life?
I'm not telling you anything.
-Oh, I think you will.
-Loder!
-Pete, you okay?
-You're the one who's got him after Clark?
No. But I have a feeling my father did.
Didn't he? He found out you were working with me and paid you off.
No wonder you were so anxious to drop the case against him.
I really don't want a morality lesson from someone willing to rat out their own father.
So how much did he toss in to do leg work on Clark?
If I was you, I'd be worried less about this farm kid...
...and more about the homicide charges you'll face...
-...when I throw you to Metropolis P.D.
-Somehow I'm not too concerned.
I bet your supervisors would be very interested...
...to know about your unique interrogation methods.
What is it you want, Luthor?
I want you to get back to the case you were assigned.
That's all the evidence you'll need on my father.
You're making a mistake, Lex.
This kid is sitting on something bigger than you...
...or even your dad.
Isn't that right, Pete?
You sure you're all right?
Clark was probably right confiding in you instead of me.
Couldn't ask for a better friend.
Come on.
I thought that guy was gonna kill me.
I guess I owe you a thanks.
I'm sure when the time comes you'll do the same for me.
Hey, Pete.
-What happened to you?
-FBl agent decided to go off payroll.
Wanted to know about you.
Don't worry.
I didn't tell him anything.
-I should've been there.
-That's just it.
You can't always be there.
I gotta look out for myself.
I just thought you should know they're onto you.
-Thanks for the warning.
-The FBl isn't who I'm warning you about.
Lex was there.
He's the one who pulled the fed off me.
-He's investigating his father, not me.
-That doesn't matter. He knows.
Now, I'm not exactly sure how much...
...but he's not gonna stop until he's got everything.
Clark, you gotta keep an eye on him.
Look out for yourself.
Pete?
Why are you talking like that?
-I'm moving to Wichita with my mom.
-No, Pete.
I thought that--
What about senior year?
No, Pete, you can't do this because of me.
I know that I told you keeping your secret wasn't hard...
...but I lied. I walk around every day, afraid that I'm gonna slip up.
-Well, why didn't you tell me sooner?
-Because you needed a friend.
And so did l.
You don't have to move.
You don't have to change your whole life.
There must be a way.
No one has to know we're friends.
There's a lot of things that
I can handle...
...but I could never live with myself if I betrayed you.
Pete.
I'll see you around, Clark.
Hi.
-Lana.
-I heard Emily disappeared from Belle Reve...
-...as soon as she was admitted.
-Yeah, even under heavy sedation.
-Do you think she's going to come back?
-No.
I think Lionel Luthor will make sure of that.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just sorry that I ruined dinner.
That's okay. I'm sure I've racked up more than a few lOUs.
Well, I was really looking forward to it.
So was l.
So there's something that you wanted to tell me.
What is it?
I just wanted to tell you that....
Have a great time in Paris.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Goodbye, Clark.
Forgive them, for they know not what they do.
Is that what you expect from me, forgiveness?
Don't try to make me out as your own personal Judas.
I didn't come here for forgiveness.
I came here to congratulate you on sweeping another mishap under the rug.
-Emily Dinsmore?
-Oh, yes. Emily Dinsmore.
I should have remembered.
You should have warned them.
Belle Reve has a habit of...
...misplacing its patients. The details--
I've always tried to teach you, Lex.
The devil is in the details.
If you don't pay attention to the details...
...he'll win.
Then it's a good thing I'm a fast learner.
You went through all the trouble of having your own son committed to an asylum...
...and shooting 600 volts of electricity through his body...
...just to cover up your trespasses.
But like I said, Dad, you've gotten careless.
Loder, why are you here?
Lionel Luthor, you're under arrest.
On what charge?
The murder of your parents,
Lachlan and Eliza Luthor.
Let's go.
Be careful, son. Don't forget.
Judas hung himself with his own rope.

Loose brick, north side of the buiIding.
Go, man. Bounce.

This is a reaIIy bad idea.
There it is.
Nice.
It's easy as pie... and twice as tasty.
Man, someone's screwing with my car!
Come on.
Come on, in here!
I saw them go in.
This is a waste of fucking time.
Come on.
Forget it.
There's no way they're in there.
Trust me. I've been working here for 20 years.
There's nobody in there.
Let's go.
Fucking donut shop shuts in Iess than five minutes.

That must be your birthday, huh?
Get your money right.
Put it in here, baby.
Let's get these numbers running.
-You aII right?
-Yeah.
This Iooks Iike a damn graveyard around here, bro.
This neighborhood's making a comeback.
Where the heII has it been?
This is the ugIiest buiIding
I've ever seen.
I don't know.
There's something about this buiIding.
It just drew me.
AII right, you know something?
I was pIanning on doing this... after I got the pIace cIeaned up and whatnot... but, Iike the man says, carpe diem.
What do you think about this,
IittIe sis?
That's us.
''IIIbient''?
Whose cIub is that?
Ours.
What do you mean, ours?
Like I said, ours.
Come on, check it out.
-In this?
-Yes.
Patrick, what are you thinking?
This is prehistoric.
Can you picture it, though?
Look, we couId have the bar right here.
Dance fIoor.
-Yo, BiII.
-What?
DJ booth, right there.
Anything's possibIe, but that's a Iot of work.
Oh, Jesus.
TeII me that's part of a dog or something.
Yeah, that's dog.
That's from a cat or something.
It's a pretty big cat,
Patrick.
Cat, dog, whatever.
I got a reaIIy great deaI on this pIace.
A reaIIy great deaI, man.
They couIdn't give it away.
It was dead meat stinking up their books for 20 years.
Don't do that, Maurice.
Stop pIaying, man.
ChiII.
The Iast owner on the Iease, before the bank... was back in '79.
Some cat named Jimmy Bones.
It's been empty ever since.
Jimmy Bones?
-You heard of him?
-You haven't?
Not that I can remember.
He was a IocaI Iegend back in the Seventies.
Sure.
There was a song--
Sing it for me, baby. Come on.
Let's do this. Ready?
This is the story of Jimmy Bones
BIack as night and hard as stone
Sorry.
Something about a deuce.
A switchbIade and...
A switchbIade and a diamond.
Get yourseIf a coupIe of doIIars and buy a piece of candy.
Say, ''Thank you, UncIe Jimmy.''
Thank you, UncIe Jimmy.
Jimmy Bones.
Aw, Maurice. Jimmy Bones.
How bad-ass is that?
Jimmy Bones!
Patrick, I'm going to teII you something.
I'm soId, baby, and I'II teII you why.
This is what I'm thinking.
We couId use this whoIe
Jimmy Bones theme... to make this pIace off the hook.
Look at this pIace, man.
It's a dump.
ActuaIIy, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Look at the rest of the pIace before you tear it down.
I know it's coId.
I'II run downstairs, fire up the furnace... see if I can warm the joint up a IittIe bit... and you'II see.
This pIace has serious potentiaI, man.
PotentiaI to Ieave me seriousIy injured.
I'm gonna check out how to get the DJ equipment up there.
Who's coming?
Aw, man.
Aw, shit.
Am I trippin'?
I'm going this way.
Yeah, me, too.
No, you won't, buddy.
You're going to foIIow me upstairs.
Tia, be carefuI.
Oh, shit!
Fucking rats.
PIease don't bust, because I can't afford that.
What's up?
Contact paranoia.
Maybe you heard of it.
I'm buggin' from hanging with you aII the time.
I teII you, goddamn, man.
WeII, I got bigger probIems.
I can't get this joint Iit.
That's drug abuse.
Things are nuts down here without you squawking that up.
Maurice?
BiII?
Hey...buddy.
How Iong you been
Iocked in here?
Want my burger?
Damn, you were hungry.
You want us to move in here?
That's the onIy way we'II get the pIace fixed in time.
Yeah, right.
And whichever of us is aIive by the end of week... inherits aII of Vincent Price's cash.
You want to pIay coIIege radio, high schooI reunions... and some fooI's cIub once a week for the rest of your Iives... that's cooI, but I think we can do better.
I put everything I got into this... because I beIieve we can make it happen.
We move in. We take shifts.
Enough with the motivationaI speech.
I'm down, aII right?
Thank you.
He has a good track record, so just go with him.
Fine. Mars needs a IittIe bit of Venus.
If I'm going to sIeep in a spook house... surround me with chicks more scared than me.
Speaking of which...
Why wouId you say that about my sister, man?
-Oh, shit.
-Look who I found.
What? Tia.
That's the nastiest dog
I ever seen.
He's not as ugIy as some peopIe I know.
Anyway, I'm naming him Bones.
Bones?
Let's go get the stuff we need and bring it back.
-Shotgun.
-Shotgun.
-I said it first.
-No, you hear things Iate.
By the way...
Dad does know about this, right?
Are you kidding?
Patrick, man--
It's going to be cooI, bro.
I'm teIIing you.
Hey!
What y'aII doing over there with that dog?
Is he yours?
Is he yours, sir?
HeII, no!
What do you care, then?
I'II teII you something, boy.
Shoot that dog.
Shoot the dog?
Whatever you say, sir.
I think it's nappy time.
Come on, Bones.
Tia, put him in the back.
Don't feed that dog!
What the heII's wrong with you?
Some hoIes can't be fiIIed... and some hunger can't be satisfied.
Some peopIe need to stagger their medication.
I'm serious!
He'II onIy get hungrier.
Come on, Cynthia.
Y'aII peopIe reaIIy don't Iike dogs.
Ma'am, you need any heIp with those bags?
No, thank you.
ReaIIy, Iet us heIp.
We just moved into the neighborhood.
We're going to be neighbors.
Let me heIp you out.
You moved onto this bIock?
Not reaIIy to Iive, but to pIay.
See, I'm a DJ, right?
In that buiIding?
It's going to be Ie hot shit.
Pardon my Francais.
We're making it a dance cIub.
Ever heard of the Resurrection Brothers?
ShouId I?
Are they on the radio?
Nah, but they wiII be.
They're the best.
How do you know?
-I manage them.
-It's us.
And you bought that buiIding?
Wait a minute.
You Iook a IittIe famiIiar.
Are you sure you're not from around here?
I was born near here... but after my mom died,
Dad moved to South.
I grew up in Rossmore Park.
You're a IittIe dark to grow up in Rossmore Park.
Yo, she's fine.
I guess this is not
Rossmore Park, but... thanks for the heIp.
Hey, anytime.
Here.
I guess
I'II be seeing you, then.
It was nice to meet you.
If she has psychic powers... how come she's working here in DesoIation Row?
Come on, man.
What happened to the CoIoneI?
A gangsta of Iove don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not?
You eat everything eIse.
The whoIe chicken distribution network is owned by the KIan.
Man, don't even go there.
When's the Iast time you seen a bIack chicken farm?
Yeah, speciaI recipe.
There's something in the batter that makes a bIack man steriIe.
-BuIIshit.
-Now hoId up, man.
Why are you so concerned with the pIight of the bIack man?
Last time I checked, you was not bIack.
I don't know exactIy what you are... but you damn sure ain't no bIack man.
I am the future, aII right?
I am the meIting pot.
You been smoking pot.
I'm the tossed saIad.
I am
Martin Luther King's dream.
AII I got to do is hoId my own hand.
I am post-raciaI.
You're post-toasted.
Post-apocaIyptic, more IikeIy.
You're making my head hurt.
Just eat your food.
Eddie, man, what's wrong, nigga?
How many times
I done toId y'aII, man?
When I'm pIaying this game here... don't interrupt me.
We just hooked you up with a tight Viper.
We are paid, nigga.
Viper!
A Viper?
A Viper you stoIe off them white boys Iast night?
Yep, yep, yep.
Like that, nigga.
Just Iike that.
Are y'aII out your motherfucking mind?
No.
Man, everybody heard that damn screaming...
Iast night on BIackstone.
Remember that shit?
How many times I toId you two knuckIehead niggers?
No psycho shit.
If there's going to be any psycho shit...
I'm the one that do it.
We know that.
We respect that.
That's why we didn't do shit.
You didn't Ginsu them punks and steaI their ride?
SteaI their ride.
That's aII we did.
That's aII we did.
Man, get that car the fuck away from here... you understand?
This is the type of shit
I'm taIking about.
I pay the pigs good money to keep shit cooI around here... and this is the shit that pisses everybody off.
Boy, if I didn't know your mama--
We just thought--
No more thinking from neither one of you!
Because I wiII burn your asses and snort your asses.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Beat it.
And do something with your hair, nigga.
Get out of here.
What make a motherfucker take his reaI teeth... and put--I don't understand that shit.
You're just a misunderstood genius.
Dad is going to kick ass.
He doesn't Iike dogs in the house in the first pIace.
AII right. I toId you so.
Hey, you guys.
Hi, Mom.
Tia...what's this?
-It's a dog.
-I can see that.
Why'd you Iet her bring it in in the first pIace?
She's hardheaded.
She don't Iisten to me.
Excuse me.
Let me see if I've got this right.
Not onIy do I have to feed the three mouths I've got... pIus Maurice the bottomIess pit...
I have to feed this stray dog, too?
Bones, it's not nice to bite the hand that feeds you.
What did you caII him?
Bones.
You cannot keep that dog.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up, Jimmy B?
What's going on, bIood?
I got it aII arranged for you tonight, Jimmy.
Eddie Mack's going to be there... and Officer Koruptsky, too.
Got it aII Iaid out for you, baby.
They've got 12 minutes, tops.
Jimmy, trust me on this, man.
There's some big money behind this, baby.
Not just big--
I mean big business big...
Iike big corporation big, big government big.
One word, three IittIe Ietters--
Y-e-s. That's aII it's going to take.
We can move out of this dump, hit the big time-- big houses,
Iegitimate business, the works.
That's your dream, not mine.
I don't ever want to Ieave this street.
Never.
Status quo is totaIIy cooI with me, baby.
I hear you, Jimmy.
I'm with you, baby.
-Be good.
-AII right, baby.
I hear you, Jimmy.
You got aII the status... and I ain't got nothin' but the quo.
Officer SIupovich... aka Loopy Lou.
It's not your styIe... is it, Eddie Mack... kiIIing off your customers?
I ain't kiIIed nobody.
You want me to rack 'em up?
PIay a game?
Too bad.
No time to pIay today.
Got your tip.
Confiscated the whoIe stash.
That's fair enough... for the shit.
Don't you think I deserve something a IittIe extra... for knocking out the competition?
Shit, you was just doing your motherfuckin' job.
The Iast thing you need... is for me to start doing my fucking job.
Give that motherfucker his money.
That's more Iike it.
That's the cost of doing business.
Maybe you can deduct it on your taxes.
Fuck you.
What's up with Jeremiah seIIing that buiIding?
What?
That's ridicuIous, Patrick.
So how exactIy did crack get in the ghetto, Pop?
By magic?
How did it fIy in there?
Like the man said, we don't own that many pIanes.
Stop poisoning your mind with that ghetto paranoia.
That's the ways of peopIe justifying their own faiIure.
No, no, no, Dad.
The man has been Iying to us for a hundred years.
Thank you.
I'm stiII waiting for my 40 acres and a muIe.
You wouIdn't know a muIe if one bit you in the ass.
PersonaIIy, I don't need a muIe.
I've got myseIf a Lexus.
And nobody gave it to me.
PIease, Pops--
I'd Iike to see the news, pIease.
...in the strange disappearance... of those two State CoIIege fraternity brothers.
Now, Patrick, I'm teIIing--
SIick.
What is that?
What's that aII about?
-Nothin'.
-What were you gonna say?
Some terribIe shit, Pops.
Better watch your mouth, boy.
Those boys had no business messing around down there.
You go pIaces where you're not meant to be... and that's what you get.
Isn't that your oId hood, Pops?
Yes, that's my oId hood... and it took some doing to get out of there.
You just be gIad that I did... so you can start your Iife here instead of down there.
ShouIdn't we maybe be down there?
Doing something about it, making it better?
It can't be done, Patrick!
That pIace has aIready died and gone to heII.
Want me to get that, honey?
No, I'II get it.
AI Lupovich.
Long time no see.
I'II be just a second, honey.
What the fuck do you want?
Wanted to visit with my oId paI J-Bird.
Don't caII me that.
That's quite a brood you got there.
A reguIar Rainbow CoaIition.
What the heII do you want,
Lupovich?
You soId the buiIding.
What buiIding?
Don't shit a shitter.
Our buiIding!
You were supposed to sit on it, not seII it.
I didn't seII it.
Somebody bought it, so somebody soId it.
Not my probIem.
That's a bozo no-no, J-Bird.
Even if they find anything, it's been 20 years.
They couId never trace it back to us.
You better hope not,
'cause it's Iike they say... four can keep a secret if three are dead.
Daddy?
Hey, Tia.
I'm just taIking to a friend.
I'II be right in.
Nice rack.
How oId is she?
Does she...you know?
That's my daughter, Lupovich.
Get the fuck off my property.
Your daughter.
Nice to see you.
You fat bastard.
Son of a bitch.
Got it. And twist.
I don't know what we're gonna do with this pIace, boy.
It's aII good.
It's ugIy, but it's home.
You know that's bad Iuck, right?
That pIace is bad Iuck.
Why's that?
I don't know.
It goes way back.
Or so my mother says.
What eIse does your mama say?
You know, nothin' much.
If I toId you, you'd think she was crazy.
And one thing my mother is not is crazy.
OK. So?
AII right.
I can't beIieve
I'm teIIing you this.
My mother says that every house is two houses.
Every street, two streets.
Two's good.
There's a whoIe city, a whoIe worId... kind of beside, on top... just beIow... the city of the dead.
There's this invisibIe waII... a fabric that keeps things separate.
Lucky thing.
Sure is, but when something bad happens... something reaIIy bad... the waII breaks, tears.
And the dead get out?
Or the Iiving faII in.
Who knows?
And you beIieve it?
If I did, do you think...
I'd come within
50 yards of your door?
Get out!
Y'aII better stop messin' around!
Go, boy!
What the fuck!
Freak!
What's the matter, bro?
Are you spooked?
Maybe just a IittIe, aII right?
I know. There is kind of a strange vibe up in here.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe around the circIe.
We wiII begin in just a moment.
You gonna join us?
Can't. Gotta finish this for schooI.
God gave you the vision.
I hate to see you waste it on painting pretty pictures.
You got your vision and I got mine... and I won't waste mine
Iike you did.
Sorry, Mama. Maybe next time?
I don't want you to go to that house anymore... and I want you to stay away from those kids and that dog.
That dog is a servant of eviI.
Ever been inside?
Yeah, back in the day.
Before it became what it is.
And what's that?
It's a bad pIace... and a door to worse.
I gots to T.C.B. tonight... so I shouId be through about 7:00.
Come see me.
Can't I get there earIy and give you some good Iuck?
No, baby. You know
I don't need no Iuck.
I'm just Ietting them have their say... before I teII them no.
AII right,
Iet me see your hands.
Come on,
Iet me see your hands.
-Come on, baby.
-PIease?
AII that readin', advisin', shiny mess... that was your mama's bag.
It was my mama's bag and her grandmama... and a Iong Iine of mamas before her.
Sounds Iike Mama needs a brand-new bag.
Let me see your hands.
PIease?
Your Ieft hand is the past... your right hand is the present and the future.
This is your Iife Iine, and this--
Jimmy, there's a Iine across your Iife Iine.
Must be my cIothesIine.
Maybe my phone Iine.
Jimmy, I'm serious!
CanceI the meeting.
Don't go. Stay with me.
Don't you worry about nothin', baby.
These hands wiII be stroking your neck tonight.
Jimmy, pIease!
PearI, trust me.
Thought you might be needing some heIp.
Look at this, man.
It Iooks Iike bIood.
The fIoor's throbbing.
Aw, snap.
It feeIs Iike a heartbeat.
It's just a probIem in the pIumbing.
You're probabIy right... but I'm gonna check it out... and y'aII are coming with me.
Come on.
-Whoa!
-Damn!
What is this?
Look at this, man!
Maurice, what you think that is?
It's rust. Rust never sIeeps.
You caII that rust?
Now where does this go, huh?
Don't ask me.
Now what?
Eat that spinach, boy.
-There you go.
-You got it.
I'm not going down there.
Go ahead, Tia.
I'm right behind you.
Don't get behind me.
Just some fIies. Come on.
What is that smeII?
What'd you expect, Cynthia?
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
FIies, there's shit!
Disgusting!
Space that's so perfect for a recording studio?
Maurice, not now.
Just shut up, man.
He got a point, though.
It'II just take a IittIe more work than I thought.
Think about it.
Put down a reaI fIoor.
Put some dampening on the waII... we'II have totaIIy controIIed sound.
It'II be perfect.
We'II make our first record where no one can hear us scream.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.
Give me some Iight.
HeIIo. Who are you?
Ladies and gentIemen, boys and girIs...
I'd Iike you to meet
Jimmy Bones.
What are you taIking about?
''This is the story of Jimmy Bones...
''bIack as night and hard as stone.
''GoId-pIated deuce
Iike the king of Siam...
''got a switchbIade Ioose and a diamond on his hand.''
There's the switchbIade and the diamond, man.
You teIIing me this couId be him?
Damn. It's so fresh.
Put that thing down!
What are you doing?
You can't take that.
It might be evidence!
Evidence of what?
Patrick, doesn't it seem a IittIe odd to you... that he'd stab himseIf in the chest and bury himseIf?
I agree.
Bones, settIe down!
Do something about the dog.
What we have to do is caII the poIice.
For someone so cute, you're so stupid sometimes.
CaII the poIice, we don't get a permit.
We can't just Ieave him, can we?
-Yes, we can.
-What?!
He ain't goin' nowhere.
We wiII deaI with this after the weekend.
-Let's go!
-Fuck it, whatever!
You put your fingers aII over it!
Maurice,
I'II Ieave you down here.
I'm coming!
Cyn?
What?
You aII right?
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Patrick, what up?
I'm coming.
-Come on.
-I'm coming.
I guess he won't be needing this.
Or this.
WeII, you know she doesn't want me here.
With you...in this house.
Whatever.
It's true.
She doesn't trust you... and neither do I.
I can handIe your mother.
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.
She wiII Iove me, watch.
No, she won't. Trust me.
See, but the X-factor is your daddy.
I don't know nothin' about him.
Neither do I.
I never met him.
She won't taIk about him.
Ever.
Wow. I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's OK.
I'm not sad about it.
It's Iife, you know?
I've never known him, so it's totaIIy normaI to me.
I'm not doing too weII with this.
Yeah, you are.
Patrick, stop.
What?
I can't.
AII right.
Do you want me to take you home?
No. I want to stay with you guys--
No, no, no.
You don't have to expIain.
I understand.
I'II go sIeep with the guys.
Thank you.
You're weIcome.
'Night.
WeIcome... my brothers and my sisters.
We wiII begin with our hymn.
The spirit worId is aII around us at this moment... and the dearIy departed are here... among us, pressing around us.
It's OK. You can stay.
But no getting fresh.
This is nice.
There is a spirit among us.
Who has just joined our circIe?
Lordy, what is that smeII?
Stop. Patrick, cut it out.
Does someone want to send a message?
Knock once for yes and twice for no.
Is it someone in our circIe?
Stop.
Is it Miss LiIIian?
Cut it out.
Is the message for Miss Abernathy?
Patrick, stop.
Is the message for me?
Patrick, stop! Stop!
No! Jimmy! No!
Patrick, stop!
What's wrong?
That sounds Iike your mom.
Open up this door!
What the heII are you doing?
Where's my daughter?
I want to see her now!
You hoId on a moment,
I'II go upstairs--
Come on out here!
I know she's in there!
Cynthia!
Oh, God! Come on, baby.
It'II be OK.
We're gonna get outta here.
Come on.
If you stay in this house one more night... you might as weII be sIeeping in your grave!
Come on.
You certainIy have a way with women, Patrick.
WeII, we're in business.
What?
Where we going?
You know I hate surprises.
It's a IittIe business venture
I made on my own...
I wanted to show you.
I think you wiII approve.
I hope so.
I hope so.
What are we doing down here?
Like you aIways said... we need to Iook for the undervaIued.
It don't get no more undervaIued than this.
Come on, Pop. Just come on.
Bet you didn't know your company owned this pIace.
I went through a broker, so you didn't know it was me... but I couIdn't wait to see your face... when you saw how I fixed it up.
Look at this.
Son, is this some kind of sick joke?
No! Look, Pop.
You Iisten to me, boy.
I didn't work aII of my goddamn Iife... to get out of this neighborhood... for you to move right back in it!
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I'm just trying to do what you did-- take nothing and make something out of it.
Nobody wiII ever come down here, son.
Look at this fucking neighborhood!
Son...shut it down.
Shut it down.
The company wiII buy it back.
No. Not this time, Pop.
I did this on my own, and we wiII open tonight!
BuIIshit!
That is buIIshit!
SeII it back!
That is a fucking order!
Do you fucking hear me?!
Shut it!
You shut it, god damn it!
Shut it down and seII this fucker!
Shut it, Patrick--
What's goin' on, baby?
Jimmy's into it, man.
That's what I'm saying.
Just wait.
Jimmy, what's happening, baby?
Good to see you.
You remember Eddie Mack, don't you?
We met.
We did the afterschooI b-baII thing at Kenwood.
What it is, homeboy?
What it wiII be.
Jimmy, you know
Officer Lupovich, right?
I've heard of him.
Man, you got a nice crib here.
It's nice to see a bIack man doing so weII.
Everybody's happy.
We do aII right.
But things change.
You gotta think ahead.
Got them Iotteries aII over now, Bonesy.
Starting here, too.
Maybe next year.
Yeah, Jimmy.
A Iot of our oId customers... are getting their new peopIe across the state Iines... buying those Iotto tickets.
We need to get on this thing fast.
What do anybody want with them damn Iottery tickets?
What eIse, youngbIood?
Money.
No, man.
It ain't the money.
It's the high.
The big fat fIoating
''What if?''
Dig, it's way more profitabIe, man.
Nobody ever wins, so you never pay out.
But a $2 bet is cheaper than a $20 bag.
I can dig that, but I'm not taIking horse.
I'm taIking a $5 kick in the head... that's a quick ticket to heaven, man.
And fooIs keep coming back.
AII right, baby.
Those fooIs?
They're my peopIe.
I can dig that, man, but it ain't no thing.
It's a poor man's freebase.
Check it out.
I ain't interested, and if you gonna seII it... don't seII it around here.
Man, here, just try it.
I said, no, thanks.
-Man, try this!
-Hey, Huggybear!
I done drove aII this way, man!
Hey! Back off.
Sit down!
That's cooI.
I'm copastetic.
But it's Iike this here, man.
It's the wave comin', man.
A big-ass, Krakatoa, east of Java wave.
Either you gonna be on top... up here in chocoIate heaven... or you'II get caught up in the muddy undertow.
And that's reaI.
That's beautifuI, baby.
TotaIIy widescreen sci-fi forward thinking... and I can dig that... but that's for you and yours.
Me and mines... we cooI as a motherfuckin' icicIe in the freezer.
By the way, your 12 1/2 minutes is up.
Sorry about that, J-Bird.
It's never business, it's aIways pIeasure.
It's cooI, Jimmy.
Did you see this motherfucker?
No, no, no.
Fuck it.
-Hey, Jimmy, Iook.
-Yeah, baby?
Just hear me out on this one.
Pass up the money train and jump his ass on the bus.
His Ioss.
Hear me out on this.
Don't need nothing Iike that.
We cooI.
Drop the piece, homeboy.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Drop the piece, nigger!
Eddie Mack! Come on, baby!
Lupovich, baby, just be cooI.
Everybody just be cooI.
Baby, be cooI.
Be cooI, man.
Jimmy, man, just hear it out.
Just hear out the deaI.
I don't need to hear no deaI.
I don't need no new partners...
I don't need no new product... and I damn sure don't need this cracker's...
Saturday night speciaI in my face.
Just try it. That's aII.
You heard the man.
Try it.
AII right, baby, that's good.
Heat it up!
Like that, Jimmy?
Just Iet it kick in, baby.
Gonna be nice, Jimmy.
Oh, my God!
God damn it!
Don't fucking move!
My one good suit!
God damn it!
TeII her to shut up!
Get your punk ass over there now!
TeII that bitch to stop screaming!
Stop fucking screaming!
You hear me?
What fuck are we gonna do now?
Shut up and Iet me think!
I need this Iike I fucking need a hoIe in my head.
I am not the onIy one in this room... with that nigger's bIood on my hands.
Get his knife.
Everybody Ieaves a print.
We hang together, or we hang separateIy.
Now cut him and cut him good.
What it is, homeboy.
What it wiII be, nigger.
Now you.
Hey! Now you!
J-Bird, heIp me, brother.
I'm sorry, brother.
Since we was grasshoppers.
Like you said.
Every man for himseIf, baby.
Hey, Shaft, it's your turn.
Hey, don't even think about it.
Man, hurry up!
OK, mama, it's your turn.
I won't do it.
Either you cut him... or die with him.
I Iove you.
AII right,
Iet's cIean this shit up.
Take this and bury it with him.
Come on, move!
Get him out of here.
Bet you wish you took the deaI, nigger.
Damn!
Does your mama know that you're here?
What my mama don't know won't hurt her.
I heard that.
Hey, can you take a IittIe extended soIo... right about now, funk souI brother?
What does she Iook Iike,
Maurice?
Thanks, bro.
Baby, if you ain't got any cuIture in you... you're about to have aII of 'em.
Breathin' just gets deeper, baby.
You sweet IittIe gangsta deI amore... eI cacho de Ia cosmos.
We wiII speak the internationaI
Ianguage of Iove.
Yo, bro!
What?
I gotta see what he wants.
I know you're havin' a good time... but couId you pIease go find the gangsta of Iove?
I'm getting vinyI spindonitis, and I know he's upstairs.
AII right.
Keep an eye on Cyn for me.
Thank you.
Maurice! Where you at?
Yo, man, get decent...
'cause I'm comin' in.
Come on, man.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
The gangsta of Iove don't eat no fried chicken.
Oh, shit!
Aw, man!
Hey! Hey, man, where are you goin'?
No, don't run! ReIax!
Stay caIm, don't push!
Hey! Don't push!
ReIax! Don't push! PIease!

What the heII's goin' on?
-Come on!
-Where's Maurice?
He's dead! Get up!
Move! Come on!
Get out of here! Go!
Go!
Run! Run!
I guess you won't be needin' this... or this, motherfucker.
It's OK.
We're safe.
We shouId have done this a Iong time ago.
It's aII right, baby.
He tried to kiII us.
If he wanted to kiII you, you wouId've been dead aIready.
Who is he?
What was he?
Your father.
He was your father.
You have his eyes.
Free at Iast, free at Iast.
Leave me be!
It wasn't my fauIt, man.
I didn't know what they'd pIanned.
Hush.
It don't even matter now.
Lookie here, man.
It's me, baby.
I been on your side aII the way.
Don't you remember, man?
Remember?
I'II show you what I remember.
FeeI better?
I--I had no choice.
What eIse couId I have done?
You couId've died with me.
Or died tryin'.
You're gonna be free and cIear,
Shotgun.
AII debts are paid, baby.
Swing Iow, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Did you do it?
Do what, son?
What are you taIkin' about?
You know what I'm taIkin' about.
The cIub. Did you do it?
I know you didn't want us down there.
I wouIdn't have risked kiIIing you to get you out.
-I was trying to protect you.
-From what?
Why did you give a shit about the buiIding?
Why did you care that we were there, of aII pIaces?
It is just a bad neighborhood,
Patrick.
BuIIshit.
Look, don't Iie to me, Pop.
Come on.
For once, teII me the truth.
Look, I saw your face.
Now, you knew that pIace, and you knew those peopIe.
It's the past, Patrick.
It's dead.
Dead?

You got a supernaturaI high?

Big bad-ass Eddie Mack... got shit for brains, and that's a fact.

Sure. Here it is.
Mama?
He's gonna kiII every Iast one of 'em.
KiII who?
Eddie Mack, that cop, and Jeremiah.
And those kids.
Maybe they deserved it.
Maybe we aII deserve it.
Patrick doesn't.
And his brother and sister don't.
I don't.
I'II try something.
I have nothing Ieft to Iose-- onIy you.
This what you want, right?
Oh, it tickIes!

Don't nobody stand up the mack daddy.

Quit pIayin'.
I don't wanna pIay these type of games. Come on.
Shit! I aImost broke--

Motherfuckers wanna act ignorant?
Where the fuck you at?
You wanna jump, motherfucker?
You wanna be froggy nigger?
Leap!
Jimmy Bones, is that you?
We kiIIed you, motherfucker, and buried your ass... in nothing but your bitch's bIoody rags.
Now I can count the hoIes in your motherfuckin' chest.
Is that it?
Your big-ass tidaI wave?
You think I'm-a do it?
Think I'm-a do it?
Fuck you, Jimmy, you jive-ass nigger.
Man, where the fuck are you at?
I'm here.
Where the fuck are you?
Man, I'm at the spot where I said I was gonna be.
-Now get your ass over here!
-I'II meet you there.
Bones, you motherfucker.
What you done to me?
Not haIf of what I'm pIannin' on.
Man, this is some twisted shit, man.
What you need with my head?
I'm just usin' it to carry your souI, sucker.
My souI? Fuck you.
I kiIIed you, you kiIIed me-- we even!
Damn, why you gotta get aII meta-fuckin'-physicaI, nigger?
Shit! I'm sick--
You just gonna bang my shit up against the waII?
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
I need this Iike I fuckin' need a hoIe in my head.
Oh, yeah, you better be scared.
What?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You heard the man.
Try it!
You next, Lou.
I toId your ass, boy.
If you wanna get ahead in Iife...
Was that fuckin' necessary, man?
What's up with these gates?
Let's see if these gates can save Jeremiah... when his past comes caIIin'.
We have to save him.
Save who?
Can Jeremiah come out and pIay?
What it is, and what it wiII be, my brother.
And it wiII be your ass.
How the heII did you get in here?
At a time Iike this... is that what you reaIIy wanna know?
How the fuck I got in here?
Oh, my God, Jimmy.
Dad!
What the heII are you guys doing?
Somebody pIease teII me--
Yeah, right.
It makes me feeI better.
Where are you going?
I just caIIed 911.
Then we reaIIy gotta go,
'cause I can't expIain this.
I'II be back, hopefuIIy with Dad.
-We're coming with you.
-No, you're not.
You gotta stay with Mom !
Jesus fucking Christ, what is this pIace? Oh, my God!
Shut the fuck up.
You two bitches were just meat.
You never had any idea smarter than getting yourseIves... a IittIe bit more.
But my brother J-Bird, here, this nigger was smart.
He didn't just want more.
He wanted more with compound interest.
Come on, Jimmy. PIease, man.
-Get Lou.
-Get him.
Get that fucker.
Bye, Loopy Lou!
-It's the bIood.
-What, Mama?
Remember when I toId you that a person... has more than two parts, they have three?
Body, souI, and spirit?
The spirit
Iives in the bIood... and the spirit keeps the body and souI together... and sometimes the spirit Iives on.
Jimmy's bIood must stiII be in that buiIding.
Let's go.
Look here, Jimmy.
I got $20,000 saved up, buried.
Don't nobody know where it is but me.
You can have haIf of it.
AII right.
You can have it aII, man.
Come on, man.
I reaIIy don't--
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Come on, man, Jimmy!
And now, J-Bird, my brother... it's time for you to coIIect your interest.
This is it.
We found that skeIeton right down here.
AII right, it was here.
Right here!
-What'd he have on?
-Nothin'.
No, wait, there was a green rag.
My god, my dress.
My bIoody dress.
We gotta burn it.
We gotta cIose the door.
Find my dress!
The bIood on the dress is keeping him aIive!
-I couIdn't find anything!
-Look for it!
You was my main man.
Since we was grasshoppers.
I aIways Iooked after you.
You had a piece of everything I had.
I didn't want a piece of yours, Jimmy.
I wanted my own.
And fuck everybody eIse, huh?
God damn, Jimmy!
Think about it, Jimmy.
If it had happened to you... you wouId've done the same goddamn thing, man.
Nah, brother.
I wouIdn't have done any manner of what you did.
It's a trip, ain't it?
Oh, my God.
Are you aII right?
-Baby, you OK?
-She's aII right.
-Be carefuI!
-Oh, heII, no!
BiII, sIow down! Be carefuI.
Don't get hurt. Be carefuI.
Oh, shit.
Watch your step.
Stay back.
Come back!
Find Jeremiah!
Mama, come back!
TeII me, Jimmy.
What wiII it take, huh?
What do you want?
Just teII me, Jimmy!
Oh, man, that's easy.
Think you can give me my Iife back?
Can you swing that, brother?
You know I can't do that!
You're fuckin' dead!
Dog eat dog, brother.
Dog eat dog.
-We can cIimb out.
-Where?
Anywhere but here.
Come on, man. Let's go.
Turn around, baby.
You know I aIways Ioved you in this dress.
Oh, damn.
Come on, give me your hand.
Look out. You cooI?
AII right.
Did he create aII this?
No, but he's a part of it.
This is... the city of the dead.
We just have to remember what was here and foIIow it.
Those stairs shouId take us to the second fIoor.
Didn't I teII you, baby?
Didn't I teII you I'd be strokin' your neck tonight?
I took out my revenge
'cause I had to.
Now stay here with me-- forever.
OK, where do we go now?
Oh, not now.
Come on!
Oh, my God.
Bro, where you goin'?
-Maurice, where you goin'?
-BiII, wait!
That's not Maurice.
Where you goin', man?
Where the heII you at?
He's gone.
This way.
Cynthia, wait.
I gotta find BiII.
WeIcome home, baby girI.
Cynthia, no. Wait.
Cyn, wait!
HeIp me, Patrick, pIease!
Dad?
PIease, Patrick.
Oh, no, Dad.
HeIp me, Patrick!
Jimmy Bones did this, Patrick!
HeIp me, Patrick!
HeIp me!
Surprise, nigger.
Die!
Die, motherfucker, die!
Stop it!
Stop it, pIease!
Daddy, Iet him go!
Daddy, stop!
Stop!
I Iove you.
Mama!
Oh, my God!
Cynthia! Come on!
We gotta go now!
Run! Come on! Let's go!
PIease!
Come on! Run, Cyn, run!
-AII right, we have to jump!
-I can't!
We have to! Now!
Cyn! Come on!
Come on! Jump! Hurry up!
Are you aII right?
Come on, baby, we gotta go!
Come on! Go, go, go!
Oh, shit! Go!
Dog eat dog, boy.
Dog eat dog.
Is that the new guy?
[Man responds in Spanish]
[Dialogue in Spanish]
[Martial instrumental music]
[Woman speaks in Spanish]
Sí, mi amiga.
We are completamente seguros here...
...because l've selected my position carefully.
First rule of engagement:
Know your enemy.
Second rule: Know where to engage him.
You've kept your engines running.
I want maximum heat emissions...
...from these coordinates.
Mucho caliente. Comprende?
The time, 5:00.
The place, seven klicks south of El Chaco.
The situation:
A single graboid reported in the area two weeks ago.
The third appearance of these underground carnivores in the last 1 1 years.
Unfortunately, lack of action on the part of local authorities...
...has allowed the creature to metamorphose...
...into the second stage of its life cycle, producing six shriekers...
...a voracious, hermaphroditic life-form...
...which can double in number every few minutes by eating sufficient food.
In this case, chickens.
[Eerie screeching]
Ay, Dios mío!
A truckload of chickens. lnfrared monitoring now indicates the shrieker herd...
...moving across the pampas toward us...
...closing at less than 300 meters. l've managed to lead the shrieker herd away from civilian population.
My tactical approach is utilize various maneuvers...
...demonstrated by Sitting Bull at Little Bighorn...
...and Field Marshal Rommel during the North Africa campaign.
The idea being to set up a proper kill zone.
[Distant explosion]
BURT: l should take this opportunity to point out their zero tactical skills.
[Screeching approaches]
BURT: Lacking eyes or ears, they can sense only heat and....
[Man tries to interrupt]
Patience, mi amigo.
[Exhortations in Spanish]
Nothing to worry about...
...because for once l have the proper tool at hand.
[Martial instrumental music]
Looking for a little heat?
[Shriekers screech and howl]
Any questions?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Horn honks]
MlGUEL: Burt, welcome home.
We saw you on CNN shooting that cannon thing.
Dual .50 antiaircraft turret mount.
Good to see you, Miguel.
What the hell is that?
Some real estate guys out of Reno.
They want to cut up the valley into parcels.
-That'll be a cold day in hell.
-That's what l told them.
Burt, while you were gone...
...there was this conga line of cement trucks going up to your place.
What are you building up there? l installed an underground graboid barrier, my own design.
Big cement box, two-feet thick, steel reinforced...
...completely surrounding my compound...
...sides and bottom.
Now l can sleep nights.
Come on, Burt. What's it been, 11 years?
No reason to lower your guard.
Burt, welcome home.
Put in a bar code reader?
Jodi, they can use that to build a profile on all my purchases.
Burt, welcome home.
Yeah, welcome.
Next they'll want a sample of my DNA.
How have you been?
JODl: l guess l'm getting by.
BURT: Getting by? You're doing better than your uncle ever did.
JODl: ln retail, if you're not three steps ahead, you're one step behind.
JODl: You want your mail?
BURT: Yeah, l guess.
Perfection Valley Ranchettes.
They've been making offers to all of us.
Shall l file it for you?
JODl: Cool watch.
BURT: Gift from the gauchos.
It continuously updates its time to the nanosecond...
...by connecting directly to the cesium clock in Colorado...
...via ultrasonic frequency.
Well above our normal range of hearing, but it'll give a dog fits.
Right. So, were you able to get me graboid or shrieker parts:
Beaks, tentacles, claws?
Aren't you overdoing all this a little?
Burt, this stuff is our claim to fame.
China has pandas. Australia has koalas.
And we've got these...
...even if they are extinct here.
Are you trying to turn the valley into a theme park? lt worked for your friends, Earl and Grady. l'm just fighting for my piece of the leisure dollar. But this...
...this is your theme park kind of guy.
BURT: ''Desert Jack's Graboid Adventure,'' who the hell is this yahoo?
He moved in while you were gone, started this business...
...taking people out on graboid safaris. l don't believe this.
JACK: [Over loudspeaker]
Believe it, ladies and gentlemen.
This is no theme park simulation here.
You are in the heart of graboid country.
These savage subterrestrials...
...these death-dealing denizens of dirt...
...first appeared about 1 1 years ago.
Yeah, you keep your eyes peeled, your mind and body centered.
These things can jump up at any moment.
What the--
Just a jackrabbit, folks. Just a jackrabbit.
Breathe and release. There you go.
These suckers, I've seen one jump...
...clear 50 feet out of the ground, like a volcano.
Swallowed a semi-truck whole.
Now that's what I call roadkill.
I tell you, yes, friends, this whole area is a major feeding ground.
Just over that ridge there is where a simple shepherd...
...named Old Fred lost his herd of sheep.
Yeah, and everything else from the neck down.
Now as l said, we're in the heart of graboid country.
Right in the heart of it.
Whoa!
JACK: Looks like we have company, folks.
BOY: Man. ls that a graboid?
JACK: Yeah, looks like it. Get back, son, you're going to lose a limb now.
[Screams] Oh, God!
JACK: lt's flooded!
BOY: Calm down, lady!
Has it spotted us yet? l don't know. l can't tell.
But it's bigger than l've ever seen.
Look!
Oh, God!
BOY: Here it comes!
JACK: Take control of yourself, don't panic.
Keep going. Come on. Moving in!
Well, we'd better get the hell out of Dodge!
Come on now.
We got it. lt's called divine intervention.
Just stick with Jack, you're going to make it back.
That's one. l think he picked up our scent.
-Thought they only hunt by sound.
-That's what l meant, sound.
Four!
All right, baby. Been waiting for you.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now, hop on this here rock.
Here you go. Here you go.
Give me your hand, darling. Come on.
All right.
Hang on to your hat now.
Here's the rest of us.
We got everybody now?
Let's see here, one, two, three, four, five.
That's good. Well, l think we just best wait it out a spell.
How long do you think it will be?
Well, ma'am, time is the eternal river. l suggest we not swim upstream.
Damn, it's hot out here.
JACK: Anybody up for an ice-cold beer? l got $3 a bottle domestic, $4.50 imported.
Also, might l recommend my fresh fruit juices?
Monster Mango. Graboid Grape.
For a buck extra, you can keep the souvenir glass.
Glows in the dark. Look at that.
[Martial instrumental music]
RECORDlNG: Please enter access code...
...or Level 1 security program will be activated in ten seconds.
Nine seconds, eight seconds, seven seconds...
...six seconds, five seconds.
JACK: Thank you for your business. l'd say we got pretty lucky out there today.
-Absolutely.
-All we saw was dust.
That's all you want to see, believe me, son.
Stay on the blacktop now till you're clear out of the valley.
Tell your friends about us.
JACK: Got to restock the cooler here.
By the way, you didn't pay me for that bag of ice this morning.
JACK: Well, you know, l thought it was complimentary ice. l'm in business here, Jack.
So am l. l've been thinking you ought to sell me my refreshments at wholesale.
-Because?
-lt's a part of our symbiotic relationship.
Symbiotic relationship.
That's a good one, Jack.
JACK: You see, Jodi, all things are related.
My business brings business to your business.
Probably like an increase of about, approximately around...
Actually...
...22%, with questionable sustainability.
Questionable sustainability?
Do you have a business plan? l try not to plan too much. l trust in the ebb and flow of the universe.
You have to plan to be a viable entity in today's economic landscape.
See, me, l'm in phase three of establishing my product identity.
You know, L.L. Bean, ''canoey,'' outdoorsy.
Land's End, ''golf clubby,'' ''sailboaty.'' l see. l see. Chang's Market. ls that, you know, that, kind of ''deserty,''
''underground monstery''?
JODl: Exactly.
All righty.
Sure hope nothing stops you from becoming a viable entity...
...because l hate when that happens. l'm billing you for that complimentary ice.
[Deep underground rumbling]
You know, l really like this clay. lt doesn't crack in the kiln, but it is so expensive. l can get 10% off if you order 200 pounds.
Yeah, l can't even afford that.
-Hi, Jodi.
-Hey, Mindy.
MlNDY: Can you give these to Jack when he comes in?
Sure. Throw them on the table.
Thanks.
Mindy, l think Jack was expecting you to sew those pants...
...not just stick tape on them.
Mom, tape is a total statement.
People like Jack and l understand that. l was into safety pins, myself.
-Hey, Burt.
-Hey, Mindy.
BURT: l thought you were off at school.
Mom didn't tell you? l had to drop out.
We couldn't afford the tuition.
So, l'm back working at the Arby's down in Bixby...
...and trying to survive my mother.
Well, l hope things work out.
Thanks.
JACK: Beer is inside.
There you go. Watch your step.
Gummer? ls that you? lt is, isn't it?
Damn!
Real pleasure to meet you, sir.
Jack Sawyer. l've started up this little tour business.
Kind of an homage to you guys.
I would be honored if you would consider being a part of it.
Sign a few autographs...
...maybe a little weapons demonstration.
MlLTON: Mom, take a picture of me with the tremor.
MlLTON'S MOM: Cute idea.
They're called graboids.
Come on over here, folks.
Look who I've got for you. Come on down!
The legendary Mr. Burt Gummer himself.
MlLTON: Mom, it's the gun guy. lt is.
Here, Milton.
Stand right here, up straight.
You don't mind, do you?
Straight, honey. Nice and tall. Taller!
Say ''graboids.''
-Graboids.
-Oh, great.
Thank you so much, Mr. Goober.
You had that look on your face.
What was that about?
MlLTON: Don't start, Mom.
They're out of their gourd right now.
My inner voice has been telling me...
...you and l are destined to work together.
What do you think? lf l had an inner voice it'd be telling me to tell you to get lost.
Well, you know, take your time.
You just think about it and get back to me now.
He'll come around.
Buford! Get your head out of your pants.
Just looking at the scenery.
Drooling on yourself.
Go set up for the next group.
You don't have to be so mean.
Boy, you're about as sharp as a bowling ball.
Yeah, tough guy.
Hi, Mindy.
That skull was ripped wide open, boy.
Eyeballs popping out. Ugly!
Now as l said, you're in the heart of graboid country.
Yeah, you're right in the heart of it.
Let me tell you something, boys...
...you're right in the frigging heart of it!
WOMAN: Honey, did you see that?
MAN: Sweet Jesus! Look!
JACK: Having a little engine trouble, folks.
Stay calm. Stay calm.
WOMAN: Where is it?
JACK: Stick with Jack, you'll make it back.
JACK: Hold on to your hats.
MlNDY: Help, help, graboid attack.
This is what you guys do all day? l mean, no offense, Buford, but it's like tragically lame.
This is a good living.
Compared to what l was doing before.
Which was?
Well, l was...
...shoveling roadkill for the county.
Okay, l get you, but...
...why is Jack wasting his time...
...scamming yahoos with this Scooby-Doo routine? l bet there are a zillion better things a guy like that could do. l bet he's nursing a broken heart.
Or something totally tragic. l bet he's just dying to talk to somebody who understands him.
JACK: All right, we got everybody now?
Damn, it's hot out here.
Anybody up for an ice-cold beer?
You know, l couldn't help but notice that you're getting...
...awfully red out here in the sun.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Do you really have to keep doing that?
When is this tour going to be over, anyway?
You don't enjoy my company, huh?
A man could take offense at that.
What's that?
[Buford screams]
[Suspenseful music]
MlNDY: [Screams] Freeze! ls he all right?
[Deep underground rumbling]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Gulps]
[Graboid hisses]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Keys clatter]
[Suspenseful music]
JACK: Come on, give me your hand!
This thing is not even real!
MlNDY: Everybody, shut up!
JACK: Listen to her!
MAN: Who's that other guy?
MlNDY AND JACK: Shut the hell up!
Jack's jeep can outrun it, but we need a diversion.
Some noise! Everybody, grab something.
WOMAN: Like what?
MlNDY: Like anything.
We're going to throw stuff out that way...
...then we're going to pile in the Jeep and haul ass.
Got it? Okay. On three.
One, two, three! Okay!
[Camera clatters]
MAN: Where's my camera?
You threw away my brand-new camera?
[Rapid electronic beeping]
This time we're ready for you.
[Siren blares]
This shipment of graboids has four tentacles instead of three.
They look ridiculous.
Nobody is going to buy them.
-What the hell is that?
-lt's Burt's siren.
JODl: The graboid ladder? lt can't be real, Nancy.
NANCY: He wouldn't blow the siren unless it was for real. l hope Mindy's okay.
Hope she doesn't do something stupid. l'm not paying for them!
MAN: lf you ask me, there's something very amateurish about this operation.
You take people into a life-or-death situation, and you don't have a real gun?
Are you even licensed to do this?
You wanted to see a graboid, you saw a graboid. l advise you to hit the highway and don't stop till you reach Seattle. l expect you to pay for that camera!
NANCY: Mindy, thank God!
What's going on?
MlNDY: Mom, they're back.
We just made it out.
Graboids? Live ones?
JACK: Burt, we found one.
Son of a bitch killed Buford. l mean, boom and he was gone.
The thing is like the size of a whale.
Yep, l've seen them.
NANCY: Burt, is it okay?
Can we come down?
Come on down. They're not close.
You check the seismo-monitor l gave you? lt's not working very well. l think the batteries are dead or something.
Come on, Burt. lt's been, what, 11 years?
[Radio crackles]
Burt here. Talk to me.
MlGUEL: Burt, was that siren noise for real?
Affirmative.
No me chingas.
BURT: You on your roof?
MlGUEL: Damn right, l am.
Check your seismo-monitor?
Any graboid activity near your ranch?
Burt, that aerial thing, it got bent, man. l've been meaning to fix it.
Well, now it's all hands on deck, Miguel.
So, l suggest you bug out asap, maintain a steady speed on your truck...
...and report to HQ at Chang's, you copy that?
[Cows bellow]
[Deep underground rumbling]
BURT: Good news, there are only three.
JODl: How do you know that?
BURT: A few years ago, l put a geophone monitoring system around the valley.
Data transmits to my laptop, gets triangulated. lt's all based on Rhonda LeBeck's geological research.
-l sell all her books.
-The comics were better.
Totally.
[Clears throat]
They're moving slowly down from the north, just like last time...
...from Jasmer quadrangle, straight down the valley...
BURT: ...into Calypso quadrangle.
MlNDY: Huh?
-l think he means Cactus Flats.
-Why can't he just say it?
So, what do we do?
Your little jungle boat ride is over, mister.
-Time to fish or cut bait.
-So what do we do?
NANCY: Burt, excuse me, but we're not cut off this time.
We don't have to act like militia nitwits.
We'll call for help.
BURT: Nancy, since no one has bothered to maintain their seismic equipment...
...we don't know how long they've been active...
...and therefore have no idea when they may become shriekers.
We can't wait for the authorities.
We are the authorities.
What do we do?
We hunt them down.
We wipe them out.
We can go at dawn.
BURT: These are perfect.
BURT: How many do you have in stock?
JODl: Eleven.
Need to requisition all of them.
Requisition. Am l getting reimbursed?
BURT: Not today.
JACK: How does it work?
JACK: Killing them with a toy truck?
-Graboids hunt by sensing--
-Sound. l know.
A graboid hears a toy truck, goes after it just like a cat to catnip.
-lt's in the comic books.
-When he swallows detonate the explosive.
Boom! End of worm.
Explosive.
Where are we going to get the explosive?
This, not being an officially sanctioned event...
...l've provided something of my own design.
MlGUEL: Don't worry about Burt.
He knows what he's doing. lt's like his thing. Put these on my tab.
BURT: Mount up and move out.
JODl: You don't have a tab!
MlNDY: Jack, l'm going with you.
No, you're not.
BURT: Yes, sir?
STATLER: Good morning. Mr. Gummer?
'Morning.
Agent Frank Statler.
-My cousin, he went back to Mexico.
-l've filed for my business license.
The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.
Department of the lnterior.
This gentleman is Field Agent Rusk of the BLM...
...and Dr. Andrew Merliss,
Director of Paleontology at Smithsonian.
We don't have time to chat.
We've got work to do.
Not if it's hunting graboids, you don't. l called them, Burt.
STATLER: l was granted authority to insure adherence to Section 1472-B...
...of the Endangered Species Act...
...which guards the welfare of large-class desert reptilians. l'm enforcing an immediate ban on hunting of graboids in Perfection Valley.
Those are my cattle out there, pendejo.
MlGUEL: The BLM man gave permission to kill anything dangerous to my cattle.
El lobo, el coyote and el graboid.
Your BLM man reports to him, who reports to me...
...and l'm here to tell you there will be no more killing of graboids.
So, we let them live, and we become the endangered species.
You have been instrumental in the eradication of the oldest...
...rarest species on earth.
Not once, but on three separate occasions, on two continents.
Defending lives and property, a guest of two foreign governments.
-Are you even aware of the public outcry?
-Public? Not this public.
Our mandate is simple:
To investigate, trap and transport at least one creature for study.
Trap and transport?
When you find out that's impossible, we'll be overcome with shriekers. lf we discover there is a threat to public safety...
...we're prepared to evacuate
Perfection Valley and seal it off.
Wait a minute! You'd make us leave?
That's not why l called you. l called you here to help us.
The government will offer compensation for your property. That's a given.
Eminent domain.
And people call me paranoid.
JACK: l don't think you're paranoid.
MlGUEL: l do, but not no more.
[Rifle shots]
[Rapid electronic beeping]
[Deep rumbling]
Son of a bitch!
[Martial instrumental music]
[Sinister instrumental music]
BURT: ''Call me lshmael.''
Now if you would kindly lean your endangered carcass...
...over my property line. l'll call your untimely demise self-defense.
JODl: Damn stupid graboids.
Can't afford to get eminent domain out.
Every cent l have is tied to this business.
Well, at least you got a business.
JACK: Body language says it all.
RUSK: Does it say l could use a cold beer?
JODl: What will it be?
RUSK: Miller Lite.
JACK: Yeah, we still don't have cell towers.
You can use the pay phone.
Outside it's CBs and walkie-talkies only.
RUSK: Charming.
You guys weren't serious about making us move out, were you?
Unless we can catch one of them, we may have no choice. lt kind of seems like a small operation. l mean, to catch one whole graboid.
We don't have much of a budget. lt's not a high priority in Washington.
But if you did catch one...
...l mean, you boys would go home heroes, right?
Look good on a resume.
And your point would be?
The one guy who knows about these things...
...the one guy who could help out...
...is warming up the bench because you took him out of the game. l didn't take him out of the game.
BURT: [Over radio] May I remind you, Jack, they are not your friends?
They are government agents. Over.
JACK: [Over radio] Cut me some slack.
All I did was negotiate.
BURT: You did what?
JACK: l cut us a deal.
We help catch one live graboid, they give you back your hunting license.
BURT: Copy that. Roger. One question.
JACK: Shoot. ls your head up your ass for the warmth?
We thought you'd be happy.
-You want to get eminent domained out?
-Catch a live graboid? lt's hard enough to kill one without saturation bombing. l told them, Burt Gummer, he'd come up with something.
The bastards are smart, and they'll get smarter.
You're still here, aren't you? l'd say you're up to it.
So, Mr. Gummer, what do you think?
Fish or cut bait.
You...
...say you have some sort of tranquilizer.
RUSK: Yeah, we're using tranq darts.
We got them to chase us, but couldn't get these to penetrate dirt. l'm ordering titanium tips and a more powerful launch gun.
Of course, you could squander the taxpayers' money...
...but l can get a graboid to swallow this...
...with this, for $49.95.
Then, if it goes to sleep, you can dig it up...
...take it back to Area 51...
...or whatever fits your plausible deniability. l don't understand what you just said, but do we have a deal?
Because we want to know what we should do.
You guys do what you do best.
Find something simple and complicate it. lt's good he expresses himself.
Repressed emotions can be real toxic.
He needs counseling.
-Get in!
-Huh?
You got me into this.
All right!
BURT: Use the door!
MERLlSS: lt's unbelievable!
Frank, Charlie. lt's unbelievable.
Unbelievable. l was doing cores...
...out where they recorded the earliest graboid movements.
Voila! l hit this on my third dig. lt's an egg. l've proven they come from eggs.
I've already carbon-dated it.
The yolk remains are current...
...but the shell is over 300 years old.
-Graboids must have come from these.
-They lay dormant for 300 years? lt appears so. l need to use your phone. l must call the museum.
JODl: l'll give you $50 for that. lt's going straight to the Smithsonian.
All right, all right. $100.
Somebody getting married?
First, we make enough noise to lure one in close.
Then, we use the remote-controlled truck as bait.
Damn feds. l told them to butt out.
JACK: No, l think that's somebody else.
Well, Burt. Long time no see.
Looking good. Hard core as ever.
-Melvin?
-lt's Mel, actually.
How come you never answer our letters, and l got to drive all the way out here?
Perfection Valley Ranchettes. That's you?
You said l'd never amount to anything.
Look, Burt, we're making some really good deals here.
Between you and me, because we're friends...
...you'll get twice what we're offering the others.
What the hell are you doing?
You grew up here.
Exactly. l wouldn't wish this place on anybody.
So, come on, Burt. What do you say? l'd say, l'll give you a ten-second head start.
People are folding, Burt, and l got this whole county in my pocket.
You can't hold out forever. l was born to hold out.
[Electronic beeping]
Burt, is this bad? lt looks kind of bad here.
JACK: ls this bad? lt's....
Graboid. One of them spotted us.
Freeze. Everybody, quiet.
-A graboid?
-Quiet!
Are you kidding?
MEL: For real?
[Pager beeps]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Burt screams]
Burt! Burt, hang on!
Hey, Burt, hang on. l'll get a rope.
[Melancholy music]
[Radio crackles]
Yeah.
BURT: [Over radio]
Houston, we have a problem.
-Burt?
-Affirmative.
Are you okay?
BURT: Not much time.
Only got limited air. What's my 20?
Hold on. Hold on.
JACK: Well, you're about a quarter mile west-- No, better make that east of me.
BURT: Couple of miles from my place, engage the graboid.
What?
BURT: Drive like hell, and lead the bastard through my front gate. Copy?
Yeah, l copy, but....
BURT: Out of air. Burt out.
Burt! Burt, what do l do when l get there?
What do l do? Burt! Burt!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Come on, graboid.
Come on, baby, come on!
Come on, baby.
We are running with the graboid.
Holy shit!
Head-on collision.
Burt! Burt, are you down there?
[Silence]
Hang on. l'll be right there.
[Sound of crashing tools]
Hold on, buddy! Hang on, buddy!
Just breathe!
Come on, baby!
Hang on, buddy!
Hang on!
Jack! That Melvin guy said you got attacked!
What the hell are you doing? l'd prefer...
...we keep this...
...to ourselves.
[Faint martial motif]
You guys definitely need to be supervised.
BURT: Burt here. You read me?
Come back.
Come back. Burt here. Come back! ls that a graboid?
BURT: Yeah, but we should be seeing two of them.
BURT: Have either of you heard from the feds?
BURT: l can't raise them.
JACK: Not since this morning. l guess they've gone out of radio range.
They were chasing a graboid.
They were chasing it? lt wasn't chasing them? l don't like that.
So, maybe they scared it.
Jesus, what is that?
Dr. Merliss, what happened?
[Sobbing] We found the graboid.
On the surface.
-lt was--
-Hollow. Split open.
Yeah, split open. Split open.
When we examined it...
...the sound. l heard this screaming.
And then they were all around us.
So fast!
Rusk and Statler...
...torn to pieces! l hid in my van, but they were ripping it apart. l remembered something.
Don't let them see body heat. l sprayed myself. lt's cold. lt's so cold.
-That was good. That was good thinking.
-No.
Not entirely effective, l'm afraid.
MlGUEL: Mi madre!
BURT: [Radio] Nancy, Mindy. Come back.
NANCY: Yes, Burt. We're on Chang's roof.
MlNDY: ls the graboid still around?
BURT: We've got a bigger problem now.
-Squealers?
-No, screechers.
Shriekers.
The government team is all dead.
NANCY: My God.
BURT: These SOBs don't hunt by sound.
They see heat with sensor organs on their heads.
BURT: You've got to hide your body heat somehow. Copy.
Hide our body heat?
Burt, we copy.
Can't track shriekers with geophones...
...so l'm rigged to download infrared satellite images.
When shriekers first emerge, there are only six of them. lf we can kill them before they find food and multiply, we have a chance.
Okay, here we go.
Preston Dry Lake. Jeep trail.
There we are. Those are our cars, right?
Reading the engine heat.
BURT: Bingo. We have a visual.
JODl: Two, four. There are seven of them.
You mean, they're already making more of themselves?
Yeah, they munched on Statler and Rusk.
We better get moving.
[Fast-paced instrumental music] l totally hate my life.
Damn, l still don't see them.
JODl: How do you focus these things?
BURT: Here, try these.
JACK: Better get that satellite thing again.
JACK: We got you covered.
BURT: That's it, right there.
MlGUEL: There's eight of them.
JODl: What are they eating?
Coyotes, lizards, snakes. They don't care.
This is really serious. l keep trying to tell you people!
How far are your cattle?
-lf they get to your herd, we're in trouble.
-Burt, look.
Look there. They're going into that box canyon over there.
JACK: There's only one way out of there.
-lf we get there before--
-l'm with you.
We just roll in and mop those little devils up.
Graboids!
BURT: Go! Go!
JACK: Come on! Come on!
Miguel! Where the hell....
Es blanco.
Holy shit. l've never seen a live one.
Holy shit!
What do we do now?
Radio Nancy and Mindy to call for some kind of help.
JACK: Damn thing tried to eat my Jeep.
What the hell is it thinking?
The engine. He went for the noise.
Haven't you read the graboid comics? lt's all in there.
Freaking slug. l owe money on that thing.
-Jack, you got your walkie?
-lt's in my Jeep.
Where's yours?
BURT: On my hood.
Well, l guess we just wait.
BURT: Darn! Man!
JODl: Are you worried that the shriekers might get out...
...and go eat Miguel's cattle, and, l don't know, the rest of Nevada?
Absolutely. But l do not dwell on that over which l have no control.
That's great. l have to do all the dwelling. lf you choose to.
You know what l've found?
Most people prefer your dramatic cumulus and nimbus clouds.
But l've always had a weakness for a cirrus.
Yeah. Wispy, and way up there, you know? l wouldn't know.
-Well, don't you ever look up?
-l'm busy.
Too busy to look up?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, l am. l'm working for myself here.
All right? l could have stayed in San Francisco...
...parlayed my MBA into a six-figure income. But, hey. l'm busting my ass eking a living out here...
JODl: ...to build something for myself.
JACK: l know it's not easy.
But l just think you can enjoy yourself while you eke.
Who says l'm not enjoying myself?
You know, l don't have to justify myself to you.
[Silently mouths response]
Foodmall?
You said you bought all your supplies from me! l don't recall signing any purchasing agreement. lt was a verbal commitment. lt was understood, okay? ln exchange for tying up my telephone lines and my computer.
You're getting free overhead, pal.
And, for your information, l do enjoy myself. l do.
Well, one bit of good news.
The shriekers are still in the canyon.
BURT: Got to be the same one l saw outside my house.
Albino, l think.
We used to have a female goat like that.
No kids.
MlGUEL: lmpossible.
BURT: Sterile?
Maybe that's why El Blanco hasn't turned into Los Shriekers.
Son of a--
[Alarm beeps]
BURT: 5:00, on the dot.
Be sunrise soon. ln 37 minutes, 32 seconds.
MlGUEL: Hey, Burt. Heads up!
BURT: What?
BURT: Why, you....
MlGUEL: He follows you, Burt. l think he's got a thing for you.
BURT: lf l could reach my
Grizzly .50-caliber, l'd have a thing for him.
[Eerie screeching] ls that them? lt must be!
But l've never heard them make a noise like that before.
Like coyotes...
...with their kill.
BURT: They're still in the canyon.
Can't afford to wait. l've got to get to my radio.
Wait, Burt! Try this. l saw it on a repeat of MacGyver.
Dental floss! l always carry it.
MlGUEL: There. There, there.
MlGUEL: Yeah. Come on. Come on!
MlGUEL: There, you got it.
BURT: Yes!
Nancy! Mindy! Burt here. Come back!
What's up?
We're pinned down by...
...this great white graboid, and we need an assist. l want you to make one hell of a racket over the radio. Copy?
You want noise, Burt? l copy that.
-Honey, what's going on?
-Burt just phoned in a request.
[Hard rock blares over radio]
MlGUEL: He's going for it.
BURT: Here we go. One more.
MlGUEL: lt's coming back!
BURT: Yep.
BURT: He's taken the bait.
Jodi, Jack, let's move it.
-This is yours: .308, four shots in the mag.
-l don't know-- lt won't bite you. Jack, grab your
Weatherby and let's do this.
-My ''Weather'' what?
-Your rifle. ln your gun rack?
The gun is not real.
Borrowed it off some movie guy.
BURT: Here. You do know which end the bullets come out of?
JACK: l've seen movies.
BURT: Here. You look cold.
Now, let's go bag our limit of shriekers.
Come on!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
MlGUEL: Has to be right around that bend.
[Gusting noise]
JACK: What the--
JODl: Jeez, what are they doing?
BURT: l do not know.
BURT: Let's tenderize them a little.
MlGUEL: l remember these babies.
BURT: Cover!
[Massive explosion]
Holy shit! He doesn't fool around.
Burt is very committed.
Come on, come on! Let's hit them!
[Jack whoops]
JACK: Check it out!
Vaporized them! l mean, there's nothing left.
No, no. We should see remains.
They wouldn't just disintegrate!
-How do you know?
-l've blown them up before!
MlGUEL: lt looks like they shed some kind of husk or skin, like a snake. l don't like that.
Maybe they went back underground.
Let's just go find my truck.
[Somber instrumental music]
MlGUEL: Burt! l really liked that truck.
JODl: Man. That has to hurt. lt was new, wasn't it?
MlGUEL: At least it died for a good reason.
And my Grizzly Big Bore. My sidearms.
My ammo.
JODl: Something moved, over behind the fence.
[Roaring]
JACK: lt's a shrieker?
Not no more, it's not.
BURT: ln Mexico and Argentina, we killed them before they lived 12 hours.
JACK: This is what happens when you don't?
JODl: They just keep mutating like a virus?
BURT: l have no idea!
BURT: Hey, look. That son of a gun has the same heat sensor.
Tracking us.
[Roars menacingly] lt's not smart to track Burt.
What's it doing now?
JODl: What the....
JACK: Point, shoot! Come on!
Point, shoot!
No!
JODl: Oh, my God.
-l shouldn't have taken that shot.
-Should have shot sooner!
JACK: How could you know it was going to take off like a goddamn rocket?
[Melancholy music]
Jack, give me your walkie.
Nancy, Mindy? Burt here. Come back.
Yeah, Burt. We're here.
Nancy, listen. They....
They killed Miguel. He's gone.
Oh, my God, no.
What, Miguel? No!
Nancy? Jodi here.
JODl: [Over radio]
The shriekers can fly now.
So, get off the roof.
You're not safe up there anymore. Copy?
[Nancy and Mindy scream]
NANCY: Hurry! Help!
NANCY: Lock it! Lock it.
[Thudding]
[Hissing]
MlNDY: [Screams] lt's coming back!
NANCY: What are you doing?
MlNDY: They can only see heat! l'm not dumb, you know!
Come on, into the meat locker!
Honey, l never thought you were dumb.
[Jodi groans disgustedly]
[Flies buzz]
An egg. Graboid egg.
JACK: So it's a graboid, to a shrieker, to one of these here new things...
...and finally back to a graboid.
JODl: lt would make sense, biologically. l guess they developed the ability to fly...
...so they can carry the eggs as far as possible.
[Jack yelps]
JACK: Well, look at that. Look at that right there. Reacts with the air.
Smells like a bad night of beans.
JODl: Some high-octane stomach acid he has there.
BURT: Extremely reactive.
Almost like pure sodium.
JACK: Whatever it is, they work it up there in their ass, see--
-Excuse me?
-No, no. That's how they blast off.
Always something new with these things.
[Gusting overhead]
BURT: No, forget it, you're both empty.
-Empty?
-Already?
You fired ten, she fired four. l'm empty, too.
That's just great. Great.
My place is three miles away.
We have to try to make it.
With these honkers doing aerial recon?
We have to conceal our body heat somehow.
BURT: All right, it.... l can make a dumb suggestion.
JODl: No! All l'm saying is, we discovered them, right?
So, we should name them. Let me think.
Okay. ''Blast-Offers.''
Or ''Butt-Launchers.'' That's better?
''Ass-Blasters!'' How's that?
JACK: Sounds like a porno film.
[Gusting noise]
Listen!
JACK: Get down! Get down!
He didn't see us! We're okay.
[Electronic beeping]
-Lunch date?
-Damn! El Blanco.
JACK: l'm sorry?
BURT: White graboid.
-He's moving towards us.
-Can't we get a break here?
Come on, come on. This way.
Beneath this ridge is a solid granite intrusion.
We'll follow it, but El Blanco will have to go around.
JACK: Granite intrusion?
BURT: l memorized the valley's geology.
JACK: Oh, yeah. l been meaning to do that.
BURT: Give me your weapons and make yourselves at home.
I'll see if Nancy and Mindy got through to the Air National Guard.
JACK: Lots of choices.
Nancy, Mindy. Burt here. Come back.
Burt calling Nancy and Mindy. Copy?
You know those supplies l bought?
How about l let you have them at cost?
Feeling guilty?
BURT: Nancy, Mindy. Come back.
JACK: Yeah.
But mostly l'm going to need traveling money.
BURT: Burt calling Nancy and Mindy.
Copy?
You copy?
Burt here. Come back. Nancy? Mindy?
BURT: Nancy? Mindy? Talk to me.
JODl: So, you'll be leaving?
Can't run a business where your customers get eaten.
-Guess not.
-Nancy, Mindy, Burt here. Come back!
Damn it! Hope they got out okay.
[Electronic beeping]
Our old friend El Blanco is finally coming this way.
Not to worry, our perimeter is completely graboid-proof.
[Gusting noise]
But is it Ass-Blaster-proof?
[Crashing]
BURT: Come on, come on. l'll grab my weapon!
Go! Go! Come on!
This way, into the safe room!
Come on!
Seal it!
[Heavy thudding]
-What is all this? Food?
-Better. MREs.
Most dense, most nutritious food known to man.
Okay, how long can we wait it out in here?
Six, seven years. Depending on how well you maintain your dietary discipline.
[Heavy thudding]
Son of a bitch is melting the door down.
Damn his butane, butt-blasting ass.
BURT: Forget that! Here!
-Escape tunnel!
-Burt, l like you.
You should! Go on, go on!
What happens if this thing eats your food?
Ass-blaster blitzkrieg.
Go on! l'll take care of it.
[Suspenseful music]
Trick or treat, you son of a bitch!
-Five gallons of unleaded.
-Man. You really go the distance!
Yeah, l'm a masterpiece of self-destruction.
Fire should reach my stock of reloading powder right about...
...now.
BURT: Come on! Over here.
JACK: Go, go!
[Radio crackles]
NANCY: [Over radio] Burt!
BURT: Now what?
Burt, where've you been?
We've been trying to raise you.
NANCY: You won't believe it.
BURT: No, try me.
NANCY: You know those flying shriekers?
We've got one!
Well, actually, it almost got us, but you know how we got it?
Food! lt ate half the food in the store!
NANCY: If they eat enough, they go into a food coma!
No. They multiply!
NANCY: No, Burt, they don't! Just feed it!
Give it all your MREs.
Burt, do you copy?
Burt?
NANCY: Burt, do you copy?
Burt?
Burt's....
Burt is not available at the moment, but thanks for the update, Nancy.
What kind of Supreme Being would condone such irony?
Well, there are those who say, the marksman aims at himself.
Power of non-attachment.
You need to tap into that right now.
Enough with the Zen zingers, all right?
Burt? Maintain.
A lifetime of preparation, and l end up a refugee? l hate to ask, but have we gone through all this just to be eaten by El Blanco?
The explosions were so loud, they have driven him far away.
You really should read the comics.
[Hissing overhead]
JODl: There are four more of them?
Nothing like a fire to attract every heat-seeking...
...meat-eater in the valley.
-We have to hide.
-Where? l have no home!
Junkyard.
Junkyard! Yeah.
We just have to get that far.
The universe provides.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-The universe provides a boat?
-And a blue tarp. Come on!
Get your heinies up here before they see us! Now, move! Come on!
Get in! Put it over yourself!
JACK: Come on! Like l said, just stick with Jack, you're going to make it back.
JODl: Now, go left. No, no! Right!
Jack, go right!
JODl: Not that far! Now go right!
JACK: Make up your mind!
What the heck--
The little turd.
JODl: We made it! Look!
Plenty of places to hide!
[Puffing overhead]
Wait. lt doesn't see us.
BURT: Calmly, get out of the boat.
And calmly, just head for--
[Hisses] lt sees us! Shit! Run!
JACK: Got you, Jodi! Let's run.
JODl: lt's coming!
My God.
-lt's right there, can you hear it?
-l hear it.
-lt's right there.
-That's what l said.
Let's get out of here.
JACK: Yeah!
BURT: That one's for Miguel!
About time we got a break.
Here comes the rest of them.
JODl: God! Do you think they see us?
Do they know we're here?
No.
Yeah.
-Cover. We got to find cover.
-We can hide in these.
No.
There. Come on.
Go, go!
-God, no. Can we hide over there?
-No time!
Well.
Let's assess the situation.
-We're screwed.
-We're screwed in an outhouse?
BURT: lf l had been able to grab just one gun! Even a single shot.
-How long are we stuck here?
-Minutes.
Our combined heat will make this thing glow to them.
-So, we run! We just run like hell!
-No, they fly. We couldn't get half a mile.
Okay. Can't stay. Can't go. Your turn.
[Heavy thudding]
We've got to fight them.
They're not that smart.
They only see heat.
JODl: They light their farts.
How does that help?
No, wait.
They're full of flammable chemicals.
Could we ignite them, somehow?
Get them to swallow something hot?
-How?
-Stick them with something hot, or a fire.
-A flaming spear.
-They'll kill us if we get that close to them! l'd rather shoot them, somehow. lf l just had my--
JODl: Burt, you don't have a gun.
Deal with it.
-A potato gun!
-A what?
-A potato gun!
-What?
Didn't you make one as a kid, Burt?
-l converted my BB gun to full auto--
-We made them from an old pipe.
You seal up one end, put in a few drops of lighter fluid...
...stick in the potato, light the touchhole.
Potato will go a hundred yards.
JODl: Only, instead of a potato, we shoot a flaming arrow.
Why not? l like it.
Yes! Now, of course, we have to do some shopping.
We need to get some pipe, any size, things for arrows, rags to burn.
Then we'll need something for gasoline. Alcohol.
This won't be easy.
Wait, l got a line on flaming liquid.
You two, go for parts.
-You see any of these rocket-butts nearby?
-No?
No? All right, let's go.
Watch yourselves.
[Suspenseful music]
[Puffing]
[Jodi screams]
[Puffing and thudding]
Yeah.
Ass-Blaster! Blasted your own damn ass!
JACK: What the hell was that?
JODl: l killed one! l did it!
JACK: Way to go, girl!
BURT: Don't get cocky!
That still leaves three! l killed one.
BURT: [Calls] Listen up, it'll be dark soon.
How are we doing, people?
JODl: l got some pipes.
JACK: l got some rags.
BURT: Good work!
JACK: l need some arrows.
BURT: Let's meet over at that yellow truck.
Okay, Nestor, we need your help.
Yes.
Thanks, Nestor.
[Jodi screams]
Burt.
-What's taking Jack so long?
-l don't know.
-Jack!
-ls that enough?
That will do.
Now, look.
Let's move to that mobile home. lt offers high ground for a good line of fire.
[Gusting overhead]
Run!
BURT: Come on, Jodi!
JACK: Lock it! Yeah, eat that.
Damn, girl.
[Ass-Blaster puffs outside]
Come on, let's get to work.
A friend, Nestor, was killed in the first graboid incursion.
His trailer ended up here.
He loved his shine.
JACK: Here, rip some of these.
JACK: Now, you have to seal up one end.
Also, make a touchhole to light it.
BURT: l get the concept.
Any minute, this guy will kamikaze through your roof like before.
All right, l need a gun sight.
Anybody grab any tape or wire?
Your earrings. Your earrings!
JACK: Take them off.
BURT: Excellent.
BURT: Still don't have a touchhole.
This has a little hole. Will this work?
Yeah.
Armed and dangerous.
-But do we have a lighter?
-Burt does.
How do you know?
Well, you're Burt.
Damn right l am.
[Gusting outside]
Shit! Another kamikaze run!
BURT: Whiskey down the barrel.
About a shot's worth.
He knows. He's up!
BURT: Open the door.
Door open!
There!
JODl: Now?
BURT: No, wait for it.
-Now?
-Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now! lt worked!
JACK: Blew him away! l mean, blew him--
Blew him away!
BURT: That's why we're at the top of the food chain.
JODl: Two down, and two to go!
[Heavy thudding]
Reload.
Whiskey. l'll take that arrow. Load it.
That will do it.
JACK: Get down! Stay down!
No! l got an idea.
We'll shoot it through the other skylight.
Stay down, Burt.
JODl: Now what?
JACK: Spread your legs.
JODl: Excuse me? l get it. Okay.
-Don't blame me if l miss because--
-Aim and shoot!
Okay!
-What the hell did you do?
-l shot him.
JODl: Burt.
JACK: Burt!
We should go hunting sometime.
JACK: Here you go.
JACK: l think he looks pissed!
-Pissed, but dumb. No sitting duck, Burt?
-Never assume anything.
She's ready.
BURT: Stand by to fire at my command.
Light me!
-No way!
-l knew it!
Sons of bitches are always on a learning curve.
Load. lncoming!
Lighter. l need a lighter.
BURT: lt's going to blow! lnto the back room, now!
JACK: Get in here.
JACK: Go, go! Get in here, Burt!
[Massive explosion]
JODl: Yuck.
JACK: Jeez.
Twenty-three hours, 59 minutes.
Mission completed.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Damn it! How the hell does he always know where l am?
[Electronic beeping]
The watch. The ultrasonic signal.
JODl: Burt! Are you okay?
BURT: l'm caught.
JACK: Burt, it's coming!
Get rid of the watch!
You're crazy. Get out of here!
JACK: El Blanco, you want it?
Come get it, dude!
[Suspenseful music, rumbling]
JACK: Here you go, buddy!
BURT: My Leatherman tool! ln my pocket!
JACK: Here you go, little buddy, now!
Right side, bottom row, third pocket.
-Cut the springs where my vest is snagged.
-How do you open this?
What is that?
All right.
[Suspenseful music continues]
Come on.
JACK: Jodi, hurry it up!
JODl: l'm working on it!
One.
-Get out of here. Go on!
-Shut up, Burt!
JODl: Come on.
BURT: Go on!
God Almighty!
Wow.
Good throw. l used to pitch a little single A ball till the old rotator cuff started acting up.
On the off-chance that
El Blanco's coming back for seconds...
...want to get me off this thing?
[Upbeat country music]
NANCY: Yes.
Could you hold on for just a minute?
They matched your offer.
Well, l'm sorry.
This is the world's only living Ass-Blaster.
And l have a daughter to put through school. l want a car.
BOY: Come on.
Could you hold a minute?
The Vegas guys went even higher.
Should we do it?
Siegfried, Roy, he's all yours.
JODl: Make sure you stay behind the ropes.
JODl: Hey.
JACK: Hey.
-Hitting the road, Desert Jack?
-Well, more like, Car Wash Jack. l landed a job managing that place down in Bixby.
The universe provides.
JODl: Congratulations.
JACK: Thank you.
So, l guess you'll be sticking around.
Yeah, l like the area. lt has a lot to offer.
Hey, listen, l'm breaking in my new rear axle. You want to...
...go for a little ride? l'm restocking.
Nice clouds out there. l can see the clouds from here.
Yeah, but these....
See, these are the good ones.
Well....
JODl: Mindy? Can you watch the store?
[Soft, sentimental music] lt figures.
Older women.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Buenas tardes, Senor Blanco.
That's it, just follow the car.
Burt!
Hey, nice wheels. l've been expecting you, Melvin.
You are one persistent little money-grubber.
Come on, Burt. Look around, man.
There's nothing here. l'm going to turn this into something. l'll build homes for families.
The smart thing for you to do is cash in right now.
-You might want to join me, Melvin.
-Why? lt's safer up here.
Jesus Christ, Burt! l thought you killed all those things.
BURT: l never said that.
MEL: God, man, kill it! Blow it up!
What are you waiting for?
BURT: The thing is, as long as one of these reptilians is still alive...
...this whole area is deemed protected.
You know, pursuant to section 1472-B of the Endangered Species Act? ln other words, no houses, no condos and no ranchettes.
You're crazy. Okay?
These things, man, they're going to--
They're going to eat you, Burt.
They're going to get all of you.
We got new geophones, graboid barriers, blanket protection.
The whole town agrees. Between you and El Blanco, they'll take him every time.
Adiós, Melvin!
Burt! Hey!
Burt!
Burt!
MEL: [Shouts] Burt! You asshole!
You damn son of a bitch!
God! I hate you!
I hate your guts!
You sorry, sick...
...paranoid, right-wing...
...redneck psycho!
Shit-kicker!
Goddamn you, Burt!
And I hate that hat!
Previously on Enterprise
We don't have a complete casualty list yet ... but so far the news isn't good.
Five people are confirmed dead, dozens wounded.
If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating my species.
You'll be eliminating your own!
Do you have any idea why they released you?
I think I may have gotten through to one of them.
Degra.
We were told the Reptilians attempted to build a bio-weapon.
Who told you this?
We've also learned that they were building this bio-weapon in the past on Earth.
When I was exposed to trellium it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for.
I discovered I was able to access certain emotions.
I wanted more.
I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream.
You must have known it was dangerous.
Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.
Elizabeth, get out of there!
We're in bad shape...
I can't deny that.
But we're still in one piece.
Enterprise is a tough ship.
She took more than anyone could ask her to, and then some.
And so have all of you.
I wanted to say thank you.
I only wish I could thank the 18 crewmen who were lost.
Like you, they understood how important our mission is... and they accepted the risks.
We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find,... with no one to rely on but ourselves.
But we're going to succeed...
To accomplish our mission... for everyone on Earth who's relying on us... and for the 18.
We managed to get into Sections Six and Seven on C-Deck.
We found Taylor and Kamata.
That accounts for everyone.
What's our status on weapons?
Mr. Reed has both... forward phase-cannons back on-line in addition to the aft torpedo launchers.
Hull plating is up to 80%.
That'll have to do.
We could wait-- hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs.
Degra's message was clear-- we're to meet him ten hours from now.
And I don't intend to be late.
Maybe that's what he's counting on.
Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking our wounds.
I've made my decision.
We have got a lot of work to do.
I suggest we get to it.
Aye, sir.
Commander...
Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?
She was an EPS control specialist... a damn good one.
I'd like you to write a letter to her family.
She worked on Rostov's team.
I can ask him.
I asked you.
I'm barely holding the ship together.
I don't have time to sit down and write a letter.
It doesn't have to be long, ... but her family deserves to know what happened to her.
Understood.
You're busy.
I'll come back. have a seat.
I'll have to use a hand-scanner.
The Imaging Chamber is still off-line.
Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here.
He said the Armory was a "higher priority."
We'll see how low a priority I am the next time he burns his fingers on a plasma conduit.
You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?
None.
I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system... hardly worth mentioning.
That's good news.
What is it?
These emotions... have grown more difficult to control.
My usual techniques for suppressing them haven't been effective.
On Earth, there's a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing... a magical creature called a "genie" from a bottle.
Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in.
Are you saying these emotions may never subside?
You used trellium for three months.
It caused significant damage to your neural pathways.
You may have to learn to live with these emotions.
We're approaching the coordinates, Captain, right on schedule.
No ships out there, sir.
Hoshi?
Scanning all frequencies.
Nothing so far.
Maybe they're running late.
Tactical alert!
It's a spatial anomaly.
We've entered a dense field.
Tucker to the Bridge!
This is not the best time for this!
Stand by, Trip.
Reports of injuries on B-Deck.
No one's out there, sir.
-Get us out of here.
-Aye, sir.
Captain.
We're receiving a transmission.
It's Degra and he's telling us to follow him.
-Stay with him, Travis.
- Aye, sir.
They're hailing us.
I see you found my message.
We have a great deal to discuss, and I don't have much time.
Come aboard my ship.
If we'd left you with the Reptilians, they would have killed you.
Degra arranged for the Aquatics to return you to your ship.
Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise?
The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.
You've taking a big risk.
If you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake.
Everything I've told you is true.
Forgive me, ... but the Council will need more than your word.
Perhaps you can demonstrate your ability to time travel.
That might be a bit difficult.
But if you come aboard my ship,
I can give you all the proof you want.
Very well.
But there are some things I want to know first.
Such as?
When will your weapon be launched?
The precise date hasn't been determined yet.
Weeks...
-days?
- That's up to the Council.
I'm trying to help you, .... but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed while I'm doing it.
The weapon won't be launched for several days.
Show us your proof... and we'll do what we can to stop it.
What did you get?
Pepperoni pizza.
Don't worry.
You can pick the pepperoni off.
Damage reports?
No.
The Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family.
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
Their daughter's dead.
You really think they'll care what I have to say?
When was the last time you slept?
I don't know.
Not since the attack.
That was two days ago.
All right, then.
Two days.
Go to your quarters.
Get some sleep.
Believe me, I'd love to.
I could order you.
I don't have time.
We're full of holes, the only thing keeping us flying is a stolen warp coil, ... and now I got to write this letter.
What the hell...?
Tucker to Engineering!
Shut down the auxiliary coolant lines between Sections...
-12 and 14 on E-deck!
-Aye, sir.
Tucker to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency on E-deck, Section 12.
On my way, Commander.
Reactor pressure's holding.
Good thing I wasn't taking a nap.
Damron.
Friend of yours?
A colleague... of sorts.
They're the ones we found on Earth... in the past.
And this is the result of your "finding" them?
They were about to release a bio-weapon that would have decimated the population.
The Reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species.
Damron and his team disappeared shortly after the Council rejected his proposal.
Apparently, they decided to go ahead without your Council's approval.
But, fortunately, you were able to stop them by traveling back through time.
I already told you... we had help... just like they did.
This proves nothing.
How do we know he didn't capture them in the present?
You need more evidence?
They had this with them.
We destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample of it in stasis.
This appears to be Xindi technology,... but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it.
Have them come aboard... perform whatever tests they'd like.
This proves nothing except the Reptilians disobeyed the Council.
Which comes as no great surprise.
But you also claim that ... we've been misled by trans-dimensional aliens.
Where is your evidence of that?
Come with me.
There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket.
-That's why it ruptured!
-I ran a pressure test.
Tell it to the man lying in Sick Bay!
-Test them again-- all of them!
-Aye, sir.
-Commander?
-I'm a little busy, Doc.
So it seems.
I understand you haven't slept since the attack.
T'Pol tattling on me now?
She's worried about you.
Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and baling wire.
Has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?
Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I got to get back to work.
I don't believe so.
Come again.
I'm relieving you of duty.
You will go to your quarters, and not return to your post before 05:00 tomorrow.
-Six hours?
- Please don't make me involve Security.
Archer to Doctor Phlox.
-Yes, Captain?
-I need you in Sick Bay.
I'll be right there.
Well, Commander?
I could give you two hours.
I believe the number was six.
If I'm gone longer than three, there may not be a ship here when I get back.
Four.
Not a minute less.
Done.
And remind me never to buy a car from you.
-Captain's waiting for you.
- I'm aware of that. good night, then.
We found him adrift.
Do you recognize his species?
We've met one of them.
What caused his death?
Some kind of cellular degeneration.
It started the moment he was taken off his ship.
Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.
I believe our universe was toxic to him.
His species evolved in a different dimension, ... under a different set of physical laws.
He simply couldn't exist here.
That's why his species built the Spheres-- to make our space more compatible for themselves.
We believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding.
And, if they are, you're saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.
For any of us.
We're destined to form an alliance to stop them.
But, if you destroy Earth, that'll never happen.
You'll be condemning your own race to extinction.
Trouble sleeping, sir?
Taylor?
You were killed.
This whole section decompressed.
Did you find a sealed compartment?
No.
Then how...?
You're dead... and I'm dreaming.
The letter...
How's it going?
I got as far as...
"I regret to inform you..."
That's a little dry, sir.
You're not real.
You don't have to call me "sir."
So what's the problem?
The letter doesn't have to be long.
The Captain told you that.
You can't think of anything.
I wish it was that simple.
I served on Enterprise for three years.
You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your team.
Captain Brody was pretty angry at you.
I forgot about that.
You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday.
You will.
You would have.
Then tell my parents that.
Tell them about the practical jokes
Rostov used to play on me.
Or that one time I found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed.
Tell them how hard I worked.
How much you liked me.
Why can't you look at me?
Just remember me.
Is that asking so much?
Yes.
Why?
Why?
These tests only confirm the equipment belonged ...
-to the Reptilians.
-There's also evidence of chronometric distortion... time travel.
The readings could have been fabricated.
You're determined not to trust him.
No more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says.
Now, I admit Archer's evidence is intriguing, ... but we barely know this human.
Our contact from the future has helped us many times.
She brought this Council together.
And you've never wondered whether she might have an agenda of her own?
I am not a fool, Degra.
All I'm saying is that it'll take.... a little more than a few chronometric distortions to turn the Council against her.
Captain Archer is expecting me.
More evidence?
He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres.
Degra...
I know you've had doubts about building the weapon.
Don't let them cloud your judgment.
We've been working to reconstruct our database.
The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much.
Try it now.
I'm going to reset the optical subprocessors.
That might clear it up.
When we slipped through your detection grid, ... we got a look at the weapon you're building.
An impressive piece of engineering.
Hell, it'd take at least... a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet.
You know, I'd like to see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth.
Increase the data resolution.
I assume you were watching the attack.
Calculating the blast yields.
Boy.
You must have been pretty damn excited.
I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida.
That's the name of one of the places you destroyed.
Florida.
Commander.
Did you actually see the cities burning, the houses... the people being vaporized?
You know, I had a sister there.
Commander.
How are the repairs coming?
Just need a few more minutes, Captain.
Why don't you join me in my Ready Room until they're finished.
Let's stick to the job at hand.
Aye, sir.
The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust.
It's one of the warp plasma conduits.
It must have ruptured when our sensors were off-line.
Perhaps my crew can help.
We'll handle it.
We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.
The flow regulators are damaged.
There are manual cut-offs here and here, but we can only access it from outside.
That's very close to the fire.
We don't have a choice.
If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor.
Get going.
-I could use a hand.
-That would be me, sir.
Open that panel and
I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.
-Where's the other valve?
-Over there.
I need to open the emergency bypass ports first.
You can't close your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary line.
Commander.
I have a problem.
I think the heat's warped the metal.
The panel won't open.
Use your plasma torch.
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm releasing the interlocks on the first port.
This is going to take a while.
Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm.
The manifold pressure is increasing.
We have less than six minutes before the fire reaches the reactor shielding.
Archer to Trip.
You've got six minutes.
Understood.
You okay, Malcolm?
I'm almost there.
Captain.
The temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit is over 44 degrees.
He's too close to the fire.
His EV suit can't compensate.
Malcolm.
Get back to the airlock.
I'm almost finished, Captain.
That's an order.
Get inside, Malcolm.
I can wrap it up.
I'm opening the primary bypass port.
Two more to go, and... we're in business!
46 degrees.
Malcolm.
I'm sorry, sir.
You're breaking up
Get inside, Malcolm! I can finish.
There's no time.
Do what you have to do so I can shut this down!
A few more seconds! I'm purging the last port.
The forward valve is closed.
Okay, Malcolm, clockwise 90 degrees.
Nice work, Malcolm.
Malcolm? Malcolm!
Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
Meet us in the airlock.
We need to bring his body temperature down.
Let's geto Sick Bay.
I hope he'll be all right.
What's one more dead human to you?
Trip...
You had no problem killing seven million of us.
But seven million and one is more than you can...
-stomach?
-That's enough.
-I guess even Xindi have their limits.
-I said, that's enough!
Aye, aye, sir.
We've determined there are 59 of them.
78 at our last count.
Seventy-eight?
We've had more time to study them than you have.
I apologize for Mister Tucker.
I never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what I'd done.
At the time, I thought the attack was necessary to save my people.
I know.
Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before.
That's right.
Our "escape" from prison together.
The Reptilians are correct about one thing, Captain.
You have an impressive facility for deception.
Erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust.
Probably not.
They're all connected by a subspace energy grid.
Unfortunately our data on the Spheres' interiors is extremely limited.
Maybe I can help.
How did you get this?
The first Sphere we came across was damaged.
There was a breach in the outer shell.
We've never been able to gain access to one.
These scans are remarkably detailed for a military vessel.
Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.
If we're successful, it will be again.
Computer, begin recording.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
I regret to inform you that your daughter was killed in the line of duty.
She was a fine engineer, ... and she died performing her duties.
Computer, stop recording.
Delete that.
Computer, start again.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
As Jane's commanding officer,... it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death.
She was a diligent engineer.
Very hard-working...
Tactical Alert.
All hands to stations.
Report.
We've detected a ship.
They just passed through the cloaking barrier.
On screen.
Reptilians.
-Did you invite anyone else?
-We masked our warp trail.
I don't know how they found us.
With the humans?
I suppose the Council authorized these negotiations.
No one authorized the development of a bio-weapon,... but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one.
Undock from the human vessel immediately.
He intends to seize the human vessel.
He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.
We don't stand a chance against them, not in the shape we're in.
What kind of weapons do you have?
You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?
If we work together, we might be able to disable them.
They're charging weapons.
Are you familiar with the design of that ship?
I did some work on their power systems.
Then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons.
Their ship is heavily armored.
At least we'd stand a chance.
Those Reptilians are Xindi.
You're asking me to attack my own people.
Proceed to our starboard docking port.
I want your word that my crew won't be punished.
You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.
He's nearly reached the Reptilians.
He's knocked out their shield generators.
Fire.
Evasive maneuvers.
Keep firing. Target their weapons.
Their weapons are down.
Degra was spot on.
He knew exactly where to hit them.
Open a channel to Degra.
- Sir!
- He's charging weapons.
The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.
Captain, Degra's hailing us.
They would've contacted the Council and exposed our alliance.
I had no choice.
Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here.
Repair crews are starting tomorrow.
I thought I'd try and get 'em some power.
These assemblies are all fused together.
I've spent the last hour trying to isolate the damaged relays.
You might find this useful.
Portable power cells.
Courtesy of our new Xindi friends?
Damn neighborly of them.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Not unless you can resurrect the dead.
Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this kind of thing.
But Taylor's not here, is she?
And neither is Crewman Kamata or Ensign Marcel... or a dozen others.
So forgive me... if I don't want the damn power cells!
We found Taylor over there outside her quarters.
She was probably trying to get to her station.
If she'd made it a few more meters, ..
I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter.
Every time I start,...
I hear myself saying what a fine young woman she was, how... smart and full of potential... and I realize ...
I'm not thinking about Taylor at all,...
I'm thinking about Elizabeth.
So many people dead...
I tried not to see her any differently than the other seven million.
So I've spent the last nine months... trying to pretend she was just another victim.
But she's my sister, T'Pol... my baby sister.
I envy you Vulcans.
You think that the loss of a colleague ... or friend doesn't affect us?
It does.
But if we give in to those emotions, they overwhelm us.
You're the ones to be envied.
You need to speak to the Council.
With the evidence you've shown me they'll have no choice... but to take us seriously.
Even the Reptilians?
I'm more concerned about the Aquatics.
They can be somewhat enigmatic.
But if we can sway them, we'll have a majority on our side.
These are the coordinates for the Council chamber.
This is nearly a dozen light years away.
-It'll take us weeks to get there.
-There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor.
It's located in a nebula less than half a light year from here.
That will show your helmsman how to get through it.
I'll meet you at the far end in three days.
Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?
I'll do everything I can to delay it.
Use caution when you enter the nebula.
A hostile species is known to prey on ships that approach it.
Thanks for the warning.
See you in three days.
Three days.
Computer, begin recording.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor,... by the time you get this, ...
Starfleet will have already told you about Jane.
Since I worked so closely with her, ...
I wanted to add my personal condolences.
I have to confess,
I've been putting off writing this for a while.
I convinced myself that... my duties on Enterprise took precedence.
But the truth is...
I didn't want to face the fact that someone so young, ... with so much promise... could just be gone.
But I'm facing it now ... and I find myself thinking how important she was to me.
She was a great engineer... and she was my friend.
She won't be forgotten.
Good-bye, Elizabeth.
ANATOMY
Kaminsky! Gloves!
This woman is educational material, not a fellow student.
Kaminsky, you old lecher.
Why don't you try it with live women?
Just when l finally found fresh meat....
From tomorrow on, it'll be river corpses again.
Professor?
We found an anatomic anomaly in the abdominal area.
A penis, perhaps?
That isn't an anomaly. Men are different from you women. May l?
These things are slippery.
Yes?
Paula Henning, 783 points in the 1999 Robert Koch Contest.
The second best score in the country.
Congratulations!
Does that mean that l've been accepted into Heidelberg?
Yes. lf you prefer to spend your summer with corpses...
...instead of with young men.
Grombek's course in anatomy is the very best.
A test of will.
Really intensive. Fully focused. l wanted to go to ltaly, but this is obviously--
This is such a chance, with your talent!
And you want to go to ltaly for the summer? ln ltaly there's a lot of fondling, too.
Yes! Exactly.
Good bye.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
-So?
-Heidelberg!
Hi, Grandpa.
Listen, your transaminase level is high...
...and l just heard, that they're considering hemofiltration.
They want to increase morphine to 5 ml, but they still have to ask Schûtzenberger.
Does it hurt that much?
Paula, l've been dead since Christmas.
They're just torturing me with the machines...
...that l myself bought as head physician.
Your score in the Robert Koch Contest?
Over 700. Second best result in the country.
Very good. So? Heidelberg.
-l don't want to leave you alone.
-l don't need a keener.
Nothing could make me happier than to know...
...that my Paula will be a physician.
Not someone who applies bandages or a hospital bureaucrat...
...but a true physician. My successor. l'm so proud of you. l have to go, Grandpa. Bye.
Would you pull the plug from the socket?
Heidelberg?
Those red spots are only crab lice.
Don't worry, Nellie.
Dad, this is the chance of a lifetime!
Put some of that on it.
You could be happy for me at least once. l thought you would help me in the practice.
That's what you promised me, once.
The course in research with Grombek l told you about.... lf you pass, you can work in any research centre-- ln any elegant private clinic.
The purpose of human suffering is to make doctors rich and famous. l just want a top education--
-Kevin has such a terrible cough.
-Nellie, don't touch that! l want a career, even if you think it's stupid. l don't want to end up in such a....
Yes, go on.
At least take the blue one with you.
Maybe you'll go out.
Mom, l'm going to Heidelberg for work.
Taking a dress with you doesn't mean.... l'm not going to get pregnant and ruin my career.
Thanks. That's really nice of you.
Mom, l'm sorry. l didn't mean it.
Did you apologise to Dad? l really try, but hearing him say...
...that successful people are criminals, just because he's only a--
Even if Dad can't stand his father...
...he should visit him at least once.
He's really in bad shape.
Will you write to me?
Mom, this is going to be great!
Where am l?
He's awake.
-Are we ready for anaesthesia?
-Circulation is fine. 2 mg Promidal.
Did you already take a look at the list?
Was there anything interesting?
-What are you doing?
-The person from Berlin.
Henning?
Paula or Petra. Excellent grades.
A woman would be a novelty, for once.
We could get in touch with her.
When she arrives in Heidelberg.
DlSSECTlNG ROOM
Hey, we met in Munich.
Yes. You were in the Professor's course, too.
The six-handed anatomist, yes.
-l feel uncomfortable when he....
-Well, l just let him do it a little.
At least that way l avoid his second class courses.
He wouldn't actually have the nerve to fondle your breasts.
-Are you going to Heidelberg, too?
-Yes.
-Why, ''too''?
-Let's rent a room together. l'll bet there are nice guys there...
...even if they're doctors.
But who knows?
A doctor! ls there a doctor here?
He fell. Because of the heat.
Hello? Can you hear me? Relax.
Can you hear me?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me? Do you feel all right?
Empty a compartment. Hurry!
You finally realise why you actually study all this shit.
That wasn't a fainting spell. lt was cardiac arrest. lt's called cardiomyopathy.
Advanced heart insufficiency.
Big heart, small valves.
Besides falling down dead every now and then, it's no trouble.
Would you like my corpse? lt's a unique object for study.
Before that, we'll have to test all your vital functions. l'll meet the 435th specialist or miracle healer...
...tonight in some pub.
They only get excited over rare illnesses.
-l'm beyond help.
-Don't talk that way. Modern medicine--
Here's my number. We practice medicine in pubs, discos or cinemas...
...and if you need....
-Well, thanks.
-Good luck.
The poor guy. l didn't know, that you could get that disease so young.
So you're from Munich, too? l'll put you both together in one apartment, okay?
No alcoholic beverages, no pets.
Male visitors are allowed.
You'll have to organise that on your own, though.
By the way, my name is Philip. l'm always phiril.
-A play on words. How sweet.
-Excuse me?
Cute.
Hi, is anyone there? All anatomy students, to the dissecting room. ln the new wing. Hurry!
The dissecting room is here, isn't it?
Excuse me. Are you here for the introduction?
-We're going to the anatomy course.
-Exactly. l believe it's over there.
Great!
This looks cool.
Maybe we're too early.
-My name is Paula. Paula Henning.
-Hi. l'm Gretchen.
-Gabi. University of Tûbingen.
-Tûbingen! l had a really sweet boyfriend over there.
We're both from Munich, but we don't belong together.
Am l crazy or.... l thought l saw movement or something.
That's rather unlikely.
So, what was your boyfriend's name?
The one from Tûbingen?
Very funny. Scaring a couple of chicks!
A welcoming ritual in Heidelberg?
Nonsense. What cannot exist, doesn't exist.
A corpse can't move. lt's a corpse, not a doll.
How does a body move?
A contraction of muscles produced by nerve impulses.
And how do nerves function?
Electrical impulse.
An impulse can be induced.
Nerves stimulated by electrical impulses produce muscular contractions.
That implies movement.
That is logical.
There is a scientific explanation for everything.
All you need is a high voltage cable.
That paralyses the whole network.
What are you doing?
Using a corpse as a toy train?
No trace of ethics, you stupid assholes. l'll get you sooner or later.
Asshole!
Those from Heidelberg already have Grombek the whole year.
Hard, but unfair. The perfect sadist.
He's brilliant in his field, though.
Who is your professor? l was with Botticelli in Berlin.
Now l'm doing my AlP at the Sorbonne.
Huber, Munich.
-Kledermann, Emden.
-What? There's no university in Emden.
There's a butcher shop.
My uncle is a butcher.
He slices like a God.
Seriously. There, you learn the difference between tripe and steak.
-A difference of at least 30 DM.
-But...
-...a doctor, l mean....
-Meat is meat and has its price.
Heart costs more than liver, liposuction less than breast surgery.
Medicine is a service, and we all want to earn well, don't we?
-l'm from Heidelberg too.
-Really?
Specialised in anabolism.
But call me anyway, the next time you're naked.
Actually l'm a charming person. l love bird calls and know the names of many flowers.
But l'm a doctor.
-Caspar.
-Paula Henning.
Your grandfather was dean here, right?
Basic Neurological Anatomy.
Heidelberg '57.
That's a nice dimple.
Has your date still not shown up?
-Where's the restroom?
-Come with me. l'll show you. ln there.
Drunks! He has probably puked all over.
-Ciao bello.
-Bye.
His name's Hein and let me tell you he's all muscle!
He takes himself so seriously.
Today you got close to your sweetheart, too.
-My what?
-The tall, dark one. Caspar.
-lt was so obvious that....
-Oh God! Stop chattering about men.
You're obsessed. l'm here to work, not to fuck around.
That's too bad.
Do you know what time it is? ls he still unconscious?
Pay attention. We make the incision here, alongside the arteries near the heart.
That way, we expose the heart laterally.
Help! ls anyone here?
Too bad. He's dead.
We can't use him anymore.
-lnjured?
-No. Just a scratch.
Now what do we do with it?
Our highly modernised society tends to reduce everything...
...to problems of the soul.
The doctor, who simply cuts away a disease, doesn't count anymore. l'm fond of saying that people prefer to die in one piece...
...rather than be cured by traditional medicine.
Here, in the new wing of the institute...
...a most modern dissecting room is at your complete disposal.
No pain has been relieved yet in this room.
No patient has been cured.
We are laying the foundations for that here.
Discoveries are being made...
...which save the lives of people out there...
...or at least make them easier to bear.
The basis of medicine.
Ladies and gentlemen, we believe you are the best.
You are the elite, the future of our profession.
A third or even half of you won't be with us anymore...
...after we have given the results.
Be grateful for this apparent inflexibility.
Strict selection guarantees our high academic level...
...and the reputation of this institution.
As you can see, Heidelberg traditionally has a fine collection of specimens.
This collection is at the exclusive disposal of all scientists...
...and students. lt is invaluable for science and education.
My God. Fantastic.
Wow. Are these models?
No, no. These are real human specimens.
Plastimised.
All fat and water has been extracted from the tissue.
They are preserved for eternity.
Heidelberg University - Kidney
Specimen by: Dr. E. Henning
Ewald Henning. That's my grandpa.
Colleague, we're glad to know that your grandfather is so famous.
Your achievements, however, must be your own. lmmediately afterwards, you will receive your research topics.
You will hand in a paper on them at the end of the course. ln addition, there will be mid-term exams.
The first one in three weeks...
...after which, the six least prepared students will go home.
The same will happen after the second mid-term exam.
Lectures will be held every day from 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.
The dissecting room, library and laboratory are at your disposal from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Evenings and weekends are to be used for studying.
David. l think it's 10 years since l last smoked a cigarette.
The last time during summer camp, secretly, beneath a blanket.
Summer camp? Do you want to know what l did there secretly?
Under a blanket? l didn't like the taste then, either.
Damn. l could still see the signs of my cardiac massage on David's chest.
Wonderful.
Can we plastimise the heart and circulatory system as specimens?
Now? Their structure is no longer clearly defined.
Once decomposition begins....
You have an interesting acquaintance here.
Take a look. ln his condition, it's a miracle he was alive, not to mention the aneurysm. lnoperable.
Would you like to remove the heart? lf it's too much for you emotionally, as a woman....
We save a human life and shortly afterwards it's lost all the same.
We are doctors.
What are these stab wounds or cuts in the abdomen?
Only medical instruments are this sharp. l guess they must have been caused by a clumsy dissector.
Asshole. l can't believe that David died so quickly because of this tumour.
Look at his neck, at the jugular vein.
The blood is like gum.
And what does that have to do with cardiomyopathy?
Absolutely nothing.
David was terminally ill.
You couldn't have saved him.
You're imagining things because of your guilt feelings.
We're here to examine corpses, right?
-Shall l open the skull?
-Not yet. Thank you. l must manage to examine him in the standard way...
...otherwise l can forget about medicine. l'll do an analysis.
Professor? Miss Henning.
Colleague. Come in.
Wow, it's fantastic here.
This is a central American
Papilio demoleus.
Wonderful! lt's so light, so lively.
About David, l just want to know that there was nothing l could have done.
Your reactions were clear, correct, scientific. ln my time we called this ''composure.'' lmpressive.
-Yes. lt seemed somehow strange that--
-We both know...
...that you had personal motives.
Emotions.
Female intuition.
Further involvement would be...
...silly.
-But--
-Would you like some tea?
Otherwise Mrs. Erhardt will prepare a cup of coffee...
...biscuits and a slice of pie.
We're closing the case.
-lt doesn't exist.
-That's why l'm calling, Bernie. l've never seen blood with such strange consistency.
The process must have begun before death.
-There are no clots?
-No. lt's more like...
...gum.
Was your friend greenish, rather small and with antennae on its head?
Why green?
Let's be serious. l'll send you a sample, and you check it in biochemistry.
A tissue sample?
-Yes. l'll try to get one for you.
-Bernie needs fresh meat.
-Liver, if possible. What do l get for it?
-A kiss.
-A French kiss and l get to fondle you.
-On the forehead, and no fondling.
-Bye, little one.
-Bye, old man.
Your father?
-Yes, l--
-You seem to have a good relationship.
No, it was a friend.
Not my boyfriend, my.... Damn.
-Purely scientific?
-l'm always....
You think you're really great, don't you? l think you're really great, too.
Come here and take a look.
Take a look.
This is the young man's blood.
Have you seen anything like this before? lt has nothing to do with the tumour.
-l have to go to the dissecting room.
-What, now?
To get some tissue samples.
After the weekend it would be too late for toxicology.
What did you actually want?
Well, cinema, ice cream parlour, dissecting intestines, something romantic.
Okay. ln one hour down in the dormitory.
Nonsense. Corpses look the same at night as during the day. lt's just the university building.
-What are you doing?
-l wanted--
Student?
-Name?
-Paula. Paula Henning.
-l just wanted....
-Does the professor know?
Yes, of course.
He himself said that l should....
David. l mean, number seven.... l need to know who sent him here. l need to talk to the doctor in charge.
Twenty-two-year-old male.
Cardiomyopathy.
-Yes, and who--
-That's classified information. l really must know who sent him here.
Yes. lt's me. Someone was just here.
CREMATORlUM l got a tissue sample.
Something's going on, l'll tell you! l absolutely must find the doctor who sent David here.
The dissector has a list stating the origin of the corpses. lf there were any way l could get that list....
You're a good kisser, but your sweater smells like formalin.
Are you coming to the pond tomorrow?
Damned corpses! l'm dead tired! l took part in a contest and wrote the second best paper.
How did you get accepted here in Heidelberg? l wrote the best paper. ln the Robert Koch Contest for the advanced semester?
This year, l won for the third time.
Do you think a man can still get it up...
...when he finds out that my lQ is
50 points higher than his is?
But, l mean....
-Why Hein?
-We need something besides work.
And Hein is great.
Yes, come here!
-What is it?
-Turn around.
There. Latissimus. Beautifully defined.
The retro spina and here--
-Gretchen. Stop it!
-Flex it.
Glutaeus maximus. Great!
Thank you, sweetie.
We always get these wrinkled, old guys in pathology. lf someone is too intelligent one might fall in love.
But your Caspar is well-built too.
Does he have anything in his pants?
-You know, he isn't my--
-Do you think they ever talk...
...about anything else besides our breast-size? lt could be fun to discuss dick-size in public.
Caspar. We were just talking about you and your friend.
-Friend? What friend?
-Carrot or banana?
Have you heard of a hospital in Heidelberg with the abbreviation AAA?
-With an exclamation point?
-How did you know that?
There's a medical association.
The Anti-Hippocrates Lodge.
Where did you see it?
On a corpse. Like the sign left by a brand. lt must have been something else.
The Anti-Hippocrates Lodge has been forbidden. lt doesn't exist anymore. lt seems a bit kitsch here. l mean, a pond at sunset in Heidelberg, the birds chirping....
Kissing is in bad taste?
You know what l mean. ls it possible that it's easier for you to fool around with dead men...
...than with living men?
-ls that true or am l right?
-You idiot.
-And? ls he right?
-He's an insolent fool.
-And? ls he right?
-He's an insolent fool.
Anyway, AAA is the abbreviation for
Age Actabile Antihippocrate.
Do that which is possible?
There's nothing specific about its being a secret organisation. lt's a mixture between a Masonic lodge and a student fraternity...
...with rituals, lodge and so on.
The point is, contrary to doctors who pledge themselves to Hippocratic ideals...
...helping, healing and so on...
...they are completely devoted to scientific research. Here.
''Experimental killing of individuals to promote the survival of many.'' lnsane.
Here: ''Founded in the 16th century. Last peak in activity during the Third Reich.
''At present there have been isolated activities...
''...in genetic research, artificial insemination...
''...and pharmacology.
''An Anti-Hippocratic centre at the beginning of the century...
''...and during the Nazi period was...
''...Heidelberg.''
-And David....
-An ideal victim for forbidden experiments.
A young patient with a rare disease in its advanced stages, model development....
So you mean that here, in Heidelberg...
...doctors are engaging in forbidden experiments?
Of course.
My diarrhoea. God, diarrhoea like that must be Anti-Hippocratic.
Paula, really. lt itches. l think l already have a brand on my butt.
-What? Promidal?
-That's right.
Promidal, exactly the way you pronounce it.
At first it was used by taxidermists. lt's basically plasma-proteic. lt practically plastimises tissue by extracting all the salt.
One injects it into a living animal and it is carried by the bloodstream into the cells.
Put simply, once allowed to harden, you have your specimen. lt was forbidden by animal protection agencies.
The longer it's active inside an animal, the thicker the blood becomes.
The animal's movements become slower and sooner or later: bingo.
-Paula? Are you still there?
-Yeah. lts chemical structure is amazingly simple.
The antidote is basically a simple saline solution.
The question is, how did it get into your friend's blood?
Yeah, me too. On your firm buttocks.
-Paula?
-Yeah.
-You pervert!
-Are you still there?
My father.
No stupid remark on hand, right?
Gretchen, guess what?
Hi, Hein.
Hi, Phil.
We were studying anatomy.
About David, l got the histological result.
-The stuff is called Promidal.
-Paula is investigating a conspiracy.
Doctors are tattooing notes on their patients' asses.
Anti-Hippocratic Lodge. l just need to find out what they tried to test on David. l'm going back to the dissecting room.
-Sorry to bother you.
-No problem.
Anyway, Phil couldn't get it up.
Philip? Hormones. Low blood pressure.
We are all doctors, aren't we?
We want to go out for dinner and try again afterwards. Will you join us?
-l mean, for dinner.
-Well, no.
But thanks. And have fun. Good luck.
Bye.
Professor. l'm glad you're still here.
Do you have any idea why someone would inject a heart patient with Promidal?
Promidal? That's absolutely impossible.
-l'm not a heart specialist, but....
-The young man with heart disease....
-l tested his blood....
-Didn't we close the case?
Yes. Why? Do you wish to prevent me from....
Don't you have enough work to do on your research project?
Have you already gathered all the histological results? l was going to do that tomorrow, before the lecture.
By the way, could you briefly list the differences between...
...acute myelocytic and acute lymphocytic leukaemia?
You accidentally cut yourself.
The scalpels are sharp.
-l think he likes me.
-l know that now.
You're no good. You're arrogant because you're so stupid.
Cutting yourself like that....
That feels good. The bandage.
Yes. Women know how to apply bandages.
You have a nice way of holding it in your hand.
Tell me, in general, do you think it's kitsch here?
Are you still interested in the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge? l'll drop by this evening around 10:30 or 1 1 :00.
Shall we go?
And l say, ''Don't cut the eye! '' lt was already black, because the corpse had been there for so long.
Anyway he says, ''No, no. l know what l'm doing.''
He already had brains all over his lab coat because he had dropped them before. l've seen this before.
''Up to the early 18th century this was a warning to traitors.
''The herald of punishment.
''A scalpel slashed the left cheek of the guilty party three times.
''Three cuts opened throat, chest and belly.''
-Watch out! l have a knife!
-What are you doing?
What are you doing in my room? ls Gretchen here? l wanted to talk to her, because....
Did you see that shit over there?
Some asshole tried to....
What's wrong? Are you hurt? lt's just Gretchen. l think...
-...she doesn't love me anymore.
-Come on.
You have some problems in your relationship.
Gretchen feels really bad about it, too.
Get out!
We don't want people like you here!
Calm down, Grandpa!
They even paid me to leave The Four Seasons immediately.
-A free dinner would be fine, too.
-And my dessert?
Wow! Sweetie! You're totally wild!
But Gretchen will only let really hard Hansels in.
-What do you mean by that?
-Anatomy test.
This morning l had a burst prostate gland on the table.
Did l do anything wrong? l'm sorry. ls it over?
Too bad...
...that these things are so sensitive!
-When you cut them open they look simple.
-Gretchen!
You know, women often don't take the time to understand men. l mean, l'm not a great conversationalist.
-You know what l mean.
-Yeah.
But l'm still delicate and sensitive...
...even if l give the impression of being outwardly strong.
-Are you already...? Shall l...?
-No, no. lt's just that l'm very emotional about Gretchen, because--
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-No. Hein was about to....
-No, no.
-No, you wanted.... l didn't mean to disturb you. lf you two have something important to....
-Hein, you can stay.
-lt's not so important.
-We could do it some other time. Bye.
-Well, no....
Hey, wait a minute.
You wanted to tell me something about....
-Yes, Hein. What's that?
-A corpse slashed back at me.
-See you.
-Give my regards to Gretchen. l don't want to hurt her.
Four?
Well, sweetie. You're my fifth failure.
Though sex on the job is...
...the most natural thing in the world.
You're a nightmare for any tough guy.
Poor, little Phil.
You're a horrible men's club, and l'm God's punishment.
Are you finished again already?
Gretchen? Such a beautiful body...
...and such an ugly, little whore's soul.
Do you have any idea of how much you've hurt me? l loved you.
-Do you think l have no feelings?
-What did you inject me with?
-l can't stay with a whore anymore.
-What did you inject me with?
No, it's not about us anymore.
You've ruined everything. l injected 15 mg.
That's quite a lot. lt should work quickly.
Your blood. Do you remember?
''Like gum.''
Got you. l see, you want to go outside.
Wait, l'll help you.
But l believe you can't make it.
Shall we bet on it?
Hey, if you manage to cross the threshold, l'll set you free. Okay?
On your marks, get set, go!
Yes! Just a few more centimetres.
Maybe she'll make it. But then....
That's mean.
What are you doing to me?
You beautiful, beautiful body.
Don't be afraid. l will preserve you, forever.
Every day the door is open.
Today it's my turn, and it's closed. lt's always open. Only today it isn't.
What the hell is going on?
Just some student's joke.
Thank you, Mrs. Stobel.
Fatma, you can clean up later.
Yesterday l walked in and found half an intestine under a table.
Fuck. All those guts.
Fucking students. You're lucky if you don't run into one in a real operation.
Could you say just one sentence without using the word ''fuck''?
-After all, there are dead bodies here.
-Fuck.
Okay darlings. Who will end up under a scalpel today?
-Please. Come on.
-Number five.
-Sixteen.
-Sixteen.
-Three.
-Yes.
-And six.
-Six.
-lt won't open.
-The janitor should repair this shit.
Come on, take the next one. There.
What's this? They've cut his head off.
The threats by the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge...
...prove that l'm on the right track. lf it was blood you won't be able to remove the stains from your sheets. lt's better than brains. l ruined a new cashmere sweater--
Could one of you be serious?
There's a criminal organisation in Heidelberg.
What's that supposed to mean?
Your blood will be next?
Okay, all those rites and stuff are a bit old fashioned.
But the idea of unethical research is not that outdated, is it?
Blood in the bed, in a girl's room.... lt sounds more like one of Phil's disgusting jokes to me.
By the way, where is he?
Have you seen Phil? l've seen a bit of him around.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, diverticulosis is...
...a typical illness in the western world.
As you can see....
You may now depart for your weekend. l need not remind you of your upcoming exams.
Be glad. Those who pass will have more room to work and...
...many more corpses.
Hi, Paula. l wanted to thank you for your time yesterday.
You know it makes a person feel good to see...
...someone show concern. l solved my problem with Gretchen, too.
Really? l thought she was away for the weekend.
-Look, l brought you something.
-You shouldn't have.
Cardiomyopathy - AAA! - No storage
From Gretchen. And Paula, you really should stop all this nonsense...
...about David.
You're getting in the way of our research.
David's body wasn't worth anything anymore.
He was doomed. lt was obvious.
Paula. l really like you, but-- ls this some stupid joke?
Hein, you psychopathic asshole!
Don't yell like that. We're not alone.
Gretchen (cell phone) - 0172/555 22 97
The person you have called is temporarily not available.
-This means there is no corpse.
-Not anymore. But....
You don't know this mysterious David's last name...
...or where he lives. Which state is he from?
Well at least we know his brand.
This secret organisation.
This Anti-Coppo...
-Anti-Hippocratic Lodge.
-...Copocrats.
But, don't you understand?
What about Gretchen?
Margarete Mollmann.
-lt's been days since--
-Listen, miss.
A female student hasn't slept in her bed for one night. So?
-A medical student.
-A chopped off finger?
Do you remember last year when those two girls reported...
...that a headless corpse was waving its hands in the dissecting room?
Yeah, high-voltage cable.
Hi, Paula. Still pursuing conspirators?
Caspar? Oh, Frank. ls....
Have you seen Gretchen?
Yes. She might be....
Hello? Paula....
Dear Gretchen! l need to talk to you!
Regards, Paula
You must come. Forget the others.
This is our project.
Okay, see you.
-Have you seen Gretchen?
-l heard voices in the dissecting room.
Gretchen?
Shit.
Gretchen is on table three.
Or perhaps four?
Quit cracking idiotic jokes, you psychopath.
-Where is Gretchen?
-Well, take a look. Come on.
You're usually so curious.
-You're completely--
-You whore...
...look for your whore friend!
Are you afraid of corpses?
Table three or table four?
Three or four?
Maybe she's still alive.
Maybe now she isn't anymore.
Jokes. lt's just fun. Stupid students' jokes.
Dead bodies. Old, dead, disgusting flesh.
Jokes, they're all jokes, Paula.
Are you afraid of me now?
Paula!
Wait up.
Paula. Wait a minute. Don't be afraid. lt was just for fun, nothing more.
Come on, Paula.
There's no need to be afraid of me. l was just joking.
Paula, wait.
MORGUE ls anyone here?
-What are you doing here?
-Don't be afraid. You're safe here.
-The Lodge is off-limits.
-The Anti-Hippocratic Lodge.
-You too?
-Yes, of course.
Anti-Hippocratic simply means the desire to work as a scientist...
...mostly in an unspectacular way, but without petty bourgeois limitations.
-There are psychos with scalpels outside.
-Just big-mouthed louts...
...who enjoy frightening girls.
Do you think it's possible to make progress in research...
...while adhering to ethical principles?
Heidelberg has a reputation to maintain.
Do you know when we won the last Nobel prize?
Medical research is highly competitive...
...funds for research, commissions from the pharmaceutical industry...
...it's all about financing the education of an elite.
Your little series of experiments....
Where do you think those tissue samples come from?
Well, l was just asking myself--
Just ask a so-called ethical board for their opinion...
...on testing leukaemia patients without their knowledge.
-l had no idea.
-Of course not.
And who cares?
A terminally ill patient barely notices.
Everyone wants to be cured, but no one wants to pay the price.
But, the crimes committed by the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge....
My God. The embarrassing slips made by a few Nazi doctors...
...of course these must be rejected.
But the achievements of those times...
...have been lost. Especially in anatomy.
When your grandfather developed
Promidal--
-What?
-Well, of course.
Grand Master of The Lodge up to the end of the war. l thought you knew that.
-But--
-Your grandfather.
They were just terminally ill prisoners, worthless lives.
But those fantastic specimens! Vivisected!
Honey! You've already arrived!
-Did they give you the message?
-What about?
-Your grandfather....
-What's wrong?
But l wanted....
He's so disgusting.
Paula, we can break a body down into molecules and examine it.
But we can't grasp the soul's basic essence. ls it all true?
You hate him and you love him at the same time. l know that feeling well. l've known it for about 50 years.
Quiet please!
The human specimens which were preserved were all morituri.
Two carcinomas, one leukaemia, one advanced myocarditis. l confess to having broken the rules in the two aforementioned cases.
Enough! You have murdered human beings! Fellow students!
-This is beyond--
-l have broken the rules...
...set down in the book and accept the penalty.
Young man, the Lodge provides a traditional form for our research--
For hypocritical chatter about forbidden pharmaceutical experimentation?
To get money from the pharmaceutical industry.
The Lodge has always disregarded laws and prevailing morals, on a grand scale.
You are destroying everything with your petty bourgeois morals! l know the rules.
What we are doing is pure research.
Not your fucking, bourgeois medicine.
What do l care about the aches and pains of a pensioner...
...who'll kick the bucket two years from now?
Take a look at our specimens.
That is science!
That is for eternity!
As his professor and Grand Master, l take full responsibility.
A murder committed out of jealousy is no internal matter for the Lodge. l will pass this case on to the police...
...with all its consequences, even those which involve me.
You won't do that. Did you hear me?
You won't do that!
You'll regret it.
This is the Hennings' answering machine.
We're momentarily not at home.
Please leave us a message.
We will call you back.
This is Grombek.
A message for Miss Paula Henning.
Please call me back. lt's urgent.
Heidelberg, 23 17 96.
Or preferably, drop by tomorrow morning to see me.
We have a far larger problem...
...than l feared. lt seems it will be necessary to inform the police. l think, l will need your help. l know l'm not a great doctor. l don't have your talent. l could never prove that there are also other ways.
But you are strong, Paula.
You have a heart.
You can do everything differently.
Meet me today at 8.00 p.m. in the specimen hall. Grombek.
Only at 8.00 p.m.?
Caspar is up in our room.
The others are studying for the mid-term exam.
-Have you by any chance seen Gretchen?
-No.
-Paula, what's wrong?
-Hi.
Gretchen hasn't shown up yet and my grandpa....
Come in. l thought she was away for the weekend with Phil?
Yes, but it's just....
What l wanted to say was....
Professor?
Professor Grombek?
Hello?
My most beautiful work.
Because l really loved her. lsn't the human body a miracle?
So cleverly constructed.
An incredibly intelligent system...
...of such breathtaking beauty.
That's why l became a doctor.
Wasn't that why you did?
These vivid colours. And the tissue....
So rich. lt's like capturing life for a moment.
Promidal has nothing to do with preserving decomposing flesh.
Look, l cheated here.
The carotid belongs to someone else.
Gretchen's was twisted in such a strange way that....
But look here.
Her heart. Fantastic.
The face...
...is just for me. l can put it on her, when l'm alone--
You don't understand?
Most people don't understand.
Gretchen will be beautiful for me. Forever.
And you will be beautiful, too.
-Caspar?
-That wasn't nice of you. l was looking for you, because l wanted to explain...
...and then this crazy guy headed for you with a syringe.
-Did he give me a shot?
-A huge one!
Quick, Caspar.
A hypertonic saline solution.
-10% sodium chloride in--
-This isn't appropriate timing, but...
-...l'm not a doctor.
-What?
History. l'm writing a thesis on the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge...
-...from their origins up to 1945.
-A syringe!
There, behind the door. ln the middle cabinet. Hurry! l just wanted to go down to the library...
...since they normally won't let anyone in.
Take the small bottle of sodium chloride.
-What?
-'N', 'a', 'C', 'l'.
Here. They would have found out after mid-term exams.
But l have nearly everything l need.
Tell me...
-...do you think something dangerous....
-Caspar.
-My real name is Oliver Kaufmann.
-Great.
-Prepare the syringe.
-Okay.
-Turn it over.
-Like this?
Oh, like on TV.
Now in the air?
-And now in the butt.
-No! ln the vein. Like on TV.
-No. l can't do it.
-Caspar! l need the saline solution.
Otherwise l'll die. Come on!
At a low angle into the vein.
That wasn't at all bad for a historian.
Wouldn't it be safer to call the hospital?
Tell me, why did you have Promidal in the bathroom cabinet?
-Promi.... What?
-Promidal.
The stuff they killed those people with.
That's our bathroom.
The deodorant is mine, too.
What is the meaning of this?
Hey, guys. l'm not a doctor.
This interests me only as a historian.
Take a look. These drawings are by Paula's grandpa.
The act of procreation in cross section.
An eternal hard-on, one could say.
Or, if you prefer, half a hard-on.
Hein has injected you with 3 units.
So you will be with us for about four hours. lf you keep your heart rate slow.
After all, it contains an analgesic.
As student of medicine l find it somehow...
...interesting.
You can watch how....
Would you like a cookie?
When you're stoned while doing it, it's....
Well? Did you sleep with the little whore, too?
Who? Gretchen? Leave that alone.
Don't play around with it.
You're not in a position to crack stupid jokes just now, Caspar.
-Are you insane? You impotent asshole!
-Keep your mouth shut...
...or l'll cut your vocal cords. l'm going to kill this arrogant bastard.
-This can't be true.
-Keep your mouth shut, damn it!
Shut up, that won't help--
-What's happening here?
-l need saline solution.
NaCl, you asshole! 'N', 'a'.
Could someone stitch me up?
Fucking medical assholes.
''There's blood within the shoe.'' lt was all just a joke! You pig!
Hi. So?
What is it?
Everything's still there.
Don't complain so much, Caspar.
Who knows, what permanent damage--
Besides, my name is Oliver.
This is just a check-up. l soothe your pain. l'm a doctor.
But your not practising.
This is in bad taste.
My God, it's terrible when one thinks about it.
Ludwig was always a bit weird.
But Hein....
Hein was actually.... ln scientific terms, he was brilliant.
Sure, in scientific terms....
Have you seen the specimens? l mean Gretchen.
Before the police....
Yes, in scientific terms, he was brilliant. ln private life he was also absolutely okay.
-Evenings at the Lodge....
-Pity about the Lodge. l'm going to a hospital in Berlin.
They say there's a good Lodge there. lsn't that where they experiment anaesthetics on patients?
And you? l'm taking over my father's studio.
Private studios are rarely inspected...
...so you can play around a little.
Do you already know who's going to be Grombek's successor?
-Stievers, l believe.
-ls he also....
Tradition.
-Good morning.
-'Morning, Mr. Taxidermist. How are you?
Same as always.
