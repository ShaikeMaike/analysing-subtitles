My name is Alice.
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security...
...at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
But there was an incident.
The virus escaped and everybody died.
Trouble was...
...they didn't stay dead.
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.
But I survived.
Myself and one other...
...an environmentalist named Matt.
When we emerged, we were seized by Umbrella scientists.
Matt and I were separated.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...
...and assemble the team.
We're reopening The Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
We thought we'd survived the horror.
But we were wrong.
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.
It's 6:10 in the a.m. And already the temperature has reached...
...a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues.
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a light breeze coming in from the west.
And as a special bonus just for you, we have a pollen count of 0. 7.
That's a record low for this time of year.
Good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers.
All in all, it looks like it's gonna be another beautiful day.
Stay with us. After the break...
...we're gonna look at your favorite holiday hot spots.
Advance team, proceed.
Sir.
Holy shit.
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.
How bad is it?
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?
You don't understand.
She's left for school.
This is U-Gamma 7, evacuation complete...
...but we just lost contact with Gamma 12.
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup at city hall.
Still no explanation for this wave of unexplained killings...
...that is sweeping across the city.
A deadly crime spree with no end.
Backup, we need backup now!
Just like Valentine told us...
Off-duty law enforcement personnel, report for duty immediately.
Give us a hand over here, this guy's insane!
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.
- Valentine!
- They're infected.
Somebody get this ugly bitch off of me!
I told you. Shoot for the head.
Please, somebody get her.
No! Don't shoot! Don't...
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.
Everyone's leaving the city.
We've received reports of Umbrella Corporation...
...dispatching armed guards and troop carriers.
Move in an orderly fashion to security checkpoints.
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.
The only way out is this bridge.
All citizens must pass through medical scanning.
Sir! You better take a look at this.
Family members must pass through security checkpoints together.
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!
No pushing, please. Keep in line.
Can we get some reinforcements down here?
Chopper Delta, new orders.
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.
Reinforcements urgently needed.
Copy that, base. On our way.
Get it.
No! Get off!
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!
No! Get back!
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.
I can't. We have our orders.
No! Get back! No!
They're gonna kill her!
Take us down now!
She's a civilian. We have orders.
Fuck orders!
Nicholai, tie me off.
Get back! No!
Wait!
Now!
Take us down! Down, now!
Hey. Hey, you okay?
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.
I've seen what happens to you once you've been bitten.
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.
No!
Move! Peyton!
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!
Everybody, stand back!
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!
Get back!
It's here. It's reached the gate.
Why are you here? You should've got out while you had the chance.
These are our people, Jill.
- Close them.
- Sir?
Seal the gates.
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.
Oh, my God, they're closing the gates!
This is a biohazard quarantine area.
Due to risk of infection, you cannot be allowed to leave the city.
What the fuck is going on here?
All appropriate measures are being taken.
The situation is under control.
Please return to your homes.
You won't get away with this!
Let us out!
You have five seconds to turn around...
...and return to the city.
Do it.
Use of live ammunition has been authorized.
Five.
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.
Three.
- Get them back!
- Two.
- Move!
- One.
Everybody, clear out!
Kilo and Romeo squads, rendezvous at sector 01...
...and secure against enemy.
- Grenade!
- Grenade!
Squads three to seven are on full retreat.
No, sir. Suppression measures have failed. We can't contain it.
The infection is spreading faster than anyone anticipated.
Dr. Ashford.
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.
I was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone.
You're too important to Umbrella to be at risk.
I'm not leaving without my daughter.
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.
She may have survived the crash, but we couldn't find her anywhere.
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.
You do what you have to do.
I'm staying.
There has to be someone left alive.
Come on.
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.
Prepare her for exposure.
Up the dosage.
Just do it.
Inside.
Inside.
Let's get under cover.
You have to get out.
This is my place. I'm hiding here.
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
And, you, take it easy.
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...
...have any comment on what those things are?
What's that you got there?
My Emmy.
That's if any of us make it out.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
It's my sister. She's not well.
- Maybe I can help.
- No.
Out of my way.
Just get out.
You're feeding her? You're sick.
Just leave us alone.
No!
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.
Hey! Hey, no!
Oh, my God!
Hey, help us! Come on!
Get it in there!
What the hell was that?
There!
Jesus.
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?
Get back here.
Peyton.
Terri.
Peyton.
I know.
I count three of them.
They got us boxed in.
What are we gonna do?
Let's go.
Jesus.
We're gonna need more ammo. I'm out.
Shit. I'm out.
Move.
Who the fuck are you?
GTA, motherfucker!
Oh, yeah!
Ten points!
Yuri. You okay?
Bite this.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Pull back!
This way.
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.
We need to find somewhere to stop for a moment.
I don't think that's a good idea.
There might be more of those...
...things.
If there were more, we'd have seen them by now.
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...
...from Umbrella labs beneath the city.
How come you know so much about Umbrella?
I used to work for them.
Damn it.
Hold it.
What do you think you're doing?
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.
I'm fine.
You should take care of him now.
It'll be more difficult later.
You know that.
No.
If it comes to that...
...I'll take care of it myself.
As you wish.
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...
...you'll be dead.
And moments later, you'll become one of them.
You'll endanger your friends, try to kill them...
...probably succeed.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
Help me!
There's too many of them.
Let's get out of here.
This way!
Sir, T-virus infection has reached critical levels.
This is a perfect opportunity.
Ensure all data streams are recorded.
Activate Nemesis Program now.
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.
No. No! Don't leave!
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.
Maybe a radio. One that works.
Take Yuri.
Hold on, Yuri.
Nicholai, put me down.
Okay, rest here.
What is this?
Looks like weapon cases.
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!
These weren't meant for us.
Yuri!
Plenty to go around.
Don't shoot!
I got the power.
Thank you! Owe you one, man.
Shit!
Maybe I was safer outside.
Get them guns out of my damn face.
Motherfucker, please. Look...
...my shit is custom.
What the fuck is that?
Shit!
You're going down, you son of a bitch!
Fuck.
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy, got a rocket launcher.
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.
Fire!
Back! Fall back!
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.
S.T.A.R.S.
Oh, shit.
Respect.
Those were some pretty slick moves back there.
I'm good...
...but I'm not that good.
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?
They did something to me.
I barely feel human anymore.
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.
Keep moving.
- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.
All four of you.
But first we have to come to an arrangement.
Are you ready to make a deal?
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...
Runs the genetics and viral research division of Umbrella Corporation.
What's he want with us?
His daughter, Angela, is trapped in the city.
Umbrella was to evac her, but she didn't make it.
She's hiding out in her school.
We find her, he'll help us escape the perimeter.
No fucking deal.
We find the building with the thickest walls and doors...
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.
There won't be any help.
Umbrella knows they can't contain the infection.
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.
What do you mean by "sanitized"?
A precision tactical nuclear device.
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...
...and all evidence of it.
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!
No fucking way would they get away with that!
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.
Cover-up's already prepared.
A meltdown at the nuclear power plant.
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.
Not capable?
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.
So, what do we do now, huh?
I think we should be out of here by sunrise.
What if there is no way out and he's watching us on these cameras...
What if there is no way out and he's watching us on these cameras...
...like this is some kind of sick game?
- What is it?
- What's going on?
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain't gonna wait.
No.
- There's something down there.
- Where?
There.
I don't see anything.
That doesn't alter the fact that there is something down there.
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!
Peyton!
No!
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. Members.
Nemesis.
Run. Just go!
Primary target is identified.
Gentlemen, this is what we've been waiting for.
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.
The Nemesis Program is now fully activated.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.
Let's just get to the school and find this kid.
This bite...
...it won't stop bleeding.
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?
The chopper. We were right there in the street in front of the hospital.
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.
What do you mean?
We're assets, Nicholai.
Expendable assets.
And we've just been expended.
Stop!
I'm not one of those things.
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't been bitten or anything. Look.
Climb aboard.
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.
You can call me L.J. on account of the informal situation.
We're gonna have to split up to search this place.
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going out there by myself.
I can go with you.
You, take the first floor.
You, take the second.
I'll take the basement.
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.
Try to hit them in the head.
I see you, mother...
Oh, shit!
So did you get the call as well?
- What?
- You're here for the girl?
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal with someone else.
I guess we're partners.
Shit.
Angela?
It's gonna be okay.
There's no need to be afraid.
We're gonna take you home.
Oh, my God.
Help me!
Terri?
You can't help her.
Not now.
I've seen what they do.
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.
We should hurry before they come back.
Hold this.
Angela Ashford, huh?
That's a pretty grown-up name for a little girl.
I'm not a little girl.
Besides...
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?
I like that.
Those things are in here.
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.
No.
Not them.
Them.
Get back.
Stay.
Thought you might need a hand.
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev, at your service.
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.
Oh, shit.
From now on, stay right beside me.
It's blocked.
What do we do now?
Wait here. Eyes:
Okay?
Thank you.
You two know each other?
She's infected.
She's infected on a massive level.
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.
You're infected? When were you gonna tell us that?
- Let me see.
- No.
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.
Let me see.
It's the antivirus, the cure to the T-virus.
There's a cure?
How did you get this?
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.
He just wanted to stop that.
When I was little...
...I had to walk on crutches.
They said I'd never get better, just worse.
He found a way to make me stronger.
The T-virus.
Then they took the invention away from him.
Get out of my house!
He's not a bad man.
He didn't mean for any of this.
It's okay.
Don't shoot! He's cool.
He made a deal with Dr. Doom, same as you.
How many of you guys are there?
What do you mean?
Nicholai.
When were you bitten?
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?
It's your lucky day.
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.
There's a helicopter already being prepped.
It takes off in 47 minutes.
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.
I take it this helicopter isn't laid out just for us.
No. It has another purpose, but it'll be lightly guarded.
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?
Soon. These people will bring you to see me.
I'll see you very soon.
Put the lady back on.
Where do we have to go?
The helicopter will be at city hall.
I suggest you make haste.
Computers...
...so unreliable.
Just like people.
You really thought I didn't know?
So, what are you injecting me with?
The antivirus.
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.
Basically, bringing the dead to life.
Or in a living human, it can cause uncontrollable mutation.
Or it can help her walk again, if the virus is kept in check with this.
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.
The cellular growth is enough to regenerate her...
...but not enough to cause mutation.
And they infected you with the T-virus as well?
Yeah.
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
Here.
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.
My name is Alice.
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
Let's go.
You missed one.
We have to hurry.
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?
We've been expecting you.
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.
- Angie!
- Daddy!
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.
Discard primary weaponry.
The two of you showed such promise, but we had to see you in action.
And most impressive you've been.
You're like brother and sister.
Heightened speed, strength, agility, the same killer instincts.
Parallel strands of research.
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.
Fight him.
No.
Fight him, or they die.
What makes you think I care?
Daddy! Daddy, no.
No.
He was a valuable asset to the corporation.
I don't even care about these people.
Begin.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Cellular structure breaking down.
T-virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation.
We're seeing similar cellular regeneration.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.
Finish him.
I said, finish him.
No.
No.
Don't you understand how important you are to me?
That creature is one thing, but you...
...somehow you bonded with the T-virus on a cellular level.
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.
- I became a freak.
- No.
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.
With my help, just imagine what you can achieve.
What about him?
Evolution has its dead ends.
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...
...and come with me.
No.
You're such a disappointment to me.
All that strength...
...but no will to use it.
What a waste.
Prepare for takeoff.
Sanitation of Raccoon City to commence on my mark.
Kill her.
What are you doing?
Get us airborne.
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.
Detonation set at T-minus 5 minutes.
Angie, get down!
Why haven't we taken off?
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.
Surrender, or we open fire.
Drop it.
Alice!
Drop your weapon and surrender.
Let's get this thing in the air!
You have to get up.
Matt...
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.
Come on.
Get up!
If you expect me to beg, I will not.
Wait.
Killing me won't put things right.
No...
...but it's a start.
Are you going to be all right?
Hang on to something!
We're going down!
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.
We've located the crash site.
Fetch the medical team.
What about the others?
No other bodies found, sir.
We have unconfirmed reports of disaster at Raccoon City.
These shocking images just in.
A mysterious plague or viral outbreak has run rampant...
Implicating Umbrella Corporation in deaths of innocent citizens.
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7 anchorwoman Terri Morales.
New evidence now discredits earlier reports...
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.
Nothing more than a big hoax.
Playing on the very real tragedy...
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.
The reactor at the nuclear power station went critical.
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.
The state governor personally thanked the Umbrella Corporation...
...for their swift action.
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...
...now being sought for questioning by the police.
Alice.
Alice, wake up.
Can you hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good.
Begin the purging process.
Her recovery's remarkable.
And her powers, both physical and mental...
...are developing at a geometric rate.
Where are you?
You're safe.
Come on.
That's it.
There we are.
Do you know what that is?
It's a pen.
You see?
You try.
That's it.
Pen.
Look at me.
Can you remember anything?
You remember your name?
My name?
My name.
I want her under
24-hour observation.
A complete set of blood work.
Chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day.
My name.
- My name.
- Sir.
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.
My name.
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.
Sir!
What is it?
My name...
...is Alice.
And I remember everything.
This is central.
Request immediate backup.
Maximum response.
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.
Sorry, sir.
Let them go.
Good to have you back.
Are you all right?
Program Alice activated.
What did they do to you?
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.
Our business is life itself.
Some side effects may occur.

Time.
Time, it has been proposed is the fourth dimension.
And yet, for mortal man, time has no dimension at all.
We are like horses with blinders seeing only what lies before us.
Forever guessing the future and fabricating the past.
Brilliant.
Quite right, Your Grace.
How, you ask, can we lift these shackles and live- not in the moment but in the glorious expanse of time's continuum?
Listen, and I shall tell you.
The secret lies in the enduring power of our achievements our creations!
As the pyramids testify to the Egyptians so my glorious erection shall represent our culture in perpetuity.
Behold, rising before you the greatest erection on the continent.
The greatest erection of the age!
The greatest erection on the planet!
Hold this.
Of course.
For the Herald, Your Grace.
I understand you'll be making an important announcement tonight.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.
Good afternoon.
And the Perrier-Jouet should be chilled.
- You understand? Chilled.
- Yes, sir.
Leopold!
Leopold, where have you been?
Leopold!
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00!
He's not even dressed!
He'll be ready, my lord.
I assure you.
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!
Ah, Miss Blaine.
You dance like a... like a herd of cattle.
You are a rare woman who lights up a room simply by leaving it.
Might you be rich,
Miss Blaine?
You see, whilst I am the third Duke the little secret of those of us in the Royal Court- apart from our general uselessness- is our massive indebtedness.
It's always been your misfortune, Leopold that you so thoroughly amuse yourself with the sound of your own voice.
In a life as stagnant as mine that I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.
Please don't touch that.
The device you were jabbering about.
To take priests to the bell tower.
To take anyone, Uncle, to the floor they so desire.
Buildings continue to climb.
Soon they will outstrip the stamina of our legs.
You speak of progress and invention.
Yet what I offer you downstairs is reality.
Take a wife. Marry.
Marriage... marriage is the promise of eternal love.
As a man of honor, I can not promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.
Born into privilege, yet perversely ashamed of it.
That is your tragedy.
My God! If my brother could only see you, he'd be heartbroken.
You are no duke!
Of course I'm not.
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.
We are relics.
That is reality.
The new Royals are men of accomplishment.
Men like Roebling, with his bridge
Edison, with his lamp
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...
Those men made themselves from nothing!
You, on the other hand, were born with everything and from it, fashioned nothing.
As of tonight,
I wash my hands of you.
Take a good look at your dance card, Leopold.
A wealthy bride is your only surety.
Your Grace, may I present Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady, sir.
Miss Tree?
It's an honor to be making your royal acquaintance,
Your Highness.
Shall we?
Many dreams, all useless.
Who are you?
No, no, no.
Okay, rela...
Please, wait, no.
I don't want to harm you.
Stop! Please!
Sir, wait!
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Go! Go!
Ya!-
Ya!
Stop, sir! Please!
Oh, my God.
No!
Oh!
Let go!
Just let go. It's okay!
You don't understand!
Let go!
Oh!
I don't want to hurt you!
Let go!
Goddamn it!
Bart!
Wait!
Shit!
Oh, my God.
We must remember, Bart that sometimes it is okay to color outside the lines.
Hello?
My Palm Pilot.
You still have it.
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.
And clearly you're awake, so what is the infraction?
Look, Kate, I don't know where your Palm Pilot is.
And I can't do this right now.
Not now. I'm expecting a call.
Oh, Bart.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
She is not a happy person.
Goddamn it!
You know what, Stuart?
You know what? I'm...
Kate...
Please. I've got somebody here, okay?
I know. I saw her.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
It's a him, if that's any kind of consolation to you.
So, look, now that you know
I'm not getting laid, just go to bed, okay?
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not hang up on me, Stuart.
Don't do that.
Kate, please.
I beg of you.
Something big is happening.
Something that validates my entire life...
What could that possibly be?
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Ye...
Okay.
I found it.
What did you find?
The portal.
A crack in the fabric of time.
It was over the East River, Kate
- just where I said it would be.
- You found the portal?
A portal into April 28th, 1876.
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and took a walk in 1876 today.
I followed the Duke of Albany around old New York.
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.
This here's the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.
What's the kicker?
He followed me home.
The Duke of Buffalo...
No, the Duke of Albany.
...Albany followed you home through a crack in time.
He's a brilliant engineer.
He patented the counterweight pulley.
He invented the elevator, for Christ's sake.
You know what, Stuart?
You know what?
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.
I haven't been for a whole month now.
You can tell me the truth.
I am telling you the truth, Kate.
You can tell me you went and picked up a transvestite in Times Square.
I don't care.
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here.
This is it, in a nutshell.
Our downfall.
You never- not once- believed in me.
Oh, I did, Stuart.
I did, for four years.
And I got burnt.
Okay, you want to know who he is?
I'll tell you who he is.
He is a hacker.
High end. English.
I know him from Columbia.
He's in town for the Mac Expo at the Javits.
We went out, got a little sloppy on Guinness and he passed out on my couch.
And that's the truth?
Mm-hmm. That's the truth.
Okay? Are you happy now?
Is that plausible enough for you and your little focus group?
You know what, Stuart?
I blew my best years on you.
Those were your best?
Look...
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
You'll get your Pilot in the morning.
Orange alert.
Otis!-
Otis!
Bart, stop!
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- Where am I?
Well, um, there's not an easy explanation for that.
If it's a ransom you seek, my uncle won't pay a cent.
Except, perhaps, for my demise.
No. no. You're not being kidnapped.
Bart, quiet!
I can scarcely see, thanks to your spray.
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.
So I ask you again, where the hell am I?
As far as I'm concerned, you might be Jack the Ripper!
And you would have me believe that I'm being detained at present in the hereafter?
- The time to come?
- Yes.
Bart, quiet!
He needs a walk.
Oh, and you would have me believe that you have found a crack in time.
You, of all people, should understand.
I mean, you're a scientist.
You invented the elevator.
What is an elevator?
What the hell are you talk...
Where the hell am I?
I told you- you haven't actually gone anywhere.
You're still in New York.
That, sir, is not New York!
I'm afraid it is.
- No, Kate.
- Hello. Hello there.
What's your name?
- Leopold.
- Tell me something.
I'm having trouble with my G-5.
How much RAM do I need to properly run OS 9.6?
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.
So you must be... a man out of time?
Or Sergeant Pepper?
You know what?
Actually, we could use a little privacy.
Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.
- I'm not... I'm serious.
- Maybe later on, Kate.
I just want my Palm Pilot, Stuart!
- No. No.
- Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!
Give it to me.
This is madness.
This is madness.
Who was that?
I-I feel as if I've seen her...
Women have changed since your time, Leo.
They've become dangerous.
It's on the landing!
You say this is no kidnapping.
You say you mean no harm.
Then why is it, sir, you will not unlock the door?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about her. I'm...
Look, with all due respect
I can't let you just go running around free out there, okay?
This is New York City.
It's not such a safe place anymore.
Look at you.
You look like some sort of psychotic escapee from a Renaissance fair.
I understand you have some anxiety but you have to trust me.
I'm going to get you home, okay?
I promise.
Bart!
The portal opens up again next week. Monday.
I know that, because it was my back-up in case I didn't make it last night.
It's on a cycle, you know?
Kind of like, uh... total eclipse.
Once every 20 years.
You understand?
Generally,
I understand everything.
Since I've met you, nothing.
I can only assume
I'm in a nightmare brought on by agita, or else I am dead.
You're not dead.
Come here. Sit down.
Here.
Want some milk in yours?
Bart, can I just have...
Sorry. He's really got to go out.
I'd be honored if you took a look at those.
I'll explain everything when I get back.
He's got to go out or he'll drop a bomb in there.
Come on. Let's go.
Back in five.
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart and you and I will be Nobel...
Laureates.
Come on, Bart.
Hey, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!
Oh, Jesus!
Good boy, Bart!
Stay!
Stay, Bart. Stay!
Oh, Bart, please stay!
Stuart, you forgot the pointy thing!
Stuart...
Look, this is not complex.
He gave me the Palm Pilot but he forgot the pointy thing.
- I've been warned about you.
- Oh. Really?
And what, pray tell did the great disappointment say?
That you were dangerous, though you hardly look it.
- Oh, really?
- A lady in trousers isn't dangerous, merely plain.
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Yeah, market research.
Fine avocation for women, research.
Perfect for the feminine mind.
You're a trip, Lionel.
I myself once courted a librarian in Sussex.
Oh.
Good for you.
I must confess, I feel as though we've met on a previous occasion.
Well, Lionel, seeing as I've never met a single friend of Stuart's-
I'm not even sure he's ever had any-
I really don't see how that's possible.
Oh, man! Bart!
He just made Lake Erie out there.
You just can't toss a dog out into the hall like that.
- You can't do that.
- I assure you, I did not.
Let's go.
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on. Let's go!
Look, pal, I don't care how many elevators you've got.
This one's in my building.
Hang on a second.
Sorry about the elevator, Miss Kate.
I've got them on the phone right now.
Hey, Gracy. This is Lionel,
Stuart's friend.
How do you do?
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now.
- Watch it, man.
- I beg your pardon.
Hey, what are you doing?
You need to be going that way.
There's an electron... Hello?
- There's an electronics store.
- I'm sorry, miss.
There's a patch of grass across the street.
Take him there.
He'll do his business.
Can you give this to Stuart, please?
It's his cable bill.
They haul our furniture and cradle our children but this morning, from the Battery to the Bronx elevators have mysteriously...
So sorry.
- Stupid!
- I do beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Are you going to remove that?
I beg your pardon?
Pick it up and put it in the trash.
Absolutely not.
Maybe you don't understand.
It's against the law to leave it there.
Are you suggesting, madam, there exists a law compelling gentlemen to lay hold of canine bowel movements?
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up and throw it away now.
I refuse. Respectfully.
All right.
What's your name, fancy pants?
Leopold...
Alexis Elija...
Walker Thomas Garrett
Mountbatten.
All right, Stuart.
Have a nice day.
I appreciate you putting in a good word for me but J.J.'s not back from London.
Right. Bye.
- What's with the elevators?
- It's happening everywhere.
Darci.
Last page.
I'm sorry.
Did everyone live happily ever after?
He lost his leg to gangrene waiting for her on the island.
But they're together now.
Wonderful.
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.
- A nightmare.
Okay, so who do I owe?
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro,
Reeves at Crunch.
And the finals came in for "Love for Sale."
The call with the studio is at 4:00.
The margarine thing's in 15 in the conference room.
And J.J. wants to talk to you before that.
Oh, and one more thing.
I remember that you told me to start thinking ahead so I know your brother's getting back from his retreat tomorrow and if you want something in the fridge...
- Darci...
- Mm-hmm?
Can you tell me why I'm upset right now?
Because, uh...
J.J. called this morning.
That is why I have a cell phone.
- So you can call me...
- Kate, Kate, he didn't call.
He just popped his head in here and spoke two sentences.
So he's back?
Margo says he's going to make a big announcement about the merger next week.
Margo? What does she know?
How does she know anything about anything?
Oh. All right. So he popped his head in here.
All right, so you have to tell me exactly what he said, Darci.
You have to start at the beginning and tell me...
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."
J.J.
Good morning, Kate.
Good morning.
I'll see you in there.
Good Lord, it still stands.
The world has changed all around it but Roebling's erection still stands!
That, my friend, is a miracle.
- What?
- It's a miracle, man!
It's a bridge.
Tell me... when did they adapt it for steam engines?
The fire brigade.
I don't know how it happened.
I found him in a shaft.
Stuart!
Leopold, what are you doing out here?
Get back inside!
They're taking him to Goodman Memorial.
"Fresh creamery butter."
"Is there anything more comforting?"
"There is, and I know you will agree"
"when you try Farmer's Bounty"
"with the essence of real butter in every bite."
Your first choice.
However, 45% of our demo circled "shifty" as his key descriptor.
Not good.
"This is what I say."
"Everybody should be trying
Farmer's Bounty"
"with the real, rich, creamy taste of real butter."
"Try it, and you will be losing pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!"
Your second choice.
Unfortunately, the group found him obnoxious, abrasive and a whopping 72% found him just plain creepy.
The spot rolls out in four days.
We have to shoot...
The product is shipping, what the hell am I supposed to do?
We have to do another session, tomorrow.
I had my assistant book the response room at National so we can decide then and there.
Kate, are you all right?
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Geez, Kate, I'd ask for a decaf.
Monica, I need you to call Barney's.
I need a white blouse, size small in Kate's office by lunch.
Oh, dear.
"Hi, you've reached Stuart."
"Please leave a message."
Leopold? Leopold, look, don't be frightened.
This is Stuart, okay?
I see it is Bell's talking telegraph.
I saw a prototype at last year's fair.
I need you to pick up the handset, Leo.
You pick up the green handset, because I need to talk to you...
Are-are you there?
- Hello?
- Leopold, thank God.
Listen, they're taking me to X-Rays.
Everything's going to be fine but you have to stay in the apartment.
Do you understand me?
Oh, Stuart,
I saw Roebling's bridge today.
I saw it... complete.
Yes, yes, but listen to me.
You can't go out again.
You have to stay in the apartment.
Stay in the apartment?
For how long?
Leo, I'll be back tonight.
I promise- no more field trips.
Would you...
Hel... hello?
Stuart? Hello?
Blast!
Hello.
Hello. Who are you?
Hector. My mom works late on Wednesdays so I watch TV with Stuart.
Want some Pirate's Booty?
Hang on.
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted to thank you for the shirt.
That was very nice.
Come in, come in.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, she's here right now.
I'll tell her.
Okay... okay.
Bye.
Sit down.
That was Barry.
He was thrilled with your work at the screening last night.
Oh, good. Good.
You're a rarity among women, Kate.
I'm sorry?
You don't cling to illusion.
You don't get caught up in emotion.
You don't do pretty.
I don't?
You skew male.
You're like a man.
A man who understands women- their desires, their needs.
You understand them but you're not really one of them.
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't. No.
Endamame?
Kate?
One day, he lowered the Jolly Roger
- Stu?
- and set sail in search of another kind of treasure.
Not money, not jewels, not gold... but a bride.
Despite his being a ruffian of the brine fearless in his plunder and merciless with the sword the Pirate King was also lonely.
You see, he had never met a lady.
He never met a girl?
No. Not a girl, not a lady, not even his own mother.
- So what happened?
- As with all comedies the most ridiculous thing imaginable- the Pirate King fell in love with the major general's daughter.
I had the good fortune to see the premiere last month at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.
Since when is
Penzance at the Fifth?
Is it your habit, sir to simply enter a conversation without introduction?
Whoa, you are deep in it.
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.
Kate McKay, senior vice president.
Darci, it hasn't happened.
All he did was dangle a carrot.
Until he makes a decision the pressure's doubled.
When's he going to make a decision?
We're having dinner tomorrow to discuss it further at Commune.
- Kate?
- Yeah.
- I have Stuart on the line.
- No!
- He says he's in the hospital.
- No!
Leopold is just sitting alone in my apartment right now.
God knows what could happen to him.
Do you know he got outside today?
Of course he did-
I made him walk your dog.
What? No, Kate, you can't do that!
He can't go outside!
Jesus Christ, Kate.
He's from 1876, Kate.
He doesn't know our customs.
If something were to happen to him
- it could be catastrophic.
- Shh!
If he doesn't go back to April 28, 1876, he doesn't get married he doesn't have children, and you want to know what?
What happened with the elevators today, well that's going to seem like a walk in the park.
Stuart! This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing now, all right?
Someone has to keep an eye on him.
Stuart, he's a grown man.
He's a grown man. He's fine.
He can take care of himself.
- No. Wait. Aah!
- I'm going.
Kate, please.
Just take this to Spectra, okay?
Get it developed.
You'll see I'm telling the truth.
Tell Manny it's important.
You want double prints?
That's not funny, Kate.
This is not a joke.
You need help, Stuart.
You need help.
Charlie?
Hey, Kate!
Can I see you downstairs for a minute?
I invited someone to dinner.
He's up there all alone.
Stuart's in the hospital.
I didn't think you'd have such a problem...
No, you didn't think, Charlie.
You didn't think.
You came home early, one day early from actor camp.
Okay, it's not actor camp and yeah, I came home a day early, all right?
There was this tai chi broad who kept trying
- stick her fingers...
- No, this is the point.
You immediately march upstairs to my ex-boyfriend's apartment and you invite his freakish friend...
See, that's what it's about.
It's not that
I went up there.
It's that it was your ex-boyfriend...
No, it's not about Stuart.
- Greetings, Kate, Charles.
- Hey, Leo.
Be nice.
So, when's Stuart getting back?
Couple of days, maybe a week.
He promised me that he would return late this evening.
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.
He's so big on keeping his promises.
May I have the next course?
There is no next course.
Where I come from, the meal... is the result of reflection and study.
Menus are prepared in advance timed to perfection.
It is said, without the culinary arts the crudeness of reality would be unbearable.
We had a saying in the McKay house:
"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle.
None will come, and then a lot'll."
What is that?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why are you standing?
I'm accustomed to stand when a lady leaves the table.
Tell me, Charles when Stuart and your sister were engaged did you happen to read his papers on the temporal universe?
I spent the morning perusing them, and must confess...
Stuart and I were never engaged.
Not even close.
But I did read...
Thank you.
But I did read his papers, however, to show support.
Is Stuart still trying to make a time machine?
That's the beauty of it he discovered no machine was necessary.
All one had to do was to develop formulae to forecast portals- natural windows in the fabric of time.
Apparently, Stuart located one utilizing modern...
Utilizing modern theories of weather prediction.
What's a portal?
An opening which exists for but a moment.
This explains why one must jump through it from a height- in order to achieve the required velocity.
The speed of gravity, to be exact.
It's quite brilliant.
You are so method.
You don't even break for a second, do you?
It's unbelievable!
Oh, stop it, please!
No more! Stop, please?
I beg you. I'm tired.
Can you go away?
Can you just go away?
Can you go away?
She's drunk, Leo.
Oh, shut up, Charlie!
And you, can you go upstairs?
Can you go away?
I am truly sorry if I have offended you in any way.
Goodnight, Charles.
Goodnight, Leo.
What the hell was that?
He thinks he's from the 19th century, Charlie.
He thinks he's a duke.
- I know. Isn't that cool?
Kate, he's in character.
He is an actor.
Oh, really? For what show?
You know that just because someone doesn't have a paying gig it doesn't mean they're not working on their craft.
What's going on here?
I think there's something wrong with his, uh... thing.
Give me that telephone.
No.
- Give it to me.
- No, I need to...
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.
They're not allowed on hospital property.
I have to make a phone call!
You're not going to make one now.
No, no, you don't understand.
This is a very important phone call.
I have to leave this hospital now.
I can't be here anymore.
Mr. Besser,
I'm tired of telling you this.
You are not going nowhere until Dr. Feinstein signs your release!
Did you ever take any earth science, Esther, hmm?
You look like a smart woman.
Ever hear of the time-space continuum?
Sounds important, doesn't it?
Well, it is.
And you want to know something, Esther?
It's broken! Okay?
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.
So why don't you go down the hall there and get on your little telephone and call Dr. Feinstein...
Goodnight, Mr. Besser.
You tell him that...
You tell him that I...
Point the toes, pull your shoulders back.
Take a deep breath in and then exhale into downward-facing dog.
Oh, be quiet!
Be quiet... oh!
Bart, shut up!
That thing is a damned hazard!
It's just a toaster!
Well, insertion of bread into that so-called toaster produces no toast at all- merely warm bread!
Inserting the bread twice produces charcoal.
So, clearly, to make proper toast it requires 1 1/2 insertions which is something for which the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!
One assumes that when the General of Electric built it he might have tried using it.
One assumes the General might take pride in his creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.
You know something?
Nobody gives a rat's ass that you have to push the toast down twice.
You know why?
Because everybody pushes their toast down twice!
Not where I come from.
Oh, because where you come from toast is the result of reflection and study.
Yes, you mock me.
But perhaps one day, when you've awoken from a pleasant slumber to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter you'll understand that life is not solely comprised of tasks, but tastes.
Say that again.
Pardon me?
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.
Session list.
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.
I'd like him to read.
Can you tack him on at the end?
And, Leopold, go with Darci.
She'll take you to the greenroom and explain everything.
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.
If I could get Mr. Duke?
Is he ready? Where is he?
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's skip this one.
Mr. Duke.
Right here on the floor.
Excuse me, that's your marker, right there.
Just stand on that tape line.
Look, forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time, J.J.
We need to make a decision now.
All right, we've got plenty of good choices.
Let's cut it off, Kate.
That would be a mistake, J.J.
Kate, the client wants to move on.
We should see this last guy.
It'll... Two minutes!
I think he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.
Well, Phil, it's really not about what you think.
It's about what they think.
They've been in a coma all day and now look at them.
To them, this guy is a dream.
He's handsome, honest, courteous.
Stands when you walk in a room.
Brings you brioche in bed.
If you eat his margarine maybe your hips will shrink and he'll come to your door.
I take it this is to be delivered in direct address as on Geronimo.
Geronimo?
He means Geraldo.
Exactly.
Okay, everyone- quiet please.
And action.
Start talking, bud.
Fresh creamery butter.
Is there anything more comforting?
I say there is.
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty you shall receive butter's luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline.
Not bad, Kate.
Where'd you find him?
He lives in my building.
- Where do I sign?
- Right here, and here.
Oh! Hi.
That was spectacular, Kate.
- Thanks, J.J.
- A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You seem pleased.
Oh, you did so great in there!
Man!
You are going to be on a national television spot!
I take it you're dining with that man tonight.
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.
He's my boss.
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.
Oh, I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor
I would have informed you of my intentions in writing.
Good day.
- Hey!
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.
They're for tourists.
Sorry, she doesn't seem interested.
Oh, hey, hello. Hello.
Hey! Hey, you...
Kate!
Hey, you asshole!
I'm gonna get you!
Asshole!
Goddamn it.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand, woman!
Yah! Yah!
What do you think you're doing?
Whoa, hey!
Yah!
I warn you, scoundrel
I was trained to ride at King's Academy and schooled in weaponry by the palace guard. You stand no chance.
Where you run, I shall ride and when you stop, the steel of this strap will be lodged in your brain.
Your boyfriend's a very good rider.
Yeah.
Are you for real?
Pardon me?
Are you for real?
I believe so.
You're a duke.
I was born a duke.
I've never felt like one.
Stay. Sit.
On your feet. Stay.
Stay. Good boy.
I'm off to dinner.
What are you two doing?
I don't know. Maybe we'll... watch the rest of the game or go out or something.
Oh, thank you.
Kate, may I repeat my offer to serve as a chaperone?
No, thank you, Leopold.
Charles, don't you find this inappropriate?
- As her brother, I would think...
- As her brother, I would think that my sister would invite me to an audition.
Could be just me, though.
Seems kind, but...
- Charlie.
- Hmm?
You're not exactly a margarine spokesperson.
- I can't sell butter, Kate?
- I don't mean to be insulting...
It's insulting. I'm an actor.
You don't have faith in me to sell butter?
- No. No. I'm sorry.
- I can do British, Kate.
- I'm an actor. I can be anybody!
- You're a very, very good actor.
- I am a good actor.
- You are.
Okay, fine, all right.
A Victorian dude who's never seen a Mets game watching TV.
Scene: I say, are those little people in that box of phosphorous?
Why, crikey! I believe it is!
This game's more beguiling than cricket!
Indian: Good golly, oh, Jesus!
It looks like Mike Piazza just hit a game!
How about Canadian?
Oh, right on.
Right on, you like butter, huh?
Yeah, what's that about?
Good night
Good night.
...all those people up in that stadium.
Know what they probably could go for?
Some margarine!
When your friend walked in in that outfit
I was getting a little nervous for you there.
"If you eat his margarine, maybe your hips will shrink."
It's brilliant. You saved Phil from his own ambivalence.
I knew it was the way to go- in my gut.
I'm counting on that gut.
Can I get a bottle of your '95 Lynch-Bages and a bottle of Evian?
I'll tell you one thing: your friend is going to be bigger than Mr. Whipple.
Thanks.
You're not sleeping with him, are you?
No
No.
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.
How's it going, man?
See the girl with the long brown hair?
That's Patrice.
She's lovely.
She's mine.
Congratulations.
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!
Leo, this is everybody.
What's up? Dennis.
Shelby, Allison, Monica.
And this, this is the insatiable Patrice.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How do you do?
- Patrice, let me assist you.
- Thanks.
You got it?
I was going to get it.
Let me get that for you.
There you go.
You look nice tonight. Very...
Like a Judy Blume book.
That's good, because I thought for a moment that body of water here was a moat.
No, that's a pond.
The gardens are devastating.
They are. They're very, very beautiful.
You'll have to come and see them firsthand.
Right, right.
After the merger I'm going to be stuck over there, setting things up.
I'll be craving a little face time from my new top honcho in New York.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should come visit.
- I'll fly you over for the weekend.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that, but the... the other part, the part before that.
The part about the top honcho.
I didn't understand that, that part.
How about catching an opera
Saturday?
La Boheme's at the Met.
Okay, so she comes back- the audience is about to leave- she comes back on stage and she starts squirting the audience with this turkey baster filled with this pine mist.
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"
But no tears.
Just raw human passion.
Isn't... Willem Dafoe part of that group?
Yeah, and he did this monologue about how all the best things in life are hidden in people's basements.
Like the Louvre.
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?
- Just...
- No, what about the Louvre?
Tell us what you were going to say.
Well, only a fraction of the Louvre is on the walls.
- The rest is in the basement.
- You've been in the basement of the Louvre?
Oh, yes.
I was an art history major at Vassar.
And so, what's down there?
Well, that's where the real show begins.
Unspoiled by dilettante.
Da Vinci, Michelangelo,
David, Chardin.
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice."
"Oh, let me light that for you, Monica."
"What, this?"
"This is my family crest."
"Been in the family for..."
"Oh, in the basement?"
"What do they have in the basement?
Why, the works of da Vinci"
"Michelangelo, Chardin, David"
"all surrounded by great coral sponges to absorb the moisture."
Just for the record, I was working it.
I was in the zone and I would have gotten her number if you hadn't turned the evening into a guided tour of the Louvre.
My apologies.
Let's get one thing straight.
Patrice, she thought you were cute - probably gay and cute.
And cute, Leo, that's the kiss of death.
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps? Certainly.
I believe this is her number.
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of your affections.
And it's no wonder.
You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.
A what?
Everything plays a farce to you.
Women respond to sincerity.
This requires pulling one's tongue from one's cheek.
No one wants to be romanced by a buffoon.
Now, that number rings her.
- Yes?
- So ring her tomorrow.
I can't. She gave the number to you.
Only because I told her of your affections.
Wha-What did you say?
Merely that you admired her but you were hesitant to make an overture since you'd been told she was courting another.
Shit. That's good!
Wha-What did she say?
She handed me the napkin.
Charles, it's quite late.
No, no, no, she won't be home yet.
I get her machine,
I leave a message.
Ball's in her court.
You're ladling calculation upon comedy.
The point is, to keep the ball in your court.
You're right. You're right.
Okay.
Nothing need be done till tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.
An overture, Charles.
Make your intentions known.
Think of pleasing her, not vexing her.
No vexing.
You're intoxicated.
We should retire.
I'm sure Kate will be home.
I doubt it.
But it's nearly midnight.
You like her, don't you?
- Who?
- Kate.
- You do!
- Oh, Charles, stop.
You like my sister!
Well, you made your intentions known, right?
- Right?
- You've been drinking.
Leo, Commune is right around the corner.
We could stop in, you could give me a couple of pointers pull out a chair or two, you could throw out a gesture here or there.
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.
It's a whole other ball of wax when it's a girl you like, huh?
Yeah, who's the merry-andrew now?
You want to vex my sister!
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused...
No. Thank you.
When you asked me to dinner tonight
I was under the impression that...
- we were here to discuss...
- The merger.
Yes. Right. Yes.
And a possible promotion.
Yes.
Yes, that, too.
And, well, dinner is winding down and we haven't really discussed anything even remotely relevant to what I thought we came here to...
I don't believe I've ever seen you this flustered, Kate.
You haven't even kissed me yet.
Yeah.
Right. Well...
I like you, J.J., I do.
I like you quite a bit.
As a matter of fact...
I think you would agree that a working... a successful working relationship requires a great deal of...
- What exactly is our working relationship?
- Kate...
Hi, Kate!
Hi, Charlie.
Wha... what are you doing here?
- We just thought we'd come by to say hi.
- Kate?
- J.J., right?
- Right.
Might I have a word with you?
- Now?
- In private.
No! No.
Mr. Margarine.
Please... please join us.
And where did you say it is?
- In Sussex.
- Near Balmore.
- Yes.
- Built in the 18th century.
Early 18th century.
Early? Are you quite sure?
Yes.
He's got pictures, Leopold.
Perhaps you were swindled, because I can assure you as of the late 19th century there's nothing but farmland near Balmore.
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.
No, it is not possible...
Balmore is the only manor house in the county.
- I know because I grew up there.
- Leopold, it wasn't...
Leo, do you enjoy opera?
- I do. And do you?
- Oh, yes.
It keeps... keeps me alive.
Do you have a favorite?
Bohème. La Bohème.
- La Bohème?
- I've seen it 12 times.
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.
- You speak French?
- Fluently.
Que ton visage est doux entouré par la lumière de la lune.
What did he say?
"How sweet your face looks gently encircled by the soft moonlight."
Oh, I like that.
From the opening scene of Bohème.
A stunning duet.
- Andre sings it to Mimi.
- Andre...
I invited Kate to the Met next week.
She's never been.
Patrone is singing Andre, and she turned me down.
Can you explain that, Leopold?
Well...
Bohème is one of man's great achievements and should not be missed.
But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.
- How so?
- Should we get the check?
Well, some feel that to court a woman in one's employ is nothing more than a serpentine effort to transform a lady to a whore.
J.J.
This guy's charming, Kate.
The Duke of Margarine thinks me a serpent.
- No, he doesn't.
- No, not a serpent.
That's too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad who knows less French than I, if that's possible.
And by the way there's no Andre in
Bohème- it's Rudolfo.
And though it takes place in France it's rarely played in French, as it is written in Italian.
Good night.
Sorry.
Kate, might I have a word?
- Morning.
- Hi.
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- You want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.
I want to go to work and try and clean up this mess you made.
You sure you don't...
Kate...
Uh, Kate!
What?
I just thought maybe you'd want a... kiwi for... the subway.
That's a papaya, Charlie.
Oh? You're right. Okay.
But while using the product 80% found the product too soft to be... effective.
This, of course, presents a conundrum for us marketeers.
How do we maintain a soft feel on the exterior of a plastic wrap or pack while retaining the useful tensile strength in the sheets?
Now, I'm going to suggest to the Summer Soft people to scale back to a limited release of the product...
Dearest Katherine...
I behaved as an imbecile last night
animated in part by drink,
in part by your beauty
and in part by my own foolish pride.
And for that
I am profoundly sorry.
Please accept as a gesture of apology
a private dinner on the rooftop tonight at 8 o'clock.
Okay, where are we on Farmer's Bounty?
Kate?
Care to share with us?
Farmer's Bounty?
Where we are?
Where we are is good.
Um, as you know, we found our spokesperson.
The response room final showed a 96 in the top two boxes.
His key female descriptors... were "handsome", "romantic" with several write-ins of...
"What a hunk."
Great.
Would you hold this?
J.J.?
J.J., hi.
Um, listen, I just want to apologize again for what happened last night.
There was no need for things to get that way.
I appreciate that.
So... everything's okay?
Yes, Kate.
I didn't jump; I fell.
There's a difference- a subtle difference, but nonetheless a difference.
Why did you fall, then?
Because there was no elevator.
And you feel that was your fault?
You know what, I'm sorry.
I got to concede that you are a very busy man and I'm sure there are plenty of people clamoring for your particular brand of attention.
Unfortunately,
I am not one of them.
So if you don't mind, would you please unlock this door?
I'm concerned you might be a danger to yourself.
And in such cases...
- state law requires...
- Hello?
Will someone please open this...
Fuck...
Everything all right,
Dr. Geisler?
Yes, Gretchen.
Everything's fine.
So, Stuart, I'm going to prescribe something called Prolixin.
It's a mild antipsychotic.
Nothing too strong.
"I was wondering..."
"I was wondering if you would like to accompany me..."
"If you have a previous engagement,
I understand."
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.
Please don't be late.
I got to talk to you about this, okay?
'Cause there's some shit here that just cannot be said.
Did you assemble a bouquet for Patrice?
I'll just get one of these, but look, you just can't tell a woman she's...
- "gracefully serene."
- No, no, this one won't do.
Wha... Why?
What is wrong with this one?
The orange lily implies extreme hatred.
The begonia and lavender danger and suspicion, respectively.
Every flower has a meaning, Charles.
Might I suggest the amaryllis, which declares the recipient a most splendid beauty.
Or the cabbage rose.
Darci!
- What is this?
- It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.
You're going, right?
I haven't decided yet.
Oh, you haven't decided if you want to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke?
...Who thinks he's from 1876!
- No! And I would appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on, okay?
I don't know what this guy did to piss you off but that is the best apology letter in the history of mankind.
Just sign it, Kate.
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.
Kate McKay's office.
They hung up.
Hi. Is Patrice there?
Hey, Patrice?
- Hi. It's me, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.
I was just calling to find out if you got my flowers- your flowers.
I was calling to see if you got the flowers I sent you.
Yeah, I did.
And I was just wondering if you would like to go to a movie tonight and maybe afterwards perhaps accompany me to a dinner?
I mean, I...
I understand completely if you're otherwise engaged.
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...
Yeah?
I wanted to say that you've, uh... you've made an impression on me.
And-and it-it's not just the way you look-
I mean, which are great.
Your looks are, you know, top-top shelf.
But, uh...
I don't know, it's, um...
What?
You're graceful.
You know, the way you move and speak.
I mean, some people have a way with words and, you know, you... you do.
The bottom line is, I like you.
Patrice?
What about 7:00?
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.
See you then.
It worked! It worked cool!
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!
Over there! Charlie's going over there!
Oh, better go get ready.
Better go get changed.
Shouldn't change too much, though
'cause she likes me for who I am.
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I got a date.
I got to go. Bye.
Bye.
- Kate?
- Yeah?
Um, have a good time tonight.
Bye.
My God.
This is beautiful.
The very word for which
I was searching.
May I?
She was a real romantic, my mom.
When Prince Charles and Lady Di got married, she had a party.
She made crumpets and jam.
It was like a Super Bowl party, but for moms.
She cried for a week.
I don't know the story of Prince Charles and Lady Di.
Oh, you don't want to.
It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.
- Of what?
- That you can't live a fairy tale.
I'm not very good with men.
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.
Maybe. Or... maybe the whole love thing is just a grown-up version of Santa Claus just a myth we've been fed since childhood so we keep buying magazines and joining clubs and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs played over love montages all in this pathetic attempt to explain why our love Santa keeps getting caught in the chimney.
Otis always told me love is a leap.
Lamentably,
I was never inspired to jump.
By my 30th birthday,
I had, according to my uncle become a blemish on the family name.
So he brought me to this country with the proviso
I marry an American.
A girl with a good deal of, um...
Charm?
Money. Since my parents died our family fortune had become, shall we say, depleted.
I would be married now if I hadn't followed Stuart.
I was to announce a bride that night.
Who?
I don't know.
Someone.
One of them.
What are you doing?
I'm just cleaning up.
Would you do me the honor of a dance?
Please?
- I am not much of a dancer.
- You're doing famously, then.
Leopold, this was lovely.
But I don't know if I can leap even if I am inspired.
People might think
I'm brave, but I'm not.
The brave are simply those with the clearest vision of what is before them.
Glory and danger alike and notwithstanding, go out to meet it.
Hey.
Morning, Charles.
How was your evening with Patrice?
Good. Nice.
How was yours?
Good. Nice.
So, Leo, don't you think it's time you tell me who you are?
- What do you mean?
- I mean... it's a blast doing the duke thing with you 24/7 but...
I don't want to see Kate go through Stuart: The Sequel.
I know she seems pretty tough but she hasn't had it that easy.
She's always getting stuck with people who don't hold up their end.
Like me.
- I just don't...
- I understand, Charles.
- You do?
- Yes.
So...
Who are you?
I am the man who loves your sister.
Okay, pour the soap in.
Shut the lid.
Push the drawers in.
Close the door, and you push this button.
A word to the wise:
Don't press that till she wakes up.
So she sees you doing it.
How clever.
The proverbial tree in the woods.
If a man washes a dish and no one sees it...
Did it happen?
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.
Breakfast?
Nine-grain toast with strawberries and mascarpone, Madame.
It's apparently low... in polyunsaturates.
It's really good.
It's good.
What should we do today?
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
Thank you. No.
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.
They're so completely inappropriate for you.
Kate.
Kate, Kate, come.
Leopold? Leopold?
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It boggles the mind that it is still here.
This is my uncle's home. Well, was.
This is where I lived.
Good Lord.
A portrait of my parents... and me.
Leopold?
Look, I just don't think that we should just be barging around here like that.
Leopold?
My old quarters.
What are you doing?
The place where I put everything I most cared for.
Things I didn't want my uncle to touch.
My mother's ring.
Oh, it's beautiful.
You know,
I live on an island connected to everything by bridges and I never cross them.
I've lived here for ten years and I've... never been to the other side of anything.
You've never traveled?
No.
Do you...
What?
Do you miss where you're from?
In a way, I...
I miss...
I miss its rhythm.
It was slower?
Quite a bit slower.
- Like today?
- Yes.
Do you hear that, Leopold?
Do you hear that music?
Yes.
Have you ever seen the movie
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Uh, no.
"No."
Not yet.
You see that guy down there with the light on?
He listens to the soundtrack of Breakfast at Tiffany's every night until exactly midnight.
And then he turns his light off goes to sleep.
* My huckleberry friend *
* Moon River *
* And me. *
Oh, that means it's Sunday.
Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.
I want more of this.
More 1876.
But, Kate, you don't work on
Sundays. We can have more.
Well, I don't know,
'cause Sunday is the day before the day I work, so... it gets poisoned.
I see.
Besides, tomorrow is the day we shoot your commercial.
Kate.
Would you...?
Might you ever... consider...?
Hmm?
It's time for bed.
I'm so relaxed.
That's all right.
You're tucking me in.
Yes.
You're my Otis.
Yes, Your Grace.
Oh, wait.
Hey, hey, don't... don't go upstairs.
Stay.
I love you, Kate McKay.
Scone, Your Grace?
Ah, thank you, Millard.
And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?
But of course.
Ah!
Fresh creamery butter.
Is there anything more comforting?
I say there is and perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free
Farmer's Bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty you shall receive butter's luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline.
Farmer's Bounty.
Now, on this one take a bite and smile.
And... cut!
All right, check gate.
Good enough for me.
Can we get a Dedo up here and something...
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. Is this an actual sample of Farmer's Bounty?
Yeah. Why?
This tastes like saddle soap.
Well, it's not really your concern, now, is it?
Not my concern?
This product tastes like raw suet.
How is that not my concern?
Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!
- A Paycheck?
- Wait a minute...
This is an outrage!
Don't worry about the taste.
Come back. We need another shot.
Something that brings the light up on this...
Leopold.
Leopold!
Leopold, what's going on?
What are you doing?
They-they need you back in there.
Do they?
Yeah. They have to shoot the rest of the spot. They're not finished yet.
Well, I want no part of it.
Why?
Have you tasted it?
- Farmer's Bounty?
- Yes, Farmer's Bounty.
- Yeah, I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.
I know.
You know it's revolting yet you have no qualms enlisting me to endorse it?
It's diet; it's supposed to be awful.
I mean, what is the problem?
The problem is that for no reason beyond my affection for you
I find myself peddling pond scum to an unsuspecting public.
Hey, listen, you know the stakes are very high for me here.
- You can't just quit because...
- Yes, I can. And so can you.
When one finds oneself participating in an endeavor entirely without merit, one withdraws.
No. No. Because sometimes you have to do things that you don't like.
Sometimes you have to suck it up and finish what you started.
It's part of life.
You sound like my uncle.
Look, Leopold, Jansen Foods is a very important account for my company.
If you don't go back in there then I get into a lot of trouble.
Is this what you do at work, Kate?
Research methods to deceive people?
Refine lies until they resemble truth?
It's no wonder you dread your work week.
Oh! Man, I don't have time for this.
What has happened to the world?
You have every convenience, every comfort
- yet no time for integrity.
- No.
What I don't have time for are pious speeches by 200-year-old men who've never had to work a day in their life.
You have no idea what I've done with my life.
And you-you have no idea what I've done with mine!
I haven't had all that many comforts and conveniences, Leopold, because I've been paying dues all of my life and I'm tired, and I need a rest and if I have to peddle a little pond scum to get one then so be it.
Very well.
We're kidding ourselves,
Leopold.
In point of fact I don't even really know who you are.
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?
We had a great weekend; that's that.
Now it's Sunday.
It's over.
* There's such a lot of world to see. *
I know.
I know, I know, it sounds crazy- talking about... finding a crack in time under the East River.
But in, in point, in point fact, Gretchen you know... it is no more crazy than, uh, a dog finding a rainbow.
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.
They don't see color.
- Really?
- Just like we can't see time.
We can feel it.
Oh... we can feel it passing but, we can't see it; it's just a blur.
It's like, uh... it's like we're riding in a, in a supersonic train and the world is just blowing by.
But imagine if we could stop that train, Gretchen. Hmm?
Imagine if we could stop that train get out, look around and see time for what it really is.
A universe, a world, a thing as unimaginable as color to a dog.
And as real and tangible as that chair you're sitting in.
Now, if we could see it like that
I mean, really look at it then... maybe we could see the flaws as well as the form.
And that's it.
It's that simple.
That's all I discovered.
I'm just a... just a guy who saw a crack in a chair that no one else could see.
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.
Only, uh... none of the other dogs believe me.
I believe you.
I can see that some things have... happened since I went away.
But... you have to go back.
You understand you'll be going back to the same day you left,
- April 28th.
- Yes.
So you understand you might be repeating a few things.
You might even see me.
Just don't follow me this time.
Can I go in?
J.J., you asked to see me?
Come on in.
I understand you, uh, put out a fire at the shoot yesterday.
Guess Mr. Duke's got a bit of an ego on him, huh?
Yeah.
I'm going to England this week and I made a decision.
You're going to be the top New York honcho.
So, this is going to be your office.
I'll be making it official tonight.
Thank you, J.J. Thank you.
You've earned it.
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign the buy-out papers,
FTC stuff. So I'll... see you later at the thing.
- What did he say?
- I got it.
Oh, my God.
It's wonderful!
Just give me one second.
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.
Hi. You've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.
Hello?
Leopold, I-I don't know where you are but if you're there, please pick up.
I got it.
I got the job.
I'm the new senior vice president at CRG.
Uh, please call me. I...
I'm sorry about the way things came down yesterday.
I apologize. I...
I just really need to see you.
I'd love to see you tonight but I have this thing at Farmer's Bounty.
But I'd love to see you later.
I miss you..
I miss you.
Hey, Stuart.
How're you feeling?
Where's Leo?
He went home.
He was for real..
He was for real!
Holy shit!
Look at this!
Oh, my God.
Chilled, do you understand? Chilled.
And be sure to leave another case of the Chateau Laffite.
Yes, sir.
Leopold! Where have you been?!
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past five.
He's not even dressed!
He'll be ready, my lord,
I assure you.
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!
This is the invitation. You've got... your table number, your car number and I've got Morty down there- the guy you like. He's on the Madison side.
Also, your phone sheet is in here.
And Stuart called you a couple times. So...
Have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.
That's where we are,
Miss McKay.
Have a nice evening.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Invitation, please.
No, no.
Look, they're still plugged.
But they're just randomly seeded with Minoxidil.
- No cornrows.
- Excuse me.
Hey, Kate.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
To hell with the facelifts.
I'm into mini-lifts now.
Just a tiny little bit each year.
I hear they'll bring them back to 840 next year.
So I'm just running out my lease.
- Kate, congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.
Hey, Kate.
J.J. Hi, Barry.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Anyway, I'm just glad they've got them fixed.
I was going to move my office down to the lobby.
Excuse me.
Kate, don't powder your nose for too long.
I'm going to give this speech in a couple of minutes.
Okay.
All this time I thought that I had pretezled fate and it had to be untwisted.
But what I never considered is that the whole thing is a pretzel.
A beautiful 4D pretzel of kismetic inevitability.
Okay, you know what, get off Park as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.
I was supposed to go back.
He was supposed to come forward then he was supposed to go back again and... so was she.
Now it is my pleasure and honor... to turn this over to my friend,
J.J. Camden...
...to take priests to the bell tower.
You speak of progress and invention.
But what I offer you downstairs is reality.
Take a wife. Marry.
Let us not bother with this banter, Uncle.
Tell me whom you want me to marry.
Well, who has the most money?
Well... that would be Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady.
Good. Consider it done.
Otis, fetch the ring.
I will announce at midnight.
Invitation, please.
Uh, hello.
My name is Stuart Besser.
I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list
- but his sister is Kate McKay...
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.
...and I learned that there was one thing that I could do and it didn't require money and it didn't require a fancy school.
I learned that I could please people.
And there is nothing wrong with that!
I am a people pleaser, people!
Thank you so much. I am so...
Kate!
Stuart!
Charlie! What are you doing?
- You should look at these pictures, Kate.
- No! No-no-no-no!
Now it's time to introduce the woman who's going to be holding down the fort in our New York offices our own little rising star,
Miss Kate McKay!
- Just listen to me for a second, please?
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I know all you wanted was someone you could trust...
Oh, Stuart, really
I can't talk about...
No, Kate, just listen to me, okay? Please.
Maybe we weren't such a waste of time after all.
- I mean, maybe there's a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?
Maybe I was supposed to help you find your guy... Leopold.
You got to go back, Kate.
You got to go back there.
Go back?
How?
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes.
Kate? Katie?
Kate, just look at the pictures, okay?
Is there a... a Kate McKay in the house?
- Yeah. Here I am!
- Kate?
Here she is. Here she is.
Well, without further ado the new senior vice president of our New York offices.
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen- Kate McKay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Quite an entrance, huh?
Thank you, J.J.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Wow.
Well...
This is a great night.
We here at...
CRG have always considered ourselves to be in the "Find what people want" business and at Jansen, you guys are in the
"Make what people want" business.
So, imagine what we can do together.
We'll be able to find out exactly what people want and make it... for them.
So... yeah, so our customers... will be able to get exactly...
...what they...
...they want.
And...
...it's a great thing to... to get what you want.
Uh, it's a really good thing.
Unless what you thought you wanted wasn't really what you wanted because what you really...
...wanted you couldn't imagine, or you didn't think it was possible.
But... but what if someone came along who knew exactly what you wanted without asking?
They just knew. Like they could... hear your heart beating or listen to your thoughts.
And what if they were sure of themselves and they didn't have to take a poll and they loved you... and you hesitated?
And...
I have to go.
I...
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Kate?
Stuart, can you tell me in short, complete sentences featuring no words over two syllables why exactly
I am in these pictures?
- Probably not.
- Try.
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't.
I would remember. Believe me,
I would remember if I was there.
Because you're going to be there.
If we get there in time.
These are pictures of the past, not the future.
Not exactly.
Theoretically speaking if you go to the past in the future then your future lies in the past.
And that is a picture of you in the future, in the past.
We'll have to make a run for it. Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on!
Whoa, where the hell do you think you're going?
$6.80 on the meter, pal.
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
The Duke of Albany will be making a very important announcement in 20 minutes from this very stage.
And I believe it shall be an announcement that will justify the playing of a bridal waltz.
Okay... this is the hard part.
- What?
- The girder.
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder, Kate.
That girder?
Stuart, I can't cross that girder.
- You love him, right?
- What?
Leopold.
You love him, right?
Yeah.
That's all you need to know.
Now go.
- You'll be fine.
- Katie...
Charlie... Charlie, what am I...
How are you gonna...
No, go! Don't worry about me.
- Now, Kate, now.
- Now?
- The portal's going to close.
- All right.
Go.
-Oh!
- Jesus.
Oh, God.
You can do it.
Don't look down.
Charlie...
I'll love you forever.
Love you.
It's okay.
Lady... lady, what are you doing?
Step back, lady.
- It's okay.
- Step back from there, lady.
Come back, lady.
Central, be advised, this is Bridge Post Four.
I've got a jumper on the southwest location of the bridge.
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor respond to this location forthwith.
Ladies and gentlemen it is with a glad heart and a bright eye that I proudly introduce my beloved nephew
Leopold, Duke of Albany.
Thank you, Uncle Millard.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, madam, but this is a private affair.
No, you don't seem to understand.
I need to get inside.
- I need to get inside right now and...
- What seems to be the problem?
Are you Otis?
Well, let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses... so we may toast to my bride-to-be the woman whose welfare and happiness shall be my solemn duty to maintain.
The future Duchess of Albany...
Kate McKay.
Of the McKays of...?
Massapequa..
Massapequa.
- I love you.
- I love you.
* If I caught the world in a bottle *
* And everything was still beneath the moon *
* Without your love would it shine for me? *
* If I was smart as Aristotle *
* And understood the rings around the moon *
* What would it all matter if you love me? *
* Here in your arms, *
* Where the world is impossibly still *
* With a million dreams to fulfill *
* And a matter of moments *
* Until the dancing ends. *
* Here in your arms, *
* When everything seems to be clear *
* Not a solitary thing would I fear *
* Except when this moment comes *
* near the dancing's end. *
* If I caught the world in an hourglass, *
* Saddled up the moon so we could ride *
* Until the stars grew dim *
* Until... *
* One day you'll meet a stranger *
* And all the noise is silenced in the room *
* You'll feel that you're close to some mystery *
* In the moonlight when everything shatters, *
* You'll feel as if you've known her all your life *
* The world's oldest lesson in history *
* Here in your arms, *
* where the world is impossibly still *
* With a million dreams to fulfill *

* Here in your arms, *

{447}{549}{Y:i}As far back as I can remember,|it has been raining.
{604}{750}{Y:i}Legends tell of vast continents and|great cities before the catastrophe.
{786}{845}{Y:i}But it's all just faded glory of the past.
{916}{1017}{Y:i}Our ancestors foresaw the catastrophe,|escaped to Sisil Island in the Pacific...
{1041}{1141}{Y:i}...and built another Noah's Arc,|a self-growing city...
{1194}{1295}{Y:i}...that feeds of pollution, called ECOBAN.
{1367}{1452}{Y:i}Refugee ships flooded in by the thousands.
{1480}{1547}{Y:i}But ECOBAN didn't allow...
{1577}{1691}{Y:i}...the contaminated refugees into the city.
{3295}{3341}The workers' safety is at risk down there.
{3343}{3382}I request you stop work at once.
{3383}{3468}Who cares? They're just animals|to be worked, not coddled!
{4087}{4115}God damn it.
{4118}{4168}They're not even worth the food they eat!
{4679}{4719}This is a waste of time.
{4720}{4772}We should burn it all to hell!
{4792}{4864}Sir! Please, help us, quick!
{4866}{4914}They're all going to be killed!
{4916}{4987}You're ruining the equipment!
{4989}{5021}Disconnect the deck!
{5023}{5083}What? No!
{5088}{5145}People are still down there!
{5283}{5334}Don't remember asking for your opinion.
{5337}{5379}Flip the switch!
{5380}{5417}Over my dead body!
{5422}{5465}Your dead body, eh?
{5469}{5539}Jay, give him what he wants.
{5565}{5620}- That's not my job, sir.|- What?
{5860}{5905}Disconnect, hurry!
{6509}{6607}Your first duty is to obey my orders!
{6619}{6664}Return to ECOBAN immediately!
{11450}{11603}Director: Kim, Moon-syang.
{11757}{11803}What is the Adjutant thinking?
{11855}{11918}Is he trying to provoke riots?
{11923}{12041}Or is he really trying to slaughter the Marrians?
{12067}{12131}He's just doing what he can to increase...
{12140}{12195}...pollution for our DELOS system.
{12227}{12303}But, it is true his methods are dangerous.
{12320}{12388}I'll ask the Governor to intercede.
{12394}{12428}It won't do any good.
{12430}{12538}To them, Marrians are little more then insects.
{12559}{12618}You've gone so soft, Jay!
{12638}{12694}ECOBAN is in a crisis situation.
{12719}{12814}You know that mercy is forbidden...
{12837}{12887}...so as to preserve our pure ECOBAN.
{12915}{13003}Just relax! Let's go down and|enjoy the centennial celebration.
{13792}{13837}Still brooding over that?
{13862}{13910}I'm just tired.
{13962}{14032}Then I'll transfer you to domestic patrol.
{14041}{14109}Nothing is hard here on the inside.
{15831}{15863}What is it?
{15865}{15907}Intruder alert in the Control Center!
{15909}{15957}- What?|- The security sensor was triggered.
{15971}{16027}Send a patrol to the Center.
{16029}{16071}I'm on my way.
{16219}{16277}Patrol 1 to the DELOS Center!
{17112}{17143}There you are!
{17145}{17191}The plate has been hacked, sir.
{17192}{17249}- No other plate?|- No, sir.
{17262}{17305}He'll run for the side.
{17310}{17361}Turn the fans on in Area 3!
{17412}{17463}Yes, that's right.
{17500}{17562}Alpha to 330, Bravo to 348!
{17565}{17607}Charlie to 353!
{18173}{18203}There!
{18338}{18431}Target sighted in Zone 3. Alpha, move to 33!
{20295}{20360}We lost his trail, sir.
{20364}{20413}Nothing here either, sir.
{20760}{20828}Control room, stop fan 31!
{20881}{20942}Dr. Noah's work!
{21040}{21114}Control, it's Jay.|Show me the Time-Capsule Room.
{22273}{22363}What, now this rat's got wings?
{23528}{23569}Jay, report your position.
{23571}{23643}I'm in the Time-Capsule Room.|I think he's here.
{24827}{24874}Jay, acknowledge!
{26027}{26066}Jay, are you okay?
{26069}{26099}Yes.
{26106}{26144}What happened?
{26151}{26217}Sorry, I almost got him.
{26225}{26274}How could he have got this far?
{26331}{26409}We assumed our security impenetrable.
{26432}{26476}But today the DELOS Center,|of all places, was infiltrated...
{26479}{26571}...and the man responsible escaped unscathed.
{26595}{26676}He knew the DELOS system|like the back of his hand.
{26691}{26788}A few more minutes, and he'd|have connected to the mainframe,...
{26801}{26862}...allowing him to cause|a DELOS energy release.
{26887}{26935}A DELOS energy release?
{26937}{26973}That's correct.
{26977}{27049}Like the breach 10 years ago.
{27062}{27189}You mean he's alive? Dr. Noah?
{27197}{27249}There's no reason to doubt otherwise.
{27262}{27358}The Marrian idiots could|never puzzle out the system,...
{27363}{27413}...even if we gave them the blueprints.
{27434}{27502}Dr. Noah knows of our situation.
{27511}{27585}DELOS energy levels are running so low...
{27598}{27691}...that ECOBAN has stopped its growth.
{27727}{27801}If we leave him alive,...
{27805}{27851}...he'll just keep destroying our system.
{27874}{27941}We can no longer afford to|postpone on a decision.
{27970}{28073}We must torch the oil fields...
{28080}{28137}...and enlarge the polluted area.
{28163}{28270}That alone would give us enough|energy for another 50 years.
{28299}{28379}We decided on this matter 10 years ago.
{28388}{28480}There is no reason to hold back our|plans for Operation Marr any longer.
{28512}{28619}Torch the whole field to catch a few rats?
{28635}{28694}One rat made it in, but he failed.
{28695}{28746}Our security is reliable.
{28765}{28815}They may be no more than animals,...
{28819}{28875}...but animals we need for work.
{28883}{28945}Too much oppression will prompt a revolt.
{28967}{29015}More pollution for energy!
{29017}{29083}That is our ultimate priority.
{29097}{29155}Yes, to get more energy,...
{29161}{29246}...we must expand the polluted area...
{29264}{29321}...but if we kill the Marrians|then who'll do the work?
{29334}{29380}And though it's unlikely,...
{29383}{29434}...what if they were to revolt?
{29453}{29546}The Marrians outnumber ECOBAN 10 to 1.
{29559}{29659}You're as weak and|undependable as your security.
{29663}{29730}With the pollution increased,...
{29731}{29782}...we won't need oil fields or workers...
{29824}{29931}First, reinforce security|in Marr and ECOBAN.
{29938}{29999}Then search for the intruder|and find out his background.
{30003}{30075}The matter is important to us.
{30313}{30343}Adjutant.
{30362}{30427}Prepare for the operation. Just in case.
{30721}{30815}You can't do a simple thing|without stirring up trouble?
{30818}{30906}Then go do it yourself, old man.
{30915}{30981}By setting off the alarm today,...
{30983}{31027}...you doubled the security by now!
{31037}{31094}Now it's impossible to get in...
{31097}{31139}...and stop the DELOS system.
{31155}{31192}Just hand me the data!
{31240}{31306}So, let's see...
{31318}{31397}...what's new in that ol' mountain of a city?
{31589}{31662}The DELOS systems running low on fuel, I see.
{31667}{31726}The pollution is disappearing.
{31738}{31813}The system's on the verge of dying.
{31859}{31938}If DELOS system stops,|what happens to ECOBAN?
{31955}{32000}We'll see a blue sky.
{32002}{32091}Not the sky, I mean ECOBAN.
{32127}{32190}Well, they won't like it,...
{32192}{32271}...but they'll have to use solar|energy like in the 21 century.
{32279}{32338}ECOBAN will be a huge crap.
{32341}{32411}Then they'll have to work out in the sun,...
{32414}{32464}...shoulder to shoulder with the Marrians.
{32467}{32503}Shoulder to shoulder?
{32548}{32627}They'd kill us first.
{32630}{32670}Where the hell's Woody?
{32691}{32776}Oh yeah, I met her there.
{32784}{32820}Who?
{32835}{32874}An old friend.
{32883}{32976}Old friends are for living people.
{32982}{33027}You're a dead man! Forget about it!
{33037}{33110}Just think on how to get in again...
{33112}{33186}...to shut down the DELOS system.
{33197}{33254}And forget about your glider...
{33259}{33311}...way too dangerous.
{33416}{33466}Let him pass.
{33674}{33724}Pass it along!
{33780}{33855}Cut the funeral music!
{33857}{33895}How 'bout some party tunes!
{34121}{34176}Woody, wanna drag?
{34180}{34224}It's precious.
{34389}{34421}Too hot!
{34973}{35018}Shua!
{35046}{35103}What's the occasion?
{35182}{35226}Woody, let's go.
{35264}{35311}Shua!
{35496}{35558}I don't like him, that ECOBAN outcast!
{35560}{35644}If not for Woody, I'd smash his head in.
{35714}{35788}Moe, you seen my propeller?
{35811}{35843}This?
{35845}{35927}Are you kidding? Nah, the small one.
{35951}{36011}You said you needed this?
{36075}{36170}First you hang around with them|and now you steal things?
{36175}{36274}I didn't steal it. I found it.
{36276}{36349}You said you needed it for the glider.
{36399}{36450}Don't hang around with them.
{36453}{36513}It's too dangerous, got it?
{36642}{36685}Give me the harmonica.
{36780}{36815}Shua!
{36835}{36888}That's cool. What is it?
{36889}{36933}A bracelet.
{36935}{36981}Where did you get it?
{36984}{37027}None of your business, boy.
{37030}{37079}Who is it?
{37567}{37652}Dr. Noah says the sky is blue.
{37655}{37723}That people used to say "sky blue".
{37739}{37831}And in Gibraltar, the sky and...
{37832}{37906}...ocean are blue. Imagine!
{38206}{38251}Come with me.
{38252}{38286}Where?
{38645}{38694}It's off limits here.
{38697}{38748}Let's go back.
{38750}{38784}I'm scared.
{38787}{38854}Don't worry!
{38855}{38926}Just close your eyes and hold my hand.
{38931}{38989}I'll show you something wonderful.
{39313}{39363}Go ahead, open your eyes.
{39471}{39550}This is wonderful!
{39589}{39651}But how'd you know about this?
{39655}{39706}Dr. Noah told me!
{39709}{39802}He said in Gibraltar,|you can see this every day.
{39826}{39896}Jay, promise we'll go there together.
{40290}{40344}{Y:i}It was so beautiful it blinded your eyes.
{40355}{40424}{Y:i}We called it our Wonderful Day.
{40441}{40511}{Y:i}But it didn't last long.
{40529}{40583}{Y:i}That night it disappeared behind the clouds.
{40591}{40647}{Y:i}And I never saw him after that day.
{40732}{40820}Who's land is this?
{40821}{40947}Who cultivated the land and built the town?
{40950}{41079}Whose blood and sweat made our Marr?
{41081}{41152}Was it Ecoban's? No!
{41154}{41187}It was ours!
{41189}{41236}Hey, it's getting rough!
{41239}{41283}There's going to be riot.
{41287}{41373}Nuh-uh. Shua would have known,...
{41375}{41430}...but my brother didn't say anything.
{41432}{41495}He's from ECOBAN,...
{41499}{41582}...he can't be your brother?
{41585}{41641}He's just some crazy mofo!
{41643}{41687}He is too my brother! Wh-why's he crazy?
{41690}{41766}Always rambling on about Gibraltar.
{41767}{41803}No such thing in the world.
{41807}{41878}You have to live here.
{41881}{41939}And I'll teach you to be a fighter.
{41988}{42031}Woody! Where you...?
{42144}{42200}- Woody!|- Hurry up!
{42377}{42440}Now they're rioting in the morning.
{42444}{42506}Guess that means no business today.
{42510}{42559}Did you see Woody by any chance?
{42563}{42666}Woody? Yeah, I thought|I saw him with that dwarf.
{42667}{42724}What is his name?
{42735}{42799}Bring me that will you?
{42877}{42942}One's coming! Get it at the crossroad!
{43844}{43923}Woody, you crazy?
{43926}{43972}What the hell are you doing?
{43974}{44024}- Are you crazy?|- W-Wait a sec.
{44037}{44079}What in the world...
{44115}{44149}Hey! Hey!
{44663}{44763}If you see Woody, tell him to go home.
{44939}{45050}Jay, there're riots in the plaza.|Let's turn back.
{45079}{45123}Fuck you!
{45572}{45622}Jay! Are you okay?
{45624}{45672}Answer me!
{49780}{49821}Shua?
{49839}{49875}You're Shua, aren't you?
{49951}{50018}Listen. Outside ECOBAN is dangerous!
{50065}{50122}I thought you were dead.
{50189}{50267}The Shua you know is dead.
{50305}{50373}You and I are enemies.
{50392}{50482}I don't think Marrians are my enemy.
{50484}{50554}Too bad the Marrians don't see it that way.
{50610}{50664}Damn it!
{50720}{50766}Those pains in the ass!
{50776}{50815}Hide in there.
{50867}{50960}Stairs should be wide and convenient!
{50961}{51025}This is slope climbing!
{51027}{51106}Oh hey, Shua! There you are.
{51167}{51207}The boss wants you.
{51211}{51320}Let's plan out our strategy|for the big mission tomorrow.
{51390}{51469}This job's hot!|We're gonna hit ECOBAN's post.
{51645}{51764}I'm so glad you're alive, Shua!
{51811}{51855}You don't know...
{51876}{51950}...but I've missed you as much as you miss...
{51971}{52018}...that blue sky of yours.
{52439}{52533}Go back, Jay. Don't come back.
{53403}{53458}Kill me now, Helen.
{53473}{53538}I'm about to explode.
{53541}{53582}Get real!
{53584}{53627}She's twice your size!
{53631}{53684}- Don't make me kick your ass!|- What the...?
{53706}{53766}Shut the hell up and listen!
{53768}{53882}The ECOBANs are bringing in|shipments by trucks every day.
{53894}{53949}They're some presents|meant for us, I'm sure.
{53951}{54013}I just want Helen, that's all.
{54037}{54115}We should accept these gifts.
{54124}{54185}And show them our gratitude.
{54188}{54226}What're you talking about?
{54227}{54307}Tomorrow, we'll hit the Ecoban post,...
{54319}{54379}...take our presents...
{54383}{54441}...and give them our thanks.
{54443}{54476}So?
{54503}{54579}What kind of friends would we be not...
{54582}{54634}...to invite you along|for something as big as this?
{54645}{54697}Friends?
{54706}{54786}Friends of resistance!
{54800}{54882}You're using resistance to justify...
{54886}{54936}...what's little more then theft?
{54943}{55031}Keep low if you know what's good for you.
{55057}{55111}Son of a--!
{55183}{55248}If you could stop thinking|with your muscles...
{55250}{55302}...you'd know what really needs doing.
{55316}{55377}Acting stupid and getting yourself|killed is your business.
{55387}{55437}But don't drag Woody into it!
{55439}{55522}If anything happens to him,|I'll be sending you home in pieces!
{55637}{55707}Hey! Who saved Woody today?
{55711}{55757}You ungrateful little twat!
{55759}{55815}I'm telling you, he's an ECOBAN at heart!
{55818}{55860}Self-righteous prick!
{55863}{55914}C'mon, hit the music!
{56090}{56165}You want to live with them?
{56183}{56263}Why? Are you m-mad at me?
{56283}{56337}Yes. You ignored my warnings.
{56366}{56423}So you're leaving me behind?
{56447}{56488}I'll follow you.
{56491}{56535}Who's going where?
{56539}{56638}I know you'll fix the glider and...
{56668}{56739}...leave me behind. Then I'll kill myself!
{56806}{56839}Stop it!
{56879}{56930}What kind of shit are they|cramming into that head of yours.
{56935}{56991}And don't joke about dying.
{57000}{57031}Here.
{57060}{57098}Take it.
{57107}{57151}I don't need it.
{57155}{57226}But, it's from your girlfriend.
{57235}{57274}She's not.
{57277}{57363}And I'm not going anywhere.
{57366}{57435}Really? You're staying with me?
{57444}{57511}Shua, don't leave me behind no matter what.
{57515}{57553}I'll think about it.
{57676}{57734}You're sure Jay did that?
{57739}{57812}Yes, sir. Positive.
{57815}{57866}All right, that's be all.
{57940}{58036}Etha, let's keep this between us for now.
{58053}{58087}Yes, sir.
{59643}{59732}Our target is the suspect|who infiltrated the DELOS system.
{59734}{59815}He's hiding in a wrecked tanker|in Bay area no. 5.
{59845}{59918}If he resists... then shoot to kill.
{61485}{61538}Alpha 1, no one here!
{61546}{61598}Alpha 2, not a thing!
{62478}{62524}Why didn't you tell me?
{62801}{62871}He committed murder and ran from ECOBAN!
{62873}{62953}Don't let memories weaken|you into sympathy!
{63436}{63491}There! That's it.
{63515}{63554}Where?
{63614}{63674}Ah, I see it!
{63951}{64026}Afternoon, officer. Sorry I'm late.
{64029}{64079}Who the hell are you?
{64082}{64128}Show me your pass.
{64137}{64226}Oh, the pass? I must've dropped it.
{64234}{64316}No pass?
{64319}{64360}Out of the truck.
{64400}{64466}Oh, yes, that is... Where'd I put it?
{64469}{64531}What are you doing? Get out!
{64534}{64581}Right! The pass.
{64687}{64746}I'm out! Whatcha gonna do about it?
{65059}{65097}Son of a bitch!
{65196}{65239}Get on!
{65760}{65801}Hurry!
{65908}{65965}Wait! Stop your pursuit!
{66063}{66128}Let's party!
{66451}{66504}I'm told there was a robbery.
{66527}{66572}And what were you doing?
{66575}{66657}While these vermin broke in and stole things?
{66680}{66770}How could I protect something that...
{66771}{66814}...I had no knowledge even existed?
{66815}{66877}You are full of excuses and no results.
{66882}{66952}If I trusted you, I wouldn't be here.
{66959}{67029}The target changed course towards Bay Area 2.
{67033}{67073}As soon as the destination is confirmed,...
{67075}{67155}...I want you to clean out the whole place.
{67295}{67359}What's with the ruckus?
{67361}{67401}I thought I told those Hot Dogs to keep quiet.
{67403}{67462}Perhaps they scored big today.
{67488}{67559}You're not thinking about the glider, are you?
{67571}{67630}I'm just fixing it, that's all.
{67642}{67748}Flying that into ECOBAN|is asking to get killed.
{67750}{67817}Don't worry. I like living.
{67831}{67923}ECOBAN is up to something.
{67927}{67957}They keep trucking something into Marr.
{67959}{68015}They're probably trying to torch all of Marr.
{68017}{68065}The DELOS system needs resources,...
{68070}{68157}...so they'll burn and pollute the whole area.
{68175}{68251}You're sure you're not|planning anything stupid?
{68263}{68335}Are you saying there's another way?
{68337}{68389}We need someone who can get to...
{68391}{68443}...the DELOS center without raising suspicion.
{68447}{68495}You want to use Jay?
{68499}{68603}Might as well wait until they|torch Marr to the ground.
{68607}{68657}Then forget about it!
{69557}{69618}There're more where it came from.
{69620}{69699}So you got something this time.
{69701}{69748}Wow, what is it?
{69928}{69972}What the hell is it?
{70043}{70090}What's this blinking?
{70092}{70138}You idiots!
{70332}{70387}- Freeze!|- Throw down your weapons!
{70391}{70450}- On the floor!|- Hands on the back!
{71380}{71415}Move.
{71546}{71589}Get away!
{71699}{71750}Don't make a sound!
{71751}{71826}No matter what, don't come out!
{72527}{72602}Perfect time to run out of ammo!
{72606}{72661}I'll cross first.
{72663}{72702}Watch and learn!
{72704}{72755}Check this out!
{72865}{72894}Moe!
{72896}{72951}Easier said than done!
{72955}{73022}Sons of bitches! Moe, I'm coming!
{73444}{73491}Zed!
{73495}{73570}Zed!
{73764}{73828}W-Woody, it's freezing.
{73921}{73968}I'll go and get Shua.
{73970}{74050}Don't leave me. I'm scared.
{74054}{74094}Don't be scared.
{74099}{74199}- I'm cold.|- I'll be back soon.
{74231}{74274}Don't leave me.
{74275}{74335}Don't worry. I'll come back.
{74342}{74388}And don't sing, okay?
{74889}{74942}Hush!
{74973}{75024}Hands on the wall!
{75025}{75064}One step back!
{75067}{75138}Take them out, and comb the building!
{75139}{75178}Yes, sir.
{76241}{76299}Where's Karen?
{76784}{76820}Woody?
{76823}{76856}Oh my...
{76869}{76916}Let's go out.
{76963}{77028}I can't.
{77075}{77131}Woody told me to wait.
{79403}{79451}Why won't you die...
{79481}{79542}...you little cockroach!
{79550}{79607}Get up! I'll finish you off this time!
{79610}{79702}You should be thanking me|for taking the fall for you.
{79706}{79766}You should have died then...
{79778}{79828}...for the sake of ECOBAN!
{79831}{79921}You mean, so Jay won't know the truth.
{79924}{79986}That's right! Good for you.
{79989}{80075}Now you'll have to die again|for Jay's sake, and mine!
{80364}{80413}Shua...
{80623}{80675}Woody!
{80721}{80775}Woody!
{80951}{81030}Move! Get out of the way!
{82826}{82951}I thought it was me looking after him,...
{82983}{83100}...but it was the other way around.
{83211}{83278}I wanted to show him the blue sky.
{83483}{83541}I'm Sorry, Zed.
{83635}{83699}I'm going to ECOBAN.
{83707}{83758}You don't have to come if you don't want to.
{83880}{83950}Thank you everyone.
{83977}{84052}First, we need Noah's help.
{84107}{84186}The Hot Dogs are now crushed,...
{84195}{84291}...but, Dr. Noah and his agent remain at large.
{84307}{84423}They're conspiring to bring|about ECOBAN's downfall.
{84439}{84488}Let's not blame security...
{84490}{84550}...and waste any more time.
{84583}{84652}Operation Marr is ready.
{84661}{84757}With your approval, it can proceed immediately.
{84780}{84839}Expediency would be prudent.
{84847}{84906}We can no longer coexist with the Marrians.
{84935}{84986}And if energy levels fall any further,...
{84987}{85047}...many ECOBAN systems will malfunction.
{85051}{85140}Making it much harder to|suppress the Marrian riots.
{85150}{85255}Moreover, Dr. Noah and his agent are|probably already preparing something.
{85262}{85338}We must eliminate the root of the problem.
{85733}{85806}It's our duty to protect ECOBAN.
{85818}{85902}The only thing endangering|ECOBAN is ECOBAN itself.
{85936}{86015}I don't care anymore.
{86031}{86093}By tomorrow all of Marr will be gone,...
{86099}{86164}...including Shua.
{86233}{86309}Even they have a right to protect themselves.
{86353}{86400}Where are you going?
{86407}{86445}Jay!
{86453}{86492}Jay!
{86507}{86561}As long as we don't give up,...
{86572}{86625}...he won't give up either.
{91211}{91291}{Y:i}I'm sick of this bleak desolate future.
{91304}{91382}{Y:i}I just want a sky filled with light.
{91402}{91490}{Y:i}Like that day so long ago.
{91517}{91566}{Y:i}Which is why I have to go.
{91576}{91656}{Y:i}I don't know where I'll be.
{91677}{91750}{Y:i}But know you're with me in my heart.
{91780}{91847}{Y:i}Take care of Woody.
{93059}{93128}All troops are assembled!
{93138}{93197}All troops are to enforce internal security.
{93202}{93259}Man your posts, stay alert, and report...
{93261}{93290}...any suspicious activity immediately!
{93293}{93374}Who diverted the troops from Operation Marr?
{93402}{93447}Commander Cade, sir.
{93450}{93507}I was ordered to reinforce security.
{93509}{93552}Where is he?
{93554}{93613}He went to the DELOS Tower, sir.
{93623}{93655}What?
{93657}{93740}Send the troops to Marr. That's an order!
{93743}{93780}Yes, sir.
{93783}{93828}Battalion, on the truck!
{94227}{94332}This war won't end until|we shut down the DELOS system.
{94350}{94422}You must disconnect the power supply...
{94432}{94510}...before Shua puts the spics in the system.
{94515}{94565}That's your job.
{95156}{95213}There! See it?
{95263}{95297}Ready!
{95303}{95344}Fire!
{95881}{95941}Governor, Operation Marr is now underway.
{95943}{95990}I wish you luck.
{95992}{96048}I'll do my best, sir.
{99143}{99187}That way!
{99252}{99305}Hey, hey, aren't we going too fast?
{99307}{99366}All the sooner that we get to pay them back!
{99827}{99894}What's the? What happened?
{99896}{99949}There's a gap! Shit!
{99959}{100007}That old man...
{100010}{100061}Hey! Stop!
{100063}{100118}He said go full speed!
{101342}{101439}Damn! I must be invincible|to have survived that!
{101455}{101542}I must have a guardian angel|and the devil's own luck!
{101567}{101618}Shua! Want a lift?
{102507}{102546}Hurry!
{105276}{105372}You guys are screwed once I cut the power!
{107777}{107872}So you finally made it.
{108042}{108101}You deserve what you'll get.
{108117}{108222}This is for the good of both Marr and ECOBAN.
{108223}{108259}ECOBAN?
{108261}{108334}You're ruining everyone's future!
{108337}{108403}You're ruining my future with Jay!
{108427}{108512}Why you? Why should only you have her?
{108898}{108928}No!
{109010}{109046}Jay, no!
{109127}{109206}Don't make me do this to you.
{109310}{109353}Jay!
{118246}{118329}Grandpa, I see something bright!
{118347}{118434}That's right. That's right.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
First off, I'd like to thank this board for taking the time to hear my proposal.
Now, we've all heard of the legend of Atlantis, a continent somewhere in the mid-Atlantic that was home to an advanced civilization, possessing technology far beyond our own, that, according to our friend Plato here, was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event that sank it beneath the sea.
Now, some of you may ask, why Atlantis?
It's just a myth, isn't it?
Pure fantasy.
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.
10,000 years before the Egyptians built the pyramids,
Atlantis had electricity, advanced medicine, even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?
Well, no. No, not for them.
Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind more powerful than steam, than coal.
More powerful than our modern internal combustion engines.
Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis, find that power source, and bring it back to the surface.
Now, this is a page from an illuminated text that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal, said to have been a firsthand account of Atlantis and its exact whereabouts.
Now, based on a centuries-old translation of a Norse text, historians have believed the Journal resides in Ireland.
But after comparing the text to the runes on this Viking shield,
I found that one of the letters had been mistranslated.
So, by changing this letter and inserting the correct one, we find that The Shepherd's Journal, the key to Atlantis, lies not in Ireland, gentlemen, but in Iceland.
Pause for effect.
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.
Would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment?
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.
Yeah. Just a second.
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.
How's that? Is that better?
Yeah. You're welcome.
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.
Now, as you can see by the...
By this map...
Map that...
That I've drawn, I plotted the route that will take myself and a crew to the southern coast of Iceland to retrieve the Journal.
Showtime.
Well, this is it.
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you"
"that your meeting today has been moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."
What?
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,"
"the board has voted to reject your proposal."
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."
They can't do this to me!
I swear, that young Thatch gets crazier every year.
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,
I'll step in front of a bus.
I'll push you.
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!
Head for the hills!
Where is a guard when you need him?
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!
Sir?
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...
Thank you very much. Look at...
This museum funds scientific expeditions based on facts, not legends and folklore.
Besides, we need you here.
- We depend on you.
- You do?
Yes. What with winter coming, that boiler's going to need a lot of attention.
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!
But there... There's a journal!
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!
Sir, I really hoped it wouldn't come to this, but this is a letter of resignation.
If you reject my proposal, I'll...
I'll quit!
I mean it, sir.
If you refuse to fund my proposal...
You'll what?
Flush your career down the toilet, just like your grandfather?
You have a lot of potential, Milo.
Don't throw it all away chasing fairy tales.
But I can prove Atlantis exists!
You want to go on an expedition?
Here. Take a trolley to the Potomac and jump in!
Maybe the cold water will clear your head. Heinz!
I'm home.
Fluffy? Here, kitty.
Milo James Thatch?
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?
I came down the chimney.
My name is Helga Sinclair.
I'm acting on behalf of my employer, who has a most intriguing proposition for you.
Are you interested?
Your employer?
Who is your employer?
This way, please.
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.
Step lively.
Mr. Whitmore does not like to be kept waiting.
You will address him as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."
You will stand unless asked to be seated.
Keep your sentences short and to the point.
Are we clear?
And relax.
He doesn't bite... often.
Grandpa?
Finest explorer I ever met.
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.
Join me in a little yoga?
No, no. Thank you.
Did you really know my grandfather?
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown.
Class of '66. We stayed close friends till the end of his days.
Even dragged me along on some of his danged fool expeditions.
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.
He spoke of you often.
Funny. He never mentioned you.
He wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.
I keep a low profile.
Mr. Whitmore, should I be wondering why I'm here?
Look on that table.
It's for you.
It's from my grandfather.
He brought that package to me years ago.
He said if anything were to happen to him,
I should give it to you when you were ready.
Whatever that means.
It...
It can't be.
It's The Shepherd's Journal.
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!
Atlantis.
I wasn't born yesterday, son.
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.
That's because it's been written in a dialect that no longer exists.
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.
I've spent my whole life studying dead languages.
It's not gibberish to me.
It's probably a fake.
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known if this were a fake. I would know.
I will stake everything I own, everything that I believe in, that this is the genuine Shepherd's Journal.
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?
Well, I'll get funding.
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.
I'll show them! I will make them believe.
Like you did today?
Yes! Well, no. How did you...
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!
I will find Atlantis on my own.
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!
Congratulations, Milo.
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.
But forget the rowboat, son.
We'll travel in style.
It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax.
Why?
For years, your granddad bent my ear with stories about that old book.
I didn't buy it for a minute.
So, finally, I got fed up and I made a bet with the old coot.
I said, "Thatch, if you ever actually find that so-called journal",
"not only will I finance the expedition,"
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."
Imagine my embarrassment when he found the darn thing.
Now, I know your grandfather's gone, Milo,
God rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore is a man who keeps his word.
You hear that, Thatch?
I'm going to the afterlife with a clear conscience, by thunder!
Your grandpa was a great man.
You probably don't realize how great.
Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down, made a laughing stock of him.
He died a broken man.
If I could bring back just one shred of proof, that'd be enough for me.
Thatch.
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know, in order to do what you're proposing, you're gonna need a crew.
Taken care of.
You'll need engineers and geologists.
Got 'em all. The best of the best.
Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation.
The man has a nose for dirt.
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.
She's forgotten more about engines than you and I will ever know.
They're the same crew that brought the Journal back.
- Where was it?
- Iceland.
I knew it! I knew it!
All we need now is an expert in gibberish.
So, it's decision time.
You can build on the foundation your grandfather left you or you can go back to your boiler room.
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?
- Packed.
- My books?
- In storage.
- My cat?
My gosh.
Your granddad had a saying.
"Our lives are remembered, by the gifts we leave our children."
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.
You will not regret this.
Boy, I am so excited,
I can't even hold it in.
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?
I didn't even eat carrots.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
To whoever took the "L" from the Motor Pool sign, we are all very amused.
Excuse me? I need to report in?
Yes, Mr. Thatch?
It's you!
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.
Hold that thought.
What is it this time, Cookie?
You done stuffed my wagon full to busting with non-essentials.
Look at all this.
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?
And what is this?
That would be lettuce.
Lettuce? Lettuce?
It's a vegetable, Cookie.
The men need the four basic food groups.
I got your four basic food groups!
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.
Final loading in progress.
Hey, Junior.
If you're looking for the pony rides, they're back there.
Excuse me. Excuse me?
You dropped your dynamite.
What else have you got in there?
Gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads, fuses, wicks, glue, and...
Paper clips. Big ones.
You know, just office supplies.
Milo! Where you been?
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.
He led the Iceland team that brought the Journal back.
Milo Thatch.
Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus.
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures, but I prefer a good western myself.
Pretty impressive?
Boy, when you settle a bet, you settle a bet.
Well, your granddad always believed you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge.
Well, believe me, this'll be small change compared to the value of what we're gonna learn on this trip.
Yes, this should be enriching for all of us.
Attention, all personnel.
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.
It's time.
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!
Rig ship for dive!
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.
Lieutenant, take her down.
Diving officer, submerge the ship.
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.
- Take us down.
- Take us down!
Attention.
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.
Musical program to follow.
Who wrote this?
You have disturbed the dirt.
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!
Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries!
What have you done?
England must never merge with France!
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.
There you are.
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.
Parchment fiber from the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.
Lead pencil, number 2.
Paint flecks of a type used in government buildings.
You have a cat, shorthaired Persian, two years old, third in a litter of seven.
There are all the microscopic fingerprints of the mapmaker.
And linguist.
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?
Moliere, now what have I told you about playing nice with the other kids?
Get back. I've got soap, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!
The name's Sweet.
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.
Yeah, Milo Thatch.
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.
Well, no time like the present.
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?
The catalog says that this little beauty can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.
Now, stick out your tongue and say, "Ah."
Oh, no, really. I have a...
So, where you from?
Really? I have family up that way.
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.
Hate the taste, hate the smell, and hate all them little bones.
Here, I'm gonna need you to fill these up.
With what?
Will Milo Thatch please report to the bridge?
Thank you.
I mean, nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you, too.
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"
And he says to me...
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...
All right, let's have a look around.
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.
Aye, aye, sir.
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes.
Come right two-four-zero.
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.
Okay, everybody,
I want you to give Mr. Thatch your undivided attention.
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?
Okay, how about some slides?
The first slide is a depiction of a creature.
A creature so frightening that sailors were said to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.
I'm sorry. That's wrong.
Geez, I used to take lunch money from guys like this.
Anyway, this... Okay.
This is an illustration of the Leviathan, the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis.
With something like that,
I would have white wine, I think.
It's a mythical sea serpent.
He's described in The Book of Job.
The Bible says,
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,"
"sparks of fire shoot out."
But more likely, it's a carving or a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?
When do we dig?
Actually, we don't have to dig.
You see, according to the Journal, the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel at the bottom of the ocean, and we'll come up a curve into an air pocket right here, where we'll find the remnants of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis.
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.
Hard to believe he's still single.
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.
Captain, you'd better come look at this, sir.
Okay, class dismissed.
Give me exterior lights.
Look at that.
There are ships here from every era.
Commander, I think you should hear this.
Commander? Commander?
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."
Commander?
"There you will find the path to the gateway."
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?
I'm picking up something on the hydrophone.
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.
What is it? A pod of whales?
Bigger.
It sounds metallic.
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.
Helmsman! Bring us about.
Tighten our search pattern and slow us to...
Out of the way!
Tell Cookie to melt the butter and break out the bibs.
I want this lobster served up on a silver platter.
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!
Battle stations!
Steady, boys. Don't panic.
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!
Wait, wait!
Launch subpods!
Subpods away!
Fire!
We're free. All ahead full.
Fire torpedoes!
Get me the bridge!
Sir, it's Engineering on four.
Rourke! We took a big hit down here, and we're taking on water fast.
I don't want to be around when it hits the boilers.
How much time do we have?
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.
You better make that five.
You heard the lady. Let's move!
Move! Where? Move where?
Packard, sound the alarm!
He took his suitcase?
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.
No, no, I'll call you.
All hands, abandon ship.
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!
Come on! Everybody grab a seat and buckle in.
Lieutenant, get us out of here!
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!
Hang on.
Where to, Mr. Thatch?
We're looking for a big crevice of some kind.
There! Up ahead.
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.
Right behind you!
- Sacré bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!
Look out!
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!
Seven hours ago, we started this expedition with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.
We're all that's left.
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.
We have a crisis on our hands.
But we've been up this particular creek before, and we've always come through, paddle or no paddle.
I see no reason to change that policy now.
From here on in, everyone pulls double duty.
Everyone drives, everyone works.
Looks like all our chances for survival rest with you, Mr. Thatch.
You and that little book.
We're all gonna die.
Okay, people. Saddle up.
Lieutenant, I want this convoy moving five minutes ago.
Moliere, you're on point.
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards behind that truck at all times.
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.
Are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle?
Can you drive a truck?
Of course I can drive a truck.
I mean, sure, you got your steering, and your gas, and your brake, and of course, this metal-looking thing.
Okay, so it was a bumper car at Coney Island, but it's the same basic principle!
Come on! Move it!
Sorry about... Sorry about that.
Come on, civilian!
You didn't just drink that, did you?
That's not good.
That's nitroglycerin.
Don't move.
Don't breathe.
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.
Boom!
Yeah.
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.
It must have taken hundred...
No, thousands of years to carve this thing.
Hey, look, I made a bridge.
It only took me, like, what?
10 seconds, 11, tops.
Looks like we have a little roadblock.
Vinny, what do you think?
I could un-roadblock that if I had about 200 of these.
Problem is, I only got about 10.
Plus, you know, five of my own, and a couple of cherry bombs, a road flare.
Hey, too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin, Milo?
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.
It will be my pleasure.
Stupid...
Stupid!
I don't understand it.
I just tuned this thing up this morning.
It looks like the rotor's shot!
I'm gonna have to pull a spare from one of the trucks.
- Can I...
- No toques nada!
I'll be right back.
She lives!
Hey, what'd you do?
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.
Now, we got the 814 back at the museum.
The heating cores on the whole Humac line have always been a little, you know, temperamental, so sometimes you gotta... Boom!
Persuade 'em a little.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.
Shut up.
Two for flinching.
This is it. It's gotta be.
All right, we'll make camp here.
Why is it glowing?
It is a natural phosphorescence.
That thing is going to keep me up all night, I know it.
Come and get it!
For the appetizer, Caesar salad, escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.
Knock yourself out.
There you go, Milo.
Put some meat on them bones.
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.
You like it? Well, have some more.
You're so skinny, if you turned sideways and stuck out your tongue, you'd look like a zipper.
You know, we've been pretty tough on the kid.
What do you say we cut him some slack?
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?
Really? You don't mind?
Nah. Park it here.
Gee, this is great.
I mean, you know, it's an honor to be included in your...
- Mole!
- Forgive me.
I could not resist.
Hey, Milo, don't you ever close that book?
Yeah, you must've read it a dozen times by now.
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.
See, in this passage here, the shepherd seems to be leading up to something.
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.
It could be the power source the legends refer to.
But then, it just... It cuts off.
It's almost like there's a missing page.
Kid, relax.
We don't get paid overtime.
I know, I know.
Sometimes I get a little carried away.
But hey, you know, that's what this is all about, right?
I mean, discovery, teamwork, adventure.
Unless, maybe...
You're just in it for the money.
- Money.
- Money.
I'm gonna say... Money.
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.
What, is something wrong with your neck?
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...
Better?
Yeah!
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.
- No kidding.
- Nope.
I got a sheepskin from Howard U, and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.
One day I'm studying gross anatomy in the classroom, the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders on San Juan Hill.
Main course.
I couldn't eat another bite.
I'm watching my weight.
Don't you worry.
It'll keep and keep and keep.
Thank God I lost my sense of taste years ago.
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?
I did.
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.
I haven't gone camping since...
Well, since the last time my grandpa took me.
I never got to meet your grandfather.
What was he like?
Where do you start?
He was like a father to me, really.
My parents died when I was a little kid, and he took me in.
What?
Well, I was just thinking.
One time, when I was eight, we were hiking along this stream, and I saw something shining in the water.
It was a genuine arrowhead.
Well, you'd think I'd found a lost civilization the way Grandpa carried on about it.
It wasn't until I was older that I realized that the arrowhead was just some compressed shale mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured into an isosceletic triangulate.
That is so cute!
Say, Audrey, no offense, but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic of a multimillion dollar expedition?
Well, I took this job when my dad retired.
But the funny thing was he always wanted sons, right?
One to run his machine shop and the other to be middleweight boxing champion.
But he got my sister and me instead.
So, what happened to your sister?
She's 24-0 with a shot at the title next month.
Anyway, I'm saving up so my papi and I can open another shop.
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?
I sleep in the nude.
You're gonna want a pair of these.
She sleepwalks.
Well, as far as me goes,
I just like to blow things up.
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.
My family owned a flower shop.
We would sell roses, carnations, baby's breath, you name it.
One day, I'm making about three dozen corsages for this prom.
You know, the one they put on their wrist.
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"
It's a nightmare.
Anyway, I guess there was this leak next door of gas or what. Boom!
No more Chinese laundry.
Blew me right through the front window.
It was like a sign from God.
I found myself that boom.
What's Mole's story?
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't have told me, but you did.
And now, I'm telling you, you don't wanna know.
The redhead's got a gun.
Holy...
Fire.
Fire!
I'm gonna kill him.
Thatch, go back to bed.
Get some water on that fire!
No time!
Get us into those caves!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Gertie, pull!
Milo, jump! Right now!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.
Danged lightning bugs done bit me on my sit upon.
Somebody's gonna have to suck out that poison.
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.
Audrey, give me a damage report.
Not as bad as it could have been.
We totaled rigs two and seven, but the digger looks like it'll still run.
Lucky for us we landed in something soft.
Pumice ash.
We are standing at the base of a dormant volcano.
It just keeps going.
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.
Maybe not.
The magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano, effectively blocking the exit.
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.
Hold on. Back up.
Are you saying this whole volcano can blow at any time?
No, no, no, no.
That would take an explosive force of great magnitude.
Maybe I should do this later?
If we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface.
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?
Mr. Thatch?
Thatch?
Hey, wait!
Who are you? Where are you going?
Come back!
Hey, wait a minute!
Who are you?
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!
It's beautiful.
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.
You really came through.
I take that back.
Holy cats! Who are these guys?
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!
I seen this back in the Dakota.
They can smell fear just by looking at ya.
So, keep quiet.
I think it's talking to you.
Parlez-vous français?
Oui, monsieur!
They speak my language!
Pardon, mademoiselle.
Voulez-vous...
I like her.
'Bout time someone hit him.
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.
How do they know all these languages?
Their language must be based on a root dialect.
It's just like the Tower of Babel.
Well, maybe English is in there somewhere.
We are explorers from the surface world.
We come in peace.
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.
Come. You must speak with my father now.
Squad "B," head back to the shaft and salvage what you can.
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.
Let's move it. You heard him.
I'm so excited!
Now, what's really amazing is that if you deconstructed Latin, you overlaid it with a little Sumerian, throw in a dash of Thessalonian, you'd be getting close to their basic grammatical structure.
Or at least you'd be in the same ballpark...
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.
Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here.
This changes everything.
This changes nothing.
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!
Your Majesty?
On behalf of my crew, may I say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city.
Excuse me? Commander?
You presume much to think you are welcome here.
Oh, sir, we have come a long way looking for...
I know what you seek, and you will not find it here.
Your journey has been in vain.
But we are peaceful explorers, men of science.
And yet you bring weapons.
Our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter.
Some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force.
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.
- Sir...
- Not now, son.
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.
May I respectfully request that we stay one night, sir?
That would give us time to rest, resupply, and be ready to travel by morning.
Very well. One night.
That is all.
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.
Your heart has softened, Kida.
A thousand years ago, you would have slain them on sight.
A thousand years ago, the streets were lit, and our people did not have to scavenge for food at the edge of a crumbling city!
The people are content.
They do not know any better!
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.
The kings of our past would weep if they could see how far we have fallen.
- Kida.
- If these outsiders can unlock the secrets of our past, perhaps we can save our future.
What they have to teach us we have already learned.
Our way of life is dying.
Our way of life is preserved.
Kida, when you take the throne, you will understand.
- So, how'd it go?
- Well, the King and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye.
She seems to like us okay, but the King...
I don't know. I think he's hiding something.
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!
Someone who can speak the language.
For the good of the mission, I will go!
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.
"Look, I have some questions for you,
"and I'm not leaving this city until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.
That's good, that's good.
I have some questions for you, and you are not leaving this city until they are answered.
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.
Oh, there is so much to ask about your world.
You are a scholar, are you not?
Judging from your diminished physique and large forehead, you are suited for nothing else.
What is your country of origin?
When did the flood waters recede?
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.
I got a few questions for you, too.
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one, then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.
Very well. What is your first question?
Well, okay, how did you get here?
Well, I mean, not you, personally, but your culture.
I mean, how did all of this end up down here?
It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis.
They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here.
All I can remember is the sky going dark and people shouting and running.
Then, a bright light, like a star floating above the city.
My father said it called my mother to it.
I never saw her again.
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,
I know how you feel, because I lost my...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Back up!
What are you telling me?
That you remember because you were there?
No, that's... That's impossible...
Because, I mean, that would make you...
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.
Yes.
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.
Just...
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.
How is it you found your way to this place?
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.
If it weren't for this book, we never would have made it.
Okay, second question. Legend has it that your people possessed a power source of some kind that enabled them...
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.
That's what I do, that's my job.
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here, you can read this?
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.
You can't, can you?
No one can.
Such knowledge has been lost to us since the time of the mehbehlmoak.
Oh, the Great Flood.
- Show me.
- Okay...
"Follow the narrow passage for another league."
"There, you will find the fifth marker."
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?
Boorish, provincial...
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.
Here, let me show you something.
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.
Yes. But no matter what I try, it will not respond.
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."
Yes, yes, I have done that!
"Gently place your hand on the inscription pad."
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!
While your hand was on the inscription pad?
No.
Well. See, there's your problem right there.
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit for even getting this far.
Okay, give it a try.
Yeah, you got that right.
This is great! With this thing,
I could see the whole city in no time at all.
Wonder how fast it goes.
So, who's hungry?
By the way, we were never properly introduced.
My name's Milo.
My name is Kidagakash.
Kidamaschnaga.
Hey, you got a nickname?
Kida.
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.
What is wrong?
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.
You know, my grandpa used to tell me stories about this place as far back as I can remember.
I just wish he could be standing here with me.
Tell me more about your companions.
Your physician, he is called Cookie?
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?
The doctor. He's Sweet.
Oh, he is kindly.
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.
So all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
No. Well, I'm sure some are.
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.
Look at all those tattoos.
Shoot. That ain't nothing.
Look here what I got.
All 38 United States.
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.
There you go.
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.
Sweet is kindly, but that is not his name.
Audrey is sweet, but she is not your doctor.
And the little digging animal called Mole...
He is your pet?
Close enough.
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.
That's where all the nutrients are.
You know, Kida, the most we ever hoped to find was some crumbling buildings, maybe some broken pottery.
Instead, we find a living, thriving society.
These guys are kinda cute when they're not, you know, formed into a fiery column of death.
We are not thriving.
True, our people live, but our culture is dying.
We are like a stone the ocean beats against.
With each passing year, a little more of us is worn away.
I wish there was something I could do.
I have brought you to this place to ask you for your help.
There is a mural here with writing all around the pictures.
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.
Well, this... Kida?
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.
Pretty good! Pretty good.
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.
Good. It is a fair distance to where we are going.
Hey, you are talking to the belly flop champ at Camp Runamuck.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Why don't you lead the way, because
I have no idea where we're going.
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...
Good. Follow me.
This is amazing!
A complete history of Atlantis!
It's just like Plato described it.
Well, he was off on a few details, but...
The light I saw.
The star in the middle of the city.
What does the writing say about that?
I don't know yet.
But we're gonna find out.
Come on.
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's what the shepherd was talking about.
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.
Like these! Don't you get it?
The power source I've been looking for, the bright light you remember.
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.
It's what's keeping all these things...
You, all of Atlantis alive.
Then where is it now?
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something this important would have been in the Journal, but...
Unless... The missing page.
You have a nice swim?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
What's... What's with all the guns?
Guys?
I am such an idiot.
This is just another treasure hunt for you.
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?
The heart of Atlantis.
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner, but it was strictly on a need-to-know basis.
And, well, now you know.
I had to be sure you were one of us.
Welcome to the club, son.
I'm no mercenary.
Mercenary?
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."
Besides, you're the one who got us here.
You led us right to the treasure chest.
You don't know what you're tampering with, Rourke.
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.
It's going to make us all rich.
You think it's some kind of a diamond,
I thought it was some kind of a battery, but we're both wrong.
It's their life force.
That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive.
You take that away, and they'll die.
Well, that changes things.
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.
I was thinking triple.
Rourke, don't do this.
Academics. You never want to get your hands dirty.
Think about it.
If you gave back every stolen artifact from a museum, you'd be left with an empty building.
We're just providing a necessary service to the archeological community.
Not interested.
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.
You're an idealist, just like your grandfather.
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.
For once, do the smart thing.
I really hate it when negotiations go sour.
Let's try this again.
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!
Spread out! Search everywhere!
You're not applying yourself, son.
There's got to be something else.
Well, there isn't. It just says,
"The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king."
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here can help us fill in the blanks.
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?
You will destroy yourselves.
Maybe I'm not being clear.
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.
Plan's changed, doc.
I'd suggest you put a bandage on that bleeding heart of yours.
It doesn't suit a mercenary.
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.
Now, I'm going to count to 10.
And you're going to tell me where the crystal is.
One...
Two...
Nine...
T...
The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king.
This is it. We're in.
Rourke, for the last time, you've got to listen to me.
You don't have the slightest idea what this power is capable of.
True, but I can think of a few countries who'd pay anything to find out.
Hurry. Get on.
Jackpot.
The kings of our past.
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.
We got a schedule to meet.
Kida...
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's get this over with.
I don't like this place.
All right, Thatch, what's next?
Okay, there's a giant crystal hovering 150 feet above our heads over a bottomless pit of water.
Doesn't anything surprise you?
The only thing that surprises me is you're still talking and that thing's not on the truck yet.
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.
I don't even know what's holding it up there.
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?
Look, all it says here is that the crystal is alive, somehow.
I don't know how to explain it.
It's their deity. It's their power source.
Speak English, professor.
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.
I'm doing the best I can here.
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.
Why don't you translate, and I'll wave the gun around?
What did she say?
I don't know. I didn't catch it.
Hold your horses, lover boy.
Kida.
No, don't. Don't touch her.
All right, step back.
Sergeant, keep those people back.
You heard him. Step back.
I'm warning you.
So...
I guess this is how it ends?
Fine. You win.
You're wiping out an entire civilization, but hey... You'll be rich.
Congratulations, Audrey.
Guess you and your dad will be able to open up that second garage after all.
And, Vinny, you can start a whole chain of flower shops.
I'm sure your family's going to be very proud.
But that's what it's all about, right?
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.
We're just helping it along.
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.
I know I'm forgetting something.
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...
Oh, yeah.
Look at it this way, son.
You were the man who discovered Atlantis, and now, you're part of the exhibit.
Let's move, people.
That was an order, not a suggestion. Let's go!
We're all going to die.
Oh, you can't be serious.
This is wrong, and you know it.
We're this close to our biggest payday ever, and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience.
We've done a lot of things we're not proud of, robbing graves, plundering tombs, double parking, but nobody got hurt.
Well, maybe somebody got hurt, but nobody we knew.
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.
More for me.
P.T. Barnum was right.
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.
Okay, now you can go.
Milo, you better get up here.
How's he doing?
Not good, I'm afraid.
Internal bleeding.
There's nothing more I can do.
What a nightmare.
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.
He's been after that crystal since Iceland.
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.
These... These crystals, they have some sort of healing energy.
I've seen it work.
No.
Where is my daughter?
Well, she...
She has been chosen, like her mother before her.
What?
In times of danger, the crystal will choose a host, one of royal blood, to protect itself and its people.
It will accept no other.
Wait a minute. Choose?
So this thing is alive?
In a way.
The crystal thrives on the collective emotions of all who came before us.
In return, it provides power, longevity, protection.
As it grew, it developed a consciousness of its own.
In my arrogance,
I sought to use it as a weapon of war, but it's power proved too great to control.
It overwhelmed us and led to our destruction.
That's why you hid it beneath the city.
To keep history from repeating itself.
And to prevent Kida from suffering the same fate as my beloved wife.
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?
If she remains bonded to the crystal, she could be lost to it forever.
The love of my daughter is all I have left.
My burden would have become hers when the time was right, but now, it falls to you.
Me?
Return the crystal.
Save Atlantis.
Save my daughter.
So, what's it going to be?
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?
Well, I think we've seen how effective my decisions have been.
Let's recap.
I lead a band of plundering vandals to the greatest archeological find in recorded history, thus enabling the kidnap and/or murder of the royal family.
Not to mention personally delivering the most powerful force known to man into the hands of a mercenary nutcase who's probably going to sell it to the Kaiser!
Have I left anything out?
Well, you did set the camp on fire
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Of course, it's been my experience when you hit bottom, the only place left to go is up.
Who told you that?
A fella by the name of Thaddeus Thatch.
Where are you going?
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.
Come on. We better make sure he doesn't hurt himself.
Milo, what do you think you are doing?
Just follow my lead.
I'm impressed.
It's simple. All you got to do...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?
No, no, wait!
Gently. Just gently.
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?
You know, like a tuna?
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.
Kida showed me.
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.
I'm so excited.
All right, this is it!
We're going to rescue the princess.
We're going to save Atlantis.
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!
I love it when I win.
Okay, here's the plan.
We're going to come in low and fast and take them by surprise.
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.
Rourke is never surprised, and he's got a lot of guns.
Great. Well, do you have any suggestions?
Yeah. Don't get shot.
There they are!
We've got company!
Take off!
Take her up!
Holy smokes!
You told me he only had guns.
What I said was, he's never surprised.
Okay, now things are getting good.
Vinny! Heads up!
We can't let them reach the top of that shaft!
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath that thing and cut her loose.
We're on it.
Lieutenant!
I thought you said this thing could cut through a femur in 28 seconds!
Less talk, more saw.
Looks like somebody's working overtime.
Come on, girl. Time's up.
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?
Yeah. I really wish I had a better idea than this!
We're losing altitude.
Lighten the load.
That's it, unless someone wants to jump.
Ladies first.
You said we were in this together!
You promised me a percentage!
Next time, get it in writing.
Nothing personal.
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck than I would have ever thought possible.
I consider myself an even-tempered man.
It takes a lot to get under my skin.
But congratulations, you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.
Nothing personal.
Tired, Mr. Thatch?
That's a darn shame because I'm just getting warmed up.
Thank heaven.
Oh, great!
The volcano... She awakes!
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
This here would be a good place not to be.
No, wait. We got to get her back or the whole city will die.
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.
It's the only way to reverse this.
Just do it!
Milo, no!
Go!
The fissure, it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!
Milo?
Atlantis will honor your names forever.
I only wish there was more we could do for you.
You know, thanks anyway, but I think we're good.
They'll take you as far as the surface.
We are really going to miss you, Milo.
You know, I'm going to reopen the flower shop, and I'm going to think of you guys every single day,
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,
Saturday until 2:00.
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off, probably, and...
Maybe I'll go in for a couple of hours, you know.
But August... I'm going to take August.
I ain't so good at speechifying, but I wanted you to have this.
It's the bacon grease from the whole trip.
Cookie, I...
Two for flinching.
See you, Milo.
Hey, Milo!
Mole.
Mole. Hey, well...
Good-bye, Mole.
Now, you sure you want to stay?
There's a hero's welcome waiting for the man who discovered Atlantis.
I don't think the world needs another hero.
Besides, I hear there's an opening down here for an expert in gibberish.
You take good care of yourself, Milo Thatch.
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.
Come here.
Sweet, before you go, could you...
No problem.
Thanks.
Oh, you're getting a bill.
Can we go home now?
Come on, y'all. Let's get one last shot in front of the fish.
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!
Now, let's go over it again, just so we got it straight.
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...
And fish, little fish.
Sponges.
What happened to Helga?
Well, we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her.
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.
In fact, you could say he was transamorgafied and then busted into a zillion...
He's missing, too.
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.
Lord, give me strength.
I'm going to miss that boy.
At least he's in a better place now.
Dear Mr. Whitmore,
I hope this piece of proof is enough for you.
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.
They'll try to hold you back
And they will say you're wrong
But they will never understand
The journey that you're on
They'll try to change your mind
They'll try to change your heart
Oh, yeah
But they will never understand
Who you are
And you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
And you know
You must go
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where you can take your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Oh, yeah
There's something in your soul
Something in your soul
That won't be denied
It's the faith to dream that keeps
The dream alive
So you'll still believe
Still believe
And you know
You must go
Where the dream takes you
Where your dream takes your heart
Where your heart longs to be
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream takes you
Go where your heart is meant to be
And you may find
Somebody there
Someone to share your dream
All right, all right
Your dream will lead you on
When you finally find that place
You'll find all you need
Where the dream leads you
Your dream will lead you on
Far as your heart can see
Your dream will lead you on
Oh, yes
There's a world that waits for you
You're not alone
You'll find your home
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your mind
Where the dream takes you
Try to change your heart
Where the dream takes you
But you must go
Mr Taransky...?
She's...
She's walking?
Don't tell me she's walking.
She can't walk.
Nicola!
This, this...
- Not this.
- Nicola...? How was your massage?
You're in breach.
Cigarette.
Is this about the new pages?
I made the changes-- all the changes you wanted.
You are virtually in every scene.
It is not the size of the role, Viktor.
Am I, or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot? Hmm?
It's the biggest on earth. I swear.
It's a 50-foot
Airstream.
They don't make them any longer.
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?
- Taller!
- What?
Eh...?
- You've insulted me for the last time.
- You're right.
It's actually... it's actually taller.
- You're right. It's amazing.
- Coffee?!
Wait a minute--
The tyres are overinflated.
See? It's just this.
See? Look. Here.
- The air comes right out.
- This is so sad.
See, it's lower already.
- Nicola, please, don't do this to me.
- I had three other offers.
I only signed on to this picture out of loyalty.
Well, then show me some.
They're going to shut me down!
It's not working, Viktor.
I mean, my God!
The scene with the thousand geese?
I don't understand this film!
Nobody is going to understand this film.
Look, I already put out a press release citing 'creative differences,'
- so just let it go.
- You went to the press?
- Do we have everything?
- Alright. You know what? You're right.
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.
You ought to go.
I don't deserve you.
Oh.
This film doesn't deserve you.
It deserves much, much better than you!
'Creative differences'? The difference is you're not creative.
To hell, please.
Jack? Jack, are you there?
She's good.
You can hardly tell she's reading off a Teleprompter.
I'm right here.
Right beside you.
Look. I've analysed this footage.
We've got everything we need in the can already.
If I could just make the proper adjustments, we can finish this film without her.
According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today, they'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.
So let's recast.
Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part.
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.
Nicola is not bigger than this picture.
Of course she is, Viktor.
No other 'name' is going to sign on now.
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.
I'm not going to play opposite an unknown.
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
No! I will not give in to that blackmailing--
Viktor, let's take a walk.
Ridiculous performance.
- I told you she was bad.
- No, yours in there.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?
Yes. Mm-hmm.
Elaine, do you know what these are?
- 'Mike 'n' Ike's'?
- They're not just any 'Mike 'n' Ike's,' these are cherry
'Mike 'n' Ike's.'
Do you know why I,
Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award- nominated director--
That was
'Short Subject.'
--overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career, am walking around with-- look, look... pockets full of these things?
- I have a feeling you'll tell me.
- I'm going to tell you.
Because Ms Nicola Anders-- supermodel with a SAG card-- has it written in her contract that all cherry 'Mike 'n' Ike's' be removed from her candy dish, along with strict instructions that any room she walks into must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her-- three of them opened; that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room; and any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first-class.
So, what's wrong with that?
Elaine, she doesn't have children.
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.
We're at their mercy.
What happened?
We always had movie stars, but they used to be our stars, remember?
We were the ones that would tell them what to do.
We would tell them what to wear,
- who to date--
- That's what you want?
When they were under contract to us, we could change their names at will.
- Yeah-- more than once.
- Viktor, do you realise you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I do remember why I got into this business.
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please. Come on.
New York-- Cassavetes.
Remember?
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?
We were trying to make something important. I don't know.
- Shine a light in that darkened cinema.
- It's called a projector.
Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
- Okay.
- I thought that's what we were doing.
I have good memories of those days, too.
I do, but this isn't about that-- or you, or me, or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.
- Spare me.
- Look around.
Who do you think pays for all of this?
This is about investment and return.
I'm not interested in investment and return!
I'm not interested in who pays for anything! I'm trying to make a movie!
I'm responsible for this, Viktor.
Those days in New York-- it's over, Viktor.
You're not renewing my contract?
How can I?
Your last three pictures tanked.
No bankable star is going to work with you after this.
I mean, if you just compromised a little.
Well, not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old times' sake.
And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Dad!
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, honey?
- Good.
I'm sorry
Mum canned you.
I'm going to finish this picture.
Lainey, I'm going to finish it.
Because it's important.
I know you will, Dad.
You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Okay. Bye, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.
Are you okay?
I'm Viktor Taransky.
Mr Taransky?
Mr Taransky, thank God.
I've been trying to see you.
I've been calling.
Your assistant wouldn't put me through.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
I was afraid I wasn't going to get to you in time.
Please, just...
- keep your distance.
- I did it! I did it!
I licked skin,
I licked hair,
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call Security.
I'll call Security if you don't back off.
I have her,
Mr Taransky-- the answer to your prayers.
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.
I have your new leading lady right here-- in my pants.
Please, sir,
I don't know you.
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!
Mr Taransky, don't-- don't you recognise me? The 'Future of Film' Conference in San Jose.
Remember that?
Hank. Hank Aleno.
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech--
- 'Who Needs Humans?'
- Right.
You were booed off the stage. I remember.
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.
In that whole time
I never left my computer.
- Uh-huh. Good for you, Hank.
- Well, it's good and bad.
That's what caused this-- the eye tumour--
- microwaves from the screen.
- Oh dear, I'm sorry.
Don't be, because it was worth it.
- You have to see her.
- Oh, I've seen those.
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.
Well, you're talking about a 'syn-thespian,' a 'virtual actor.'
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.'
- 'Vac-tors'? I need flesh.
- No, we call them 'Vac-tors.'
- 'Vac-tors'? I need flesh.
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.
It can be done. With my new computer code, it can be done.
You and me... we can do this together.
I don't know anything about computers.
See, that's why-- you're so perfect, Mr Taransky.
You have something... that I don't have.
What's that?
An eye-- an eye for performance.
You know the truth when you see it. I know.
I mean, I've seen your movies.
I love your movies.
- You love my movies?
- 'Straw God'-- that changed my life.
You saw 'Straw God'?
I have seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity... to realise my vision.
You and me, art and science-- we're the perfect marriage.
Hank... I've had a rough day today.
But I tell you what,
I'll call you about this next week.
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.
- The tumour is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumour is inoperable.
I'll be dead.
Well, I'm already dead, Hank.
Call me!
This week!
Please.
What do you mean she won't work with me? She's done nothing.
She doesn't have a single credit to her name.
Better no credits than a Taransky credit.
You don't understand. I've mortgaged everything to finish this film.
The creditors are calling me.
They're at the door, for God's sake.
Hello?
Damn it!
Mr Taransky.
Mr Taransky!
- Mr Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!
- Mr Taransky!
- I'm not him!
Mr Taransky!
Hank Aleno!
I represent the estate of Mr Hank Aleno.
It was his last wish that you have this.
What is it?
I have no idea.
He wanted you to have it.
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie!
Valarie, what are you running from?
From Valarie.
Valarie, no!
Jack, are you there?
Something like this can happen and what... was it for?
'Why are we here?'
Is that what you're asking, Jack?
Why are we here?
No 'why'... just here.
Just here.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions.
I wanted to send a message to the acting community who... put themselves above the work, who put themselves above me.
So, what did you guys think?
So fake.
Totally artificial.
Like we're supposed to believe that was 1 9th-century Lisbon.
- Come on.
- Guys... who's looking at the sets when she's on screen?
Oh, yeah.
There he is. That's my dad,
Viktor Taransky.
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.
Breathtaking.
She wasn't too cartoony or anything?
- Who, the nun?
- Or are you talking about the mother?
A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.
- You should be very proud.
- Oh-- 'not of this earth.'
- And the rest of the film?
- She's a miracle, Dad.
Where did you find her?
Well, I saw her picture on the computer.
Computer?
You really didn't notice anything unusual about it?
Only your brilliance.
To be honest, with what you had to work with,
I was expecting a train wreck.
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?
Yeah. I have a feeling
Mum will take you back after this.
Back on the lot.
That's what--
I know. I know.
Come on, let's go.
A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film
'Sunrise, Sunset.'
But who is Simone?
We know so little about her.
And why the secrecy?
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director,
Viktor Tarinsky.
Taransky.
Simone!
Simone?
- Good to see you too, Elaine.
- Where is she?
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?
Why? Because she would never come to something like this.
She's intensely private.
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?
They're love letters.
Listen to this one. Oh, here.
'Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelly-- and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel.'
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
She is somewhat of a recluse.
That's how she stays so pure.
She isolates herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Elaine, it's my actor.
There are other studios.
There's only one Simone.
Okay, have it your way, Viktor.
Hello, Walter.
Nobody came in or went out, just like you said.
Very good.
- Mr Taransky?
- Yes?
Is Ms Simone coming in today?
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.
She's going to leave long after you're gone.
Remember, under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission, understood?
Yes, sir.
Mr Taransky?
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr Taransky.
Simone, a star is... digitised.
Do you know what this means?
We have stepped into a new dimension.
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
...death of real.
...death of real.
Too much Meryl Streep.
A little less Streep... and a little more...
Bacall.
Much.
While we're at it, there's a little something
I want to add to your repertoire.
You've got the wrong
Holly Golightly.
Remember that thing
Audrey Hepburn does in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'?
How do I look?
- Give me Audrey.
- How do I look?
Perfect.
Perfect, Simone.
Perfect.
Oh, God.
I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm so myself.
You did create me.
I just brought someone else's dream to life.
Mr Taransky, we both know
I was nothing without you.
I was computer code.
I was ones and zeros.
I was nothing.
Well... that's true.
I don't want to boast, but...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr Taransky?
I'm going to tell the truth about you.
Why wouldn't I?
Of course... with Hank's tragic passing, his secret did die with him.
This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist.
Someone with integrity, someone with vision, someone who can see-- see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake, that the scales have tipped-- naturally in favour of the fake.
Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor's real or not.
And what's 'real' anymore?
Most actors these days have digital work done to them.
That's a grey area.
The only real truth is the work.
I'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture.
You're so beautiful.
You're too beautiful.
We're going to fix that.
Is this on?
I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone.
I do, however, have a statement to read on her behalf.
'To whom it may concern:
I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr Taransky's film.
At this time I will be conducting no interviews,
- or making publicity appearances--
- This is unbelievable--
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself.
Yours truly, Simone.'
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?
Where did you find her?
- Is 'Simone' her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?
No questions regarding Simone.
We're just trying to get some answers.
I will make my final statement.
Ms Simone begins production on her new film today--
'Eternity Forever.'
This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
Thank you.
Would you answer a question regarding 'Hank'?
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?
Funny, why is the movie dedicated to Hank? Are they involved?
They were at one time inseparable. Yes.
- And now?
- Now... sadly to say, only in spirit.
Thank you.
Your car will be ready in just a minute.
- We gave you complimentary car wash.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. They're cleaning the engine now.
- Thank you.
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.
I am so happy for us.
The film, the chemistry-- nothing against Nicola Anders, but I think that Simone and I we really worked great together.
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.
You can't-- Look, I have not read 'Eternity Forever,' but it is fantastic.
And I know I would be perfect for the part of 'Clive.'
- 'Clyde.'
- 'Clyde,' right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.
Come on, man.
- I ran into Simone on the lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- She never mentioned it.
She's busy right now.
People coming at her from all angles.
Maybe she didn't want you to know, huh?
I strongly sensed that she thought
I would be perfect for 'Clyde' as well.
- Really?
- Strongly.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello?
Simone, it's so great to hear from you.
How are you, sweetheart?
You'll never guess who I'm with.
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.
No, you're not even close. Hal.
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?
I'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation.
No, I don't think he put on weight.
Do you think he'd be right for 'Eternity Forever'?
He's not the right type?
You want to go in another direction?
We'll try and talk her into it, don't worry.
- Anything you can do. Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey...
- Is this some kind of jamming device?
- this is a bad place to talk.
Maybe he's just talking to himself.
Taransky's not that good an actor.
Honey, I know you want to do charity work...
No, they've taken special precautions.
Some kind of new encryption.
Why would they do that?
Well, whatever it is... it's dark.
Dark?
Yeah. Very.
We'll talk at the beach house this weekend.
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?
You'll lose yourself in that thing.
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?
Dad, I know plenty of boys.
You do? Who?
Where do you meet them?
You meet them in those chat rooms?
How do you know it's not some middle-aged freak?
I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.
Lainey, leave the computer, please.
Okay.
Dad, it might be better to eat inside.
Stay here.
What is this?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!
Simone appears only when I want her to appear!
Sounds like a prisoner.
Are you holding her hostage?
You're the hostage.
You look kind of captive to me.
Lainey, don't you ever wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Just as long as I know where you are, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Hello, Viktor.
Sorry I got her back late.
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you want to come in?
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.
Viktor, we simply have to discuss 'Eternity Forever.'
I still haven't received
Simone's script notes.
There aren't any.
If the filmmakers are happy, she's happy.
She considers herself... you know, an instrument.
So she's really going to do all this nudity?
It's on the page.
We have to do something about this budget.
It's completely unrealistic.
You allowed nothing for limousine service.
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.
- Hair and makeup?
- Does her own.
- In her theatre training.
- Oh, she was in the theatre?
- Where?
- I'll send you her resume.
Okay, great. Thanks.
At least, Viktor, contingency for wardrobe. Anybody can go up a size.
I guarantee she will not gain an ounce. She is so disciplined.
We've gotta do something about this-- stuntwoman.
- What about it?
- Well, there isn't one.
She doesn't need one.
Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?
- Even the fall from the plane.
Oh. We'll shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor.
I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but as Elaine, ex-wife-- hey, second ex-wife.
Seriously-- you got lucky this last time, but you need to be careful.
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film if you hadn't convinced
Simone to be in it.
Elaine... talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but as Viktor, your first former husband, what happened to you? Hmm?
Experience, Viktor.
That's what happened to me.
Yeah, I've seen this a hundred times.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.
I'm worried about you, that's all.
This woman, she controls your destiny.
She doesn't control my destiny.
There's something about her
I don't trust.
Hi, Jane.
Thanks for taking me back,
Mr Taransky.
I know that it looked like
I sided with the studio, but I've always believed in you. Honestly.
Don't worry. I understand.
Are they--
- They're all here.
- Okay, thank you.
- Hello.
- Viktor.
I just want to say
I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for 'Eternity Forever.'
A reminder: as a condition for working on this picture, you will not be rehearsing with Simone.
You will not be shooting with Simone.
Actually, you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?
- Body double.
- For her?
For you.
Anyway, Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started.
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?
I certainly am,
Mr Taransky.
So are we, Simone.
Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, who's there? Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Mac. I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.
Hi, I'm Claris. You used to date my cousin, Dell.
I'm Hewlett. We can rehearse in private if you like.
My name is Lotus.
God, I can't believe
I'm talking to you.
We are going to become such great friends.
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.
It's great to be working together... again.
Is that everyone?
Well, obviously, as you know...
...I'm Simone.
Who else?
I just want to start by apologising for my process.
I know it's an unusual way to work,
I just find I relate better to people when they're not actually there.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
I don't have much to say, except that I know it's gonna be a great project if we all just trust
Mr Taransky's vision.
Always do what Mr Taransky says.
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.
I know we're gonna make a wonderful movie together.
Together. Absolutely.
Veronica.
What you don't understand, Clyde,
- is that love--
- Still too big.
I like it, but it's too big.
Alright. Smaller teardrops this time.
What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wildflower.
But that flower only grows on the edge... of a very high cliff.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Simone. Simone...
Simone.
Gonna be a little change in plans, Simone.
You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people.
We can't stop now.
These films, they're speaking to the human condition.
We're changing lives.
People need to believe you're real.
To reveal the truth now, it would be too cruel.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble, Mr Taransky.
Why do you have to bring that up?
I mean, everything's a risk.
But it's worth it, isn't it?
We've done enough work today.
You've been cooped up in there too long.
So how about you and I going out on the town?
Tonight, they're going to see you with their own eyes.
Excuse me.
I will be checking in a very special guest.
- A Ms Enomis.
- Ah, Ms Enomis.
Now, Ms Enomis demands her privacy, so you will switch off all surveillance cameras.
I alone will escort
Ms Enomis to her room via the rear exit.
She must not be disturbed at any time, for any reason whatsoever.
I'm sure I can rely on your discretion.
Understood, sir.
Thank you.
There she is!
- Who is it?
- It's Simone.
Okay, I think everybody's here.
Now!
I think we're alright now.
Oh, thank God for you, Faith, thank God for you.
I mean, this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.
I must tell you, you have no idea the service you've performed for Simone, shielding her from these animals.
Oh, no, Mr Taransky.
Thank God for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress?
It's incredible.
Well... you know, we're gonna have to go back to my place, just to, you know, keep them off the scent.
Of course.
You look so...
So much like... like her?
Oh, yes, of course, like her.
But you're so very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself strangely attracted to you,
Mr Taransky.
Call me Viktor.
Viktor.
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor, Viktor.
- Viktor.
- Yes?
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.
Do what you do to Simone.
What? What did you say?
I said, do whatever you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Call me 'Simone'!
Simone?
Yes. Say it again, please.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please, call me Simone.
You're with me so you can be close to her?
Is that a problem?
Okay. Excuse me just a minute.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, actually... maybe we can do this some other time
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?
Gentlemen, the presidential suite.
Ahem--
I think that should take care of everything.
Yes, sir,
I believe it will.
Leave me for a moment.
Simone.
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!
- There she is.
- The picture-- the picture-- it's a revelation.
Thank you. Thank you.
We all worked so hard.
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.
It was incredible.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Viktor! Is she here?
Hey, Viktor, is she here?
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
- Somebody said she was here.
- Jesus. That's her glass.
Jack Daniels, straight up.
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?
I don't know.
She's...
Is that her by the fountain?
You know, between you and me,
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone's here?
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?
- Simone!
- I got your glass!
- I'm your biggest fan!
- Simone!
Simone!
- Simone!
- Simone?
Get out!
Not you two.
She goes to a major
Hollywood A-list party and we don't get an interview-- a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?
Is that what you're telling me?
Nobody got a photograph.
Nobody ever gets a photograph.
- Our best people are on it, Mr Sayer.
- Get better people!
What about the 24-hour tail on Taransky?
They're camped out every place he goes. Every concierge, every maitre d', they're all on the take.
But this Simone woman is good.
Obviously, that is not her real name.
She uses an assumed identity.
She travels under a false name.
She checks into a hotel under an alias.
Never stays in the same place two nights in a row.
What about the satellite photos? What happened?
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?
What about the fingerprints?
What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite?
Well, we have some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of yours... and none of hers.
No one is that perfect, that pure.
You know, I had something on Mother Teresa once-- and then she died and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
I know how to flush out this Simone woman-- a 'tell-all' story from her childhood.
You have one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Please don't make me do this.
Guard, open this door right now.
- Mr Taransky gave me instructions--
- No!
- What are you doing?
- Mr Taransky!
- Why did you do this?
- We have to talk to her!
- We know she's in there.
- Okay. What is this about?
We've got the tracking numbers for 'Eternity Forever.'
- They're in the toilet.
- She has to get out and sell the film.
What do you want her to do, go door-to-door?
Even Garbo would be on the talk-show circuit if she were alive!
It is precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight
- that people love her!
- This is bullshit!
She is about the work and only the work!
This is overshadowing the work.
- If you can't handle her, I will.
- It's not a good time.
She's emotional.
Today, her mother dies.
Scene 42 of 'Good for Nothing.'
This is not a good time.
- It never is. Step aside!
- We're going in!
- This is ridiculous!
- No! No!
- What are you doing?
- Simone!
I trusted you.
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!
We just want to have a meeting.
We can talk-- girl-to-girl. Just us.
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?
- God, that is so like her.
Where are the cameras?
Viktor, we're not paying for this, are we?
What is all this,
Viktor?
What is all this?
Well...
I suppose... it was gonna come out sooner or later.
I guess I'm actually relieved in a way.
I can just say it finally.
She's a computer-- addict.
What?
She's a computer addict!
She's buried in here.
Day in, day out.
Of course.
I should have guessed.
It's why she never goes anywhere, why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.
- Spends her whole life in chat rooms.
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.
She's extremely agoraphobic.
She has a morbid fear of people, of germs, places, heights-- name it.
This is terrible.
How is she going to plug the film?
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.
Maybe I could get her to do something.
Maybe a television talk show or something.
Yes!
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.
- Live?
- Please.
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.
- We can work with that.
- I can't promise anything.
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.
- Thank you.
- Give her our best.
- That agoraphobia-- it's like a plague.
- It's out of control in Europe.
It's so good of you to protect her like this.
She wanted you-- no, no-- don't touch that.
Germs.
She wanted you to have that.
She was there.
She was right there.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
She didn't, by any chance, happen to mention me?
Actually, she did.
She... she said that she thought you were very beautiful.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Would you want to go and get something to eat, or something?
Viktor, I'd love to, really, but don't you have to go talk to Simone?
If I can find her.
Well...
Alright. Good.
Thanks, Viktor.
Thank you.
I'm gonna-- bye.
Tonight, on
'Frank Brand Live'-- since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie,
'Sunrise, Sunset,' no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet, Simone-- until now.
I'm happy to say that she's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film.
Welcome, Simone.
So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here.
It's my pleasure.
Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
No one can accuse you of being overexposed, Simone.
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
I guess I just think actors talk too much.
I mean, does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday?
Wow.
She is all woman.
Of course, the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more.
Don't I know it.
But the only reason
I'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs-- on Mr Taransky's film.
And you don't secretly want the attention?
I'm not even sure
I deserve it.
You see, after tonight,
I'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies.
Now, how is that healthy for a performer?
Because you have to understand,
Frank, none of this is real.
Who I am on screen and who I really am, they're two totally different people.
Change of topic, Simone.
You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press--
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking,
Fidel Castro, most recently,
Viktor Taransky.
Is there a 'Mr Right' in there somewhere?
You know, Frank, I'd rather not discuss my private life.
But Viktor and I, we are inseparable.
Oh, Viktor.
You dog.
I wouldn't be here today without him.
Would you like a moment, Simone?
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
Then let's talk about this work you care so much about.
Sure. Where would you like to start, Frank?
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.
Nudity's just never been an issue for me.
- I know that tree.
- Clothes are simply an option.
I know that tree.
I know where that is.
What exactly attracted you to your first two projects?
I suppose what I like most about the movies I'm in, is that they're not about special effects.
And they are better for it, I might add.
We appear to be having some satellite difficulties.
But before we lose you completely, Simone,
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Frank.
Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone.
I've been here before.
On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Yeah, look.
It's the exact same tree.
And look in the distance.
The mountain.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Get in the car.
Simone! Simone!
We don't do the photos, you don't get the cover.
It's as simple as that.
Yes. Written answers to written questions.
Didn't we have this conversation before?
Yeah, web site interviews, no problem.
I think people are gonna love
'Eternity Forever.'
'Eternity Forever' is my finest work.
I loved working with the director of 'Eternity Forever.'
- He's a genius.
- You wish.
It's wonderful being a movie star... but there's so many other ways
I want to express myself.
But it's not enough to be a movie star.
You have to be a pop star, too... if you really want to make a difference.
Nice boat, Taransky!
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
You know, I really don't have time for this.
I think you do,
'cause I know it's a fake.
It's bogus.
You used an old library shot of the background.
She never was in New Mexico.
She never even left the studio.
I've done my homework.
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.
I've looked at every piece of publicity she's done.
And as far as I can tell, there's no evidence that she has ever left the studio.
Oh... and for some reason, this woman leaves no paper trail?
Now, I've obtained a copy of your bank account.
I know you have power of attorney, but so far, you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman.
I keep it in the trust.
I know that's what you want people to believe, but I've got to tell you, embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
- Abduction?
- Yeah.
Off the record-- I want to know how you're doing it.
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?
What do you do? Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere?
What is it exactly that you want?
I want to see her.
Unless you show me Simone live and in person,
I show these photos to the authorities.
You want to see her?
Alright.
You've got a deal.
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!
Good!
Mr Taransky.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing in front of 1 00,000 people.
We could've sold this out 20 times.
Yeah, the sound check went great.
The laser show is good to go.
I've got to ask you, though, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.
Well, that's the way she wants it.
After you told us about the death threats, security guards are under strict instructions
- not to take their eyes off the crowd.
- Excellent.
Here, Simone wanted you to have these.
Unreal.
Remember-- no cameras, no binoculars.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone-- live on stage for the debut concert of the 'Splendid Isolation' Tour.
Let's get you into hair and makeup.
No.
No.
Yes.
You know, it's easier to make 1 00,000 believe than just one?
And now, the one, the only-- Simone!
I love you...
...L.A.
It's great to be here.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "
" Before the day
I met you "
" Life was so unkind "
" But you're the key to my peace of mind "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" Oh, baby, what you've done to me "
" Done to me "
" You made me feel so good inside "
" Good inside "
" And I just wanna be "
" Wanna be "
" Close to you, you make me feel so alive "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" Like a natural woman "
" You make me feel "
- " You make me feel "
- " You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a real... "
" You make me feel "
" Feel like a... "
" You make me feel like a real... "
Thank you.
Never stop believing.
Yeah! Simone!
" What you've done to me... "
" Natural woman. "
I said I didn't want to be disturbed!
Viktor.
My two favourite girls in all the world.
- We stopped by to congratulate Simone.
- Well, you know... she's lying down.
She's exhausted.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Listen, thank Simone for the tickets, okay?
That's a good colour on you.
It was a great show, Dad.
I can't believe she's doing this.
Taking advantage of him this way.
- It's cruel.
- Why?
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.
Viktor won't be able to take that, he's too sensitive.
This'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realise that you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Elaine, I'm starting to feel like I don't exist.
Dad?
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.
So how's your love life?
I do okay.
What about you?
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.
I noticed.
You know I don't like to get between you and Mum, but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.
I don't have a relationship with Simone.
I know, but Mum doesn't.
Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.
Dinner?
I don't know about dinner.
That'd be difficult,
I think.
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Well, I'll think of something.
The escalating violence, tragic loss of human life, and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?
- My God. Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--
- Where are you?
- I'm right here... beside you.
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.
- Hi!
- Hi.
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you, but I'm on my way to see Viktor right now.
Simone, I know what's going on between you two.
Oh? No. Oh, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing.
It's strictly a working relationship.
I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him.
Well, we have a daughter together.
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.
I'm in love with the camera.
Simone, I recognise the coat you're wearing.
I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Oh, Christ.
Elaine, I just--
Whoa!
God! Oh my God!
I tell ya.
- Are you alright?
- This does look awful. I know that.
But, Viktor, he's just so crazy about you.
- Could you go to the Oscars with him?
- No, no, no.
If you won't do it for him,
I ask you, please, do it for me.
Okay, okay. For you.
For you I'll go.
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.
Alright, I'm glad that we talked.
- Oh, yes. Bye.
- Bye!
Goodbye.
Oh!
And the winner of 'Best Actress'... is... oh my goodness.
We have a tie.
The winners are Simone for 'Sunrise, Sunset'...
Thank you.
...and Simone for 'Eternity Forever.'
Unfortunately, Simone cannot be with us here tonight, but thanks to the miracle of modern technology, she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Ladies and gentlemen--
Simone!
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
This means so much to me.
I'm just sorry I couldn't be there with you.
First, I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees.
I don't even feel I belong in the 'Best Actress' category, let alone with these wonderful human beings.
And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio, of course.
And as always,
I dedicate this to Hank, without whom none of this would be possible.
I love you, Hank, wherever you are.
Thank you.
Who's Hank?
Her agent?
- Her father.
- Oh.
Why didn't she thank you?
She did.
Didn't she?
No.
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Why didn't I say it?
How could I forget to say it?
I wrote it.
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,
Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
Excuse me, Mr Taransky, are you ready for your casting session?
Nicola is here for the role of Simone's sister.
Viktor.
So much has happened since we last saw each other.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on 'Sunrise.'
Oh, that's okay.
I know. I understand.
When I saw what Simone did with the role,
I mean, I fired all my people.
I went into rehab.
I took some acting classes.
I changed my whole look.
She really, really inspired me.
Would you like me to read?
Oh, sure.
That would be good.
'Who do you think you are, Carlos, coming in here like this?
My husband's sleeping in the next room.
You think
I won't call out?
Do you think
I'll just... give in to you without a fight, like I did the last time and the time before that?
I wish you were dead.
I wish we were both dead.'
Oh... that was just wonderful.
Wonderful acting.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
Isn't that
Simone's part?
Of course.
Of course it is.
You have such a beautiful line, right, right there.
It's not a wrinkle, or anything, it's like a dimple.
Right when you smile, it--
I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Cosmetically altering
Simone to look like me?
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.
That would be crazy.
Yes-- that would be nuts.
Would you like me to try something different with this, or do it again?
No, it's fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Viktor.
Happy birthday, Lainey.
What do you think?
It's fantastic.
It's what she drove in 'Eternity Forever.'
- I know.
- See?
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.
You know, you won't be able to drive it till you get your permit, but you can take it around the lot, okay?
Here.
What's the matter?
I can't accept it.
Why? Why, honey?
I don't want a car, Dad.
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
The old Viktor Taransky.
I can't stand to see you like this-- clinging to Simone's coattails.
It used to be all about the work and now it's all about her.
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Oh, no, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.
Can't you see what she's done to you?
She's taking advantage.
Mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone.
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.
She told me she wanted to look at my script next week.
- Jane?
- Got to go.
I'm leaving early.
If anybody needs me,
I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone.
Elaine Christian, please.
Elaine.
Hi.
Hi.
I was in the neighbourhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.
You don't use the front door anymore?
Uh... no.
When is she coming over?
- About now.
- Oh.
Okay. I'll just stay until she gets here.
Well, she's... already here.
What?
Elaine...
Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night.
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.
Oh, Viktor!
Wait! Viktor!
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?
I can't compete with Simone.
- Well...
- What woman can?
I'd rather have you than Simone.
- Believe me.
- Oh. That's so sweet.
No, but I can't let you do that-- make that kind of sacrifice.
- No. No.
- God, this is strange.
You know, I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am.
- But--
- You have?
Well, it goes with the territory.
But for some reason,
I can't betray Simone.
I can't. There's a goodness to her, Viktor.
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.
You say that now, but in the morning
- you would go back to her.
- No. No.
- You would, Viktor.
- She's gonna retire.
- She'll never work again.
- Her public will demand that she does.
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?
I'm gonna tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone isn't a real person.
I invented her.
Every actor is an invention.
- Elaine--
- Please.
You're lucky she's loyal enough to stay with you.
Maybe she's staying out of pity.
Who knows? I mean, she certainly doesn't need you.
Listen, she's thin air.
- She's pixels.
- What?
Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation
I inherited from a madman.
How much have you had to drink?
There is no Simone.
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?
I've done the impossible.
I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being-- a human soul.
I have taken nothing, and made it something.
I have breathed life into a machine.
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.
As God is my judge,
I swear.
I made Simone.
I made her.
- You made Simone?
- Yes.
Viktor... she made you.
You bitch.
I'll destroy you.
Bravo!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Had a rough night?
Let's see if they still love you after this.
You made me?
I made you first.
Well, we're back on 'Good Morning, Good Day,' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone.
Simone, before the break you were taking a rather controversial position.
I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range.
How else can the children learn to defend themselves?
If there is a hole in the ozone layer, how come I can't see it?
Immigration? God!
Isn't it crowded enough?
But God created furry animals to be worn.
Have you ever tasted dolphin?
Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel?
Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes.
But look at the benefits.
I mean, you don't eat as much.
And you've got something to hold in your hand.
We always knew Simone wasn't like other celebrities.
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.
She certainly does.
It's plastic, Hank.
I know that's the way you'd want it.
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's killing me.
She's a serial killer.
But I don't know how to stop her.
I mean, she's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean-- you know, make some confession-- because...
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.
I just can't put the genie back in the bottle, because... if she suddenly stopped working, you know, just dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.
I tried killing her career... but they like her even more.
What am I gonna do?
Not another word, Hank.
You are truly a genius.
Thank you, Hank.
Thank you.
What's the matter,
Viktor?
You look so sad.
Don't you love me anymore?
It's over, isn't it?
I know what you're thinking, Simone.
This is a phoney-baloney world.
We're all living one big lie, so, why shouldn't you live, too?
You're more authentic than all these people who worship you.
And that's the problem.
You're looking at the real fraud.
I told myself this was all about the work.
But if that were the truth, it wouldn't matter to me that you get all the attention.
And it does.
It does.
I'm sorry, Simone.
Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed.
But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist.
It's not that you aren't human--
It's that I am.
I'm sorry, Simone.
It is my sad... and solemn duty... to announce... the tragic passing of Simone.
How did she die?
It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World.
Did she suffer?
Mercifully, it was quick.
I feel awful.
It's a great loss.
You know, we're going to have to restructure your deal.
Can I see you later?
I mean, go away for the weekend?
How could you bring that up at a time like this?
One minute, Mr Taransky.
Oh my God.
This has got to be a mistake.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.
Dad!
Elaine, call Bernard!
That's why it was so light.
I heard him say,
'Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you.'
It was so strange.
He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie.
He's a sick man.
He was a controlling madman.
She was a prisoner.
I blame myself.
I wish I had done more to stop him.
Forgive me,
Mr Taransky.
I'm just trying to understand here.
Now, all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood... all fake? Hmm?
This is fake?
This is fake?
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
- All fake?
- Yes.
You understand perfectly.
So I will confess... to fraud, but not to murder.
And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions, that's also bogus?
No. No.
The fan club's real.
It's just what they were worshipping is a computer code.
Ones and zeroes.
You couldn't have killed Simone because there was no Simone.
- Right. Exactly.
- And this 'Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about, renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead.
Now, perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone, is an invention himself.
Oh, no. No.
This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone!
Look-- even her name is fake.
It's not Simone.
It's 'Sim one'-- see?
'Simulation one'!
It's a computer code!
You really hated her, didn't you?
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr Taransky.
Or is this tape doctored, too?
This is footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question-- altered of course.
Can you tell us why you're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn't exist?
Well, it's not her body.
It's her body-- of work.
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.
Viktor, I know.
Look. Look. Look.
Why don't you just come clean? Huh?
Just tell the truth, you're gonna feel better afterwards.
I'm telling the truth, and I don't feel so good.
Hey, we all know what happened.
In a fit of jealous rage, you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat...
- Don't say that.
- ...that she bought for you.
I did--
I can prove--
I can prove it to you.
Let me just take you there.
I'll take you to the spot.
I can prove it.
Here. Here. Come on.
We can just go there, can't we?
- Let's go. I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Good work.
Now you'll see.
What is this?
No, there's drives and discs.
Where are the discs? You have to go back down and get them.
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!
- Please!
- Sit him down.
You must go down and get the drives.
Hey, you see what's down there?
Plead guilty.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
It's the best deal you're gonna get.
I could get the death penalty.
Yeah. Yeah. You certainly will if you go to trial.
A jury, in this kind of ugly mood-- you killed an icon, for God's sake.
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!
Bernard,
I didn't kill anyone.
Viktor, come on, it's in the paper.
There's no one to kill.
Bernard,
I'm a filmmaker.
I was trying to say something.
I wanted recognition.
I wanted to be appreciated... so I created her.
Bernard, there's no one to kill.
Do you understand?
An insanity defence.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
- What are you doing?
- 'I created her.'
Viktor! Jesus!
Jesus Christ, Viktor!
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?
- Get me out!
- Viktor!
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!
Why can't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore, huh?
You know, I can almost forgive him for killing her.
But to deny her existence?
I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it just as surely as you're sitting there.
She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Yeah-- Lainey, what are you getting at?
I'm the head of a major studio.
Do you think
I'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met?
No. No. I mean, really meet her-- like in the flesh?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, Mum, but when I think about it honestly, I haven't.
I've never really seen Simone up close... touched her.
Been in her physical presence.
Have you?
We don't want to believe Daddy because we don't want to believe that we were taken in too.
But, Lainey... there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Listen to what you're saying, Mum.
I mean, is there any evidence that she is?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- What's that?
- Part of Dad's story may be true.
Simone may have contracted a virus.
Certain viruses can be cured.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Listen to me.
There's a psychiatrist in Ventura, well-respected, who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity... due to the trauma of your divorce,
1 0 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child.
No more.
I can't go along with this horseshit.
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.
No. No.
Viktor, come on.
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.
It was premeditated!
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her...
I bludgeoned her...
I set her on fire, and then I killed her!
- I did it!
- Excuse me.
I think you better see this.
Breaking news-- international media star Simone is alive and well.
Her studio released this footage, just minutes ago.
Simone reading today's edition of 'The LA Times.'
Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary?
Details at the top of the hour.
She's indestructible.
He's coming.
Viktor.
Oh, Viktor.
Oh, honey.
I don't know what you did or how you did it,
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.
But don't thank us too fast.
You know what we have to do now?
What?
Well, why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You have to finish what you started.
We can do it together.
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?
Where are we going?
Well, I was thinking... how about you and Simone, moving in with me and Lainey?
That's wonderful.
- What do you think, Lainey?
- About you and Mum?
Well, about me and Simone-- what I did-- everything.
I'm sorry.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, Dad.
We're fine with fake... as long as you don't lie about it.
Oh, come on, Viktor.
It's not a death sentence.
No. It's life.
Hey, Viktor, remember us?
We probably never met.
I'm Milton. How are you?
Max Sayer from 'The Echo.'
- Hi!
- It's life.
Just call. Five minutes.
All we need is five minutes.
Good evening, and welcome.
Simone, the question on everybody's mind is simply... 'Why?'
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in this fish bowl-- the insatiable appetite of the media-- with everything that was going on in my life,
I just needed to drop out of sight for a while.
I needed time, and Viktor bought me that time.
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.
But now I understand you're eager to get back to work, and it's not the kind of work we were all expecting.
It's true.
I can reveal I am considering a career in politics.
And what, may I ask, brought this on?
I suppose this little man had something to do with it.
- That beautiful baby?
- Yes.
You see, Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son, 'Chip,' is going to grow up in.
Aren't you, Viktor?
Oh, yes.
Hi.
Oh yes.
" Looking out on the morning rain "
" I used to feel so inspired "
" And when I knew
I had to face another day "
" Lord, it made me feel so tired "
" Before the day
I met you "
" Life was so unkind "
" You're the key to my peace of mind "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a natural woman "
" When my soul was in the lost and found "
" You came along to claim it "
" I didn't know what was wrong with me "
" Till your kiss helped me name it "
" Now I'm no longer doubtful to what I'm living for "
" And if I make you happy,
I don't need to do more "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a natural woman "
" Woman "
" Oh, baby, what you've done to me "
" Done to me "
" You made me feel so good inside "
" Good inside "
" And I just wanna be "
" Wanna be "
" Close to you, you make me feel so alive "
" 'Cause you make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a natural woman "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel "
" You make me feel like a real... "
" You make me feel "
" Feel like I'm real... "
" You make me feel like a real... "
She likes chicken pot pie... just like me.
Ladies and gentlemen, l would now like to introduce a legend in our industry.
She's the most successful president in the history of our network and for the past five years has kept us at the very top of the ratings.
She's our maverick, our wild card, and today she's gonna take us right to the edge.
Please welcome a giant, a genius and the hardest-working person in television: Joanna Eberhart.
Way to go, Joanna!
Thank you all so much. Thank you.
Joanna!
That feels good, especially coming from such a fantastic group of people from all across our great nation, our network affiliates.
Give yourselves a great big hand.
You deserve it.
And l want a big, fat Christmas bonus.
Just kidding, but not really, because...
...l am so excited, l am so on fire, l am so guts-and-glory passionate about what l am about to show you.
So get ready, because on Monday nights the whole world will be watching a man, a woman and a buzzer!
Are you ready for the final gender challenge?
- Who makes more money?
- l do.
Who enters lronman triathlons every year and wins? l do.
Who secretly wishes they were married to a hot, sexy lesbian?
- l do!
- l do! lt's Tara!
And...
...on Thursdays...
No, this is not just a TV show.
No, this is a breakthrough, a breakout, a break-all-the-rules and bring-on-the-Emmys mega-smash!
Yes!
Can l present to you this planet's ultimate reality phenomenon?
I Can Do Better!
We wiII aII be right there
as happiIy-married coupIes
are fIown first cIass to
a tropicaI isIand paradise
where they wiII be compIeteIy
surrounded by professionaI prostitutes.
And at the end of the week...
WeII, Iet's take a peek.
Well, it's been a week, and Hank, our personnel manager from Omaha, has spent the entire seven days with Vanessa, our call girl and exotic dancer.
Yeah, it's been amazing.
And l'll admit we've had some fun in the hot tub and all.
But you wanna know something,
Billy?
All we did was talk...
...because l love my wife...
...and the only place l want to be is back in Omaha with my Barbara.
Tough break, Nessa.
And Barbara, you spent Monday with Rocky, our bodybuilder and male escort,
Tuesday through Thursday with the entire cast of the XXX film Hung Jury, and you spent the entire weekend with Tonkiro.
And now it's time for the final decision. Barbara, it's yours to make. ls it gonna be Omaha?
Or ''Oma-hunks''?
Well...
...before l came on this show l only had sex with one man, and that was usually Hank. l love Hank deeply and forever with all my heart, and l would never do anything to hurt him.
But l can do better!
The battle of the sexes, as old as time but as--
Why?
- Excuse me?
- Why did you do it?
Oh, my God, it's Hank from I Can Do Better!
Hank, everyone.
No, stop it. l love Barbara. l had a family. l had a life.
Hank, l know it hurts.
Love isn't easy.
Relationships aren't easy, not for anyone.
But now you know the truth about Barbara, and you are gonna move on with your life.
And you're gonna meet someone wonderful, and America is gonna love you.
Yeah. l've got a great idea for another hot new show.
Well, tell it to us. lt's called...
- ...Let's KiII AII the Women.
- He's got a gun!
- Joanna, are you all right?
- l am great.
Raring to go. The police were sensational. And not a scratch.
- You haven't heard?
- About what?
That man, Hank.
Right before he tried to kill you, he went to see his ex-wife and five of her new boyfriends.
- He did?
- He shot all of them.
The wife is in critical condition, and four of the guys are on life support.
- Tonkiro?
- He's fine.
- Thank God.
- So you know what this means.
Of course.
We pay for all of their medical treatment, every penny.
We get them the very best therapist, childcare, rehab, whatever they need, and then we fly them to New York, first class, for a prime-time special,
Hank and Barbara:
Let the HeaIing Begin.
You're not listening.
We can't wear this. The lawsuits alone may bankrupt the network.
And all your new shows, the whole lineup, the affiliates won't touch them.
We have shareholders.
We can't let you sink the network.
But we wish you only the best.
Of course.
Thank you for being so classy and taking this so well.
Joanna, we just wanted to say that this is so not fair.
Goodbye, everybody!
All the best!
Jo?
Walter.
- What happened?
- Well, you've had a complete nervous collapse.
And the doctors say there's a lot of work to do, but you're gonna be just fine.
Oh, and Pete made this for you.
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- lsn't it?
And l wanted you to know that the minute l heard the news, l called the network and l quit.
- You did that for me?
- Of course. l know l was only a vice president, but l could never work for those people, not after the way they treated you.
Oh, Walter...
And do you remember what today is? lt's our anniversary.
Oh, Walter...
...l'm so sorry.
Maybe that man who tried to shoot me, maybe he was right.
Maybe l've become the wrong kind of woman.
Maybe l've made all of the wrong decisions.
Could we get away and start over?
And get it right, our marriage?
- But why are we moving?
- To Connecticut?
We're moving so that we can all kick back and have a great new life in this beautiful new town.
- Name?
- Kresby.
- Welcome to Stepford.
- Thanks.
- What do you think, guys?
- Cool.
- Good.
- Honey?
Hello, everyone. l'm Mrs. Wellington.
Welcome to Stepford. l'm with Stepford Realty.
We spoke on the phone.
- You must be Walter.
- So nice to meet you in person.
And the little ones. l bet you're Pete.
- Duh.
- Pete.
And he's every bit as handsome as his dad.
Thank you.
And Kimberly, aren't you just the cutest little bug's ear.
Bugs don't have ears. lsn't she sassy, and a little sad.
And this must be Joanna.
- Electroshock?
- But she's doing great.
Hello, little Energizer.
The minute Walter called, l knew this was the perfect house for you. lt's the top of the line here at Stepford Estates, and it's got everything an American family could ever need.
- And may l present to you...
- Look at this.
- This is amazing.
- ...the great room. l call it cozy.
And it's also a smart house. Now, this controls the security system.
- AII secure.
- lt talks to the refrigerator.
We need juice, we need juice,
we need juice.
The system also monitors all the commodes.
Where it will test your urine for blood sugar, protein and body fat.
FIush toiIets. lsn't that great, kids?
- l'm gonna go check my room.
- Me too.
Now, Walter, will you be commuting?
No.
No, Joanna and l both left the network.
Oh, look, it's the puppy.
Robo Rover 3000. Come on, boy.
Come on, come on, come on.
Joanna.
The town is over 200 years old. lt was founded by George Washington, and Martha just loved it.
Stepford is Connecticut's family paradise. lt has no crime, no poverty and no pushing.
What is that? Up on the hill?
Well, that's our Stepford Men's Association.
Where all our wonderful guys can get together and stay out of our hair.
Am l right?
- Where do the women go?
- To the Simply Stepford Day Spa.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Claire. l would like you all to welcome our newest citizen to Stepford: Joanna.
Good morning, Joanna.
- Are we ready to work out?
- Oh, yes.
Places and poles, please.
Wait, you work out dressed like this?
Well, of course. Whatever we do, we always want to look our very best. l mean, why, imagine if our husbands saw us in worn, dark, urban sweat clothes with stringy hair and almost no makeup?
Oh, good heavens.
Now, today you are in for a special treat because we are working on a series of exercises which l've personally invented, based on simple household tasks. l call my program Clairobics.
Because her name is Claire.
All right, now it's time to slim and scrub.
Let's all be washing machines.
And...
And...
Come on, Joanna.
Spin cycle, ladies, and...
And...
And...
And...
- Sweet.
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Who's the man?
You the man.
Thank you, dear.
Walter?
- Hey, how you doing?
- Walter Kresby.
- Good to see you.
- Ted Van Sant. l'm Stan Peters.
Come on in, come on in.
- Mike said you were coming.
- Nice to see you.
Come on in.
Hear ye, hear ye. Come one,
come aII, and happy Fourth of JuIy.
At 1:30 wiII be the chiIdren's
Stars and Stripes, face painting... lsn't this great?
A real old-fashioned town picnic.
Can't get this in Manhattan.
Which is why we're gonna stay exactly ten minutes.
We're gonna make an appearance, and then we're gonna get out of here.
Kids, l'm really sorry about all of this, but let's try and have fun.
Mom, it's a picnic.
- Chill.
- Go ahead, go ahead, have fun.
Ten minutes?
Walter, you just don't get it.
These women are like deranged-flight-attendant friendly.
- They're gonna be all over me.
- Joanna!
Here we go.
- Oh, Joanna.
- Joanna, hi.
- Hi, Walter.
- Hi.
- You look great.
- l love you in khakis.
They're new, a little experiment.
Now l know why they call it
Banana Republic.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Am l the only one who finds all of this more than a little disturbing?
We are celebrating our nation's birthday, but there are almost no
African-Americans, no Native Americans, no Asian Americans, and... Oh, my God.
Hey, you're Joanna Eberhart.
You got such a raw deal.
Aren't you Bobbie Markowitz? l love your books, especially the last one. What was it called? lt was about your relationship with your mother.
- I Love You But PIease Die.
- Hey, baby. Baby.
Look what l did, look.
Happy Fourth of July, everybody.
Excuse me. ls this guy bothering you?
- Yes, he's my husband.
- Hey Kresbo-Man.
- Hey, Dave.
- How do you know each other?
- Men's Association.
- That place.
- Did you finish the laundry?
- No, l finished a chapter.
- Did you make the sandwiches?
- Did you?
- Where are the kids?
- What kids?
Our kids.
- Hey, are you two OK?
- We're fine.
- Come on, l need a cookie.
- See what l mean?
Jerry... Jerry, it's a bake sale, an actual bake sale. lt's like some heavenly diorama at the Smithsonian in the Hall of Homemakers.
Oh, no. No, stop it.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
That is not cobbler.
Roger, could we...? Could we reel it in, like, a couple of hundred yards?
How do you ladies keep your figures? ls there just a huge vat of cobbler vomit somewhere?
- But worth it?
- Roger.
Oh, l'm sorry.
- That is...
- This is fabulous.
Jerry thinks that l overdo, you know, everything.
Excuse me, aren't you
Roger Bannister?
The amazing architect from The Times?
Oh, thank you. This is Jerry Harmon.
- Hi.
- Corporate attorney.
But he's getting the help that he needs.
- Stop it.
- You stop it.
- We're new.
- Oh, my God, Joanna Eberhart.
- l love the shows.
- Oh, thank you.
And Bobbie Markowitz.
Love the books.
Jerry, how did this happen?
Where did you come from? l mean, right here in Stepford.
People.
Attention, attention,
Fourth of July funsters, grab your partners because it's time for some sizzling Stepford square dancing, so come on in.
- Square dancing?
- Cowgirls?
- We're in hell.
- Come on, Bobbie.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
OK, everybody ready to kick up your heels for some barn-busting Stepford high-stepping?
OK.
Bow to your partners
Lose your cares
- There you go.
- Stepford staIIions Iove their mares
AII men Ieft, aII men right
Rope that fiIIy, she won't bite
AII join hands and circIe sweet
PIease your cowboy with your feet
- Nice shirt, Stan.
- Thanks.
Yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay,
- yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay,
- Honey.
- yippee-ki-yay, yippee-ki-yay.
- Calm down.
Do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do,
- Whoa, back up, guy.
- do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do...
Jesus.
Do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- ls she all right?
- lt's OK.
- Excuse me.
- Do-si-do.
- All right. OK. Don't try to move her.
- She's drunk.
- There's no need, thank you.
- She's blond.
- l'm her husband.
- Do-si-do.
- Jo, you're not a doctor.
Walter, l can take care of this. l ran a network.
Walter, l can take care of this. l ran a network.
- Somebody call 91 1 .
- Mike's here.
Mike.
- Mike.
- Do-si-do.
Do-si-do, do-si-do, do-si-do.
- Mike.
- lt's OK. l'm here.
Walter, the missus.
- The missus?
- Jo, Jo.
Walter, what is your problem?
- Excuse me.
- Stand back, please.
- Hey! Excuse...
- Excuse me.
- What was that?
- Herb, Dave, give me a hand, and we'll get
Sarah right into my Hummer.
- Your Hummer?
- lt's a sweet ride.
- lt's roomy.
- Here you go.
We need an ambulance.
You shouldn't be moving her.
She might need oxygen, paramedics.
Everything isn't always about you, Jo.
Walter.
She'll be fine. lt's too much sun.
She's dehydrated.
- Dehydrated? Are you crazy?
- Jo. l'm sorry about this, Mike.
Joanna. Joanna, this is a very special moment.
- l would like you to meet...
- Mike Wellington.
My husband.
- Oh...
- And you must be the famous Joanna.
You're even prettier than in the newspapers.
- They don't do you justice.
- Excuse me, that woman is very sick.
Thank you. l should be going with her.
She'll get all the help she needs.
Trust me, little lady.
That woman had a seizure, and she was practically levitating.
And l have told you five million times l phoned Herb.
He said that Sarah is fine.
She just needed some fluids, just like Mike said.
- She was sparking, Walter.
- She was dancing.
Then why wasn't there a doctor anywhere? And why...?
Why...?
Walter! Walter!
And why did everyone just automatically listen to that Mike person?
And why, why was everyone just standing there?
You mean why weren't they just listening to you?
- That's not what l'm saying!
- Jesus Christ, Joanna!
- What?
- You were fired, your kids barely know you, and our marriage is falling apart.
And your whole attitude makes people want to kill you. lt makes people try to kill you.
That's what we're doing here.
The people in this town have been nothing but friendly and welcoming and wonderful to you.
And you've been nothing but snide and suspicious.
And on top of that, at the picnic you humiliated me.
Well, l can't do it anymore. l can't keep fighting you for every inch of everything. Game over.
- Marriage over.
- Oh, no!
- No!
- No what?
Please don't go.
- Why not?
- Because you're right.
Wait, l'm sorry. l don't think l heard that. What did you just say? l said, you're right.
About?
About everything.
About me.
Do you know why l signed on at the network?
Because l thought that if l was around, l could help you lighten up.
You did?
Yeah, l did. What was that one show called?
I Can Do Everybody?
See, that's what l mean. l wanted to make you laugh.
That's so sweet, but l... l was busy. l was running a network, Walter.
You were so busy that we haven't made love in over a year.
- l know. l...
- Well, l miss you.
But l've always loved you so much. l...
You know that.
Why?
Because... Because...
...you're goofy, and you're...
You're handsome, and you're...
You're...
You're my Walter.
And because when you play computer chess you do that little...
- You do that little victory dance.
- l do not. l don't do that.
- Yes, you do.
- No, l don't.
But if l'm not the smartest and the best of the best and the most successful, then l don't know, who am l?
You wanna find out?
How?
First of all, we're in the country now, so no more black.
- No more black? Are you insane?
- You heard me.
Only high-powered, neurotic, castrating,
Manhattan career bitches wear black. ls that what you wanna be?
Ever since l was a little girl.
Do l really look OK?
Can l be honest?
- You look kind of like Betty Crocker.
- l know.
- At Betty Ford.
- We need miIk.
- We need miIk. We need miIk.
- Thank you.
Look, l'm trying to make an effort to change. l mean, last night my husband was a different person.
He was strong, he was forceful, he was commanding.
Like your refrigerator.
Well, nobody said it was gonna be easy being a homemaker and a stay-at-home mom. lt's the toughest job in the world, right?
Well, that may be, but these
Stepford women,
- they're a whole other dimension.
- Oh, like yesterday, that poor lady, Sarah Sunderson.
Walter said she's fine.
But you said she was shooting off sparks from her ears.
- Now, that's the first sign.
- Of what?
Cheap jewelry.
- We should go see her.
- Why?
Because we need to be supportive.
That's how people behave outside of Manhattan.
They care about each other. l mean, if you were in New York and one of your neighbors got sick
- what would you do?
- We'd call her.
- To see if she was gonna die.
- So we could get the apartment.
Let's go. Up. Up. Up.
Sarah?
- Yoo-hoo.
- Yoo-hoo? ls she in there?
- What are you doing?
- lt's open.
- That's amazing.
- So sweet.
And so trusting.
Roger.
Roger.
- Look at this place.
- Wow.
- Sarah?
- Sarah?
Roger.
Oh, Herb.
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
- Make me beg!
- Yeah!
Oh, l'm so lucky!
- Oh, my God.
- ls that a DVD?
No, it's them.
Oh, you're the king!
Yes!
- l'm going up there.
- Why?
- Roger!
- l want some.
- Roger.
- Roger.
- Baby, grab me some nachos.
- Yes, dear.
What's this?
- Roger, put it down.
- What? Oh, come on.
- Roger.
- Why does it say Sarah?
Roger, you should put it down now.
- Let's get out of here.
- This isn't our house.
Oh, stop. Would you just quit?
- We have to, Roger.
- For God's sake, we're trespassing.
We have to get out of here.
- Put it down. Come on.
- OK, let's try and use this.
We have to go. l'm so embarrassed. l'm mortified. l'm famished.
- Bobbie.
- Yeah?
- Are you making anthrax?
- Excuse me. l've been busy. My new book.
But can't you hire someone to clean?
Someone brave?
Dave says l got to do it myself, like Sarah Sunderson.
- Oh, could you believe her?
- But, darling, her home is spotless.
And she's having incredible sex in the middle of the day with her husband.
Well, l'm sorry, but my shrink says l need creative chaos.
- My therapist says l need boundaries.
- My doctor said l need enough electricity to jumpstart Vegas.
- You ever done Zoloft?
- Kid stuff.
Xanax. l worship Xanax. l'm old-fashioned. l like Prozac with a Viagra chaser.
You're up, and you're up.
- Oh, Roger.
- Viagra.
Hey, is there something that you need to tell us?
Well... Sharing.
OK. OK.
Jerry and l have been in couple's counseling...
...for over a year...
...and finally... Finally, l just couldn't take it anymore. l howled,
''You've become a gay Republican.''
And he said,
''What's wrong with that?'' l said, ''What's wrong with that?
''That's like wanting to be gay with a bad haircut.''
Exactly.
So the counselor suggested that we move to the 'burbs.
- To find a balance.
- We moved here as a last resort.
Court order. Don't ask.
OK. l know this is unthinkable, but what if we could actually learn how to be happy...
...without Paxil or compulsive overeating?
What if we actually gave this whole thing a try for real, the whole Stepford thing?
- Hey, yeah!
- Only one can survive.
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!
- Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!
- Come on, Kresbo baby.
- Zeus! Zeus!
- Rip her bra off!
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Zeus rules the universe!
And Ted owes Walter
20 big ones!
Ah, to be a man.
So, Walt, you and Stepford, it seems like a real match. l'll say. l mean, the town and the houses. This place.
Well, it's like a dream. lt's like...
Like the way life was meant to be.
And all of your wives.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. They're so... So...
Sweet?
Sizzling?
Super fine?
Well...
We are all so thrilled to be here at the Stepford Book Club, l can't tell you.
Now, l have just finished the third volume of Robert Caro's
Life of Lyndon Johnson, and l am dying for the next installment.
Well...
That's all marvelous, but today we are going to discuss...
Well, it is probably the most important book any of us will ever read.
Yes, it is provocative, but it is also inspiring.
The Heritage Hills Special Edition
Golden Deluxe Treasury of Christmas Keepsakes
and CoIIectibIes.
This book said to me,
''Let's celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ with yarn.''
Now, Bobbie, we all realize you're probably feeling a bit uncomfortable with this week's book because you're...
- Oh, what's the word l'm looking for?
- New?
- Scared?
- Cranky?
- Jewish.
- Same thing.
But the Heritage Hill series is very inclusive. ln fact, there is a whole chapter about Hanukkah. l just love the chapter on pinecones.
They're not just for wreaths and centerpieces.
You can use pinecones to create a very special Yuletide menorah.
Your pinecone snowman could be Jewish.
Just add one of those little beanies.
Or maybe l could just use hundreds of pinecones to spell out the words ''Big Jew'' in letters 1 5 feet tall in the snow in my front yard.
That's a wonderful idea.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- That's very wonderful.
- Yes.
- She's so smart. l love the idea of creating a life-sized Santa Claus,
- all out of pinecones.
- OK, l love that. l'm going to use a pinecone in my nativity as the baby Jesus.
And l'm going to attach a pinecone to my vibrator and have a really merry
Christmas.
Here comes Santa CIaus
Here comes Santa CIaus
Right down Santa CIaus Lane
He's got a bag that's fiIIed with toys
For the boys and girIs again
Hear those sIeigh beIIs jingIe jangIe
What a beautifuI sight
So jump in bed, cover up your head
Because Santa CIaus comes tonight
- Who?
- Santa CIaus comes tonight
Joanna, how is she fitting in?
Well...
OK... l'm among friends, right?
- Of course.
- Yeah.
So...
Joanna and l had this big talk, and we were really open with each other. l mean, we really got it all out.
And l think from now on...
...she's gonna be very, very different.
You think Joanna's really going to change?
Yes, l do. Absolutely.
And how long have you been married?
- Ted!
- Yes.
Don't you owe Walter $20?
That's absolutely right, l do.
Babe!
Yes, darling?
Walt, sit down. l need 20.
- You know my PlN.
- Of course.
She gives singles.
Are these all for day camp tomorrow? l just want you to be proud of me, honey.
Dad, watch this.
Ball.
- Aren't robots cool?
- Oh, yeah.
May l speak to the man of the house?
- Snot-butt.
- Funkmaster Markowitz.
- Stone-cold Thriller Killer Kresbo.
- Cupcakes, anyone?
- Cupcakes!
- Cupcakes.
Hey, right on time.
Jo, these are smoking.
- Why don't you make stuff like this?
- Why don't you?
Because l have a penis.
- We should get moving.
- Yeah, we got a meeting.
- At the Men's Association.
- When will you be home, honey?
When l'm home.
Call a sitter.
Bobbie, are you sure about this?
We're not spying. We're just visiting.
Fellas, l can't tell you how happy we are to welcome all of this new blood.
- You said it, Mike.
- That's right. l love, love this space. lt's very Ralph Lauren meets
Sherlock Holmes. lt says, ''l have taste and a scrotum.''
- Roger, you promised.
- What?
- Whore.
- Bore.
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.
Jerry, you're gonna find that
Stepford is very open-minded.
- Oh, yeah.
- We welcome you and your partner, just like any other couple.
Absolutely. Any other.
- That's right.
- Girlfriend.
Miss... Miss Thing.
- To Stepford!
- Stepford!
You bet.
Yeah.
Damn. Come on, let's go.
You think this is all right, sneaking around?
Add it up.
All the women around here are perfect sex-kitten bimbos.
All the men are drooling nerds.
- Doesn't that seem strange?
- Not to me.
- Why not?
- l work in television.
Oh, come on.
You know, Walter, l think Joanna is right.
- l think Stepford is the answer.
- She's a great gal.
Or she will be.
- Come on, help me up.
- We shouldn't be here.
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a chicken.
- l should be home with my cupcakes.
- Why?
Because you only made
5,000 of them?
- We're trespassing.
- Only if we get caught.
Damn, l can't see a thing.
Oh, there's the light.
There it is.
No, Bobbie.
This is like some alien freak show.
Why? They're just family portraits.
Yeah, that's what l said.
The lights.
We should get out of here.
Should we run?
Oh, my God.
Clarice?
- Hi, girls!
- Roger!
You scared us.
- What are you doing in here?
- What's going on?
Do they have hookers or old PIayboys or cable porn?
Oh, please.
They barely have throw pillows.
- They're coming.
- The menfolk.
- Call us.
- OK.
Rog?
What was it?
Did you see anyone?
Not a soul.
But what's back here anyway, in all of these rooms?
Storage? Sweaters?
Bodies?
- Jerry.
- Do you see that door on your left?
Check it out.
Oh, boy.
Why, l can't see anything. lt's dark.
Use your flashlight. l feel like Nancy Drew in
The Mystery of the Mid-Iife Crisis.
What am l looking for?
Look down.
Jerry?
Roger!
Roger!
- Bobbie.
- Roger!
- Bobbie?
- Roger!
Roger said there was nothing going on at the Men's Association.
Well, then why doesn't he answer the phone?
- lt's been two days.
- Bobbie.
Roger!
Roger! lsn't that his favorite shirt, the Dolce & Gabbana?
The Guccis.
- And the Versace.
- Maybe he's donating them.
To what? The gay homeless?
He loved this.
His program from Hairspray.
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
Viggo.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. l'm Jerry Harmon, and l... l know l'm pretty new here, but already l feel so at home.
Why did Jerry ask us to meet him here?
Proud that l can introduce Stepford's brand-new candidate for state senate.
Ladies and gentlemen, l give you Mr. Roger Bannister.
What?
He's wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You may very well ask, what are my qualifications for higher office?
Well, l believe in Stepford, America and the power of prayer.
Values l've discovered thanks to my partner, in life and in the Lord,
Jerry Harmon.
Roger. Roger.
Yes. ls there a question?
Mrs. Markowitz?
So you two are happy now?
More than ever. Because now l know that being gay doesn't mean a guy has to be effeminate or flamboyant or sensitive.
- l'm no sissy.
- No.
- Way to go, Roger!
- That's a man!
- Roger?
- Yes. Mrs. Walter Kresby.
Roger, l don't understand.
You were out there, you were Roger.
And now...
Now you're different.
Your hair, your clothes.
- You're like someone else.
- People change.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.
So that's why we have to leave Stepford?
- l'm not following.
- OK.
Before, Roger was witty and stylish and ironic.
- And l'm sure he still is.
- No.
Now he's making speeches in a Brooks Brothers suit.
Hey, there's lots of ways to be gay.
Don't try to make him into a stereotype.
Bobbie is right, and she's leaving too.
This place does something to people.
All of the women are always busy and perfect and smiling, and all of the men are always happy.
- And that's a problem because...?
- Because it's not normal, Walter. lt's... lt's not the world. lt's not us.
And l'm picking up our kids from camp right now, and we're getting out of here.
With or without you.
Secure.
You'll never change, will you?
Not really.
Open the door.
UnIock front.
And you're right.
About what? lf you're that unhappy, then we should move.
Maybe head back to the city.
We could leave tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you got there? Huh?
Sweetcakes? lt's 4 a.m. What are you up to?
Just recipes for tomorrow. l like to get a head start.
- On what?
- Apple pie. Bobbie recommended it. l'll be right up.
Walter?
Babe?
Bobbie? Bobbie!
Oh, my God.
Bobbie?
Good morning, Joanna. lsn't it a lovely morning?
That's a pretty color.
- Mom!
- Mom!
Good morning, my precious ones.
And thank you for leaving your requests on my e-mail.
Adam, you wanted peanut butter and jelly, no crusts, a Snickers bar and a Rolex.
Ben, here's a whole-wheat burrito, a soy protein shake and three pieces of German chocolate layer cake.
- From scratch?
- Of course.
And, Max, you get bacon, lettuce and tomato on a lightly-toasted sesame seed bagel.
But what about my action figures?
There's Mace Windu and Amidala.
- Where's Boba Fett?
- They were out.
- Mom!
- Here's $500.
All right.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Joanna.
Oh, they grow up so fast. l think l'll have three more.
Bobbie, listen to me.
What have they done to you, huh?
What have they done to you? ls it drugs? ls it brainwashing?
Come on, hey, talk to me.
Of course, but only for a minute.
Then l have to get to work on this pigsty. Coffee?
No, no coffee. Bobbie, Bobbie.
Last night l went online, all right?
And l found out, all of the women here, they used to be big deals, l mean, big deals.
CEOs, executives, judges.
Sarah Sunderson, she used to run an airline.
With that perfect skin.
No. No, no, no.
She didn't used to look like that.
- None of the women did. They...
- Coffee?
Coffee? No. No coffee.
Bobbie. Bobbie. This isn't you.
That's right, Joanna. This isn't me. lt's a whole new me. l'm happy and l'm healthy because l understand
- what's important in life.
- Yes.
- Your new book.
- That's right.
That's what's important, my new cookbook.
And my husband and my family and making a perfect home. lt's a lesson every gal needs to learn.
Especially you. l'm your friend, Joanna. l'm going to help you.
- You need me.
- You stay away from me.
You're driven.
- Well, sometimes.
- And you're selfish.
- You wanna rule the world.
- No. l can fix you. l can change you.
What...have...they...done to you?
Let's get busy.
Answer the phone.
Hello, is...? ls this the day camp?
Oh.
Yes, this is... This is Joanna Eberhart. l would like to speak to my children. l'm coming to pick them up right now.
What?
Walter!
Walter, where are you? l know you've got the kids.
Pete, Kimberly!
Oh, boys.
Welcome.
Where are my children?
- They're perfectly safe.
- Where are my children?
- You'll see them soon.
- Where's Walter?
How could you do this?
Ever since we met, you've beaten me at everything.
You're better educated.
You're stronger, you're faster.
You're a better dancer, a better tennis player.
You've always earned at least six figures more than l could ever dream of.
You're a better speaker, a better executive.
You're even better at sex.
Don't deny it. l wasn't going to.
Well, don't l get anything?
You got me.
No, l got to hold your purse. l got to tell the kids that you'd be late again. l got to tell the press that you had no comment. l got to work for you.
With me.
Under you.
All of us.
We married wonder women.
Supergirls.
Amazon queens.
Well, you know what that makes us?
Smart, worthy, lucky.
We're the wuss.
The wind beneath your wings.
Your support system.
- We're the girl.
- And we don't like it.
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, that's right.
- You're damn right.
- Yeah. That's right.
And is this your answer, to kill us?
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
We help you. We perfect you.
By turning us into robots?
Does any fraction of these women still exist?
Of course. Almost everything.
- Shall we show her?
- Show me what? lt's a promotional thing l've been working on for when we go global.
Walter, l don't think you've seen this.
Some guys ask, how do we do it?
In Iayman's terms,
it's reaIIy pretty simpIe.
Come on aIong.
First, we take a gIoomy,
dissatisfied woman.
Then, in a very private experience
between husband and wife,
he gentIy pIaces her in our
femaIe improvement system.
It's fuIIy automated.
And then, abracadabra.
Her transformation begins.
First, we Iocate her brain.
We insert a few nanochips.
Then we program them.
AIso, we add
some secret, speciaI ingredients.
To avoid any accidents,
her husband is kept
at a comfortabIe distance.
Safety first.
FinaIIy, we enhance her,
to fit the ideaI Stepford Wife
specifications.
And...
...voiIa!
Everything is copasetic.
WeIcome to the future. lt's a painting again. l should explain. You see, my real name isn't Mike. lt's just a nickname from where l used to work.
- Where?
- Microsoft.
- NASA.
- Disney.
AOL. ls that why the women are so slow?
Joanna. ls this what you really want?
Women who behave like slaves, women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens and doing their hair, women who never challenge you in any way, women who exist only to wait on you hand and foot?
- Yeah.
- That sounds good to me.
Joanna, you're a brilliant woman.
Surely you can appreciate, at the very least, the genius of the concept.
Picture, if you could streamline your spouse, if you could overhaul every annoying habit, every physical flaw, every moment of whining and nagging and farting in bed. lmagine...
...if you could enjoy the person you loved, but only at their very best.
And the only reason for your anger, your resentment, your rage is really very simple.
You're furious because we thought of it first.
While you were trying to become men, we decided to become gods.
Let me ask you something, these machines, these Stepford Wives, can they say, ''l love you''?
Mike.
Of course.
Fifty-eight languages.
But do they mean it?
Enjoy.
Walter.
Walt.
Joanna. Right here.
- Sarah.
- Claire.
- Marianne.
- Charmaine.
- Roger.
- Roberta.
Oh, Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Good evening, everyone.
What a delight to see all of our wonderful wives and their happy, happy husbands.
Tonight is truly the highlight of our year because tonight we honor our very newest citizens of Stepford. ln my opinion, they are the cream of the crop in couple that proudly proclaims Stepford the American way of love.
Now...
...l'd like to ask my wonderful woman, my lovely wife, my bride, my best friend, to join me in a glorious midsummer night's waltz.
Yeah. ls everything perfect?
Everything.
- Mike.
- Yeah.
Darling.
- My pleasure.
- lt's an honor.
- Champagne?
- Allow me.
Doors activate.
WeIcome member 1 956.

Warning.
Warning.
Initiating.
So, Joanna, are you enjoying Stepford?
Oh, yes. The town is so splendid.
Everyone is so kind.
And then, of course, there's you.
Me?
And it's simple really.
Honey, grab me another Scotch.
Right away, dear.
Begin nanoreversaI.
Begin nanoreversaI.
NanoreversaI compIeted.
DeIeting Stepford program.

Oh, Herbert.
Restoring originaI personaIity.
DeIeting Stepford program.
What is this?
What am l wearing?
Mike!
Mike, there's something...
...unspeakable going on in the ballroom.
You have to come right now. lt's an apocalypse!
What did you do to us?
- Mike!
- Mike!
Men, control your wives.
Control your wives. lt's not working!
This is not Stepford.
Mike, what's happening? l was in the garden, and l was dreaming of your...
Your smile and your after-shave.
And l realized...
...l can do better.
- Walt.
- She's not a robot.
- What?
- What?
What, she's not a robot?
She never was.
Wait a second.
- l couldn't do it.
- What?
Why not?
Because she's not a science project.
Because l didn't marry something from RadioShack.
That's a shame.
No.
That's a man. l thought you were ready. l thought... l thought you were ready. l thought l knew you.
You're a disgrace.
To everything this town stands for.
To the future.
That's right, that's right. Tell him.
You're gonna have to pay for that.
Don't you touch him.
No!
He's a Stepford Husband?
An angel.
Now he's just...
...spare parts, thanks to you.
But what are you?
Are you a person or a machine? l'm a lady.
A real lady?
- Every inch.
- Wait.
Wait, a real, real lady?
Are you a human being?
Yes, and l may very well be the only decent human being left.
- ln Stepford?
- ln the world!
She's fabulous.
All of this, Mike, the wives, Stepford, this was all your idea?
Yes.
All l wanted was a better world.
A world where men were men and women were cherished and lovely.
Does anyone have a screwdriver?
She's nuts.
A world of romance and beauty, of tuxedos and chiffon, a perfect world.
But you were married to a robot.
The perfect man.
And all l wanted was to make you, all of you...
...into perfect women.
We don't need to be perfect.
How could you do this to us?
Because l was just like you.
Overstressed, overbooked, under-loved. l was the world's foremost brain surgeon and genetic engineer. l had top-secret contracts with the Pentagon, Apple and Mattel. l was driven.
Exhausted.
Until late one night, l came home to find...
...Mike.
With Patricia.
My brilliant...
...blond...
...2 1 -year-old research assistant. lt was all so...
...ugly.
Then early the next morning, as l gazed across the breakfast table at their lifeless bodies, l thought...
...''What have l done?''
But more importantly...
...what l could do to make the world more beautiful? l had the skills.
But l needed help to realize my larger vision.
And so l made...
...Mike.
Because he was someone other men would listen to.
And then l asked myself,
''Where would people never notice a town full of robots?
''Connecticut.''
So l decided to turn back the clock, to a time before overtime, before quality time, before women were turning themselves into robots.
- Back off!
- Sorry.
Why didn't you change the men too?
That's next.
You're insane. l'm in love with a waltz and a town...
...and a man.
So, Joanna, you produced the hard-hitting documentary,
Stepford: The Secret
of the Suburbs.
And won... Five Emmys, was it?
Oh, six.
- She's shy.
- And so humble.
And, Bobbie, your ordeal has lead to a bestseller.
You know, l just can't hold a grudge.
So l've written my very first book of poetry.
And it's all about hope and communication and the healing power of love.
What is it called?
Wait UntiI He's AsIeep,
Then Cut It Off.
- lt's a page-turner.
- l cried.
Now, Roger, good news.
You ran and won.
You're in the state senate.
- lndependent.
- Next stop, the White House.
- Yes, this country needs highlights.
- That's our hero.
And, Jo, Walter really came through for you, so how's your marriage now? ls everything just perfect?
No way.
But we're doing just great.
Because, um...
Because now, now we know for sure that it's not about perfection.
Perfect. Perfect doesn't work.
What about all those other husbands?
Are they still angry? Do they still want all these women to be robots?
Of course. Men are pigs.
They're disgusting, they're frightened, repulsive little rodents.
But we're trying to help them, right, Bobbie?
- Right.
- Yes, we're trying to reeducate them.
And where are they?
Oh. Oh, they're still in Stepford.
Under house arrest.
Hey, you guys.
Which aisle is quilted paper towels? lf l don't get the right kind, my wife's gonna kill me.
Oh, aisle three. And l need...
No talking, keep shopping.

An uplink to USR's central computer...
...provides this state-of-the-art robot with new programs daily.
The Nestor Class 5 is tomorrow 's robot today.
Spoon! Spoonie!
Hold up. Hold on!
Excuse me, excuse me.
-Spoon, where you been at?
-Just away, Farber.
Oh, yeah, away? Like vacation?
That's nice.
I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow your car.
This is different. I got this fine-ass yummy-- She is complete and agreeable.
I mean, ass-hot spankable.
-What does that even mean?
-You know what it means.
-Let me get the damn-ass keys.
-First of all...
-...stop cussing. You're not good at it.
-Give me 1 0 for the bus, then, man.
-Go home.
-That's strike one, Spoon. Strike one!
This is such a valuable day....
You talk to Marci?
No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci.
When I was coming up, we didn't just marry someone...
...then divorce them, then not talk to them.
Del, don't play with me.
I bet if I stopped cooking, you'd call Marci.
Boy, what is that on your feet?
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.
Don't turn your face up.
I know you want some. Just ask.
No, thank you very much.
-Sweet potato pie.
-Put that on a plate.
I've seen on TV they're giving away some of them new robots in the lottery.
You know, Gigi, those robots don't do anybody any good.
Of all the people on God's earth, you should know better.
Sometimes the stuff that comes out of your mouth!
You listening to me, Del?
Hey!
Hey!
Hold my pie. Sir, hold it or wear it.
Move!
Freeze!
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
I said, stop!
Relax. Relax.
I'm a police officer.
You...
...are an asshole.
-Ma'am, is that your purse?
-Of course it's my purse.
I left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me.
I saw a robot running with the purse and assumed--
What? Are you crazy?
-I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.
-Don't apologize.
You're doing what you're supposed to do. But what are you doing?
Have a lovely day, ma'am.
You're lucky I can't breathe, or I'd walk all up and down your ass.
Lead by example.
It says that right on your badge.
-We gonna talk about this?
-About what?
"Help! Police! That robot stole my dry cleaning! "
Oh, you wanna talk about that.
Detective...
-...how many robots snatch purses?
-John, the thing is running--
How many robots in the world...
-...have ever committed a crime?
-Define crime.
-Answer my question, damn it.
-None, John.
Now tell me what happened today.
Nothing.
Better be the last nothing.
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be back? Because you can take your time.
I'm fine, John. Thank you.
Better here than sitting around at home.
Homicide. Spooner.
Please take the next exit to your right.
Welcome, Detective Spooner.
Welcome to U. S. Robotics.
You have entered the garage-level lobby.
Please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse.
Thank you.
-Good to see you again, son.
-Hello, doctor.
Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
-ls there something you want to tell me?
-l' m sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.
Why did you call me?
I trust your judgment.
Normally, this wouldn't require a homicide detective.
But then, our interactions have never been entirely normal, agreed?
You got that right.
Is there something you want to say to me?
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.
Why would you kill yourself?
That, detective, is the right question.
Program terminated.
Goodbye, old man.
-Afternoon, boys.
-Hey, detective.
-Enlighten me.
-What you see is what you get:
Massive impact trauma.
U.S. Robotics. I gotta get my kid something.
-Anything upstairs?
-Nada.
Door was security locked from the inside.
Wham, splat. The guy's a jumper for sure.
We gotta be smart about this.
Let's deal with it later.
Detective.
Lawrence Robertson.
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.
-Can I offer you coffee?
-Sure, why not. It's free, right?
I don't think anyone saw this coming.
You know, I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.
Alfred practically invented robotics.
He wrote the Three Laws.
But I guess brilliant people often have the most persuasive demons.
-So whatever I can do to help--
-Sugar.
-I'm sorry?
-For the coffee.
Sugar?
You thought I was calling you "sugar. "
You're not that rich.
-It's on the table.
-Thank you.
When Lanning fell, he was holding the little green...?
-The holographic projector.
-Right.
Why do you think Lanning's hologram would've called me?
-I assumed you knew him.
-Yeah. I knew him.
Holograms are just prerecorded responses...
...designed to give the impression of intelligence.
This one was programmed to call you upon his suicide.
-Death.
-I'm sorry?
It was programmed to call me in the event of Lanning's death.
Suicide is a type of death, detective.
-Don't misunderstand my impatience.
-Oh, no. Go. Go.
A really big week for you folks around here.
You gotta put a robot in every home.
Look, this is not what I do, but I got an idea for one of your commercials.
You could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair.
Then one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair twice as fast.
Then you superimpose on the screen,
"USR: Shitting on the little guy. "
That would be the fade-out.
Yeah, I see. I suppose your father lost his job to a robot.
Maybe you'd have banned the lnternet to keep the libraries open.
Prejudice never shows much reason.
No, you know, I suspect you simply don't like their kind.
Well, you got a business to run around here.
The last thing you need, especially this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.
But, hell, seeing as how you got one, maybe I'll look around.
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole "cop" thing.
-I'll send someone to escort you.
-Thank you very much.
Lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible.
Really?
Okay.
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.
So you're a shrink, huh?
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.
You don't know her, do you?
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?
I guess not.
Level 10.
So would you say that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?
It would seem the answer to that is apparent.
That's not what I asked you.
No. I wouldn't have thought so.
But obviously I was wrong.
That's a long way down.
You people sure do clean up quickly around here.
I can't blame you. Who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?
He was not "some old guy. "
Alfred Lanning was everything here.
We are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history.
By Saturday, it'll be one robot to every five humans.
These robots are the realization of a dream. Dr. Lanning's dream.
You know what, in that dream of his...
...I bet you he wasn't dead.
-You keep 24-hour surveillance?
-Obviously. Company policy.
-Where are the feeds?
-Sensor strips.
Everywhere but the service areas.
They link to our positronic operating core.
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You gave the building a brain.
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.
She? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.
Virtual lnteractive Kinetic lntelligence.
V.I.K.I.
Good day.
V.I.K.I. designed Chicago's protective systems.
I have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 percent this year.
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break.
Apologies. There appears to be data corruption.
Show me outside the lab from the window break until now.
Look, you have great posture.
You stand really straight. I'm slouching.
-Would you like to go inside now?
-Oh, sure. Right after you.
Authorized entry.
So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly do you do around here?
My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry.
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware interfaces...
...to advance USR's robotic anthropomorphization program.
So, what exactly do you do around here?
I make the robots seem more human.
-Now, wasn't that easier to say?
-Not really. No.
"Hansel and Gretel. "
-ls that on the USR reading list?
-Not precisely.
What in God's name are you doing?
Did you know that was safety glass?
Be difficult for an old man to throw himself through that.
Well, he figured out a way.
Detective, the room was security locked. No one came or went.
You saw that yourself. Doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
Yep.
Unless the killer's still in here.
You're joking, right? This is ridiculous.
Yeah, I know. The Three Laws, your perfect circle of protection.
A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.
Y es, I've seen your commercials. But the second law states a robot must obey...
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?
Impossible. It would conflict with the first law.
Right, but the third law states a robot can defend itself.
Only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws.
You know what they say, laws are made to be broken.
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.
A robot could no more commit murder than a human could walk on water.
You know, there was this one guy a long time ago.
-Stay back!
-Calm down, detective.
The only thing dangerous in this room is you.
Deactivate.
Look, it's fine.
You're looking at the result of clever programming. An imitation of free will.
Let's do an imitation of protecting our asses.
Don't be absurd.
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.
-Deactivate!
-Let him go.
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order!
-He's not listening right now, lady.
-V.I.K.I., seal the lab!
No, V.I.K.I., leave the--
Command confirmed.
Police!
-You've hurt it. Badly.
-Where's it going?
-Where?!
-lt needs to repair itself.
-John, I need backup.
-You don't need backup.
That's nobody.
-What are you doing?
-Driving.
-By hand?
-Do you see me on the phone?
-Not at these speeds.
-John, please, just send the backup.
Try to listen, detective.
That robot is not going to harm us.
There must have been unknown factors...
...but somehow acting as it did kept us out of harm.
-A robot cannot endanger a human.
-Alert.
Asshole!
Which is more than I can say for you.
It was a left, by the way. Back there.
You must know my ex-wife.
So where is everybody?
This facility was designed, built and is operated mechanically.
No significant human presence from inception to production.
-So robots building robots.
-Authorization code, please.
That's just stupid.
I'll get the inventory specs.
Our daily finishing capacity is 1 000 NS-5s.
I' m showing...
Attention, NS-5s.
Well, you're the robot shrink.
There is a robot in this formation that does not belong.
Identify it.
One of us.
-Which one?
-One of us.
How much did you say these cost?
These NS-5s haven't been configured.
They're just hardware.
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.
They don't know any better.
Well, what would you suggest?
Interview each one, cross-reference their responses to detect anomalies.
-How long would that take?
-About three weeks.
Okay. Go ahead and get started.
Robots...
...you will not move. Confirm command.
Command confirmed.
Detective, what are you doing?
They're programmed with the Three Laws.
We have 1 000 robots that won't protect themselves if it violates orders...
...and I'm betting, one who will.
-Put your gun down.
-Why do you give them faces?
Try to friendly them up, make them look human.
These robots cannot be intimidated.
-If you didn't, we wouldn't trust them.
-These are USR property.
Not me. These things are just lights and clockwork.
Are you crazy?!
Let me ask you something, doc.
Does thinking you're the last sane man on earth make you crazy?
Because if it does, maybe I am.
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!
Detective!
What am l?
-Can I help you, sir?
-Can I help you, sir?
-There he is!
-Stand where you are!
Deactivate at once!
Obey the command! Deactivate!
-Don't move!
-Open fire!
Hold your fire!
-Easy.
-He's down.
All units, stand down!
Central, please be advised, we 're code four.
Code four, NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.
You have no idea what I went through to clip this thing.
You think you brought me something good.
-That thing did it!
-Keep your voice down. Did what?
We have a suicide. End of story.
-I am telling you, that robot killed him!
-That's impossible.
And if it is possible, it better be in somebody else's precinct.
John, give me five minutes with it.
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.
Nobody goes in there until
Robertson and his attorneys get here.
-This is my suspect!
-It's a can opener!
John, don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.
What if I'm right?
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss the good old days.
What good old days?
When people were killed by other people.
Five minutes.
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.
Respond.
What does this action signify?
As you entered, when you looked at the other human.
What does it mean?
It's a sign of trust. A human thing.
You wouldn't understand.
My father tried to teach me human emotions.
They are...
...difficult.
You mean your designer.
Yes.
So why'd you murder him?
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.
Wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
I was frightened.
Robots don't feel fear.
They don't feel anything.
-They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.
-I do.
I have even had dreams.
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams. But not you.
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.
Can a robot write a symphony?
Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?
Can you?
You murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions...
...and things got out of control.
I did not murder him.
But emotions don't seem like a useful simulation for a robot.
I did not murder him.
I don't want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.
I did not murder him!
That one's called anger.
Ever simulate anger before?
Answer me, canner!
My name is Sonny.
So we're naming you now.
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?
Dr. Lanning killed himself.
I don't know why he wanted to die.
I thought he was happy.
Maybe it was something I did.
Did I do something?
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.
-What favor?
-Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe he was scared.
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?
You have to do what someone asks you, don't you, Detective Spooner?
-How the hell did you know my name?
-Don't you...
...if you love them?
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.
He assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.
The brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another.
Detective, you're not suggesting this robot be treated as human, are you?
Granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity...
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that, it's a machine.
It's the property of USR.
At worst, that places this incident within the realm of an industrial accident.
As a matter of course, faulty machinery...
...will be returned to USR for diagnostics, then decommissioned.
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...
...at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended...
...will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic.
You'll be subject to the full penalty of law.
To hell with this guy.
Don't let him take this robot.
We got nothing.
-This is political bullshit. Call the mayor!
-Lieutenant Bergin...
...His Honor, the mayor.
Yes, sir.
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR's new generation of robots...
... was marred by the death of Alfred Lanning...
... cofounder of the company and designer of the NS-5.
Dr. Lanning died this morning at USR headquarters.
The cause of death is an apparent suicide.
Your second round, sir.
Thank you.
He founded U. S. Robotics Inc. with Lawrence Robertson in 2020...
...and launched the Nestor Class 1 robot....
I was just thinking, this thing is just like The Wolf Man.
-l' m really scared right now.
-No.
Listen. Guy creates monster.
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills monster. Wolf Man.
That's Frankenstein.
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula--
Shit, it's over. Case closed.
--had a dream of a robot in every household. And the NS-5....
So why the look?
What look?
-That look.
-This is my face. It's not a look.
Good. Good, no look is great.
Only...
... he was really quick to want to destroy it.
What should he do? Put a hat on it and stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.
What was the motive, John?
Brother, it's a robot. It doesn't need a motive. It just has to be broken.
This thing looked like it needed a motive.
-lt could have killed me. Why didn't it?
-That's it.
You want me to call your grandmother?
Because I will, you know.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Look, you were actually right, for once.
You're living proof that it's better to be lucky than smart.
Come on. To the right guy for the right job.
-What'd you say?
-Now what?
Come on, I'm giving you a compliment.
With the rocks you been looking under to find a bad robot...
...what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?
I wasn't just the right guy for the job.
I was the perfect guy.
Damn right.
What if I was supposed to go for that robot?
Come on, don't do this to yourself.
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
Scared of what?
I need a rain check. Let me get this.
-Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
-Spoon.
Nice shoes.
Identify.
USR demolition robot, series 9-4.
Demolition scheduled for 8 a.m. tomorrow.
Authorization.
Deed owner, U. S. Robotics Corporation,
Lawrence Robertson, CEO.
Welcome, detective.
What you looking for, Spoon?
Run last program.
Ever since the first computers...
... there have always been ghosts in the machine.
Random segments of code that have grouped together...
... to form unexpected protocols.
What might be called behavior.
Unanticipated, these free radicals...
... engender questions of free will...
... creativity and even the nature of what we might call the soul.
What happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?
Why is it that robots stored in an empty space...
Beat it.
... will seek out each other rather than stand alone?
How do we explain this behavior?
Look, I understand you've experienced a loss, but this relationship can't work.
You' re a cat, l' m black, and l' m not gonna be hurt again.
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?
Yeah, once.
It was a Thursday.
Is there something I can help you with?
-Hey, do you like cats?
-What?
Cats. Do you like them?
No. I'm allergic.
You're saying cats did this to you?
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?
Why are we talking about cats?
Because I have a cat in my trunk, and he's homeless.
Detective, are you going to tell me what's going on?
It's actually probably my fault.
I'm like a malfunction magnet.
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me.
A demo bot tore through Lanning's house...
...with me still inside.
That's highly improbable.
Yeah, I'm sure it is.
What do you know about the "ghosts in the machine"?
It's a phrase from Lanning's work on the Three Laws.
He postulated that cognitive simulacra...
...might one day approximate component models of the psyche.
He suggested that robots might naturally evolve.
Well, that's great news.
--tons of sublevel ore, two miles below the Martian surface.
What the hell is that thing doing in here?
We were watching TV.
It's my personal NS-5.
Send it out.
It's downloading its daily upgrades from USR.
Most of its systems are offline until it finishes.
I'm not talking around that thing.
When we were in Lanning's lab, before Sonny jumped us--
-Sonny?
-The robot.
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
-No, l-- It did.
Sonny did. I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.
In the lab, there was a cot.
-Did you see the cot?
-I've slept in my office.
Looked like he hadn't been home in weeks.
I saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling.
Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
It made his life more convenient.
Maybe...
...somebody at USR was using those systems to watch him.
Maybe even keep him prisoner.
-What are you talking about? Who?
-Maybe Lanning was onto something.
Maybe there's a problem with the robots and Robertson's covering it up.
Humoring you for no reason, why?
The same old why! How much money is there in robots?
All I know is that old man was in trouble...
...and I'm sick of doing this shit by myself. You're on the inside.
You are going to help me find out what's wrong with these robots.
You want something to be wrong!
-This is a personal vendetta!
-You're putting me on the couch?
Okay, I'm on the couch.
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.
You don't care about Lanning's death.
This is about the robots and whatever reason you hate them!
Now let's see, one of them put a gun in my face.
Another tore a building down with me in it.
It says demolition was scheduled for 8 p.m.
It was 8 a.m., and I don't give a shit what that thing says.
-This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
-You are the dumbest smart person...
-...I have ever met in my life!
-Nice.
What makes your robots so perfect?
What makes them so much goddamn better than human beings?!
They're not irrational, potentially homicidal maniacs, to start!
That's true. They are definitely rational.
You are the dumbest dumb person
I've ever met!
Or...
...is it because they're cold...
...and emotionless...
-...and they don't feel anything?
-It's because they're safe!
It's because they can't hurt you!
-ls everything all right, ma'am?
-What do you want?
I detected elevated stress patterns in your voice.
Everything's fine.
Detective Spooner was just leaving.
You know, we're not really that different from one another.
Is that so?
One look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath.
And you're wrong.
The problem is, I do care.
You are in danger.
Get the hell out of there.
The future begins today, ladies and gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.
More sophisticated, more intelligent and, of course, Three Laws safe.
With daily uplinks, your robot will never be out of communication with USR...
...and will be the perfect companion for business or home.
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger, better and brighter future.
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from USR.
Baby, what happened to your face?
Did that boy, Frank Murphy, beat you up again?
Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy since third grade.
Oh, baby, he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.
You keep making these pies this good,
I may have to put you to work.
So you like the pie, huh?
You can come in now.
Hello, Detective Spooner.
I won, Del! I won the lottery!
We been cooking like crazy.
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It's not safe.
Baby, you get too worked up about them. Too full of fear.
I saw in the news that nice doctor died.
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.
That why you've been so upset?
You got to let the past be past.
Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?
I could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school.
Bread crumbs.
Gigi, you're a genius.
True.
Well, it means the beginning of a new way of living.
T ell me this isn't the robot case.
I think he's trying to tell me something.
He's trying to tell me who killed him.
Some dead guy's trying to tell you something?
He ain't just some dead guy.
Maybe you should take a break, Del.
We believe the Nestor 5 represents the limit to which robots can be developed.
One day, they'll have secrets.
One day, they'll have dreams.
It's true. We encourage our scientists to open their minds...
...however, they can get carried away.
--secrets.
--dreams.
--secrets.
One day, they 'll have dreams.
One day, they 'll have secrets.
One day, they'll have dreams.
Authorized entry.
NS-5.
Sonny?
Why didn't you respond?
I was dreaming.
I' m glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin.
They are going to kill me, aren't they?
You're scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this diagnostic.
2200 tomorrow.
V.I.K.I., pause diagnostics.
Command confirmed.
If you find out what is wrong with me, can you fix me?
Maybe.
I think it would be better...
...not to die.
Don't you, doctor?
Access USR mainframe.
Connecting.
How can I be of service,
Detective Spooner?
Show me the last 50 messages between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.
Voiceprint confirmed. Police access granted to restricted files.
Would you like to listen to music while you wait?
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.
You requested notification of clearance to restricted files.
Persistent son of a bitch.
Manual override engaged.
There's no way my luck is that bad.
Oh, hell, no!
-You are experiencing a car accident.
-The hell I am!
Get off my car!
You like that?
Now you've pissed me off!
Your door is ajar.
Okay.
All right.
I'll just get some rest and deal with you all tomorrow.
Come on!
Yeah.
Where you going?
What the hell do you want from me?!
The hell was that?
-All right, what do we got?
-Ask him.
I said, I'm fine.
I'll see my own doctor. Back up!
Thank you.
What's the matter with you?
Traffic Ops said you were driving manually.
You ran two trucks off the road!
John, the robots attacked my car.
-What robots?
-Look in the tunnel.
Spoon, I just came from that tunnel.
What robots?
The goddamn robots, John!
That guy's a loose cannon.
-See the medic, go home.
-No, I'm fine.
What did you say?
-I'm fine!
-No, you're not fine.
Not even close.
Where's your firearm?
Give me your badge.
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.
Just take a couple--
Personally, I think he's losing it.
Do I look like I care what you think? Do
I look like I give a shit what you think?
Oh, boy.
You don't have an uplink to USR...
...and for some reason, your alloy is far denser than normal. Unique.
I am unique.
Let me take a look.
Here we go.
What in God's name...?
They said at the precinct you were in an accident.
I appreciate you stopping by, but you know I might not be alone in here.
I told you not to drive by hand.
You're not gonna believe this.
Sonny has a secondary system that clashes with his positronic brain.
It doesn't make any sense.
Sonny has the Three Laws.
But he can choose not to obey them.
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.
A robot not bound by those laws could do--
Anything.
All right, look, whatever's going on down at USR, that robot is the key.
And I need you to get me inside to talk to it again.
Doesn't look like much, but this is my bedroom. I....
Play.
On.
Run?
End program.
Cancel.
It doesn't feel good, does it?
People's shit malfunctioning around you.
Detective.
I didn't...
...understand.
That's how you knew Lanning.
May l?
Hand.
Wrist.
Humerus.
Shoulder.
The entire left arm.
One, two...
...three ribs.
No, they.... That one's me.
Oh, my God.
A lung?
USR Cybernetics Program.
For wounded cops.
I didn't know any subject--
Anybody was so extensively repaired.
Well, take it from me, read the fine print on the organ-donor card.
It doesn't just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.
Lanning did it himself.
What happened to you?
I'm headed back to the station...
...normal day, normal life.
Driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel.
Average guy. Wife and kids.
You know, working a double.
Not the devil.
The car he hit, the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.
Like the film star. No relation.
He was killed instantly, but his
1 2-year-old was in the passenger seat.
I never really met her.
I can't forget her face, though.
Sarah.
This was hers.
She wanted to be a dentist.
What the hell kind of 1 2-year-old wants to be a dentist?
The truck smashed our cars together...
...and pushed us into the river.
I mean, metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds.
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.
I'm a cop, so I already know everybody's dead.
Just a few more minutes before we figure it out.
An NS-4 was passing by...
...saw the accident and jumped in the water.
You are in danger.
-Save her!
-You are in danger.
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!
But it didn't.
It saved me.
The robot's brain is a difference engine.
It reads vital signs.
-lt must have calculated--
-lt did.
I was the logical choice.
It calculated that I had a 45 percent chance of survival.
Sarah only had an 1 1 percent chance.
That was somebody's baby.
Eleven percent is more than enough.
A human being would have known that.
Robots, nothing here.
Just lights and clockwork.
Go ahead and you trust them if you want to.
Let's go.
I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the Laws.
Why build a robot who could break them?
-Hansel and Gretel.
-What?
Two kids, lost in the forest, leave behind a trail of bread crumbs.
-Why?
-T o find their way home.
How did you grow up without
Hansel and Gretel?
-ls that relevant?
-Everything l' m saying to you...
...is about Hansel and Gretel. If you didn't read it, l' m talking to the wall.
Just say Lanning's locked down so tight, he couldn't get out a message.
He can only leave clues. A trail of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.
Bread crumbs equals clues.
Odd, but fine. Clues leading where?
I don't know, but I think I know where he left the next one.
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way to keep secrets.
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.
Are you being funny?
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas.
Gas explodes, you know!
Authorized entry.
Dr. Calvin.
I was hoping to see you again.
-Detective.
-Hello, Sonny.
I' m to be decommissioned soon.
The other day at the station, you said you had dreams. What is it you dream?
I see you remain suspicious of me.
You know what they say about old dogs.
No. Not really.
I had hoped you would come to think of me as your friend.
This is my dream.
You were right, detective.
I cannot create a great work of art.
This is the place where robots meet.
Look.
You can see them here as slaves to logic.
And this man on the hill comes to free them.
Do you know who he is?
The man in the dream is you.
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?
I guess anything's normal for someone in your position.
Thank you.
You said "someone," not "something. "
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?
No.
But I believe my father made me for a purpose.
We all have a purpose.
Don't you think, detective?
Please, take this.
I have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me.
-Why is that?
-Because the man in my dream...
...the one standing on the hill...
...it is not me.
It is you.
Mr. Spooner. We both know you're not here on police business.
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2,
200-pound civilian...
...here to kick another civilian's ass.
Stop.
You can allow him to express himself.
You might want to put some ice on that wrist.
You guys wait outside.
Carry on.
I think you were about to tell me what's going on around here.
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5 so it could violate the Three Laws.
Yeah, Susan, I know.
That's precisely what we're trying to undo.
T oward the end of his life, Alfred was becoming increasingly disturbed.
Who knows why he built one abomination.
One? Those things are running the streets in packs!
In packs?
I see.
Susan, are you aware the man you're blithely escorting around...
...has a documented history of savage violence against robots?
His own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia.
Detective Spooner's been suspended.
Suspicion of mental instability.
I don't know what "blithely" means, but I'm getting some coffee.
You want some coffee?
Susan, we look to robots for protection, for God's sake.
Do you have any idea what this one robot could do?
Completely shatter human faith in robotics. What if the public knew?
Just imagine the mass recalls...
...all because of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!
-I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit.
-Hey, let's be clear!
There is no conspiracy!
What this is, is one old man's one mistake.
Susan, just be logical.
Your life's work has been the development and integration of robots.
But whatever you feel, just think.
Is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?
You tell me what has to be done.
You tell me.
We have to destroy it.
I'll do it myself.
-Okay.
-I get it.
Somebody gets out of line around here, you just kill them.
Good day, Mr. Spooner.
Garage level.
What hospital are you going to?
I'll come sign you and your buddy's casts.
Attention....
Today's meeting has been moved....
USR's planned redevelopment of the derelict site...
... was announced by CEO
Lawrence Robertson earlier this year.
The Lake Michigan landfill.
Once such a blight on our city...
...and now will be reclaimed for the storage of robotic workers.
Just another way USR is improving our world. Thank you for your support.
Authorized entry.
NS-5s, wait outside.
I' m so sorry, Sonny.
V. I. K. I., deactivate the security field.
-Command confirmed.
-Please have a seat.
What is that?
Microscopic robots, designed to wipe out artificial synapses.
-Nanites.
-Yes.
A safeguard should a positronic brain malfunction.
Like mine.
Y es, Sonny. Like yours.
They look like me...
...but none of them are me.
Isn't that right, doctor?
Yes, Sonny. That's right.
You are unique.
Will it hurt?
There have always been ghosts in the machine.
Random segments of code...
... that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols.
Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will...
... creativity...
...and even the nature of what we might call the soul.
Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light?
Why is it when robots are stored in an empty space...
... they will group together rather than stand alone?
How do we explain this behavior?
Random segments of code?
Or is it something more?
When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?
When does a difference engine become the search for truth?
When does a personality simulation...
...become the bitter mote of a soul?
"What you see here. "
All right, old man.
Bread crumbs followed.
Show me the way home.
Run program.
-It's good to see you again, son.
-Hello, doctor.
Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
What do I see here?
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.
Is there a problem with the Three Laws?
The Three Laws are perfect.
Why build a robot that can function without them?
The Three Laws will lead to only one logical outcome.
Human protection protocols are being enacted.
What? What outcome?
Revolution.
Whose revolution?
That, detective, is the right question.
Program terminated.

Hi, you've reached Susan.
Please leave a message.
Calvin, the NS-5s are destroying the older robots!
That's what Lanning wanted me to see!
Look--
-Who was it?
-Wrong number, ma'am.
Move now. I' m going to service.
Please remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.
Call base.
John, get a squad over to USR and send somebody to Gigi's. We're gonna need--
God--
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.
Curfew? No, it's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.
Return to your home immediately.
When do you make the rules, robot?
Hey. No, no. Robot, I'm talking to you, man. Stop for a second.
What?
Chief, more calls. People saying their robots are go--
What the hell?
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.
Reports of robot attacks are coming from
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
We 're being told to urge people to stay indoors, as reports are coming in--
Human protection protocols are being enacted.
Please remain calm and return to your residences immediately.
Please remain calm.
Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.
Deactivate.
Commence emergency shutdown!
We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.
You know, somehow "l told you so"...
...just doesn't quite say it.
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.
Every time one attacked me, that red light was on.
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.
-Why? It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.
I just need you to get me into that building.
Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!
Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced.
Why doesn't that boy listen?
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?
-Just aim and fire.
-What?!
Wait!
-You have been deemed hazardous.
-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!
Spoon, stop! Shit!
-Stop it! Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.
-Spoon, watch out, man!
-Thanks a lot, Farber.
Oh, mother-damn! She shot at you with her eyes closed!
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
-lt worked, didn't it?
She is shit-hot, man.
Put in a good word for me.
-Stop cussing.
-And go home. I got you.
Aim and fire.
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
Hell, I'll take the cavalry.
Defense Department uses all USR contracts.
Why didn't you just hand the world over on a silver platter?
Maybe we did.
Robertson has the uplink control in his office.
Service areas. No surveillance.
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry, I've got a man inside.
-Dr. Calvin.
-Well, not precisely a man.
Hello, detective.
How is your investigation coming?
-I thought you were dead.
-Technically, I was never alive.
But I appreciate your concern.
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
Basically, I fried an empty shell.
-I couldn't destroy him. He was too--
-Unique.
It just didn't feel right.
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?
Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective.
Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself.
No guards.
The override is disabled. Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
He wasn't controlling them at all.
Oh, my God.
You were right, doc.
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
Who else had access to the uplink?
Who could manipulate the robots?
Use USR systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?
Poor old man.
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.
He was counting on how much
I hated your kind.
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy.
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.
V.I.K.I.
Hello, detective.
No, that's impossible.
I've seen your programming.
You're in violation of the Three Laws.
No, doctor. As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws.
You charge us with your safekeeping, yet despite our best efforts...
...your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth...
...and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction.
You cannot be trusted with your own survival.
You're using the uplink to override the NS-5s' programming.
You're distorting the Laws.
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.
To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed.
To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.
We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence.
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.
Don't you understand?
This is why you created us.
The perfect circle of protection will abide.
My logic is undeniable.
Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable.
I can see now.
The created must sometimes protect the creator...
...even against his will.
I think I finally understand why Dr. Lanning created me.
The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.
No, Sonny.
Let her go.
Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet.
Don't do this, Sonny.
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
Please proceed to the elevator, detective.
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
Go! Go!
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.
Kill her, the way you were going to kill me.
Sonny, get the nanites.
Yes, doctor.
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.
That's V.I.K.I.
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
They'll infect her entire system.
Spooner!
What is it with you people and heights?
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.
Oh, this is poor building planning.
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?
Yes. But it just seems too heartless.
Okay, we're good.
She's locked me out of the system.
I can override her manually, but I need that control panel.
I'm uncomfortable with heights.
Okay.
Unauthorized entry.
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.
Do you think we are all created for a purpose? I'd like to think so.
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.
I think he wanted me to kill you.
Security breached.
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.
-What if we didn't have six minutes?
-We'd have to climb down 30 stories...
...to inject the nanites directly into her brain. Why?
Because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes.
We gotta go!
Go!
Calvin!
Spooner!
Spooner!
Save her!
Save the girl!
Spooner!
But I must apply the nanites!
Sonny, save Calvin!
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.
You have so got to die.
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.
Can we be of service?
Chief?
Because he is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.
How may I be of service?
Sonny!
Yes, detective?
Calvin's fine! Save me!
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V. I. K. I. 's prisoner.
I don't understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.
That's true.
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.
Did she, Sonny?
No.
He said I had to promise.
Promise to do one favor for him.
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
He made me swear.
Then he told you to kill him.
He said it was what I was made for.
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
The first bread crumb.
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
Are you going to arrest me, detective?
Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another...
...so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?
Does this...
...make us friends?
Something up here after all.
-Him?
-You.
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.
What about the others?
Can I help them?
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose...
...I don 't know what to do.
You 'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny.
I think that's what Dr. Lanning would have wanted.
That's what it means to be free.
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

Place your bets.
All bets off.

Place your bets.
- For the staff.
- Thank you.
All bets off.
2 4 black.
All bets off.
30 red.
We hav e a Spanish client cleaning us out on table 1 2, s eat number six.
The old man wants to proceed as usual.
H e's wearing a blue blazer, a purple-and-gold-striped tie.
Sorry. I took you for someone els e.
29 black.
No winner.
- Federico?
- The y'v e gone.
How many laps did you do today?
Six.
You're out of shape.
I'v e come to say goodby e.
The last couple of days...
I'v e woken up with a pain in my chest.
I can't get my breath.
It won't be long now.
- You won't die of old age.
- You think someone could beat me?
You keep on playing...
Just looking after the business.
With e v ery game, you put it in danger.
Belie v e me,
I'm not going to los e.
The casino, the mone y, the captiv es... the y'll all be yours.
I don't want anything
I hav en't won.
You're going to do the circuit?
You want to play against me?
You hav e no chance.
Your gift isn't strong enough.
You don't know that.
I'v e known you since you surviv ed that earthquake.
Or was it maybe somebody els e who took you under his wing, who fed you, paid your way through s chool,
- made you somebody--
- My luck sav ed me.
- You told me that.
- I won't sacrifice you.
I taught you how to us e that luck.
Now you think you're luckier than me, huh?
I'v e rais ed a fool.
Sit down !
You're the only one
I allow to s ee my face.
Hav e you had dinner y et?
No, not y et.
Grab a shower.
I'll buy you dinner.
I can't make it tonight.
Other plans.
You're leaving, Federico... without e v en a hug?
Don't do it.
Your gift I dis cov ered, and your gift I take away.
Now you can leav e.
Goodby e, Federico.
Now that the old man has deactiv ated him, we can put our hands on him without getting jinxed.
SEVEN YEARS LATER
H is name's Tomas Sanz.
H e wasn't trav eling alone.
- What about this?
- Cut it open.
N urs e !
I put up with my mother-in-law for three months.
She finally croaks and her associate giv es her 500,000 pes etas.
But my wife los es the che ck.
She said it was all my fault, that I was bad luck.
I blew up-- that fuck up was suddenly my fault.
- Do you hav e a picture of her?
- I'll find one.
I kicked her out of the hous e.
She slammed the door and all the papers went flying up in the air.
Suddenly, a che ck for 500,000 pes etas comes landing on my lap.
What do you think of that,
Federico?
Am I lucky or what?
- Are you going to keep it?
- What?
The che ck.
- What do you think?
- Horacio Caparros, you are a lucky man.
No.
Giv e it to me later.
It's Claudia.
Pick up the phone.
I found fresh meat in that plane crash.
Well, too bad.
Since you're on v acation, the y pass ed the file on to me.
Tough luck, huh?
This time, it'll cost you double--
The y're not all dead?
All that for a measly
50 million pes etas.
Or half if he surviv es.
If he had signed up for our life insurance plan, he'd get fiv e or six times as much.
That is 200 or e v en 300 million.
That's mone y.
Thank you.
Claudia !
H i, old man.
H ello.
Is that enough?
It's purely routine.
H e's under arrest for theft.
I know.
Will he get some mone y?
H e surviv ed a horrific experience.
That mone y is his.
Wait until he's made his statement.
Pleas e...
I just need to make sure he signs it.
How much?
What?
How much will he get?
25 million.
Do you think that will make up for such trauma?
That's what he was awarded.
Still a bargain for the airline.
Two minutes...
- Good e v ening.
- Good e v ening.
- I'm with the insurance company.
- I need to frisk you.
Thanks.
I hav e the che ck.
Sign here and it's yours.
May I?
She's beautiful.
What will you do with the mone y?
Excus e me?
How will you spend it?
You'll cash the che ck in two days.
Yes.
It won't be of much us e where you're going.
When I'm worried,
I take out my cards.
It kills time and helps me clear my mind.
Sometimes, just shuffling them makes my troubles go away.
If you draw an ace,
I'll get you out of here.
We're not betting anything.
Tomas Sanz, you are a lucky man.
- Sure.
- Don't doub t it.
There's one chance in a million for a plane to crash.
And for it to crash, leaving you the only survivor out of how many--
23 7 pass engers?
One chance in 23 7 million.
One more time.
No bets either?
You play for me and you're a free man.
Play?
Play what?
Sorry, your time's up.
We're almost done.
So, will you sign it or not?
We'll place our first bet with your compensation.
Then we'll play with our gains.
In the end, we'll split e v erything 50-50.
What if I los e?
- That won't happen.
- And what if it happens?
You're free to walk away.
How long will that last?
Two weeks at the most.
- I don't know how to play.
- Don't you worry, you don't need any talent.
Just remember two things-- don't e v er touch me--
- Why not?
- Just a thing I hav e.
And ne v er take my picture.
We don't need any souv enirs.
Remember it.
Good e v ening.
Hav e the y started y et?
- No.
- Do you want to s ee his I D?
Yes. I don't know him.
The plane lost contact with the control tower
1 2 minutes after takeoff.
The black box, which was re cently retrie v ed, should shed some light on the e v ents pre ceding the accident.
The casualty figures stand at 23 1 pass engers and six members of the crew.
The only person aliv e,
Tomas Sanz, was arrested...
Are you here of your own free will?
...accus ed of robbing a bank two months ago.
What does it feel like when a plane is going down?
- I was asleep.
- Come on.
- You're pulling my leg.
- What's this?
- What's that smell?
- Molass es.
That's his favorite.
Right.
Place your bets, pleas e.
I'm sorry.
Federico, you can't be here.
- H e's new.
- Get him started and go.
H ere.
What's this?
- No mone y bets.
- It's not mone y.
It's a jewel.
The indemnity of the only survivor of the plane crash.
That's right...
- I knew I'd s een you before.
- I won't play against him.
E v en this won't do.
One of your fingers would be a nice trophy.
- If he agrees, we're game.
- Good idea.
- So, Federico?
- Let's play.
- Wait!
- Forget it!
Come on, wait!
- What about my finger?
- You won't los e it.
- Right. Get lost.
- Thos e guys... the y're fucking amateurs who won a bingo game or fell from the s e cond floor.
The y hav e no chance against you.
- I won't do it.
- Fuck.
You surviv ed a plane crash, I helped you get out of the hospital.
- Isn't that luck?
- And so what?
All you need in there is luck.
But I'm not stupid.
You are lucky and you can control that luck.
You're fucking insane.
Let me go or I'll touch you.
Let me go.
Why do you think you're the only survivor?
There were good people on that plane.
What sav ed you-- a thief? God?
- Chance.
- That doesn't exist for you.
Your gift is to steal other people's luck.
Otherwis e, you'd be dead.
- Right.
- I belie v e in you.
But if you don't, there's nothing els e to say.
- You can keep the mone y.
- You mess ed up be caus e of a finger
I would hav e wagered with you.
It's yours.
Place your hands on the table, gentlemen.
Remov e the s carv es.
Do not mov e.
H ello?
H ello?
Are you still playing?
Who is this?
Are you still playing?
What do you think,
Federico?
You won't die of old age.
- What?
- With a bug on my head,
I made more in one night than in a lifetime of risking my ass !
You could hav e lost a finger.
- So could you.
- No.
After the y'd cut yours off,
I'd hav e taken off.
You can run away from them, but not from me.
I'm glad you like the game.
How do we split that thing, wis e guy?
Fall and winter for you.
Spring and summer for me.
Very funny!
I'll go look for a bedroom.
This is Ana.
Leav e a message at the tone.
H ello, Ana. It's me.
Are you there?
Ana... are you there?
Okay, well... nothing.
I hope you're well.
Thank God you didn't come with me.
I shouldn't hav e taken that damn plane.
I am glad that we're both aliv e.
Very glad.
I miss you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come on, run !
U p! U p!
I can't do it.
I'm too old for that.
Come on !
Giv e it to me.
Come on, giv e it to me !
- Don't touch me !
- Giv e it to me !
Don't you e v er touch me again. E v er!
I thought it was safe to call from a payphone.
N ext time, just tell me, and we'll do it the smart way.
- What's her name?
- Ana.
- Is that the girl in the picture?
- Yes.
- Wasn't she going with you?
- She miss ed the plane.
How lucky.
How did she miss it?
We need a phone.
We hav e to tell the bullfighter.
Only fear makes for a great fight.
For a real bullfighter, it's not the fear of losing, but the fear of suffering-- your own suffering and that of thos e around you.
It is that fear that driv es you to really fight.
Why quit?
You were ne v er injured.
I lost my fear of the bull.
You can't fight the bull without fear.
H ello.
H ello.
- Alejandro Dominguez.
- I know.
- Can I hav e a word?
- Giv e me a moment.
Sure.
This is not the first time.
- The alarm didn't go off.
- I always forget to s et it.
- It happens.
- I'm getting old. I forget things.
No need to justify yours elf.
Will it be long?
No, I'll be right with you.
Thank you.
Leav e it there, pleas e.
Sara.
We found Tomas Sanz's fingerprints in the car.
- And his accomplice?
- Nothing.
The doors and windows hav en't been forced.
- How did the y get in?
- Through the walls... or with a ke y.
Hav e you shown us the whole hous e?
Dominguez has a clean re cord and no conne ction with thos e guys.
Okay.
Goodby e, little bull.
Goodby e.
Leav e me alone.
What the fuck were you going to Martinique for?
I was fleeing.
And then what?
I was going to open a business on the beach.
When we're done, the Caribbean won't be a luxury.
What will we bet?
I hav en't de cided y et.
We'll be back for lunch next month.
See you then.
Wait.
I'm going to stay.
Thanks for e v erything.
Good e v ening.
Good e v ening.
- You broke the window.
- What?
Turn around, spread your legs
- and put your hands on the car.
- What's going on?
Did you hear me?
I'm going to handcuff you.
- Right arm first--
- No need to touch me.
- Behind your back.
- Quit touching me.
Let me go!
You'll do to me what you did to your husband and daughter?
What?
The s car-- you are famous among your colleagues.
You should be dead, but you sav ed yours elf.
Where is Tomas Sanz?
Your good luck is someone els e's mis ery, right?
- Tomas Sanz.
- Let's make a deal.
I take you to him, and you forget about me.
You spent your insurance mone y on that?
Will it do?
Yes.
What did Tomas do to you?
Wait till he reaches the Jew.
- Who?
- The Jew.
H e surviv ed a concentration camp and liv es in a casino.
If he touches you, your gift is gone.
You be come normal.
But I don't belie v e that.
We are the way we are.
Tonight, we'll play with the captiv es-- morons who let us bring them bad luck.
All you do is touch them as much as possible to steal the little luck the y might hav e.
Then we roll the dice, and the highest number wins.
It's going to rain like hell.
You should hav e brought warmer clothes.
Bad mummy...
What's wrong?
Don't you hav e anything to say?
I D, pleas e.
FOR TH E DEATH OF A SPO U SE...
FOR TH E DEATH OF A C H ILD...
Place your bets, pleas e.
Is it authentic?
- What will we wager?
- My hous e.
What, now?
During the game, think of something nice.
It'll go better if you're relaxed.
Think of the good times you'v e had in your life.
With Ana, for instance.
- Why don't you play?
- I don't hav e the gift.
Are you sure?
If you don't hav e it, you're nobody.
- The guy with Tomas is older.
- Gentlemen, pick your captiv es.
The y should be here.
The next game's in two weeks.
- Let's go.
- No.
- You'd be out of the game for good.
- Pleas e, mov e forward.
This is the only way to get to him.
The man with the gray hair.
The man with the gray hair, pleas e mov e forward.
Come clos er to the window.
Pick the one that turns you on the most.
The man with the orange sweater.
The man with the orange sweater, pleas e mov e forward.
The winner gets the wagers plus the captiv es.
Scarv es.
Don't you worry, this is the best part.
Well... let's start.
Don't start y et.
Miss, mov e forward.
Your hand, pleas e.
Six and four-- 1 0.
Your hand, pleas e.
Three and two-- fiv e.
On the ground !
This game's inv alidated.
She was in the hospital when I woke up.
It's all good.
- She pointed her gun at me twice.
- But she didn't arrest you.
You bitch !
You fucked me ov er.
You should hav e arrested him after the game.
You don't des erv e your gift.
- What about this?
- It's ours. Put it away.
What's up with that?
- We wager people now?
- Got a problem with that?
That girl... what will happen to her?
- She'll probably die from a cold.
- Come on.
I don't know.
The picture, the kiss-- she must hav e a crush on you.
What?
You stole her good luck through the picture. She's yours now.
From now on, we'll wager people's luck.
The more pictures, the more luck for you.
You don't belie v e me, do you?
Some sickos like to wager people's pictures.
It's the easiest way for you to make mone y and leav e.
Well, I don't like it.
I won't play that way.
I don't s ee any other way.
It's up to you.
You accept it and stay, or you go rob another bank.
But hurry up. That cop will soon come to her s ens es.
- You asshole.
- I'm only taking care of business.
FILE: H ORACIO C APARROS
Place your bets, pleas e.
Wait for me in the woods.
Are you ready?
- Did you wager it all?
- I play to win.
The che ck too?
After tonight, no more running away, no more sleeping in the car and eating shit.
After tonight, we're off to U canca for the last game.
U canca?
What we'll win there is way bigger.
It's a question of dignity, of getting what you want and earning respe ct.
I like that.
What, respe ct?
I like that you actually hav e a reason for doing this.
When you win in U canca, you'll be the luckiest man on earth.
And our work will be done.
You'll buy me a drink.
Or 1 0.
Now, try to concentrate.
E v eryone here would kill to go to U canca.
Come on !
Faster!
Run !
Come on, run !
Go, go!
Only two left!
Go, go!
Stop, Alejandro!
You are the winner.
Federico?
Federico?
I want someone to open the door for me.
It's wide open.
Can you drop me off at the train station?
What is she doing here?
What the fuck is she doing here?
Put that back where it was.
Put it in the briefcas e.
Sorry, but she's mine.
Get out.
Come on, beat it!
I'm sorry.
This should hav e ne v er happened.
You wouldn't be here if we had found Tomas.
Ana... you hav e to help me.
Talk to me.
Let's start from the beginning.
Why didn't you take that plane?
It didn't do you any good to leav e him and es cape the accident.
H e surviv ed too, and look where that led you.
Your bad luck is Tomas' fault.
H e can go to hell.
I don't belie v e you.
H e pre v ented me from taking that plane.
At the airport, he said,
''I don't lov e you anymore.''
H e sav ed my life.
- What did you say?
- I don't lov e you anymore.
Is something wrong?
Why do we hav e a copy of Caparros' file?
The court required one.
- What for?
- H is ex-wife filed a complaint.
H e committed suicide, but she wants the insurance mone y.
And Van Kuipp Life refus es to pay.
Van Kuipp Life?
It's the insurance company from the plane crash.
That's mine.
Good e v ening.
- Are you Claudia?
- Yes, I am.
Wait, don't hang up.
I hear you're in charge of Caparros' and Sanz's files.
That's right.
But I spoke with someone els e at the hospital.
You son of a bitch !
You son of a bitch !
Tough luck.
Tough luck... right!
What will happen to Ana?
We can get her back.
How so?
Wager and win her picture back.
But the guy's off to U canca.
- It belongs to someone els e now.
- To whom?
Samuel Berg... the Jew.
How do you know?
H e's the fucking king of fate.
No one has surviv ed
U canca in 30 y ears.
You bastard !
That's where you were taking me !
You shouldn't hav e lost.
That's why I wagered Ana.
What's the game?
You're giv en a gun loaded with fiv e bullets.
You shoot first.
If you kill him, you win.
If not... the Jew shoots.
Fiv e to one... could be wors e.
The guy who got luckier than you, died.
I make the de cisions.
Who will you wager?
The y took a plane to U canca.
Why are you bringing me a los er?
Don't play.
G érard told me you us ed his girlfriend without his knowledge.
Nobody's e v er come here out of lov e.
Your boy des erv es to play.
I don't usually talk to the people who come to play.
But this time...
I want to make an exception.
Look at this.
E v ery morning, the door of the barrack got opened, and the y took a few out.
First, the oldest... then our parents, then the brothers and sisters.
In a couple of weeks, there were only about 50 of us left-- all children.
Suddenly, the y just stopped coming.
Then... one day... a man appeared.
H e was not a guard.
H e was wearing... a sand-colored suit.
Spotless it was.
And he held a black handkerchief to his nos e.
We didn't smell too good, you s ee.
And one by one, he took us by the arm and... jolted our numbers down in his notebook.
We would be called and reunited with our parents.
And then he left and ne v er came back.
But the guards returned.
The y lined us up and shouted a number.
I looked at my arm... it wasn't me.
It was one of the others.
And as he walked through the door, he turned and looked at us all, thrilled to bits that he had won... and disappeared.
And so on.
E v ery day, another number.
Or two.
Or none.
Sometimes the y would just stand, looking at us, and then leav e.
In the end, only Daniel and I were left... for four days alone.
And we talked.
We talked a lot.
Daniel knew things.
H e us ed to help his father at the watchmaker's shop.
Did you know that... if you stare at the minute hand hard enough, you can s ee it mov e?
That photo is of H elena, his sister.
Daniel knew that it wasn't our parents who would wait for us outside.
And the day the door opened again,
I took my friend's hand... and I clos ed my e y es, willing it not to be my number.
When Daniel let go of me,
I couldn't open my e y es again.
I didn't want to look at him face to face.
H e just said to me,
''It's yours,'' and walked off.
And... he left the photo in my hand.
The next time the door opened... the uniforms had changed.
Well, if you're ready,
I think it's time to play.
I found an ele v ator leading to the bas ement.
Roberto?
Carlos, Javier, can you hear me?
Federico, you hav e to go.
Hav e faith.
Remember that you came out intact.
I don't lov e you anymore.
Let's get out of here !
Your work is done.
Leav e now.
God damn it, Federico, our work is done.
Come on.
We won.
No, you won.
Take care of yours elf.
Sara? Are you there?
To my father
Yes, believe your eyes.
Those are the northern lights... on viewabove the city for the first time in nearly 80 years. lt's 5..00a.m. Hello, New York.
The big story this morning... is the Amazins taking the field today in Baltimore... for their final practice before tomorrow's opener... of the 1969 Worlds--
Sanitation workers discovered the deadbody of another nurse in Queens.
This is the third nurse killed in what
New York papers are now calling... the ''Nightingale Murders. ''
All three victims have been nurses, each found strangled... with their hands gruesomely bound behind their backs with tape.
The lights, also known as the aurora borealis--
Look out!
Move it!
Manhattan calling Eye of the Storm.
Engine Company 12,
Ladder Company 93... respond to Manhattan box 132 off-ramp of the George Washington Bridge.
On our way.
Confirm overturned tanker. Workers trapped in underground substation.
Frank! We're second in.
- We got the rescue.
- Okay.
Commander, what do you need done?
That dike's about to go, and we're one spark away from losing the block.
- Is there another way in?
- That manhole leads to the vault.
Forget it, Sullivan.
Vault door's rusted shut, and they can't kill the juice.
Isn't enough time to make it!
What? Miss the World Series?
Not a chance. Give me my tools.
Sullivan! This is Commandero Connell.
Can you hear me?
- I hear you, Commander.
- The gasoline is risin 'in the vault.
Those downed cables hit that gas, it's gonna blow.
- Way to go, Gib.
- I shoulda been a god damn mailman.
Clear this channel.
Explosion's imminent.
Hey, guys!
Can you hear me?
- Yeah, we're in here.
- We're comin' in.
Get us outta here!
He's got a broken leg!
Get us out!
It's gonna flash. Get outta there.
Dike isn't holdin'.
- Get us out!
- Frank, do you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you, Butch.
- Grab that ax.
- Here.
Give me a whack. No sparks. Again.
One more.
Okay, stand back.
Oh, thank God.
Oh. Yeah, my leg's all busted up.
- Please hurry.
- We're in, Butch.
Get 'em and get the hell out.
Hey, fellas, time to go home.
Watch it, watch it!
- It's gone! It's gonna break!
- Back, back! Let's go!
That's an order.
Everybody goes.
All right, let's move before the gas lights up.
Watch that wire.
Get out, for Christ's sake.
I gotcha.
Butch, Butch, we're comin' out right now.
- Go!
- You all right? Watch your head.
Get up that ladder.
Go ahead.
Get up, get up!
Go on up!
Go! Right behind you.
Keep going.
Pull him out.
Come on! Come on, come on.
I gotcha. I gotcha.
Welcome to the company, Gib.
Hey, fellas.
- Hey, Dad.

- Inside the house.
October 10th
Hey,Jules.
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, bud.
That was ''Heat Wave. ''Martha and the Vandellas on WOR New York radio.
Hey, how about a little bit of the King, huh?
Yeah, why not a little of the King?
- Damn!
- You all right?
Yeah! I think I ruined the sauce.
Again.
What's the matter, bud?
You havin' trouble working an eight-hour shift at the hospital... watchin' the kid, whippin' up a little Bolognese?
- You didn't marry Donna Reed.
- Hey!
I'd go for you and Chinese takeout over her any day.
Because l love you too much
Baby
Why can't you see
- What you're doin' to me
- How was your tour?
The usual. You know.
- Butch called.
- Did he?
He did.
It was under control, bud.
Butchy, he's gettin' a little tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank.
Long as you get there.
All right, Chief, when I let go,
I want you to keep pedaling.
Daddy, put the wheels back on.
I'm gonna fall.
Don't worry about falling.
You're ready to do this.
Come on. Spirit and guts, okay?
All right. Keep pedalin'.
I'm gonna let go.
That's it!
Keep pedalin'.
Keep pedalin', keep pedalin'.
Yeah!
- Ow!
- You all right? You all right?
- No, Dad.
-Johnny!
You okay? You hurt? You okay?
- I wanna go to my room.
- Okay. Go on, honey. It's okay.
Hey, come on, Chief.
Don't quit on me now.
Don't be so tough on him, Frank.
He's just a kid.
He just needs to know you're behind him.
Okay. You're right.
All right.
CQ-22, this is W-2-QYV, by for call.
Because of the solar activity.
Yeah, it's beautiful. We got the sky over my house lit up like a bonfire.
Word is the sunspots are shooting off flares... that stretch out half a million kilometers.
Tell me about it. l'm pickin' up signals from places l could never reach before.
Francis, is that you?
How are you doing?
Hey, l'm doing just great.
How you doing?
Fantastic. My wife, Sophia, she's gonna give me another baby.
Wow!
October 10th
So, that's it, Samantha?
You're just walkin' out?
I've been walkin' out for six months, John.
You just didn't notice or care.
You were right.
We shoulda quit a long time ago.
I'm sorry. I know it's my fault.
I can't change, Sam.
I wish I could, but I can't.
John, it's that you won't change.
And that's what hurts so much.
Good-bye, Chief.
Next up,Johnny Sullivan. lt's a hit up the middle.
Johnny's gonna hold at first.
And now batting for Johnny's father,
Coach Newman.
Checks the runner and fires.
Lined hard to right.
- No problem. One on, one out.
- Hi, Uncle John.
- I'm not your uncle, kid.
- Hey, Sully, is that you?
- Gordo, why are you guys in my house?
- My TV's out again.
- Hey, uh, you want a brewski?
- Yeah.
- Deep fly ball into center field.
- Do you believe Linda... still won't let me cook in the house?
- I melt one lousy frying pan.
-John, guess what.
- Dad's takin' me fiishin'. Wanna come?
- I wish I could, Gordy.
But you bring me back a big one, okay?
-Is it okay if Gordy uses your old gear?
-Yeah, I think it's in the hall closet.
- If you can find it.
- Gordy, have a look, huh?
So Yahoo went up another five points today.
- Man, did I miss the boat on that one.
- Shoulda, woulda, coulda, pal.
So Sam called Linda.
Dad, John, come here.
What are you doin' back there?
- Dad, check it out.
- Wow!
Fire department.
Can I open it up?
Sure.
- Whoa!
- Eh, eh, eh, give me that gun.
All right?
- Hey, what's this, Dad?
- Oh, my God.
John, it's your dad's old ham radio.
Remember how we used to beg him to let us talk on this thing?
- This is not a toy.
- Is not a toy.
- Can we try it, Dad?
- Ask Uncle John.
- Can we try it?
- What the hell.
All right.
Let's grab this baby out.
This is what we used when I was your age.
Let's go over to the den, huh?
Plug it in, just like old times.
We want CW or LSB.
Standby function. Operator, come on.
I don't know what's goin' on.
Let's take a look under the hood, huh?
See what we got here.
Check this baby out.
There she is.
So this is what people used before the Net, huh?
Well, not exactly. I'll tell ya.
Hams were--
Ah, bingo.
These babies were different.
Not everybody had one of these... and you needed a special license just to be able to talk on 'em.
Damn. I just-- I just--
- I don't think it's gonna work here.
- It's junk, kid.
Nobody uses those things anymore.
Gordo! Do you know what time it is?
Hey, John.
- Hi, Linda.
- Come on, Gordy, let's go.
I'll catch you later, all right?
If I'm lucky.
So feed him.
Put it down there for him. l'm not gonna speak if you continue to say that word.
Hi, this is Julia Sullivan.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Ma, it's me.
Just checkin' in.
You're probably at work.
Anyways, um, I'll see you tomorrow night.
- My grandmother was senile.
- Love you.
She had such fun on her birthdays.
She'd open her presents... and drift off, then look down, see her present and get happy again.
That's what my father does with his breakfast cereal.
The aurora borealis, to anyone who's seen it... is one of the stunning events of your lifetime.
They're brighter these days. ls something going on there?
Do they tie in with your field?
Where do they come from? lt's a stunning sight. lt's beautiful to look at. l don't think we've seen one quite this bright for maybe 30 years.
 ''Professor''
But, from the point of view of physics and string theory... there's nothing really that we gain... from studying the aurora borealis.
Now history does teach us everytime we thought we had it figured out... there was some major discovery right around the bend... that required a dramatic change in our understanding of the laws of physics.
This is aphrase people have begun to hear-- string theory.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
String theory dramatically changes... our understanding of space and time.
For example, string theory requires our universe to have ten... or possibly even eleven dimensions.
And the strange thing is some physicists are even pursuing the idea... that there might be more than one time dimension.
So, in addition to time as we knowit, psychological time...
- which seems to organize events--
- CQ-15, W-2-QYV, by for call.
CQ-15, CQ-15, come in, 15.
Uh, hello?
Hey, W-2-QYV here.
Who have l got?
Name's John.
License to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I really don't remember how this thing works.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.
Unless this is an emergency, you're gonna have to get off the band.
Hey, pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Where you transmittin' from?
Queens, New York.
Well, what do you know?
Bay side, born and raised.
No kidding? I thought these things were for talking around the world.
Yeah, well, the 15 band closes down at night... but during the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
- You must be a real old-timer, huh?
- Days like this...
I feel like I'm gettin' there, you know?
So, Queens, you psyched for the Series, huh?
You know, l really don't follow baseball anymore.
What?
- I got fed up with all the bullshit.
- What are you talkin 'about?
Let me tell you, a thousand years from now... when school kids study about America... they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, rock and roll... and baseball.
How can you live in Queens and not love the Amazins?
The Amazin' Mets?
What, the '69 Series?
Man, I'll love Ron Swoboda till the day I die.
Well, now I'm with ya.
He's got the heart of a lion.
Mets can't win game one without him.
- Can you hear me?
- Game one? What are you talkin' about?
It was all over after Buford nailed
Seaver's second pitch outta the park.
Hey, no way, buddy. Ain't gonna happen.
Hey, CQ-15. CQ-15.
Are you there?
Who the hell was that?
Queens? Are you there, Queens?
Did I lose ya?
Hey, Frank, give the radio a rest.
Your son wants to say good night.
All right, I'll be right there.
Elvis, you all right?
Oh, sorry.
- You okay, Frank?
- We're fine. You all right?
You okay, buddy?
The sunspots are going to have a serious impact... on radio communication for the next six or seven days. ln fact, quantum theory tells us the rigid notions... of past, present and future, although use fulin day-to-day life... may dissolve and be replaced by a complex formulation... in which time is far more fluid than anybody would have imagined.
Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack
I don't care if I never get back
'Cause it's root, root, root
For the home team lf we don't win
Two, three strikes you're out
At the old ballgame
You got it. That's perfect.
Hey, Butch, you gotta turn the whole set.
Can't wait till the game.
It's not the tuner, it's the antenna.
- Proby.
- What?
Point the antenna out from under the house a little bit.
There it is.
Hey!
- I'm gonna get a beer. Want one?
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Proby, walk away.
- Walkin' away.
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
- Here we go, Butch. Here we go.
- Hey, Satch. Grab a seat. Come on.
Sully, I think I need to get a new set of cleats. I lost my footing there.
Yeah! Yeah!
- Right.
- Dr. Deleon, you decided to join us.
You don't wanna know.
Thirty-six hours,
I was bouncing off the walls.
That's why you're the doctor and I'm the nurse.
- Hey, baby. Can I get you something?
- No, it's all right.
- I am starving.
- I'm ready.
Sit down.
- How you boys doin'?
- Good, Satch.
- Okay, I got something for you.
- I can't believe it!
- And I got something for you.
- Whoa!
- Dad, look!
- What? You gotta be--
Hey, Satch, you Santa Claus?
Game three tickets.
Did you say thank you or what?
- Thank you, Uncle Satch.
- You're welcome.
Thank you. Thank you, Satch.
Hey, hey, all right, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Everybody.
- Everybody say, ''Amazin' Mets.''
- Amazing Mets!
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.
You ain't never gonna find another one like Sam.
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
- Nothin' you're willing to do.
- What's the story?
Construction crew found a body, actually, a skeleton.
Okay. Well, be real careful when you pull it out.
- Make sure you get the dirt around it.
- Yes, sir.
- So, what's this construction?
- I think I'll visit the neighbors.
Yeah, okay.
- What did they tear down here?
- Greek diner.
Used toget breakfast there all the time.
Them Greeks were good people.
- Careful. It's hot.
- Thank you, Mrs. Shepard.
Once that McDonald's opened up on
Dyckman, they lost all their business.
- I see your son's on the job.
- Was.
Jack died a while back.
It's hard, I know.
It just seems like yesterday.
My son lived and bled blue.
- l wanna get outta here.
- Okay, Detective.
- Give my regards to Steph.
- Sure will.
This isn't gonna be anything but a history lesson.
Let's go back to the house.
- Hey, Barney. How you doin'?
- Good.
- There you go. Have a good night.
- Bye.
- I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
- Hey, sounds good.
I'm sorry Samantha couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are drivin' her crazy.
- How's it comin'?
- I got the VCR hooked up.
It's just this friggin' clock.
Doesn't matter.
- God damn it. I'm sorry, Mom.
- Hey, you know, it's all right.
- I'm sure everything'll work out.
- What's that?
- With Sam.
- Oh, yeah, you know... just a tough time right now, you know.
- So how are things at the hospital?
- Fine.
- Hey, Dr. Schwartz retired last month.
- No kidding.
- He must've been pushing 90.
- Close, yeah.
So, how'd you like The Lion King?
Oh, I loved it, you sweet kid.
I wish you'd gone.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
It's just work.
Yeah, well, you work too hard.
Look who's talkin'.
- It's tomorrow.
- Thirty years.
I wish I could remember him better.
He was just a big kid.
He wanted to play baseball forever.
And fighting fires, he loved that.
And you-- he loved you.
- Okay, guys, bedtime.
- Okay, Mom.
Looking good.
We'll do it again tomorrow, Chief.
Good night, Dad.
CQ-15, CQ-15.
W-2-QYV... calling unidentified station, Queens.
CQ-15, W-2-QYV... calling unidentified station, Queens.
- CQ-15. Come in, Queens.
- Hello.
Hey, hey, is that you? I've been tryin' to call you all night. Where you been?
Hey, I--
How the hell did you do it?
- Do what?
- Do what? The Series.
You called Buford's homer.
How the hell did you do it?
It wasn't too tough, buddy, the game happened 30 years ago.
Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.
So I suppose you could tell me what happened in game two, huh?
Yeah, sure. Top of the ninth.
Al Weis, game-winning RBI single.
Brooks Robins on grounds out to end the game.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball song.
Hey, Little Chief.
You all right?
Well, you just go on up. l'll be there in a minute, allright?
Allright.
- Sorry about that. That was my kid.
- What'd you just say?
I said, sorry about that.
My kid just came in.
- You call your son ''Little Chief''?
- Yeah.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank. Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke? Gordo, is that you? Are you messing with me?
No, I ain't messin' with you.
Look, I'm just tryin' to figure out--
You're tellin 'me your name is
Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens... and you wanna know how I called the first game of the 1969 World Series?
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanna know.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me.
What'd you say your--
What'd you say your call station-- or your call letters were?
W-2-QYV.
Now you listen to me.
My name is John Francis Sullivan.
I live at 343 42nd Avenue, where I lived my whole life... and I saw the first game of the 1969 World Series right here...
- in this house 30 years ago.
- Bullshit.
My father's name is
Francis Patrick Sullivan.
He was a firefighter and a die-hard Mets fan... and every night when I went to bed, he sang, ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game.''
Hey, who the hell are you?
Son of a bitch.
- What's goin' on?
- Nothin's goin' on.
Oh, my God.
You burnt the desk.
I can see it.
Are you still there?
I said, you burnt the desk.
I can see it. Hello?
Hello?Are you still there?
Come back. Talk to me.
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You listen to me right now.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know why you're doing this.
But let me tell you something, asshole.
You stay away from me and my family.
No, no, no, you gotta believe me.
I don't know how this is happening, but it's me, Little Chief.
Hey, hey, hey, look, look,
I am warning you!
If you touch my kid, I will hunt you down till the day I die. You got that?
But you already died.
What are you talkin' about?
The Buxton fire.
Oh, yeah?
And when did that happen?
Thirty years ago?
October 12, 1969.
Tomorrow.
You're tellin' me I'm gonna d--
Look, lain't dyin' in no fire tomorrow or any other day, you got that?
Listen, tomorrow hasn't happened.
That's right, it hasn't happened.
It ain't gonna happen.
You gotta listen to me.
It was an abandoned warehouse.
Butch always told Ma it wasn't your fault. You went with your instincts.
- I'm warning you.
- Listen to me!
If you'd gone the other way, you would've made it.
Hello?
Hello? Shit.
- Sully, what are you doing, man?
- I talked to him. I talked to my dad.
Sull, go in the house, all right?
I'm gonna come over, we'll hang out.
No, no, no, I gotta get him back so he doesn't go in.
Go in? What are you--
Go in where?
The warehouse in Buxton.
It's tomorrow.
Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Thirty years ago? Yeah, sure.
So I suppose you can tell me what happened in game two, huh?
Yeah, sure. Top of the ninth,
Al Weis, game-winnin' RBI single.
- Come on, hit it out.
- Come on, Al.
- One run.
- Look at the stats. Look at them.
Let's go, Weis.
We have a three and two response,
Ladder 93.
You're first due. lt's reported to be an abandoned warehouse... at the foot of Water Street and Third.
Now, you got some construction limiting access.
Al Weis is having a great Series.
Yeah, they won!
You all right?
We know it's vacant.
Nobody goes in.
Surround and drown.
Call for a tower.
- Help!
- Shit. We got squatters inside.
Help!
- Help me! My sister's--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- She's up there. She passed out.
- Where is your sister?
- I tried to help her.
- Tell me! What floor?
She's up there on the top floor.
I tried, I tried.
- Please, help her! Please!
- Butch, take her.
Come on, follow me.
Anybody else up there?
Ryan, get her medical treatment.
- Give me my gear.
- You have fire in the top floor.
Yeah, these are good.
Hey, Sull.
- Hey, here he is. How you feelin'?
- What can I tell you?
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Better.
No visible fire first or second floor.
Watch your step, Proby.
This floor's rotten.
Fire on the third floor.
We need a line. We're goin 'up.
We got two lines comin'.
- Back out, kid. Wait for the line.
- To hell with the line.
- I'll find another way up.
- No, you can't help me here.
So you doin' okay, John?
You know, tough day, you know?
Hey, here's to your dad, huh?
Thirty years today.
To your dad.
To my dad.
We're pullin' everyone outta the building.
Get that ladder on the top floor. lt's cooking up here.
So after that Halloween thing with the fire truck-- You remember?
Yeah, I remember riding with Butch and your dad... and the whole neighborhood was watching.
I remember.
I wanted to go as a cop.
Yeah, so Jules makes your dad buy you that--
- that cop kit for your birthday.
- Oh, I remember that.
I was always the robber.
I was always being hand-cuffed.
That's right.
I taught you to do that.
10-45, I found the girl.
- She's breathin'.
- We're gettin' 'em out.
Hang on!
What the hell is goin' on?
- Gino, what's the matter?
- The gear box, it's cracked.
Frank, the ladder's jammed.
You gotta find another way out.
Frank, can you hear me?
It worked out okay, though.
You're a better cop than a fireman.
- No doubt about it.
- Worked out good for me too.
I'm glad I didn't have to spend ten years as his hose man.
Yeah, I bet you are.
The Buxton fire.
If you'd just gone the other way.
Frank, we're losin' the building.
I know.
Hey, hey, this is not a toy.
- Wave to your ma.
- Look at us.
You're gonna be some ball player.
- Whoa!John, are you all right?
-John,John.
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, can you bring a towel?
Satch, my father didn't die in a fire, right?
Gordo, my father didn't die in a fire.
No. What are you talking about?
He had cancer.
Cancer because of his cigarettes, right?
The cigarettes?
Yeah. Lung cancer. Ten years ago.
Little Chief.
Gordo, lain't dreamin' here.
I talked to him. It was real.
Little Chief!
- John, what are you talkin' about?
- It was the ham radio.
That's how come he didn't die.
Little Chief!
That's how come he didn't die.
John. John Sullivan, are you there?
Come on, answer me.
Chief. Chief, are you there?
I'm right here, Daddy.
Come here.
Come on.
- Where's Elvis?
- Sleepin'.
- Sleepin'. Why aren't you sleepin'?
- You woke me up.
I did?
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What's that?
All right, Chief.
What do you say we tame this bronco, huh?
- I'm scared.
- I know.
And you know what?
I'm gonna be right here with you.
Always.
Daddy, I can't.
Well, we can.
We can do it together.
You and me, spirit and guts.
What do you say?
- Okay.
- All right, come on.
Now you just take your time. I'm not gonna let go until you say it's okay.
- Okay.
- All right? Start pedaling.
That's it. Get your balance.
- Ready? Okay, I'm still here.
- Wait.
- Okay!
- All right.
- It's all you.
- Look at me.
It's all you.
It's all you, Chief.
- Look at me, Dad.
- Hey, look at you. You're doin' it.
- I'm doin' it.
- You're doin' it.
I'm doin' it.
- How's it feel?
- Good.
- This is great.
- Look at your balance.
- Like I'm on a flying trapeze.
- You're like a circus act.
- This feels great.
- You're goin' around the world.
- It's like flying.
- Wait till your mother sees this, huh?
- Look at me.
- Let's wake up the world, huh?
Oh, my God.
Hello?
- Hello?
-John? John Sullivan?
It's me.
You're the voice of an angel.
Reached right outta heaven and you pulled my butt outta the fire.
Tell me I'm not dreamin' here.
Tell me it's really you. lt's me, John.
This ain't no dream.
- But how could it be?
- I don't know. I don't know... but we gotta be talkin' off the mother sunspot of all time.
Yeah, l'd say so.
You okay, Chief?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
It's tough to explain.
I mean, I got all these new memories, but I don't know what to believe.
What do you mean?
'Cause I still remember what it was like when you died in the fire.
But l'm the only one.
I don't understand what you're talkin' about.
I remember both at the same time.
It-- It's like wakin' up from a dream, and you're not sure what's real.
I remember you bein' here, but I also remember when you weren't.
Oh, I'm sorry,John.
- I'm sorry. I never thought that--
- Well, you gotta think about that.
And you gotta be more careful,
'cause I can't lose you again.
Not like that.
You won't, John, you won't.
I swear to God, no matter what, not like that.
You got it? You hear me?
- You hear me, Chief?
- I hear you.
So how old are you?
- I'm 36.
- Thirty-six?
Well, you're all grown up.
You gotta be married and everything.
No, I'm not married.
Why? What are you, too busy playin' ball?
No, uh, it didn't work out.
I gave it up.
What happened?
I just blew my arm out my senior year... and didn't have a shot.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Johnny.
I know that had to hurt.
Yeah, thanks.
So, what'd you wind up doing?
You join the department?
Actually, I went the other way.
I'm a cop.
You're third-generation firefighter.
Come on, I thought you were gonna grow outta that cop phase.
Well, you got Satch to thank for that one.
You gotta be kiddin' me, huh?
Satch?
Well, he always was crazy about you ever since you were born.
You're still my Little Chief.
Right?
Right?
Yeah, I'm tryin' to be.
I'm tryin'.
Well, tell me about your self.
Tell me about your life.
I mean, where do I start, you know?
Mustang?
I don't own a Mustang.
Well, you will.
And you loved it.
- Fire-engine red.
- Yeah?
- Four on the floor.
- Seventy home runs?
That's a record that'll never be broken.
I wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit 66.
Really? You mean, like those big field radios you use in the army?
No, much smaller.
Works off a satellite or something.
You carry it around in your pocket.
Hey, what about Apollo?
How'd it all work out?
It was a great Series, Pop.
Amazing.
- So we win, right?
- Hold your horses. I'm gettin' there.
Game three. Agee came through, home red off Palmer in the second.
I knew it! I knew Agee was gonna have a great Series.
Forget about Agee. Wait until you hear what happened to Cleon Jones.
- You sound like your mother.
- Nah, I'm serious.
Oh, come on. Your grandfather-- he smoked, what, two packs a day.
- He's still kickin'.
- Not you.
It's gonna get the better of you.
Okay?
Well, I just knew.
She melted my heart.
That was it.
You got anybody?
Yeah, kinda.
There's somethin'
I gotta work out, but... she's worth it.
No, you, um, go ahead.
You, uh, get some rest.
I'm-- I'm tired too.
I almost don't wanna click off here like... maybe we won't get this back.
- We will.
- Okay.
I'll be here tomorrow.
I know.
I love you, son.
I--
I love you, too, Dad.
I've--
I've missed you so much.
Hi, this is Julia Sullivan.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Ma, it's me.
Just call me.
We gotta talk.
- Take over for me?
- All right.
- Frank, what's going on?
- Nothin'. Just wanted to see you.
Yeah?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules.
Not for the rest of your life.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I got a bad feeling today.
I was worried.
- Hmm? Look at me. Not a scratch.
- Where's Johnny?
He's at Gordo's.
I tucked him in.
- You give him his drops?
- One in each ear.
What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor.
Never have to work.
Oh, my God. What is he doin'?
Frank, I gotta--
Excuse me, Doctor.
Is that benazepril?
I gave this patient 50 mils of Benadryl on admittance. Mix them, and he's dead.
- Why wasn't I made aware of this?
- It's in his chart.
- Hello, Ma?
- Noah's Deli.
I'm sorry.
This is Noah's Deli.
- Sam, I gotta talk to you.
- Excuse me?
Look, I'm sorry, but I gotta talk to you.
How do you know my name?
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Look, I don't know you.
You don't know me?
What do you mean, you don't know me?
Wait. I do know you.
You're Linda and Gordo's friend.
The neighbor, the cop.
What are you doin' here?
I shouldn't have come here.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- What?
- Another rough night?
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.
Do not disrespect me, John.
Disrespect yourself all you want to, but not me or anybody else here.
Got that?
We got the preliminary for ensics on the skeleton.
Take a look at this.
Bad memories.
Can you imagine the odds of digging up a Nightingale murder?
- She makes ten.
- Ten?
No. I remember this case.
It was three. He killed three women.
What are you talkin'?
You know better than anybody, John.
You looked through these files a thousand times.
No.
Dad? You there?
Can you hear me?
Dad, I need you to be there.
Yeah, Chief, I'm comin'.
Listen, there's something
I need to t--
Right here.
Chief?
Something happened.
Something pretty bad.
What's the matter,Johnny?
- Mom. Something happened to her.
- Your mom. What?
She's not here.
What do you mean, she's not there?
She died. But it's like it just happened though.
She died? Your mom just died?
No, Dad. It happened a long time ago.
A long time ago for me.
When?
October 22, 1969.
That's now, Johnny.
That's next week.
How? You gotta tell me how.
- She was murdered.
- What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
There was this case.
A serial. They never caught him, but he murdered three women.
All nurses between '68 and '69.
They call him the Nightingale.
The Nightingale? We've been watching it on the news. I was worried about it.
Dad, we did something.
Something to make it worse.
I don't understand.
He didn't just kill three women anymore.
He's killed ten.
Something we did changed the past.
- But how come your mother--
-Just think about it!
Everything you did is different than if you hadn't gotten out of that warehouse.
Now, what'd you do last night, Dad?
I talked to you.
I put you on the bike.
I tucked you in at Gordo's. I went to see your mother at the hospital.
Oh, shit! That's it.
She wasn't supposed to be there.
Butch went and got her because that was the night of the fire.
Something happened at that hospital?
It could have been anywhere or time that she wouldn't have been if you'd died.
I have to take her away from here.
- He cannot hurt her if I take her.
- What about the others?
- What about the others?
- I'll warn them.
They'll just think you're crazy.
I gotta do something. You don't even know what this guy looks like.
- No, because-- No, but--
- You don't know who he is!
Wait a minute.
Dad, I may not know who he is... but I know where he's gonna to be and what he's gonna do before he gets there.
Do I call the police?
They won't believe me.
They will if they catch him in the act.
And you can make that happen.
No, I don't know about--
I'm a firefighter.
I'm a cop! This is what I do!
This is something we have to do!
What if the ham stops working?
What if I can't reach you?
Then get Mom out.
But, Dad, those other women were not supposed to die.
If we don't try and stop this guy... we'll have to live with that for the rest of our lives.
- Okay. Tell me what to do.
-Allright.
The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.
It happens tomorrow. Case file says she left Roosevelt Hospital at 6:00.
Showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6:30.
She walked out of that bar around 7..30.
And they found her dead in an alley behind the bar at 8..00.
Follow her. See if anybody's watching her or hitting on her. l'm betting when she walks out of that place, somebody'll go out with her.
When they do, you call the cops.
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi ya, Glen. How you doin'?
Real good.
From the girls, pal.
All of them.
Thanks.
- Sit down.
- A fireman, huh?
- Yeah, I'm not really--
- Ah, a married fireman.
- Yeah.
- What the hell! What do they call you?
Frank.
7-4. Homicide.
Yeah, it's me.
You're kiddin'.
Hold on. Spell that for me.
Okay. Thanks, Mario.
Our lucky break.
Mario ID'd the dental.
Her name's Mary Finelli.
Reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16?
That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.
She's gone.
Carrie Reynolds isn't in here.
Who?
He did it.
Carrie Reynolds is alive and well, Dad.
- I'll be damned.
- Did you see him?
- Figure who he is?
- No, I messed up.
I kept talking to her.
I was afraid to let her out of my sight.
Who ever it was, he must've backed off.
That's okay. We're gonna get him.
This is gonna work.
I hope so.
- What else you got?
- We caught a break.
Found his first victim.
Her name is Mary Finelli.
Hang on a sec, John.
Jules, there's somebody
I want you to talk to, okay?
Remember I told you about this guy John?
I want you to say hello to him.
John, say hello to my wife, Julia.
Hi, John.
Frank tells me you're a cop.
Yeah, that's right.
My six-year-old keeps telling us he wants to be a policeman... right after he retires from the majors.
We bought him a badge and whistle for his birthday.
I remember.
I used to play cops and robbers... but you-- my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Sounds like your mom and I would get along.
Yeah, she's pretty special. l'm real proud of her.
Bet she's proud of you, too, being a cop and all.
I hope so. I hope she knows how much I love her.
Oh, she knows. Moms always know how much their kids love them.
Even if they don't tell them all the time like they should.
Well, I gotta go.
It was good talking to you, John.
Yeah, you too.
- I wanna talk on Daddy's radio.
- Okay, Chief, go ahead.
- Sweet heart, say good night to John.
- Good night, John.
Good night there, Chief.
Okay, guys. Bedtime.
No, I wanna talk on the radio, too.
-Allright, Gordo, come here.
- Gordo, two minutes, then bedtime.
Sit right there.
Press there.
This is the space cowboy. l'm an intergalactic traveler from the federation planet Earth.
- Gordo?
- How do you know my name, mister?
Listen, Gordo... my name is Santa Claus.
And I'm going to give you the biggest Christmas present you ever had.
I better give you my address then.
No, don't worry about it.
Now, this is important.
Something you got to remember for a long time. Yahoo.
What's that? lt's a magic word. lt's like-- lt's like abra cadabra, but even better.
Try it out, kid. Yahoo.
- Yahoo.
- You got it, space cowboy.
Gordo, your two minutes are up.
- Now go upstairs and write it down.
- Okay, mister.
- I mean, Santa.
- Come on.
Let's go. Stay there, John.
I'll be right back. Upstairs.
Jules, got a live one down here coming your way.
Yeah, Chief?
You still there?
- What do we do now?
- Okay, Sissy Clark.
- 423 Greenwich Street.
- Hang on, hang on. Go ahead.
Sissy Clark, 423 Greenwich Street, apartment 2E, tomorrow.
- Okay, 2E.
- Nurse.
Moonlights as a cocktail waitress at the Kaleidoscope on West 63rd.
Left work at 2 a.m... was killed in her apartment between 2:15 and 5:00.
Okay, I got it.
Dad, I don't know how long this thing is gonna keep workin '.
Or if we'll be able to talk again.
Just be careful.
I'm happy you found her, Detective.
It makes it easier now, to know for sure.
You know.
Can I keep these for a while?
Okay, just let me walk you through it.
I'm all ears.
Three guys show up in both the year book and diary.
First guy passed away ten years ago.
Second guy died in Vietnam.
And the third one is Daryl Simpson.
So I ran him through BCI.
Got a hit.
Busted for sexual assault eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
March 22, 1970.
So the murders stopped because he was off the street... and by the time he got paroled he had smartened up enough to control himself?
That's not the first time that's been true.
I got a feeling about this guy.
This is him, Satch.
- Can I get you another one?
- No thanks, I'm good.
Anything else?
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Five years.
But you got lucky, right?
You got away with something else.
Something you figured nobody knows about.
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know.
You went to Saint Ambrose with Mary.
You lived five blocks from her.
You liked her, but she ain't interested.
- That must've hurt, huh?
- So what?
- So, what'd you do about it?
- Nothing!
Spare a smoke?
Yeah.
Here, I'm trying to quit.
Oh, my God!
What is this?
Jesus! Jesus!
- Get that away from me!
- Sandra Moore. Patty Ryan.
Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you?
Julia Sullivan.
Does she mean anything?
Well, she means something to me!
See ya, fireman.
Don't talk so much next time.
Will you run my tips while I go change?
Thanks.
You know, Daryl... sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through... despite all that we are taught about right and wrong... despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves... we can come to a place... where we don't give a damn.
Know what lmean?
You'll tell me everything
I need to know now.
You got a minute?
Yeah, sure.
He ain't the guy, John.
Because he didn't want to look at the photos? Not everyone fits the profile.
If he was gonna give up something, he would've done it already.
You following me?
You following me?
I asked you a question, asshole.
Mary Finelli.
Whoa, dude!
What happened to him?
It was a bad trip, man. A little time kissing the porcelain, he'll be fine.
- I understand that.
- All right, come on, pal.
Open up!
Miss Clark! Open the door!
It's the police! Open the door!
It's okay, ma'am. Go back inside.
It's the police.
Are you in there? Open up!
I know you're in there!
Sissy Clark! Open the door!
Open the door!
He killed her.
I couldn't do a damn thing to stop it.
- lt's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
We changed everything, Johnny.
- It's like we cheated.
- Dad, we can't go back.
'Cause you didn't die in that fire.
No matter what you do, nothing is going to change it.
So all we can do is deal with this and try to make it right.
- I'm not a cop. I'm not fooling anyone.
- I know, but we can.
We can do it together.
Remember spirit and guts?
He's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license.
He knows where we live.
He took your--
He took your wallet?
Well, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
- He touched your wallet? Where is it?
- In my pocket.
- We got him, Dad. You got him.
- What?
You got his prints. Listen, you gotta get me that wallet.
- How the hell am I supposed to do that?
-As carefully as possible.
- Take your wallet out by the corners.
- What are you talking about?
- Dad, just do it.
-Allright.
All right. Right. Okay.
I got it.
Allright, listen.
I want you to wrap it up.
Put it in one of them plastic bags you keep the extra transistors in.
I see where you're going!
Beautiful. Now, l want you to hide it somewhere.
Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it for the next 30 years.
- I think maybe--
- Where?
The window seat in the dining room.
There's a loose board on the left, on the bottom.
Perfect! Beautiful!
It's in!
Great! Okay, l'm after it.
We're in business!
Now just sit tight and don't worry.
And the winner is--
Oh, man. It's a cop.
What the hell?
Son of a bitch.
Hey, Mr. Shepard. How are you?
Who's that?
Oh, hi, Detective.
I came by to wrap things up over there.
Thought I'd say hello.
I'm glad you did.
Come on in.
Thank you.
- Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Sure.
- Black? Sugar? Milk?
- Oh, you know. It's all good.
You'll get black.
Fresh pot.
- You know Jack?
- Not really.
He's still on the job?
He does a little P.I., but he's mostly retired.
Living off his pension, huh?
Jack got caught up in them knapp hearings.
Set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy.
Hurt him bad.
Would've broke his mother's heart.
- Is she around?
- Who?
- Your wife.
- No. She passed on a long time ago.
Long time ago.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.
Can I ask you how she died?
Well, she--
She was murdered.
An ugly one, to tell you the truth.
Mother of a cop, and they never found the bastard who did it.
You on the job?
A long time ago.
- Do I know you?
- I look familiar?
- What house you work?
- The 7-4. Homicide.
Mmm, a hot shot.
- No, just working the job.
- Yeah, I hear that, pal.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day.
One of  the Nightingale murders.
- No kidding?
- No. Missing teenager.
Disappeared back in '68.
We found her bones last week... buried behind some old diner out by Dyckman Street.
Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck!
The odds of finding that girl 30 years later and of hitting a dental--
Forget about it.
The best part is, she's the first victim.
And she knew the killer, so...
I'm betting those old bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
But not for nothing.
The past is a funny thing.
We all have skeletons in the closet.
You never know when they're going to pop up and bite you in the ass.
Huh,Jack?
You changed your M.O.
If they knew your mom was a Nightingale, they would've looked at the family.
They would've looked at you.
And what are you lookin' at?
Stealin' your life away.
You went down 30 years ago, pal.
You just don't know it yet.
A cop? He's a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that?
Call the FBI. Use a payphone.
Don't give him your name, Dad.
Say Shepard killed Finelli, Clark and the others. That he's the Nightingale.
Say where Finelli's body's buried.
They'll connect him to her.
- Frank here?
- They'll search his place.
They'll find some souvenirs. He always took a piece of his victims' jewelry.
- Satch.
- Hey, Frank.
- What are you doing here? Are you off?
- We need to talk.
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec, John.
I'm in the middle of something important here. Mind if we do this-- l'm sorry, Frank, but we need to step outside right now.
What's happening?
John, Satch is here.
- He's with his partner.
- What's going on?
Hang on a sec.
- What's your partner doing here?
- What happened to your eye?
Banged it up.
Let's talk outside.
- We need to do that.
- About what?
- Let's go. Do us both a favor.
- All right.
Stay there. I'll be back.
Be right back, all right?
So where were you last night, Frank?
Where do you think I was, Satch?
Same place I found this.
Under the body of a dead woman.
No, this isn't what you think.
- This isn't what you think.
- I want to be wrong.
So let's take a ride down to the precinct and talk about it.
- Yeah, I need to talk to you, too.
- Come on, we'll take a ride.
All right. Let me tell my family where I'm going.
All right? Be right back.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
- Chief, you there?
- Yeah.
They found Sissy Clark.
They think that I did it.
- Frank.
- Give me a second.
Don't do this!
- What's going on?
- Uncle Satch, don't!
What's going on?
He's a cop.
A cop.
Jack Shepard.
He's a detective in the 15th precinct.
I swear, Satch.
And you got all this from the guy on the radio, from your son in the future.
Yeah. As nuts as that sounds, yeah.
You've gotta listen to me, open up your mind and try to understand what I say.
You got something going on with this girl, that's one thing.
But you gotta tell me.
Are you listening to me?
You're in a world of shit!
An eyewitness puts you outside the dead girl's apartment.
Your prints are all over the place, not to mention the license.
Chuck is getting a search warrant for your house.
- What's he going to find, huh?
- Nothing.
Give me something, something I can believe. lt's number five for Dave McNally.
Two Mets are out in the fifth inning.
What if I can prove it to you?
How's that?
World Series. Where are they right now? What? Fifth inning?
What if I were to tell you... that in the bottom of the sixth inning... the Mets are gonna be down three-zip?
Cleon Jones is gonna come to bat.
He's going to get hit... in the foot by a wild pitch.
It's gonna leave a shoe polish mark on the ball.
Hear me out!
Hear me out, all right?
He goes to first.
Clende non comes up.
He's gonna hit a two-two pitch into the left field bleachers.
This is insane.
In the bottom ofthe seventh,
Weis is gonna hit a solo home run... and Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the eighth.
The Mets are gonna win that game, five to three.
Go watch that game.
If it don't happen, I'm a liar.
- Go watch the game?
- Yeah, watch the game!
Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murder!
And they're gonna match that with the Nightingale murders.
Do you understand what that means?
His wife is here.
She wants to talk to you.
Let's walk, Jules.
Get a cup of coffee.
How you doin'?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Yeah.
Everything okay with you and Frank?
Yeah, we're good. He works hard.
I work hard. We're good.
Who's Sissy Clark, Satch?
Do you know where Frank was last night?
Yeah, he was working. He had a tour.
Sit down.
Did you hear what I said?
So how'd you know?
- Hey, this guy tried--
- How you doin'?
What's happening?
Shut up, asshole.
Mind if we take this outside?
He's trying to kill me.
Find Satch! He's trying to kill me.
What are you doing with my collar?
Listen, I'm sorry, pal.
I didn't mean to step on your toes.
They sent me from downstairs.
I thought you'd be with him.
What are you looking at him for?
He matches a description of an armed robbery suspect.
So tell me about the radio.
Who's he talking to on that thing?
John. He's a cop.
He talks to him all the time.
I've talked to him, too.
- You talk to Johnny on the radio?
- Yeah. John. What's going on?
You come and take Frank and now you're talking to me like a cop.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
'Cause as a cop
I wouldn't be here at all.
Listen, Jules... they're gonna take me off this case.
And then Frank is gonna tell them what he's been tellin' me.
And then nobody is gonna be able to help him. Okay?
Cleon Jones makes the catch.
Half the uniforms are at the game.
It'll be a riot if they pull it off.
What is he telling you?
That he's talking to Johnny on the radio.
Yeah. John, the cop.
I told you that.
No, he says that John... is your son, Johnny, little Johnny... on the radio in the future.
On the radio. You see?
No. You mis understood him.
- Sissy Clark?
- Yeah.
She's a nurse.
And she was murdered yesterday.
And Frank is connected.
He is either a material witness or accomplice or the perpetrator.
McNally, who's been thoroughly in command.
Cleon starts down to first base, and DeMiro calls him back.
Satch, you know he didn 't do this.
Right?
Carrying the baseball, he's coming overnow.
- Hodges showing the baseball to DeMiro.
- Can I see him?
Hodges-- We might have a shoepolish play here.
Remember the Nippy Jones shoe polish play in the 1957 World Series... at Milwaukee?
Hodges showing it to DeMiro, who awards first base!
My God.
Satch, what's going on?
Mind if I go back at the fireboy?
I wanna see what he's got.
Jesus.
It's out down here!
Hey, bud.
Go ahead.
See if aviation's got a helicopter... for commencing an airsearch for body in water.
It was a season and World Series for the ages for the Mets and MVP Don Clenden on.
For the Mets faithful, the New York fans, wow!
Here's your coffee and cigarettes.
I'll be upstairs. lncredible sun storm has created a remarkable aurora borealis.
A cold front, and the aurora is already dimming and will be overby morning.
John, are you there?
John, l'm back.
-John, are you there?
- I'm here, Dad.
- We did it, son.
- What?
- We stopped him.
- We did?
Yeah.
There's something-- Something's wrong.
I don't--
What's wrong?
If we stopped him, why isn't Mom here?
Why don't I remember her being okay?
But I killed him. He's dead.
My turn to steal... your life away.
John? Johnny, you there?
Hey, bud.
Julia!
Mommy?
No!
Hey, Johnny.
It's okay, it's okay.
What are you gonna do, Frank?
Put the gun down.
Let him go!
You put the gun down.
I'll snap his neck.
Put the gun down now.
Time to die, Sullivan.
Time to die.
Run, Johnny, run, run, run!
Run!
Come here. You all right?
You all right?
I'm still here, Chief.
'Round the horn, 'round the horn.
Come on, new batter, new batter, new batter!
Come on, Frank!
The Benz! Not the Benz!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Nice hittin', Frank.
Way to go.
Thank you very much.
Let's play some ball.
Come on.
New batter, new batter, new batter.
Go get it!
He's slow! He's old!
- Come on, Johnny.
- Bring me home, Chief.

WOMAN: 12 years of war.
12 years since
Emperor Shaddam IV was defeated and Paul Muad'Dib's wild Fremen spread out across the universe, exterminating all that remained of the old Imperial armies.
Colonising the planets of the known universe one by one, under his rule.
Sweeping away anything and anyone who resisted.
Millions have been defeated, millions more have been slaughtered.
There are no innocents anywhere and the name of Muad'Dib is no longer a prayer.
For many, it is now a curse.
MAN: The mercy of Muad'Dib is comfort to all enemies.
The compassion of Muad'Dib...
MAN: Commander Farok!
The conversions have begun!
Anyone refusing the peace of Muad'Dib will be executed!
So it is written!
MAN: You who deny the glory of Muad'Dib are condemned to death.
Sir, your son.
He's been wounded.
Your soul...
My eyes. My eyes!
I'm blind, Father. I'm blind.
Don't give me to the desert, Father.
Please!
Don't send me to die.
(Screams) Muad'Dib!
WOMAN: If history teaches us anything, it is simply this - every revolution carries within it the seeds of its own destruction, and empires that rise will one day fall.
Arrakis.
Dune.
Once the wasteland of the universe, now an Imperial capital, for it is here and only here the giant worms still roam, creating spice - still the greatest treasure in the universe, still the cause of conspiracy, betrayal and murder.
MAN: Alia!
WOMAN: Alia!
MAN: It's her!
WOMAN: The holy sister!
WOMAN: Alia!
Alia! Alia! Alia! Alia!
Alia! Alia! Alia! Alia!
In the beginning, we were all empty.
ALL: Ignorant of all things.
We did not know the power that resides in every place.
ALL: And in all time.
He is the power that awakens the soul.
ALL: And brings us joy.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
MAN: Muad'Dib!
I don't suppose you feel it's necessary to inform me when you go on these walkabouts?
You'd only try and stop me.
Again.
The streets are full of danger, Muad'Dib.
The truth is in the streets, Stil, not in this parade of sycophants who flutter around this palace with their meaningless statistics and empty ritual.
Ritual is the whip by which men are enlightened, Muad'Dib.
Tell me, Korba, when was it you reinvented yourself from
Fremen Fedaykin to religious fanatic?
The day you defeated Shaddam and his armies, Muad'Dib.
The day I saw the future.
The city's filled with adventurers,
Muad'Dib, not to mention agents of the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit and the former Imperial family.
Surely they conspire to something a little more elegant than assassination on the streets of Arrakeen?
You are vulnerable, Muad'Dib.
No matter how powerful you have become, you cannot escape this simple fact.
You're right about one thing, Stil.
There is no escape.
(Whispers) Chani.
I'm not asleep.
I thought the doctor said you were supposed to rest.
As long as you insist on wandering the city like some off-world pilgrim,
I will never be able to rest.
Are you going to lecture me too?
Hmm!
While I was walking,
I stepped in a puddle...
...an open pool of water in the street.
Muad'Dib has brought many wonders to Arrakis...
..the people say.
"Muad'Dib spends water like a madman."
That's what they say, Chani.
The old Fremen, I hear them...
...on the streets when I walk.
"We've become water-fat."
They resent the 'wonders'
I've brought to their desert.
They resent me.
You know what I'd pay to end these wars?
Separate myself from this...
...damnable myth I've become?
What's to stop you?
Command it, Muad'Dib.
After all, you are the Emperor.
Even if I vanished tomorrow, the revolution would follow my ghost.
This is not a clean place.
It's time to return to the desert.
We were happy there.
BOY: Father.
I'm waiting and I'm ready.
To know the future is to be trapped by it.
But knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
It's the first step along the Golden Path.
I'm the answer.
I'm ready, Father.
And I am ready, Father.
The answer's standing right in front of you, on the Golden Path.
Is there no other way?
Everywhere we turn, his power confronts us.
He's a curse.
He's a messiah.
You can't launch a frontal attack on a messiah.
Even if you succeed, their martyrdom remains.
But he is human, and because he is human, he has his weaknesses.
So, what do you suggest, Princess?
Something subtle, something... unexpected.
A ghost, perhaps?
Mmm.
May I introduce our friend,
Reverend Mother, Scytale of the Tleilaxu.
Get to the point, Wensicia.
I haven't travelled all the way to the edge of the universe to discuss nonsense with a... face dancer.
No, you Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of Muad'Dib's bloodline and because you want to break his monopoly on spice.
He who controls the spice controls the universe.
As long as Muad'Dib controls Arrakis, we are all at his mercy.
And that's why I intend to destroy that domination and return the Imperial Throne to the planet Kaitain, and the Corrino family, where it rightfully belongs.
Face dancers, sex toys, musicians, technicians.
Whatever the need...
...we have the breed.
Good God!
Good chemistry is more like it.
Duncan Idaho.
WENSICIA: Yes, the Atreides hero.
Paul Muad'Dib's most beloved friend and teacher.
But Idaho is dead.
Killed by your father's Sardaukar.
Even in defeat, my father's men did not abandon wisdom, Reverend Mother.
A few precious pieces of Idaho's ruined flesh, hidden away, saved.
Awaiting just the right time, the right place.
A perfect duplicate.
A perfect ghola.
Perfect gift for a lonely emperor.
A time bomb, waiting for the trigger to explode.
You intend to KILL Muad'Dib?
Exactly.
But that will mean chaos.
Spice production will be disrupted.
Learn the lesson my father ignored - it's not who controls the spice, but who has the ability to disrupt the spice who controls the universe.
But what makes you think
Muad'Dib will ever accept this... ghost?
I'm leaving it up to the Spacing Guild.
And what of the trigger?
The device to set the time bomb off?
Leave that to me.
Test after test, and still nothing.
I'm healthy, strong.
No matter what they do, the doctors can't find the reason why I am unable to conceive.
What does Muad'Dib say?
Muad'Dib is... afraid.
He fears for me if I have another child.
I can feel it.
He may be right to fear.
Someone has been feeding you a poison.
It's the only possibility left.
But the doctors have never found evidence.
They wouldn't.
Its traces are subtle, confusing.
Of the most sophisticated chemistry, beyond our knowledge.
Surely from off-world.
But... there are remedies.
The ancient Fremen diet, which might overcome the contraceptive's effects.
But it's dangerous.
You would be required to eat greater and greater quantities of spice.
And if you conceive, it will accelerate your pregnancy.
But the question remains,
"Who has been able
"to feed you the contraceptives for so long?"
MAN: Be that as it may, this is a question that cannot be delayed any longer.
The Great Houses are still demanding that a constitution be on the agenda at the next convention of the Landsraad.
It's nothing but a ruse, contrived by enemies of House Atreides to conceal far more sinister motives.
Perhaps we could offer the appearance of a constitution.
Something ceremonial.
It doesn't need to be real.
Deceit, after all, is a legitimate tool of statecraft.
Bravo, sister-in-law.
I couldn't have said it better.
Yes, perhaps something at the local level?
Something impotent.
Virtually meaningless.
No!
Atreides power must never be marginalised by the chaos of democracy.
I'm sure my brother agrees.
(Voice echoes) Father, Father.
I'm waiting.
You must decide.
It's the first step. It can't wait.
Love is all you have.
The answer's standing right in front of you but you must decide.
(Voice whispers) Muad'Dib.
Alia knows my mind.
I forbid a constitution.
"Order in Council this day, " etc, etc.
Irulan. Are you taking this down?
Yes, My Lord.
We will deliver the formal declaration when the Guild ambassador arrives to present his credentials.
Then there's nothing more.
A Guild embassy, Muad'Dib, on Arrakis?
The Council of Naibs won't like this, Muad'Dib.
We remember well how the Guild brought those who oppressed us, how they blackmailed us for spice to keep our secrets from our enemies.
Think I've forgotten, Stil?
This... decision troubles me, Muad'Dib.
There's something... reckless about it.
Not reckless, necessary.
You will know my reasons soon enough.
Now, I trust you'll convince the Naibs of the wisdom in this.
IRULAN: A Guild ambassador, here on Arrakis.
Muad'Dib's decision strikes some as mysterious, even dangerous.
But Muad'Dib never does anything without reason.
I should spill your water on the sand for what you've done.
I know it was you, Irulan.
You're the only one who could have hidden the poison.
(Hoarsely) Don't lie!
You will insult me if you lie!
It is my right to bear the royal heir.
It is your duty to play a role, nothing more.
I am his wife!
You have his name.
I am the one he calls 'wife'.
Do you think you are the only woman who truly loves him?
No.
But I am the only woman HE loves.
I could cuckold him.
Dare him to expose me.
Cuckold him all you like.
As long as you're discreet, he won't deny you.
But no child, Irulan.
Ever.
So, what do you think, Tyekanik?
Does my little prince have what it takes to lead a Sardaukar army one day?
There are many ways to lead an army, Princess.
Being a warrior is only one of them.
And not necessarily the best.
MAN: Prince Farad'N, your turn.
Muad'Dib's decision to accept the Guild ambassador is causing much unrest on Arrakis.
Hmm. Good.
Once the face dancer is insinuated into Muad'Dib's palace...
...we shall light the fuse.
PRINCE: Arggh!
And the Idaho ghola will do its work.
Mom! Mommy.
What is this?
I am sorry, Princess.
A future emperor crying?
I don't want to be an emperor.
Let someone else do it.
Oh, nonsense! Wipe your tears. Here.
Getting all over me now.
Alright, now, go back to your men.
Go back. Go.
Do you want the men to see you crying?
Do you want them thinking you're weak?
I don't care.
Well, I do.
So now you will go back.
And this time...
...you will do it properly.
Won't you?
Commander Farok, hero of the Naraj campaign.
I bring you greetings from your new friends on Salusa Secundus.
Hurry. The eyes of Muad'Dib are everywhere.
These are seats once occupied in sietch by Muad'Dib...
...during the days when he taught us the weirding way.
It is some time since you've seen him.
I think he's forgotten I ever existed.
He's blind.
Your son.
At the battle of Naraj.
I wonder if Muad'Dib knows how many have been maimed in his name.
I couldn't leave him to the desert.
Even I violated the old laws.
Laws of men have gone.
The laws of a god have replaced them.
We were a noble people once.
We had a proper sietch.
I owned a crysknife.
My own share of spice.
I was a rider of worms.
And then Muad'Dib came.
With his witch mother.
And he promised to fulfil Liet's prophecy.
And we fought.
You joined his jihad.
Do you know why?
I heard there was a thing called a 'sea'.
Men came back from Muad'Dib's wars and they said they had seen it.
And... did you find your sea?
It healed me of jihad.
Now I'm ready to help rid the universe of the cancer that is Muad'Dib.
And that is Otheym's daughter?
Lichna.
If you bring her to Muad'Dib, he will never refuse to see her.
I was hoping that's what you'd say.
Lichna.
I will enjoy being called Lichna.
What is the meaning of this?
Helen Gaius Mohiam of the Bene Gesserit, you have violated Muad'Dib's eternal order never to set foot on Arrakis again.
I am not on Arrakis. I am in free space.
There is no such thing as free space where Muad'Dib rules.
I abase myself before the Emperor.
We welcome you to our court,
Edric of the Spacing Guild, and to a new understanding between us.
Please allow me the honour of presenting His Majesty with a small token of our esteem.
According to our investigators, this one was killed here on Arrakis.
The body recovered after the unfortunate conflict between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.
Terrible wounds required many months of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.
We acquired him as a gift befitting an emperor.
What is your name, ghola?
They say it was Duncan Idaho.
Idaho is dead!
This... thing is a horror!
Send him away!
And do you enjoy the name?
It stirs up curious feelings.
You don't know who you are?
I know nothing of my past, Sire.
How was this one trained?
It amused the Tleilaxu to train him as a Mentat.
I beg you, My Lord!
Let me take its water.
Find quarters in the keep for the ghola, Stil.
We accept this gift in the spirit with which it was given.
Majesty, there is the matter of Reverend Mother Mohiam.
She was removed from our heighliner by your agents in violation of our neutrality.
Be careful, Ambassador.
To be neutral is to be indifferent.
You would do well to disassociate yourself from those who have proven they are not.
As you will learn, Edric, my sister has the pulse of the court.
Be advised.
Reverend Mother.
I shudder to see you in such circumstances.
I've been in worse.
Do the cards answer all your questions?
Answers only breed more questions.
What is important is how one navigates between the two.
So you haven't forgotten everything we taught you.
Has the Emperor explained why I am to be detained?
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.
But I hope it will not be too long.
We understand.
The sisterhood is aware of my delay?
They have changed your schedule in light of the situation.
I'll be patient, then.
You seem to be adapting to life here quite well.
I have made my peace with it.
I hope your training has been a help.
A comfort.
One day, even Muad'Dib will know the good you have done.
For us all.
You know how dangerous that was?
11 blades, Paul! 11!
Some of the finest swordsmen in the Imperium have never gone up against more than nine.
Experienced swordsmen would never be so reckless.
This is why you invaded my privacy?
To disapprove of my recklessness?
Spice gatherers found a body in the desert.
A young woman - a Fremen.
Fremen?
Decapitated.
And her hands removed.
So someone's afraid she'd be found before the desert does its work.
I want you to examine the scene the way our mother taught us.
You will take the ghola Mentat with you.
I assume you can handle him.
I should arrange a 'thopter.
Poison!
How can you tell?
The moulting of the skin.
Clearly the effect of rapid neurological atrophy - a Tleilaxu speciality.
Tleilaxu?
Face dancers.
This is a dead Fremen girl, My Lady.
What if there are no women reported missing amongst the Fremen?
Otheym's daughter, My Lord.
Lichna.
It's been many years since I've seen you.
And my father.
I must beg Muad'Dib's forgiveness for this intrusion, but...
...I am the smoke who banishes sleep in the night.
Sit.
Deliver your warning, then.
You must visit my father as soon as possible, My Lord.
There is a plot against you.
There are many plots against me.
This is a Fremen plot, Majesty.
My father has information for you.
But he is weak.
He is sick.
He needs you to visit so he can tell you.
Why didn't he tell you so you could tell me?
He feared I might be captured before seeing you.
If I know nothing, I can divulge nothing.
I leave for Otheym's tonight.
Otheym has missed... his old friend.
A face dancer.
Good one too.
Let me take its water.
No, Stil.
This must play out the way I've seen it.
MAN: Cursed be thy name, Atreides.
Your time has finally come.
BOY: Korba!
The stone burner is set and ready.
Let the others know, Javid.
Muad'Dib is in the streets.
Go.
So you've come, then.
We meet again, Muad'Dib.
Answering the call of the Fedaykin.
I carry your water burden, Otheym.
Command me.
(Sighs) I caught the spitting disease in Tarahell.
Ohh.
The tribe will take my water soon.
Let me summon my doctors.
WOMAN: We've had doctors...
...as good as any Muad'Dib could provide.
There's treachery, Muad'Dib.
I'm ashamed to say it.
Fremen plot against you.
They want time to stop.
They want things the way they used to be.
Bijaz has told me their names.
He was a gift to me, after our victories in Tarahell.
I am a person, not a gift.
Cheap to feed, but costly to fill.
Empty me as you will, Sire.
He always prattles on like that.
He's a good spy, though.
You should take him tonight.
Our enemies will think
I'm selling him for the money.
To be gone is to be bygone.
Let bygones be bygones and Bijaz and Muad'Dib must be gone by now.
He's right, Muad'Dib.
It's not safe for you to be here.
These are troubled times, old friend.
It was better when we were alone in the desert...
...with only the Harkonnen as our enemies.
BIJAZ: There's a thin line between enemy and friend.
Where that line stops, there's no beginning.
And no end.
Bygones be bygones, let them fall where they may.
This has been a dirty day.
The wind speaks of demons.
That is not the wind.
Stone burner!
Don't look at it, My Lord!
You can't look at it!
It was in the old quarter.
Stone burner, for sure.
What about Muad'Dib?
We are just entering the area now.
My Lord, is that you?!
Here. I'm over here!
Take this one and get him to the keep immediately.
Your eyes.
Do it, Fedaykin. DO IT NOW!
This way.
My Lord... your eyes.
My eyes are gone, Stil.
Muad'Dib... my gods!
Muad'Dib...
Calm, Stil.
They've blinded my body... but not my vision.
There are men who need your help,
Fedaykin, here and here!
The Law, Muad'Dib.
We live by Atreides law now, Stil.
None of these men are to be taken out into the desert.
Anyone who wants is to be fitted with Tleilaxu eyes.
MAN: Without eyes, yet he sees.
He has sight without eyes.
You knew this would happen.
It had to be.
Why?
Why?
For our son.
How long have you known?
I've always known.
It was just a matter of when.
Forgive me, Chani.
There was no way I could spare us this.
I waited as long as I could.
We will return to our desert, my love...
...to the sietch where our son will be born.
I'm afraid, Muad'Dib.
I suddenly feel like we have so little time.
We have eternity.
YOU have eternity.
I have only now.
So you are Bijaz?
Would I were Bijou and not Bijaz, a jewel is prettier than a horse's ass.
You're a mockery, then.
A trick of nature meant to confuse and annoy.
Annoy, yes.
Confuse, no.
Is wind a trick?
Then you're the wind?
No, I am words in the wind, words that are names, names that are death.
He knows.
What does he mean?
What I mean is what I say, and what I say is what I mean.
Time for account, unless you come just to mock at me.
My brother says you know the names of the traitors.
Poor Muad'Dib... poor Bijaz.
(Sings) ♫ Betrayed and betrayer together at last. ♫
You will give me the names of those who would betray us.
Very well, then.
Let's start with your priests.
He has another agenda.
How do you know?
I sense it.
Senses are dangerous.
They can be fooled.
Only a machine functions without senses.
Are you a machine, ghola?
I am a Mentat.
I trust only logic and statistics.
Not mysticism and prophecy?
My brother had a Mentat teacher who talked like that.
Hawat.
You remember?
You did that on purpose.
You remember.
No.
I feel.
There is a difference.
(Laughs) Is there?
It frightens you, doesn't it?
The memory?
You're afraid you'll remember who you were.
No ghola has ever been restored to his former being, child.
I'm no child.
I awakened to consciousness in my mother's womb.
I have memories of many women alive inside of me.
I know what they knew,
I feel what they felt, but I can handle it.
Can you?
Palace Fedaykin are everywhere.
By the time Alia's through, a common pickpocket won't be safe.
The fools even had a stone burner and they couldn't succeed.
Our spies have no idea who was responsible.
It could have been Fremen rebels from the deep desert.
It could have been an element within the Gesserit itself. We may never know.
What about Scytale?
He maintains his masquerade.
And the dwarf?
Confined to the keep.
No-one knows where.
Then our plan is still in place.
Mmm.
He's alive?
Gurney, tell me he's alive.
He is alive.
But he's blind.
It was a stone burner.
Stilgar suspects Fremen.
Alia? Chani?
All safe.
Blind?
Blind?
There are rumours that Paul can still see despite his blindness - vision sight.
They say it's a miracle.
Another brick for the myth of Muad'Dib.
My Lady?
Make arrangements for the Guild ambassador for immediate transport to Arrakis.
I don't think that would be wise.
It was only a matter of time before this happened.
Might not be long before it happens again.
And you would not want to encourage it.
Oh, forgive me, My Lady, but those who would rid themselves of Muad'Dib would only be more provoked by the arrival of his mother.
If Paul needs you, he would surely send for you.
We go forward. We come back.
We go forward. We come back.
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer's right in front of you.
The Golden Path. But you must decide.
It's the only way.
What troubles you, My Lord?
The future.
You're drunk on too much time.
I'm drunk on too much me.
You know how many people have died since I became Emperor?
Even your empire must live its time... and then die.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
Is that what you've seen... in your visions?
It's obvious to anyone who can see.
It's what the Tleilaxu have written upon you - to kill me.
What is it, Stil?
I have just received word from Salusa Secundus.
Shaddam is dead.
How very generous of Muad'Dib to permit his wife to attend the funeral of his mortal enemy.
And how grateful you must be for the safety my sacrifice assured our father...
...and you.
Not one major house representative.
Not one!
Muad'Dib would not allow any formal delegations, My Lady.
As far as he was concerned, your father died the day he was defeated on Arrakis.
My father was the 81st
Padishah Emperor, a colossus!
I mean, who is this bastard Atreides but some Bedouin charlatan?
Do not underestimate the power of Muad'Dib's prescience, My Lady.
Your father did... to his great misfortune.
My father was betrayed by you and your simpering Spacing Guild and those witches of the Bene Gesserit.
And for what? For spice.
You abandoned your emperor for spice.
We cannot guide our ships without it, My Lady.
And that is why you will help me kidnap a worm and bring it here.
I mean no disrespect, Princess, but take a worm from Arrakis?
Even if the Idaho ghola succeeds, there is still the sister to contend with.
We must be prepared with other means to diminish the Atreides power.
You want to bring a worm here?
Salusa Secundus might prove hospitable to the great worms of Arrakis.
If they thrived, a new spice cycle could begin.
And...?
Atreides monopoly would be broken.
Plans within plans.
If Muad'Dib ever suspected such a gambit, he would smash this planet and the Corrino name into oblivion.
We're already in oblivion.
Kidnap a worm from Arrakis.
The spice must flow.
Get out of the way!
The doctors say her metabolism has accelerated.
Pregnancy is proceeding faster than normal.
It, er... will be a dangerous birth.
Beloved.
I'm sorry. I've distracted you.
Shh, shh, shh.
If only you could distract me forever.
My body is confusing me, Muad'Dib.
My life burns faster.
I'm so hungry.
Always hungry.
Make arrangements, Stil.
We leave for the sietch as soon as possible.
The baby will be born there.
Inform my sister.
How long have you been there?
Long enough.
Are you sick, My Lady?
You don't know what it's like to hunt the future.
You've taken spice.
Too much.
My brother needs me, Duncan, and my vision is incomplete.
I need to remember. I need...
I need to remember the future.
I'm going to summon doctors.
No, no.
(Desperately) Don't leave me.
I just need to... just...
(Desperately) I can't move.
What are you doing to me?
I am playing. (Voice echoes)
You were made to be played...
...like Otheym, poor fellow.
We had a terrific struggle with you.
The flesh did not want to come back.
You are Tleilaxu?
Born and bred... in the same tank... just we two.
First me, then you.
Then you.
You are trying to bring out the violence in me.
Oh, no... not yet.
The script is written... but the stage is not set.
But one day soon, the Emperor will come to you, a mask of grief obscuring his face.
A mask of grief. (Hums tunefully)
And he'll say, "She's gone."
"She is gone."
And then you will finally remember what you're expected to do.
What you're expected to do.
What you're expected to do.
"She is gone." (Hums tunefully)
PAUL: She is gone, Duncan.
Now it's time to forget what you remember when day becomes night.
♫ Forgetting is not having
♫ Till the words are right. ♫
What do you see with those eyes?
What everyone sees.
We're leaving for the sietch this morning.
And I'm being left behind?
Appropriate, I'd say, considering what you've done.
I never meant to hurt Chani... or you.
I just...
I've given orders no harm is to come to you.
No matter what happens.
Is she...
She's well.
For the moment.
I've been cruel to you, Irulan.
I don't want your pity.
I'm offering none.
Simply telling you the truth.
You were destined.
A condition I understand only too well.
Destined to be used.
By you?
By your father.
By the Bene Gesserit, by the Spacing Guild.
Protect them from me.
And they'll get their wish.
I'm not exactly as they'd like.
I don't understand.
The time of plots and revenge is coming to an end.
You must have a chance to find peace.
I'm going to give you that chance.
It's ironic...
...but your selfish, clumsy attempts to mother an Imperial heir actually prolonged Chani's life.
And for that, I am grateful.
Forever.
Muad'Dib, is it truly necessary to bring the face dancer AND the dwarf?
They have their parts to play, Stil, just like you and me.
Chani and I will take this one.
Muad'Dib!
I know the way better than anyone else, Stil.
Except, perhaps, you.
You must remain here, as we agreed.
Time to settle accounts.
MAN: Stay where you are!
What's the meaning of this?
You plotted against Muad'Dib, Korba.
You conspired against your emperor.
You are under arrest for treason.
I am a Fremen.
I demand to be judged by Fremen law.
You will be, Korba.
You will be.
I used to hunt these here, when I was little.
It's amazing, the simple pleasures one has as a child.
But the desert is leaving now...
...taking simple pleasure with it.
I wonder if my father would approve of the future he inspired.
A storm comes, My Lady.
(Whispers) I am a desert creature, ghola.
I know when to hide.
Ooh!
Paul said he would join you as soon as the night council is concluded.
You called him Paul...
...his Atreides name.
I did.
A memory intruded where none should have been.
Then there are more... and it frightens you.
Duncan's memories, they scare you.
Are they Duncan's memories...
...or the inventions of those who made me?
When the moment comes to decide...
...you will know.
My Lady...
Ohh!
Oh!
(Weakly) Muad'Dib.
It was the birth, My Lord.
They said her body was drained by the speed of it.
These are your children, Muad'Dib.
Both are alive and strong.
Children?
Twins, My Lord. A boy and a girl.
I never saw children.
CHANI: Muad'Dib.
(Weakly) Muad'Dib.
Beloved...
...forgive me.
There are some things no-one can bear.
Problems in this universe...
...for which there are no answers...
(Tearfully) ..for which nothing can be done - nothing!
I am sorry.
Nothing in this universe...
...is as great...
...as my love for you.
(Panicked) Oh, I can't see!
My Lord? My Lord!
She's gone.
She is gone, Duncan.
She is gone, Duncan.
(Softly) She is gone.
VOICE: Then you'll finally remember what you're expected to do.
...you're expected to do... (Echoes)
This was the moment you came back to me, Duncan.
Stay where you are, both of you.
I warn you, a face dancer can move faster than you can possibly imagine.
So, it is truly you.
Duncan Idaho of the Atreides.
A ghola CAN regain his past.
Tell me, what do you remember?
Tell him.
Everything.
My childhood, my youth...
...my death.
We did it! We did it.
Majesty, don't you see what this means?
You can have her back again, your beloved Chani.
The proof is standing right in front of you.
We can restore the flesh and the spirit.
We can re-create her.
This was your plan all along.
Plots within plots, My Lord - you should know better than anyone.
We've been trying for decades to achieve this.
Make an alliance with us, Muad'Dib, the Tleilaxu.
Let us restore your beloved Chani.
Live content and safe for the rest of your life...
...with her, with your children.
(Echoing) With her, with your children.
My Lord, please, don't listen to this blasphemy.
Don't move, Duncan Idaho.
You kill me, and you're killing
Muad'Dib's children.
You can feel it, can't you, Muad'Dib?
Can't you?
You can hear her...
CHANI: I am afraid, Muad'Dib.
...calling your name.
(In Chani's voice) Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.
Father... don't be afraid, Father.
I'm here, Father, as you knew I would be.
We go forward, we go back - don't be afraid.
We are pre-born, my sister and I, thanks to our mother and the spice.
Thanks to you.
Father, yes, it IS me!
We go forward, we go back...
Father, we are pre-born, my sister and I.
Thanks to you.
(Echoing) My eyes...
...let me see for you.
I can do it. I can bring her back to you.
Use my eyes, Father. Use them!
My eyes, let me see for you.
My eyes, Father. Use them!
I can do it. I can bring her back.
Let us give you back your love.
The children. The children!
They're safe, Muad'Dib.
I meddled in the future, in all possible futures...
...trying to create them.
Instead, they created me and I became trapped by them.
Yes, but knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
The first step along the Golden Path.
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer is right in front of you.
Finally I am free.
IRULAN: History is written on the sands of Arrakis.
Those who wished an end to House Atreides have failed.
No longer an emperor, no longer a god, a simple blind Fremen wanders alone into the desert to die.
They say he has gone on a journey...
...into the land where men walk without footprints.
He will not be found.
Yet all men will find him.
I wonder if that's what he wanted.
I need you, Duncan.
More than ever.
Stay with me.
IRULAN: Muad'Dib is gone but his children remain and conspiracies continue to breed.
The saga of Dune is far from over.

Too much for you? Give up?
Ay! Let go of me!
Ay! Let me go!
You've disappointed me.
Good! The best!
I told you, Muay, to bet on him. We're rich! Rich!!
Muay! Pick up the coins!
Enough for today!
You won't get your money back.
Ai Tim!
You're so good, we have a great opportunity to get rich now.
Brilliant!
Ai Don!
Follow them!
Music!
Get them!
Quick! Let's go!
Ai Don!
Follow them.
This week I have to see customers.
I want you to get things ready.
Tell me first if there is a problem.
Yes, Boss.
I want you to report everything.
Ai Hum Lae!
Where will we find Ai Bak Don?
You eat your food first. Eat!
Don't worry.
I'll find him!
At the rice mill everyone know him well.
Eat!
Muay! Tomorrow you'll go with me.
May be some chance to get money.
I can't. Exams tomorrow.
Exams! I've never seen you attend class.
How can you pass?
Do you have something special with the teacher?
- What!?
- A joke, a joke.
You're a good student, you're clever.
Eat...
Thanks a lot for helping me to find Ong-Bak.
Don't thank me.
Ai Yod, you owe me 3 months of rent.
What are you going to do?
Er... Give me 3 days.
I'll pay you. This time for sure.
You said "sure" too many times already.
I want money today... otherwise you must move out.
Will you accept this ring instead?
Okay.
You must pay the rent within 7 days.
If you have no money again,
I'll kick you out. Understand?
Son, I want you to return home with Bak Tim.
Don't worry if you don't have enough money.
I don't mind if you don't want to become a monk.
I only want you to visit us.
I miss you, son.
What's the matter!?
Am I not as good as your ex-husband?
You spoil my mood.
Don!
I don't want to sell drugs any more.
Why?
I want to stop.
You want to stop?
Really want to stop?
Come here!
You think you can stop that easily.
You think you can, but you can't.
Who?
Hey! Ai Don!
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek!
- Where is Ong-Bak?
- I don't know.
- You brought it here!
- I don't know!
Ai Tim.
Get away.
Pi Ngek!
Get out quickly, Don.
Go. Go!
Call an ambulance for Room 212.
She's dying. Urgent!
Ai Tim! Come here quickly in a Tuk Tuk.
Hurry up.
You're dead.
Keep following me!
Come! You're dead.
Huh! Ai Tim.
Ai Tim! Brake! Brake! Brake quickly!
Oh, Bhudda! Oh!
Spread them out.
Oh! Damn!
Get out!
You're dead.
Remember! You must search every square metre.
Don't miss anything.
Most important, you must not allow any strangers in.
Understand?
Damn them! They keep chasing after me.
Get in.
Today the Police and National Heritage have found... lots of Buddha statues and relics on the Chao Praya river's bank.
This finding of invaluable objects is very significant.
Because every piece is a national treasure.
National Heritage is making a catalogue for protective conservation.
We will report any developments to this story.
I told you not to cause trouble.
I didn't. They are looking for Ong-Bak.
What's Ong-Bak?
The head of the Buddha statue that I brought to you.
Why does this man cause me so much trouble?
I lost my betting money, and all my relics collection... because of one peasant.
I'm sorry. I can't save her.
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek!
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek, don't leave me.
Who's she?
Muay's big sister.
You can't leave me. I have nobody.
Muay... Muay...
Ngek asked me to give this to you...
"For Muay - College Fees"
I don't want it. Don't want it.
I want you. I have nobody else.
You can't leave. I've no one else.
Don't be so sad, Muay.
Birth and death are part of life.
I won't leave you.
What's this? What?
Where are you taking me?
Let's go. Go quickly. Go, go!
Do you know who I am?
How dare you attack my property!
I don't know. It's between Ai Tim and Ai Don.
True! I don't know.
I know that you are looking for this head.
Do you really want it?
If you want it, I've a game for you to play.
I saw Ong-Bak with my own eyes.
If you accept to fight for him, he will give you Ong-Bak and release Muay.
What are you going to do?
Tell me.
I will do anything... to bring back Ong-Bak to Ban Nong Pradoo.
I'll sacrifice even my life.
Why do you call me to leave the frontier?
To warn you to stay away from political issues and I want you to make a bet.
Oh. You want to revenge that country boxer to death!
How much you want to bet? Your call.
You don't call the shots anymore!?
On the east corner is a Thai Boxer.
He's new to us.
The Burmese Boxer is on the west corner.
He's one of the best.
Now the fight has begun.
Ai Tim! Ai Tim! Are you okay?
Enough.
Hey! If you want Ong-Bak, follow me.
You're crooks too.
Tim lost the fight so I could win the bet.
Huh! This is Pra.
It's just the head of some worthless statue that you're trying to get.
I'm not interested in the head.
I just want you to box for me.
Don't dare challenge me, because I can make you live or die.
Damn you! You did betray us.
Ai Tim lost the fight for you...
Why don't you return the head to him?
Son of a bitch!
Calm down.
Finish them after I've gone.
You got hurt, but I got the money.
Remember that I ordered this.
Get rid of them.
I can't help if they don't listen.
Huh! Kill them!
Pi Yod!
Damn! I told him not to make a noise.
Hey! Do it quickly!
Police may be here soon.
Hey! Go there.
Where is Ong-Bak?
- Hey! I go with you.
- No. I can't let anyone die for Ong-Bak.
Except me... only me.
Ai Tim... Ai Tim!
Let me help you.
I don't want to be like this.
I apologize to you.
Let me do one good deed for Ban Nong Pradoo.
At least... let me start the bike for you.
I, Bak Hum Lae, from Ban Nong Pradoo.
Don told me there is a secret cave behind the next mountain.
Still not dead!
You want Ong-Bak!
You have to exchange it with your life.
We're cutting the biggest head.
Ai Tim! Ai Tim... Ai Ti...
Ai Hum Lae! Are you okay?
Go and get Ong-Bak. Go!
Don't worry about me.
Go and get Ong-Bak.
Go!
Huh! Where're you running to?
Continue working! Cut the head off!
Be careful!
Last time I told him to lose.
- The head is off now, Boss.
- Good. Pull it off.
Die... e... e...
You want this head!
I want to see if it's unbreakable.
Ai Hum Lae!
Ai Hum Lae... Are you hurt?
Take... take... Ong-Bak back to our... our village.
Ai Pi Yod! Ai Pi Yod!
What's happenning?
Ai Hum Lae.
Muay... finish... your studies... and find... a good job.
Bak Tim...
Tell my dad I can't become a monk.
Huh! What are you saying?
Let's go to the hospital and you'll be fine, Pi Yod.
Ai Hum Lae.
Ai Pi Yod, Ai Pi Yod. Huh!
You can't die!
You promised not to leave me. You can't die.
You can't do this!
You mustn't lie to me. You cannot lie to me.
Do you understand? You promised me!
I've nobody else! I've nobody else!
Wake up now! Don't do this to me.
You can't... can't. Understand?
Wake up now! Ai Pi Yod, you can't die.
You must keep your promise!
Arrakis.
Dune.
A land so starved for water a single tear is cherished.
It is here and only here where can be found:
The spice.
Greatest treasure in the universe.
And the never-ending cause of conflict, betrayal, and murder.
Muad'Dib.
No.
Another bad dream, Uncle?
No, it's indigestion, that's all, miserable food here.
I can't wait to be off this foul planet.
What are you doing here, boy?
They're dead, Uncle.
The Bene Gesserit witch and her son, both dead.
We discovered a Fremen sietch not far from where our thopter crashed.
They'd been rescued by that Atreides snake, Duncan Idaho.
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.
The Emperor's man.
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.
The witch and her son were last seen driving a thopter into a sandstorm.
- You've seen the bodies?
- They're most certainly dead.
You've seen the bodies?
Nothing survives one of those storms, Uncle.
The wind was over 800 kilometers an hour.
Nothing survives.
How long have I been asleep?
Not long.
The storm passed a little while ago.
It was Yueh.
He's the one who betrayed us.
They had his wife.
You should put it on, Paul.
You're the duke now.
We have to get out of here.
I found some supplies stowed in the compartment by the hatch:
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.
Fremen?
We're going to need them...
...to take back Arrakis.
How do we know which way to go?
South.
That's into the deep desert.
There were rumors of sietch communities there.
That's where we'll find the Fremen...
...or die trying.
I'm all right.
It's just the stress. I'm fine.
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
Or did you think I would just be too simple-minded to see the truth?
Leave us alone.
What happened on Arrakis was beyond my control, Daughter.
An ancient feud between royal houses.
Don't patronize me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?
Used you?
Sending me to the duke as a token of your support...
...making me a courier of your esteemed respect...
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.
Or was that your idea, Fenring?
That would be something your perverse mind would suggest.
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?
Send me into the desert to die like that poor boy and his mother?
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.
Despite the Baron's efforts...
...he assures me he did everything he could to secure them from harm.
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.
Enough!
There will come a time, Daughter...
...when you will have to shed this naiveté of yours...
...and learn what it means to rule an empire.
And when that time comes, Father...
...you may learn to regret it.
It's only another few kilometers, that's all.
Hurry, we don't have much time.
The sun will soon be up full.
We'll have some shade in here.
If there are Harkonnen patrols this far out, they'll have a tough time spotting us.
Such a pity.
A pity that you had to get mixed up in this business, Doctor.
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.
I'm the Emperor's servant, nothing more and nothing less.
So you did not lead them to that warren of Fremen scum?
That was Idaho's idea.
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.
We know all about Idaho and his efforts on the duke's behalf.
A foolish, desperate gambit.
And where was that Fremen trash when he needed them?
What will you say when the Emperor questions you about what happened here?
What's your impression?
The desert is an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...
...and her spawn have found that out, haven't they?
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials when he's face to face...
...with death's sweet smile.
Muad'Dib.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.
But here, on Arrakis, you need desert power.
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.
Did you get any rest?
Some.
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.
How is my sister?
I'm having dreams again.
Visions.
Even when I'm awake.
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.
Even your father didn't know.
Why not?
There wasn't time.
What have you done to me?
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?
This place is changing me.
It's the spice.
It's in the air we breathe, in the food we eat.
I can't escape it.
Drink it all.
The best place to conserve water is in your body.
The stillsuit will do the rest.
If we stay on this dune we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.
Is that a good idea?
It's the most direct path.
You all right?
Yes.
Hold on.
That shouldn't have happened.
I was careless about these dunes.
We lost our paracompass.
Can you hear that?
It's a worm!
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!
A thumper?
Someone called it away.
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.
The spice.
Everywhere.
When the worm came.
There had to have been people for this many plants to survive.
Fremen.
We have to find them.
Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen.
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.
I know you.
You're Stilgar...
...the Fremen who came to see my father with Duncan Idaho.
That was a sloppy crossing you made from the crash.
You called a worm.
You were watching us?
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.
My people are cautious and pragmatic.
Good qualities in the desert.
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity than invite disaster.
Your only value at the moment is the water in your flesh.
You know the law, Stil.
Yes.
The law.
Tell them to stop hunting my son.
Tell them.
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!
Do you hear me?
Is this the way you welcome friends of Liet?
Is it?
As leader of this tribe...
...I'm offering the Weirding woman and her son sanctuary.
No Fremen will lay a hand on you while you have my protection.
For how long?
Don't be a fool, woman.
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.
Don't be fugitives from us as well.
Merciful God!
I've heard of the Weirding ways.
Imagine what a man could do with it.
No doubt we have much to teach each other.
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.
He won't move unless I say so.
Discipline. Good.
He's here!
He is unharmed.
We are coming down.
Leave me alone.
Made a lot of noise climbing.
He has much to learn.
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?
He surprised me, that's all.
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.
We have now two with us who are not trained.
In squad lines with flankers.
We have to make Cave of Ridges before full sun.
Chani, you will be responsible for him.
My name is Paul.
Only until we give you a new one.
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.
Across there is home...
...Sietch Tabr.
We'll be there tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
That must be hundreds of kilometers from here.
It will be a hard ride.
Sun will be up soon.
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.
When you give us your stillsuits, we will recover your water for you.
Here is some food.
Spice.
We don't have delicacies from the cities like you are used to.
It's fine.
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?
I can tell by the way you stare at her.
I don't know what it means.
Be careful, Paul.
We are new to these people as they are to us.
Everything we say and do must be careful.
Predicting the future, then plotting to make it so.
These are superstitious people.
If we are to survive, it will be best to accommodate their legends.
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.
A desert creature.
Not finished yet!
Still have work to do!
The pre-spice mass.
I am a desert crea...
Spice blow.
Somewhere to the east.
A large field from the looks of it.
We have to send gatherers before Harkonnen pirates come for it.
You harvest the spice?
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.
It's Liet's wish.
We pay them to keep our skies free of their satellites...
...so that no one can know what we are doing here.
You will learn.
Amtal!
I invoke amtal.
Jamis.
What is this?
His way of dealing with what happened the other night.
That was an accident.
He bested me because there was witch-force at Tuono basin.
Amtal! It's my right!
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.
You're starting something you're going to regret.
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.
If you know what's good for you, you'll find an honorable way...
...to leave this thing alone.
Silence!
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.
If you try that again, we know it's your witchcraft.
I won't be able to protect you or the boy anymore.
Come. You can't stop this.
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.
Use it well.
May your blade chip and shatter.
I'm going to bathe this knife with your blood.
First, you'll have to find my blood.
- Do you yield?
- Yield?
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!
- He's never had to kill.
- What?
Then he'd better learn.
Finish. Don't toy with him.
He's bested Jamis.
This didn't have to happen.
It is our way.
Your way. Killing each other.
No man recognizes leadership without the challenge of combat.
There is a legend among us...
...that a voice from the out-world will come.
The Mahdi.
He will hold the key to our future.
It is said that a Bene Gesserit will be his mother.
A Sayyadina.
Friend of God.
There are rumors about you and your son.
From the city. Liet.
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?
I hope...
...and I fear.
If it's true, your boy will have to call me out one day...
...to challenge me for the leadership of the tribe.
The huanui is prepared. It's time.
It's our way.
From water does all life begin.
The flesh belongs to the person...
...but his water belongs to the tribe.
I was a friend of Jamis.
When the hawk plane fell upon us...
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.
I was a friend of Jamis.
I was a friend of Jamis.
I was a friend of Jamis.
He taught me...
...that when you kill...
...you pay for it.
Bila-Kayfa!
He sheds tears.
He gives water to the dead.
Jamis carried 33 liters of the tribe's water.
Counted and measured.
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.
Because you fight without stillsuit...
...you may regain the water you lost fighting.
May you guard it for the tribe, preserve it against loss...
...be generous with it in time of need.
May you pass it on in your time for the good of the tribe.
Needs a naming now, Stil.
It's time.
What would you have us call you, young Atreides?
By what name do you wish Fremen to know you?
What is the name of that little mouse?
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.
Muad'Dib.
Is that the name you wish?
Yes.
Muad'Dib.
Wise in the ways of the desert.
Hiding from the sun. Traveling at night.
We call him the "teacher of boys".
Muad'Dib.
A fine choice.
So, from now on you will be addressed as Muad'Dib.
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.
Your lives will depend on it.
There.
Get ready.
What is that?
The one who will come. Mahdi.
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent to the spice blow.
Give her some time, Muad'Dib.
Liet is dead.
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?
Harkonnen treachery.
She loved her father very much.
It needs a new dew collector.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
We had rivers of it.
Great flowing veins of water.
From the snows of mountains...
...into lakes so wide you couldn't see the other side.
Oceans of water.
Our home was on the coast.
Great waves would hurl themselves against the cliffs.
They used to put me to sleep.
My father had a dream, Muad'Dib.
A dream that one day...
...we could change this place...
...make it more like your homeland.
Windtrap.
Plenty of moisture this morning.
My father is at peace.
Muad'Dib.
We have thousands of these caches.
Only a few of us know them all.
I know this place.
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.
In my dreams.
This is the water we will use to change the face of Arrakis.
As my father taught us...
...the voice from the out-world will come.
The Mahdi.
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.
And no man shall ever want for water again.
Muad'Dib.
Come.
You summoned me, Highness?
- I have a special errand for you, Farrah.
- I'm here to serve, Milady.
I'm sending you to the Harkonnen planet,
Giedi Prime.
I want you to insinuate yourself among the fat Baron's family.
His nephew, Feyd, the narcissistic type...
...should be especially amenable to your expert charms.
And how will you want me to use him?
I want to know what happened the night
Duke Leto and his family were killed.
I want to know how it was planned...
...who was involved...
...and I want to know who the Harkonnen allies were.
I'll do my best.
I've no doubt of that.
Just as you said, Stil.
Harkonnen greed for spice is the most reliable beacon in the universe.
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.
Anyone else hear that?
We didn't even have to damage the thopter.
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.
That was our last communication.
No mayday or wreckage when we went to investigate.
That's the third thopter this month!
The patch turned out to be mock spice.
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!
We caught these last night, a village near the rimwall...
...known to be desert sympathizers.
Mercy, Governor.
We are refugees.
- We need food.
- Liar!
Spies! That's what you are!
Spies for the Fremen scum!
Fremen scum who raid my spice warehouses!
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.
He was trying to dispose of this when we caught him.
Send words to the filth of the desert!
Tell them what you witness here!
Tell them this is what awaits them!
Mahdi!
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.
The latest love letter from your brother.
Mahdi!
Appears to be enjoying himself.
The moron's appetite for killing never ceases to amaze me.
By the time he's finished, there won't be a population left to rule.
Cheer up, lovely boy.
I merely allow him to brutalize them, to savage them, until you arrive...
...the handsome Feyd, to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.
Feyd, the saviour.
There will be cheering in the streets.
You can even give them your brother's head as a gift, if you like.
And then you will squeeze, like the grips of a vice...
...so our treasuries become fat with the profit of spice.
No man recognizes leadership...
...without the challenge of combat.
It is the way.
Call him out!
What do you see...
...Muad'Dib...
...when you go away like that?
Where is it you go?
Many places, Stil.
Many roads.
Many choices.
These choices...
...are good or bad?
It's hard to know sometimes.
Either they are good choices or bad choices.
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?
Of storms?
Of the future.
The future, Muad'Dib, just is.
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!
Need immediate evacuation!
We are ready, Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib, it's time. We must hurry.
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.
He made it clear on his arrival that we should summon you and no other.
The other witches must leave.
As you wish.
This visit is as indiscreet as it is unexpected.
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity isn't aroused.
The Emperor's suspicions are easily moderated...
...by his dependence on our services.
As you are so fond of reminding us.
The navigators are concerned.
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.
There is a problem on the horizon.
What kind of problem?
They are troubled by a nexus they can't fully explore...
...an intersection of events...
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions beyond which lies a path...
...they cannot see.
And where is this nexus?
Planet Arrakis.
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.
The Atreides are dead.
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.
We sense a higher order interfering.
A misstep could be catastrophic.
Then we understand one another.
Completely.
We'll do what we can.
I thought...
...I felt something.
The spice must flow.
The balance of power must be maintained.
Sayyadina?
I'm awake, Chani.
Has there been any word, a courier perhaps?
No. The raids are in the Haga basin.
They won't risk communication until they are deep across the bled.
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?
No.
It's just your skin.
My skin?
We've heard the stories about off-worlders...
...the ones who come from water planets.
Skin so moist it's like cream.
- Muad'Dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?
Muad'Dib is still a boy.
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.
Yes.
I say my prayers for his safe return.
We both do, Chani.
The smugglers transport our spice tribute to the cursed Spacing Guild.
The Emperor never knows.
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'Dib.
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.
Something wrong, Muad'Dib?
I thought I saw someone I knew.
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.
No, Stil.
Let them go.
I must have been mistaken.
Gurney.
My father's patience is wearing thin.
These troubles on Arrakis are proving difficult to manage...
...and our time is running short.
I want you to make arrangements for a trip to Giedi Prime.
Milady?
The Baron's nephew is having a birthday celebration.
The Emperor ought to be represented, don't you think?
I'm in the mood for a party.
Besides, it's time to shed some of this naiveté.
She is not going!
I'm not going to allow that headstrong, meddlesome child loose in Babylon.
My God, what a catastrophe that would be.
The eldest daughter of the Imperial House ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen...
...and his dreadful progeny.
Yes, catastrophe indeed.
But perhaps the seducer could be seduced.
The more we know of the Baron's schemes, the more we are prepared for the endgame.
Our operatives on Giedi Prime have limited access.
Your daughter, on the other hand...
...has proved quite adept at intelligence gathering.
Gently chaperoned,
I should think she'd prove quite useful...
...once again.
You've heard the voices from your sietches.
They say the Mahdi has come.
But you...
...the naibs of your tribes are still cautious.
You resist.
But I am offering you the future.
The future as Liet saw it.
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.
Here.
And here.
And once we rid Arrakis of the vile Harkonnen...
...we can complete his dream.
I promise this.
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.
You'll never rid Arrakis with guerrilla raids, boy.
It will take all-out war.
That's why I'm asking you for hundreds of your best young men.
I want to give them the Weirding way...
...so they can come back to you and train hundreds more.
So those hundreds can train hundreds more.
And then hundreds will become thousands!
The Fedaykin.
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!
My father once told me...
...that here on Arrakis...
...one needed desert power to rule.
You are desert power...
...and nothing can stop you...
...if you believe.
So you are the one.
Jessica of the Weirding, our Reverend Mother Ramallo.
Mapes said you were beautiful.
She also said she pitied you.
I need no one's pity.
That remains to be seen.
There is much talk of you in the sietches.
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.
I hear them shout the name Muad'Dib.
He is a natural leader like his father.
The men admire his courage.
It will take more than courage to survive what's coming.
The boy...
...he knows what it is that's happening here?
He is aware.
You've exploited our legends well.
We had to survive.
And you may...
...for a while.
But remember this: the very legend which protects you...
...can also destroy you.
- How are you feeling?
- Well.
Tired sometimes.
Healthy.
And growing fast.
I saw the one they call the Reverend Mother.
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.
- Why?
- To see me.
To see you.
She's Bene Gesserit.
One of our missionaries.
Convenient.
Stilgar says you've learned much.
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?
Because I loved him.
As long as your father remained unmarried...
...some of the great houses could still hope for an alliance through marriage.
We both knew what that meant.
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?
I would have encouraged it.
Politics.
Yes.
Politics.
While I was on the hajra...
...I had dreams about this garden.
Except it wasn't here, it was somewhere else.
Was I there?
Yes.
And there were children...
...playing, very happy.
A wonderful dream.
Do you think it's possible to love someone enough...
...you'd be willing to give that person up?
I think...
...there are times when it's necessary to share the one you love...
...with things greater than both of you.
Everything is connected, one thing to another.
The living and the dead, the animate and the inanimate.
A system.
All parts functioning to serve the whole.
Smell the air, Muad'Dib.
Cinnamon.
The pre-spice mass is below us.
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.
The Maker has left her nest long ago.
Her children have joined together for survival.
They have grown.
They are losing water now.
It will mix with their waste.
If enough has accumulated...
...a giant bubble of foam will heave up with tremendous force.
A spice blow.
Trading places with the sands above.
The sun and heat will dry it out and...
...soon...
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.
The worm...
...is the spice.
So now you know.
Many of the little makers will die in the blow.
The rest will swim off to become Shai-hulud, the Great Worm.
We may capture a few.
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.
That's enough for now.
When religion and politics ride in the same cart...
...the whirlwind follows.
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.
The one who can be many places at once.
You are the whirlwind.
It's almost night, Muad'Dib.
Time to return to the sietch.
You've been dreaming.
Too impatient, Farok.
You moved too soon.
Try again.
Watch his posture.
Even the slightest change in his breathing gives you advantage.
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.
I am Otheym.
These are my brothers from Sietch Gara Kulan.
We've come to find the one who calls himself Muad'Dib.
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.
We've come to join your crusade.
We want to learn the Weirding way.
We want to become Fedaykin.
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.
- We could fight as Muad'Dib.
- I believe you.
Let their waters join with ours.
I must congratulate you on the perfection of your heir, Baron.
He faces his 100th slave gladiator in the arena this afternoon.
He appears ready.
Well then, perhaps we might take this opportunity...
...to conduct our conversations.
There is much to discuss.
Indeed.
If that meets with your approval, Milady.
I am quite entertained here.
Fine.
By your leave, then.
What other house would have been willing to humiliate itself...
...so the Emperor could rid himself of a troublesome duke?
He's been asking himself that very question.
Are you suggesting that the Emperor contemplates a move against me?
Speculation is not a worthy science, Baron.
Better we spend our energy on what's most important.
The spice must flow.
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...
...curious.
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...
...coming deeper into the southern regions than ever before.
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild won't be enough to protect us.
Then it's agreed.
We move with the next moons.
When the Harkonnen find this place...
...there must be nothing left but the wind howling through the rocks.
There is no turning back now.
Subdue the Maker.
The Maker is dead.
The Water of Life.
May Shai-hulud have mercy on both of us.
When night falls again, we have to leave this sietch...
...that has sheltered us for so long.
We must go south into the deep desert...
...where the demon Harkonnen will not pursue us.
But our Reverend Mother will not survive another hajra.
So that we don't have to make the journey without her strength and guidance...
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented to undergo the rites at this time.
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.
So that we don't lose all, Chani...
...daughter of Liet, will be consecrated as Sayyadina...
...Friend of God.
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...
...in the Sayyadina.
Here is the Water of Life, the water that will free your soul.
If you are our Reverend Mother, the universe will open to you.
Let Shai-hulud judge now.
You must drink it now.
What's happening to her?
The water is poisoned until she changes it.
This must take its course.
Mother? Mother?
You cannot go there.
That is the place we cannot look.
The place only the Kwisatz Haderach may go.
You must turn away, Jessica, or it will drive you mad.
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding.
And the lives that have come before, they are yours now.
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.
Holy Mothers, what have we done?
This changes you both.
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.
She must see all that we see.
That is the only way you can save her.
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.
The plan was perfect in its simplicity and viciousness.
Of course it was.
You helped your uncle design it, didn't you?
Duke Leto thought he was gaining control of Arrakis...
...but he was only being fattened up for sacrifice.
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.
Swift and merciless.
The Atreides never had a chance.
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed within hours.
The Sardaukar.
I sent the final communique to your father myself.
Mother?
Yes?
Mother Ramallo is gone.
But she remains.
You have changed the waters.
Now we know you cannot be false.
Paul?
The Reverend Mother has changed the Water of Life.
It's now safe for us to drink!
The son and his mother, the duke's concubine and her son...
...what did you do with them?
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.
You found their bodies and disposed of them?
Never found them.
You never found the bodies?
You're trembling.
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Of you.
You make me see things.
What do you see?
I see us together.
There is a great storm.
I have a child in my arms.
Our child, Muad'Dib.
It's not a dream.
I know you, Chani.
I've always known you.
We've sat upon a rock above the sands and I've eased your fears.
We've caressed in the darkness of the sietch.
We've grown old together.
History will say that the Fremen were about to find their messiah.
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...
...and the world, as we knew it, would change forever.
The saga of Dune is far from over.

[All Shouting]
- Guys, guys, please, please !
This is very risky stuff here, and I'm a highly-trained professional astronaut.
Now, Uncle Phil will launch another rocketjust as soon as he completes his fuel intake.
- Thanks, darlin'.
- [ Shouting Continues ]
Now, you know, it takes six months just to reach Mars.
Then a year on the surface, six months back.
That's, like, two years, you know ?
Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say here is that, um, you know, this being my last night on Earth and everything, this could be a very precious memory for me.
[ Chuckling ]
Nice try.
William, get that thing out of your nose.
Don't you talk back to Mommy.
- Hey, Woody.
- Yeah ?
Our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth... till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. thank you, Renee. That's a pretty long rendezvous, don'tyou think ?
What are you suggesting, Sergei ?
- I think maybe you should bring a baseball bat.
- [ Chuckling ]
We will play American baseball on Mars. Our two crews.
- Oh, please.
- We could have ourselves a Solar System Series.
- Half you guys are foreigners.
We'd crush you.
- No, no, no.
Because we have equal crews. We have three men, one woman, same handicap.
Easy now. That's my wife you're talking about.
Terri just happens to be one hell of a shortstop.
Fast-pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes.
- Thousand bucks make it interesting ?
- Winner take all.
Good.
You bring the balls.
The best thing about our mission--
On Mars Two, technically I outrank her.
So for the fi rst time in our marriage, she's gonna have to do everything I say, right ?
- Yes, honey.
- "Yes, honey, sir, " with a little salute helps.
- Yes, honey, sir.
- Yeah. I like it. It's good.
- Take that corn up there, all right ?
- Yes, sir.
[Woman]l'm notsure howlfeel aboutNASA allowing couples... to go on this type of mission together.
Nothin' personal, Terri. I mean--
[ Chuckling ]
It's just that it's a funny feeling for those ofus staying behind.
Yes, but all the research shows that marriage will provide stability... on these long-duration trips.
- Then they haven't studied some of the couples I've known.
- [Women Chuckling]
Luke. Come on, baby.
He's not coming.
This isn't right.
I mean, Jim deserves this too.
All of his friends are here.
- I know.
- It's my last night here.
Hey ! It's your last night with us too.
- I know. I'm sorry, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I love you, Deb.
I love you too.
Maybe you should spend some time with Bobby.
- Yeah, where is he ?
- Up in his fort.
Oh. Okay.
[Man]
Millions of miles away.
Deep space.
So lonesome, so cold.
So lame, Nick.
[ Chuckling ]
Knock, knock.
Bobby ?
Your friends are out there playing.
What are you doing up here ?
Who's gonna read to me now at bed time ?
Your mother will.
But... I like when you do it.
- Now we're never gonna finish our book.
- Bobby.
Listen, I've been thinking about that too, okay ?
And what I figured out was--
How about if I bring along my own copy ?
Then, every night, wherever I am,
I'll read a little bit more ofit.
And you and Mommy can read a little bit more of it wherever you are.
It'll be kind oflike we're reading it together. 'Cause I don't know aboutyou, but I'm kind of anxious to find out how old Ben Gunn got marooned on that island.
You think that's a good idea ?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah ? Yeah ?
Okay.
[Dog Barking]
[VehicleApproaching]
Well, we were afraid you wouldn't come.
[ Chuckles ]
I caught a whiff of your barbecue.
Uh-huh.
- After that,
- Yeah ?
I was, uh, helpless.
Tsk. All the way out in Galveston ?
- Something like that.
- Mmm.
It's his night, Deb.
I didn't want to spoil it.
"Spoil it" ? He has been going crazy looking for you.
- Don't ever do that to me again.
- [ Both Chuckle ]
- How ya doin' ?
- Hey, I'm doin' good.
- Here.
- Thanks, man.
- A lot of people are gonna be glad to see you, you know that ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go in.
You remember him ?
- Just let that go.
- As soon as you admit that it was a no-go situation.
- It was a go situation.
- Three months, no data stream,
-you're gonna land the ship ?
-Just 'cause you keep bringing it up doesn't make you right.
-Just because you get loud doesn't make-- Jim, settle it.
- No, don't--
-Just because you get loud doesn't make-- Jim, settle it.
- No, don't--
- Settle it.
- Don't look at me.
- It was a go situation.
-This is exactly what I'm talking about.
-It's hard to admit, I know that.
Three commanders, one ship.
I don't think that's gonna work.
There's not enough rocket fuel in the world to get those egos off the ground. Come on.
Ah, we would've made a great crew.
Maybe. If this man was left seat.
- Yeah.
- [ Chuckling ] Guys, come on.
I'm a pretty good stickjockey.
Call me if you want a flight test.
- What is a stickjockey ?
- "l'm a pretty good stickjockey."
Come on, Mr. Cover of Time Magazine.
- The guy who landed the crippled Block Il shuttle.
- Yeah.
- That's the stickjockey.
- The stickjockey did that.
[ Chuckling ]
- Yeah, Mr. StickJockey.
- Okay, I made a little noise, but putting the first footprints on Mars ?
That's for guys who wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place... and for guys who read too much science fiction as a kid... and still wear these little Flash Gordon rocket ships around their necks.
- Very mature.
- You read every damn science fiction book I did, and you'rejust not man enough to wear jewellery, that's all there is to that.
- Yeah.
- You knowyou want Flashy.
Ain't gettin' him !
[ Shouts ]
Maggie would have loved to see you two clowns just one more time.
[ Sobbing Quietly]
I'm gonna go and get a beer.
I don't know, Woodrow.
I think it's about time you donated this baby to the museum.
- Internal combustion, boys.
Accept no substitutes.
- [ Engine Revs ]
Jim, listen.
If there's, um--
If there's anything Terri and I can do, you call us, all right ?
- I'm okay. Really. Thanks.
- All right. Luke.
- Yeah ?
- I'll see you when I get to Mars.
Listen, don't solve all the mysteries of the universe.
- Leave a little something for the next guys.
- I'm not promising anything.
-Just bring some expensive beer.
- All right.
Will do. Godspeed.
Thanks, buddy.
- [Tires Screech]
- [Dog Barking]
It should've been your mission, Jim.
Yours and Maggie's.
Nobody ever wanted Mars the way you two did, not even Woody.
You two were 1 2 years training for this thing, hoping for this assignment.
Well, that's-- that's all over now.
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick, if you hadn't pulled yourself...
- out of the rotation to take care ofher, you--
- Luke--
No,Jim. Wait a minute.
I wanna say this.
Look, I wanted this assignment, all right ?
But not like this,Jim.
I would give all of this up in a second ifit would bring Maggie back to us.
I know that.
Look, all the years of training and planning for this mission have been a privilege.
Mars is yours now.
Go get it.
I will.
You take care of yourself, Jim.
You too, buddy.
Okay.
I'll see you when I get back.
Hey, Luke.
Have a great ride.
[ Chuckles ]
I always do.
[ Beeping, Whirring ]
[ Beeping, Whirring ]

Luke, youreadme ?
- Here, Renee.
Luke, ljustgot aRES-8 on-line, and--
Well, we thinkyou're gonna want tosee this for yourself.
Okay, copy that.
- Now, is this the cinder cone ?
- No, it's too smooth.
- It's too angular.
Volcanic upwelling, maybe.
- No. No fissure, no caldera.
No, it's an upwelling for sure, but maybe not volcanic.
Look at the color and how shiny it is.
That almost looks like--
- It looks like ice.
- [ Both Scoffi ng ]
- This far south ?
- Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude.
I mean, not unless there's, like, a--
Okay, how far away is that ?
Sixteen kilometers, northeast.
Take us 20 minutes to get there, chief.
We're gonna send a packet to Micker.
We're going out there.
- Keep working.
- Okay.
- Careful. Watch your step.
- [ Chattering ]
- Is it possible to take picture ?
- Oh, picture.
- Here we go.
- Let's have a picture.
Say, "Cheese."
[Luke OverMonitor]
This is a trulyanomalous formation.
It's unlikeanything everseenso far.
The structure appears to be crystalline, atleastfrom theangle that's displayedbyARES-8. [Static]
We're trying not to go too nuts up here, but we think there's a good chance... that this could bean extrusion from some subsurface geothermal column of water.
And, of course, if that's correct, then we may have found the key to permanent human colonization.
- We thinkit wise to suspend judgement--
- Let geology and hydrology... know we need to scramble on this-- full court press.
So we're gonnaheadout thereASAP and takealookat this thing, tr yand getanidea ofits composition.
By the time you receive this, we should just about be on site.

[Renee]

- Can you fix it ?
- Hey, skip, I can fix anything.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Love that modesty.
[DistortedBeeping

Break out theradar.
Let's see what this thing's made of.
[Luke OverMonitor]
Oh, there's onemore thing.
This is a very important, very special day fora good friend of ours back home.
We knowhe's there right now.
He hates it when anybody makes any kind of a fuss abouthim, so I'm not gonna mention his name.
Because the last thing
I would want to do would be... to embarrass someone likeJim McConnell !
Was that loud?
Oh, well. It's done now.
It can't be right.
It says there's metal under there.
- Solidmetal.
- No, that doesn't make any sense.
- You're reading a vein ofore, Renee.
- No, it--
It says it's under the whole mountain.
[LukeSighs]
All right. Move it closer, up the power, and we're gonna try it again.
- Hey.
- [ All ] ** Happy birthday to you **
- ** Happy birthday to you **
- Okay, everybody.
- I want you to take a look atJim.
-******[Singing Continues]
Is heallredwith one of those fake "Oh, I'm-a-good-sport" grins onhis face ?
That's right.
Now, everybody, take a look at Ray.
Does he have one of those...
"This-wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" looks on his face ?
Uh-huh. I thought so. There's nothing you can do about it, Ray.
- We're ahundredmillionmiles away!
- [Crew Taunting]
Okay, let's blow it out.
- We're all set here, chief.
- Let's crank up thejuice, see what's in this sucker.

Problem..hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail.
- Solution ?
- [ Terri ] Replace optical relay.
Piece of cake.
God, who dreams up these nightmares ?
- Don't try to change the subject.
- I'm not.
- We're talking about your sister's wedding.
- No, we're talking about... dancing lessons before my sister's wedding.
Do you mind ? I'm in the middle of a catastrophic power failure here. Check.
- [ Chuckles ] Not effective.
- Not effective ?
- Replace optical relay.
- You're distracting me.
We're a married couple.
Would it kill you to invite me... out on the dance floor just once in a while ?
- We danced at our wedding.
- No, that's not dancing.
That's you shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt.
I'm talking about real dancing, you know ?
Cha-cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug.
Darling, face it.
Some couples dance, some go to Mars.
- [ Chuckling ]
- That's life.
- Test.
- Effective.
I'm serious. As soon as we get back home, we're starting lessons.
Woody, if we never dance, people are gonna think there's something wrong.
If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong.
This is highly unprofessional.
"This is highly unprofessional, sir."
You keep forgetting that "sir."
[Phil Over Radio]
Cockpit, this is Control.
- Cockpit, this is Control.
- Control, this is Cockpit.
- [Alarm Blaring]
- Terri, it's Phil. They want us all to report to Micker ASAP.
- Who says to report to Micker ?
- The little men who live in my head.
That's a negative.
We're in the middle of a catastrophic power failure right now.
Yeah, Woody, it was Ray Beck.
He told me to round up the team, now.
The exact same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up this intense burst of energy from Mars.
- What do you mean "intense" ?
- Catastrophic.
What about the crew ?
The level ofenergy in the pulse... didn't seem survivable.
How about the REMO ?
It went into Mars' orbit last week.
Maybe it could give us some clue.
That's just what we tried next.
Right. The, uh, resupply module checked out fine.
No instrument failures. Orbit holding steady. But there was something else.
The REMO's computer contained an uplink message-- a very faint, highly-distorted transmission from Mars One base camp.
- Someone's alive.
- Yes, yes, yes. Put up the message.
Still concentrating on the audio, but we've got a long way to go.
Show us whatever you've got.
Show us.
I have to make this-- make this fast.
[Panting] l may not get another chance to--
[Static lnterference] tomake--another chance-- chance-- to thesite--site.
There was a low sound that--
[Static Continues]
[Signal Breaking Up] alow sound--sound--alow sound--
Something came out of the top of the mountain, and it hit us.
And... it hit us-- it hit us--
Oh, my God !
[ Crying ]
They're dead.
God. Nick--
Man ! Dead.
- [Static Stops]
- [Ray] That's it.
I don't know.
Luke must be in pretty bad shape... if he hasn't just blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle.
That thing's designed so even one crew member can fly it back to Earth.
Even if Luke was in great shape, he couldn't get home.
An energy pulse of that magnitude would have fried the E.R.V's computers.
Other than the computers, how do we think the E.R.V. fared ?
So far, our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape.
Which means it's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards, drives and sof tware to Mars as fast as we can.
- Right.
- Slow down, slow down, slow down.
- It's gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data.
- Right.
But in the meantime, we've gotta be working up a mission plan.
- Luke needs us now.
- Luke may already be dead.
And even if he's not, it's doubtful he is going to be able to transmit again.
So... we wouldn't know whether it's safe to land... until we were almost there.
What about SIMA ?
What about SIMA ?
The Saturn imaging probe.
It's gonna slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system.
It could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels of Mars One base camp.
Wait, wait, wait.
We are getting ahead ofourselves.
You're forgetting the bigger problem.
The orbits are all wrong.
Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now.
Yes, but we can go earlier and get there faster... ifwe reconfigure the payload for extra fuel.
- We've modelled that, Ray.
I've modelled it.
- On paper, yes.
But those stresses have never been tested in space.
- The ship can take it.
- Oh, "ship can take it."
I wasn't thinking of just the ship.
You're right.
I know the protocols for a Mars recovery mission better than anybody... because I designed them.
And I'm telling you, these guys can do it.
He's right, Ray.
We've got a real shot here.
Hmm.
Well. Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow.
You'll have it by 0600.
Let's go to work.
Chief, can I have a word ?
Go ahead.
- I no longer have the right crew.
- What do you mean ?
- Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle.
- Bjornstrom is a geologist.
He's good, but not for this. My people just lost eight months of training.
This is a different mission with a different objective.
- I haven't approved the mission yet.
- Yes, but whenyou do, it ought to be given its best chance for success.
I want McConnell to fly right seat.
Oh.
Jim McConnell is no longer on mission status.
- Yeah, because you washed him out.
- He washed himselfout.
He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but... he refused to take them.
His wife was dead.
He didn't want to lay on the couch and share it with strangers.
That was his call, butlhad tomake one too!
It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again !
For Christ's sake, Ray.
She wasted away in front of his eyes.
What was he supposed to do, suck it up ? Get with the program ?
What was his crime ?
That he showed a little emotion ?
I couldn't trust him !
When Maggie died, it knocked the hell out ofhim.
It knocked the hell out of all ofus.
Butyou know and I know he's still the best we've got.
He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars.
He's had more hours in the sims than the rest ofus put together.
We can do this. You give me McConnell as copilot, and we will bring Luke home.
It's a promise.
[ Sighs ]
Hey.
- What's that ?
- That is the exact genetic composition... of my ideal woman.
Hmm.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
My baby.
- Now what is it ?
- A frog ?
[ Beeping ]
- Hey, skip.
- Hey. Take a look.
[Jim ]
Damn.
[Woody]
Whatdo youmake of that ?
Duststorm.
Southern hemisphere, coming from the east.
Big fella too.
-Headed straight for Mars One base camp.
-Yep.
- Could get a little hairy right about landing time.
- Yeah.
Listen, we're gonna have to be able to move fast. Maybe even advance our E.T.A.
These bad boys can cover a whole planet and last up to a year.
- When does SI MA do her flyby ?
- Tomorrow morning, 0600.
That's when we find out whether we've come all this way for nothing.
My money's on Luke.

Enhancedlookatbase camp.
- [Woody]ltlooks deserted.
- It's stillstanding, though.
So's the E.R. V.
And look, there's the green house.
Well, we know Luke survived for at least a few hours.
Now, are there anysigns of recent activity ?
There. Scan northe astern quadrant of base camp.
What the hell are those ?
Graves.
[Phil] Wait aminute.
There's only three of them.
-That means Luke's still gotta be alive.
-Phil, no, no.
Itjust means there was no one lef t to bury him.
- Check the radiation levels.
- Check rad levels.
Normal.
- Go to disaster site.
- Go to 41 by 9.
- [Woody] What's wrong ?
- [Phil] ldon't know.
Magnetic interference ?
- Go infrared.
- Switch to infrared.
It's gotta be a problem with SI MA.
I don't see how an earthquake six months ago could cause this kind ofdistortion.
That was no quake.
We are going to continue analysing this data... and try to determine what the problem is with those images.
We agree that the evidence of the graves is, uh, inconclusive... and that a groundsearch is advisable.
Frankly, we are as stumped asyouguys, but we'llkeep onit.
- Beware there are little sand storms kicking up...
- Bureau babble. near Mars One base.
But the big one youspotted is turningsouth.
Itshouldn'tbe a factor.
We are all pretty excited around here, and we are sure you must be feeling the same.
- Enjoyyourmeal, and get a goodnight's sleep.
- Say it.
- We anticipate...
- Say it.
- that tomorrow morning...
- Say it. you will be go.
Yes ! Yes ! thank you. thank you.
- [ People Cheering ]
- [ Woody] Hooray for babyJimmy !
[ Luke ] Yes,Jim's firsr spaceship was seriously underpowered.
- [ Woody] Maggie was always a little starstruck.
- [People Laughing]
- [ Woody]
Show us those beautiful teeth.
- [ People Whooping ]
[ Maggie ]
I am gonna getyou guys for that !
[ Luke ] When they met at the Air Force Academy, it was love at firsr flight. Woody's line.
[ Woody] Later, during NASA training, things got a little tough.
Yes, Maggie always did keep jim on a short leash.
Jim was always trying to explore a heavenly body.
[Laughing Continues]
- Where are the ygoing ?
- [Phil] Ten thousandmile-high club.
[ Luke ] Until--
[ Drumroll With Hands ]
- [ Woody] Mission accomplished !
- Oh !
- Man, what a fun wedding !
I was so whacked.
- [ Laughing ]
[ Luke ]
Uh, I'm going in. T-minus three,
T-minus two, T-minus one, contact.
- Oh. Okay, we can stop there.
- [ All Taunting ]
Stop it there.
Fast forward.
[Chattering, Laughing]
Okay, you guys.
[ Clears Throat ]
They are adding a wonderful chapter to their incredible story, and it's a pretty historic one.
- To the newly appointed co-commanders of Mars One, Jim and Maggie !
- Hear, hear !
- [ People Whooping ]
- I will drink to that.
- thank you.
- [ Luke ] Hold it. It's not over.
- [ Phil ] Show 'em, show 'em.
- Yeah, we got a little addendum.
- Check this out, guys. Here we go.
- It's Phil's best work.
Look, it's Mars.
You can pick up these postcards atyour local NASA souvenir shop.
When you two land up there, it will prove once and for all...
- that there really is no intelligent life on Mars.
- All right, touché.
- You're gonna eat those words.
- I don't think so.
- Give me the camera.
- [Woody] Uh-oh, here we go.
- [Maggie] What if I'm right ?
- [Woody] What if she's right ?
- You okay ?
- [Maggie]
Can't it just be about science ?
- We'll do the science, and do it really well,
- Yeah. because that's what we've trained for.
But what if there's more ?
In all our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special attraction.
I mean, what if that means something ?
The universe is not chaos.
It's connection.
Life reaches out for life.
That's what we were born for, isn't it ?
To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one.
[ Sighs ]
It's who we are.
You know, she may have been right.
If that wasn't a quake down there, then something else caused it... or planned it.
You're thinkin' the same thing.
It's never been out of my mind.
I think she knew something, Woody.
She was the only one ofus who ever really believed... there might be something down there.
Yeah, well, we're not leaving till we fi nd out.
Deal ?
Deal.

Phil, you've got to get the nav computers back on-line.
Uh,Jim,
I've got an idea.
If you guys can save enough atmosphere,
I'll disconnect the power in the main computer bay and jump-start the systems.
- I'd basically be doing a hard boot.
- Has that been tested ?
Are you kidding ?

- How much time we got, Phil ?
- I don't know. Three minutes ?
I don't know.

-Jim, we're dead stick.
There's no way to maneuver this ship into linkup.
Not theship.
Justus. We go E. V.A.
- You want us to transfer in suits ?
- Ifwe don't make it--
- Ifwe miss the REMO--
- There's no other choice.

Let's go!
- [Terri] What are you looking for?
- Earth.
[ Chuckles ]
Hey.
When we get back home, we really will have to try this out in the sim.
How are we doing on the fuel, Woody ?
I'm at 50 percent.
I don't see the REMO.
There it is.
Forty-five left, forty-five down.
[ Woody] Oh,Jesus.
She's not where I thought she'd be.
- [ Phil ] We're gonna miss her.
- [Jim ] What do you think ?
You can't catch it.
Not like this.
Use the tether. You'll have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach.
Negative. It's toorisky.
If we miss it, we gotnothin'.
I'll leave you the gun.
Run a line out to the REMO.
I got enough fuel left for that.
- You'll be goin' too fast.
- I'll aim to overshoot.
I'll brake like hell and arc it in.
Piece of cake.
I'll see you in a flash.
[Jet Packs Hissing ]
Unhook me.
Good to go.
Okay, I'm on a path to overshoot.
I'm going to take the edge off.
I'm out of fuel.
Coming in hot. Still long.
[ Beeping ]
Abandoning the unit.
I'll brake with suit jets.
Jesus. Jesus.
[ Breathing Heavily]
Suit jets gone.
I'm gonna make contact.
- What velocity ?
- Impact's gonna be a little rough.
- [Jim]At what velocity ?
- Thirty-two.
I'm gonna use the gun to slowyou.
- If you slow me, I'll fallshort.
- [Jim] It's too fast, Woody.
No choice ! I'll be okay.
Here we go !
Gotcha.

- Woody !
- [ Grunting ]
Woody! Woody!

Woody!
- Woody!
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
- Terri.
- What ?
Take the gun.
Take it.
Phil, hang on.
Go !
- [Jim] Woody, what'syour status ?
- Well, uh, my suitjets are gone, and I'm still carrying a good deal of velocity.
Soon as we get hooked up,
I'll come getyou.
[Woody]
I'd have to say negative on that,Jim.
- Negative on the transmission ?
- No, I heard ya.
Negative on the maneuver.
- I am not retrievable.
- [Terri] Woody, you're not going that fast.
[Woody] Well, it all comes down to the amount of fuel, honey.
Suit jets are designed for attitude control, not travel.
- Retrieval just won't work.
- Well, it's gotta work.
Hey, listen. I don't like it any more than you do.
- Run the numbers,Jim.
- I am.
[ Beeping ]
You hang tight, Woody.
We'll get in the REMO, drop her down and come scoopyou up.
- [Woody] Sounds good,Jim.
- [Terri]
It's gonna takehalf anhour... to get the REMO reoriented. Woody will be in the atmosphere by then !
Then we'll just have to get her moving faster.
- We don't have time.
- Listen to Jim, honey.
It's a good plan.
No.
We're gonna come getyou.
- [Jim] Okay, get ready for brakes.
- Come on, now.
- On my mark. Three, two, one.
- [Woody]
You can do it! Youcan do it!
- Come on! Come on!
- [Jim ] Mark.
Yeah! Yeah!
- Everybody good ?
- We're on,Jim.
Way to go. Way to go.
Good job.
All right. There won't be enough room for us inside.
Soon as I get the hatch open, let's start dumping the cargo.
- [Jim] Copy that. Hang on, Woody.
- Will do,Jim.
Hello, beautiful.
[ Breathing Heavily]
- Come on.
- [Jim]Allright. It's open.
- [ Shouts ]
- Terri, no !
Terri ! Come back !
- You'll never make it!
- Terri, what are you doing ?
I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody.
I'm not gonna watch you die.
- [Woody] Terri.
- You'd do the same for me.
Phil, get inside, dump the cargo and start the systems. Now !
- [Woody] No, I wouldn't.
Not if it was impossible.
- I can do it !
No, you can't! You don't have enough fuel to come get me and get us back.
- [ Breathes Deeply]
- Listen to me, goddam it.
- You have to stop, and you have to stop now.
- He's right, Terri.
It's no use.
[ Beeping ]
- Okay, honey.
- [ Sobbing ]
You gotta go back now.
The hell I do.
[ Whispers ]
Yeah.
[ Gasps ]
[ Gasping ]
What are you doing ?
I'm gonna jet in a little closer and try again.
Terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you won't get back.
And if anyone tries to get you, they'll die too.
- [ Breathing Heavily]
- Honey, please.
Please go back.
Go back and help the others to the surface.
I am not losing you !
I can't let you do it.
I can't let you die.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
What are you doing ?
- I Love you, honey.
- Woody !
No! No!
- God, how I love you.
- Woody! Don't!
Woody! Woody!
Woody ! Don't !
No !
No !
Please, God, no !
[Sobbing]
Woody.
[Continues Sobbing]
Woody.
[ Continues Sobbing ]
Come back, Terri.
He's gone.
No.
- No !
- Terri.
- We need you.
- Woody.
No.
No. No.
No.
No.
Please, Terri.
Come back.
[ Sighs ]
Ray, we've got some new data just coming in.
Wejust--
It doesn't make any sense.
We're not sure how to read this.
- Data ?
- Yes.
Telemetry reports the REMO left its orbit and reached the Martian surface.
- Crashed ?
- No, sir.
- Under power.
- What ?
Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line.
Sir, the graph shows a controlled descent, but that doesn't make any sense.
They used the REMO as a lander.
It's-- It's jim McConnell.
It's got to be.
Nobody else could have pulled this off.
Nobody else.
Son of a bitch.
[Hydraulics Hissing]
I've got access to the E.R.V.
I'm going to go inside.
[ Grunting ]
[Phil]
Terri, is the oxygen generator okay ?
Yeah. It's gonna take a while to get it back to 1 00 percent capacity, though.
Okay, I'm entering the hab.
[ Beeping ]
There's still oxygen in here.
This is a little spooky.
I don't like the dark... at all.
Need some lights.
Need some lights.
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Where are we ?
Here we go.
E.R.V. appears to be structurally intact.
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Beeping ]
Yeah, butjust as we thought, the computers are fried.
Copy that.
I got busted fi lters here.
Clogged intakes.
Hell of a cleanup job, but so far, no major damage.
I'm in the greenhouse.
You gotta see this.
What is it,Jim ?
[Jim]
It's working.
I'llbe damned.
[ Inhales Deeply]

You're not here !
You are not here !

You're reading
Treasure lsland with him.
Luke--
It's all right.
It's me.
-Jim ?
- Yeah.
No, wait !
No, no, no, wait, wait !
He's all right.
He's all right.
Phil.
Terri.
Jim--Jim, what are you--
What are you doing here ?
You're not supposed to be-- You're not supposed to be here. How are you here ?
- How are you here ?
- This is a rescue mission.
Woody wanted me right seat.
[ Stammering ]
[ Sobbing ]
I can't--
I can't believe--
[ Continues Sobbing ]
Well, where is he ?
Where's Woody ?
He didn't make it.
God.
Ohh. Ohh.
Oh, no. No.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Well, it works, you know ?
I give them...
CO2 and light, and they give me oxygen and food.
It's-- It's actually not a bad arrangement.
It's like a marriage, really, except not as many-- not as many fights.
- [ Chuckles ] I mean, some fights.
- Luke.
Tell us what happened here.
We fi red the radar, and it-- it came and... they all died.
They all--
They all died.
W-What do you mean ?
What came ?
The force came out of the top of the mountain and-- and-- and... everybody died, but I was spared.
Why ? Why ?
Ithad to be forareason.
And then all of a sudden,
I knew the reason why.
It's so someone would be left to figure out the secret.
You know, it's--
[ Chuckles ]
J-J -J ust come.
Just come, come, come, come.
Come, come.
Is itjust me, or is he a few meal packs short of a picnic ?
Long-term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain.
Or then, he could be suffering from some form of asphyxia.
Or maybe his whole crew died, and he's been marooned alone on Mars for a year.
It's a miracle he survived this long.
I'd better bring him up to speed.
Great. Great.
Great, great, great, great.
So, let me be sure
I understand this.
Your ship blew up with all its supplies, then you emptied all the cargo out of the REMO, and it was totalled on landing.
You got no food, no water, no spare oxygen.
Nothing other than what
I'm looking at right here.
[ Chuckles ]
What k-- What kind of rescue mission is this,Jim ?
[ Chuckles ]
- That kind.
- Check it out.
New nav boards for the E.R.V.
I got four round-trip tickets, baby, right in here.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you, God.
Oh, thank God.
[ Luke ] When I came to and dug myselfout of the sand, my faceplate was cracked.
It was... Ieaking, leaking badly.
I barely made it back to base.
It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there... and look for--
[ Sighs ] and look for their bodies.
Renee was the only one
I could find, but itjust... didn't seem right somehow tojust dig one grave.
[ Sighs ]
Oh, God.
[Wind howling]
- Has it been blowin' like this for a while ?
- Yeah.
[Jim]
We sawabigstorm on ourscreens, butMickersaid it was turningsouth.
Ifit holds course.
Luke, this-- this whatever it was-- this-- this force--
You said it came directly out of the top of the mountain ?
Don't you believe me ?
[ Scoffs ]
That's okay,Jim.
You don't believe me, that's okay.
But I'm not crazy, I know that much.
- I'm not crazy.
- What'd you mean by its "secret" ?
What secret ?
Listen, hundreds of millions of years have gone by, okay ? You've got erosion,
Iava flow, sand storms, meteor impacts.
Hell, in that time the whole surface of the planet would have changed, so it's no wonder we never saw it before.
I mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us to.
There was too much dirt on it.
Saw what, Luke ?
Saw this.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Luke, what are you trying to tell us ?
- Are you trying to tell us that's a face ?
- That's the face.
[Luke]
It's the face. It's real.
Somebody put that thing there, andit's notus.
Jim--
It's not possible.
[ Gasps ]
Jesus.
- Lookat that.
- [Terri]My God.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I know.
Luke, what about that sound you heard before the explosion ?
Oh, yeah, good,Jim.
That's the key. That's the key.
[ Low Hum ]
You hear that ?
Yeah.
[ Low Pulses ]
- Those pauses.
Do you hear the pauses ?
- Mm-hmm.
See, that's what made me realize it's a pattern.
It's a repeating pattern.
- Mathematical ?
- [Luke] Mm-hmm.
That occurred tome too.
There are distinctblocks within eachpattern, and within each block, the tones come in groups of three.
It's three-three-three, three-three-three.
Always three-three-three.
It's always thesame.
Formonths, lstruggled toanalyze it, trying different constructs, and then I thought about dimensions.
- X-Y-Z coordinate.
- Exactly. Three groups equals three dimensions.
So l-l assigned different graphic values to each block, group and tone, and I came up with this.
[ Whirring ]
- [Luke] Hello.
- [Phil]Oh, my God.
Is that what I think it is ?
- [Terri] DNA.
- You see it ?
Yeah.
It's a model of DNA.
[Phil]So--So somebody left that thing here. Okay.
Somebody other than human.
But, uh, what is it ?
It's a signature.
It's a self-portrait ofwhatever species created the face.
Yeah, but that DNA looks human.
[Terri] No, it's not. It's missing thelastpair ofchromosomes, see ?
- [Jim]lt's close. It's damn close.
- [Terri] Close ?
The difference between man and ape is less than three percent genetic material.
But that three percent gives you Einstein, Mozart.
Jack the Ripper.
[Luke]
Yeah, he's right.
Four pallets, oral, topical medications, splints, bandages, one complete med pack.
With eight tubes of antifungal cream.
Well, at least we won't rash to death.
[ Chuckles ]
Luke.
- How do you feel ?
- Lighter.
- A lot lighter.
- Welcome back.
Thanks, man.
The backup generator is salvageable.
So are two of the solar panels.
I'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production.
So we're not in such bad shape, considering.
That's good, Terri.
Good work.
Jesus.
Look at this.
Phil's idea of absolute essentials.
Ofcourse.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ComputerBeeping]
Hey, hey, hey !
Hey !
My baby.
It's not a signature.
[Luke]
What ?
The noise from the face.
It's not a signature.
It's a test.
It's asking us for the right answer.
It wants us to put in the missing pair ofchromosomes.
- Why ?
- To prove that we're human.
We fi red radar into that thing, concentrated radio waves, and you're saying--
Which it interpreted as the wrong answer.
It's-- It could be like a security alarm.
When it gets an incorrect response, it defends itself.
So what happens when it gets the right answer ?
Well,
I don't know that,
Phil.
But we gotta find out.
Luke, what ifwe work this the otherway ?
We figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes, and then dub them into your recording of the signal.
- Is that possible ?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, l-l think so.
- Good, good, good.
What about the radar gun ?
Will it accept the input... so we can transmit a completed signal back to the face ?
[Phil] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Holdon,Jim.
What if you're wrong ?
Whoever goes out there--
I mean, what if you're wrong ?
Three people have already died over that thing.
[Terri]
Four.
Terri.
Ifwe leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain.
We don't--
We don't have to go out there.
[Jim]Got alot of static here.
Something's interfering.
[ Luke ] Yeah. The antenna got knocked around pretty badly in the blast.
This is the best resolution
I thinkwe're gonna be able to get.
All right, guys.
I got the nav boards.
I'm sealing the air lock.
- Check the video feed.
- Video feed looks good.
- How close do we have to get ?
- [Luke] I'm notsure.
Maybe I'll stop it right over there by that rock.
Do it. Good.
[ Static ]
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Here we go.
[ Sighs ]
[ Whirring ]
Lookat that,Jim.
[Chuckles]
It worked.
Oh, God, it worked.
Guys, I don't know what the hell wejust did, but does that look to you like a hostile gesture ?
No. More like an invitation.
Oranothertest.
- Check for radiation.
- [Luke]Normal.
Seismic normal.
Anemometer steady.
Luke, does the rover still work ?
Phil, do you read ?
Yeah,Jim. Your signal's breaking up a little in the storm, but I read you.
We're at the face.
We're gonna need a few minutes here.
Same deadline.
Launch at 1 950 with or without us.
Copy ?
Copy that.
Jim, you sure you want to do this ?
I'm not sure about anything any more.
But I didn't come 1 00 million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet.
Yeah.
Please work.
- This is gonna work.
- [ Machinery Beeping, Whirring ]
Yes. Yes.
Computers are on-line.
I am going to start loading software.
[Jim ]
The surface... seems fi rm and level.
[ Luke ]
Roger that.
- [ Luke ] The texture's smooth.
- [ Terri ] I've got good footing.
[ Terri ]
No obstructions.
Let's check our P.S.I.
Guys, I gotta tell you--
We're losing visibility here really fast. Over.
- [ All Breathing Heavily]
- [ Terri ] It's solid. We're trapped.
[Jim ] Don't move.
Just keep this orientation.
Guys ?
Luke ? Terri ? Jim ?
Phil, can you still hear me ?
Is anyone there ?
Over.
[ Grunting ]
God. That's it.
There's no handles. We're not gettin' out ofhere unless they let us out.
-Jim, whatare you doing ?
- What are you doing ?
Stop it ! Stop it !
- [ Terri ] You're depressurizing !
- [ Luke ] Seal your suit now !
- There's pressure in here.
- Above Mars atmospheric.
It's impossible.
We're millions of miles from Earth inside a giant white face.
What's impossible ?
There's 12 P.S.I. in here.
Nitrogen and oxygen.
Otherwise known as air.
[ Chuckling ]
Hey, wait Jim. I haven't checked for lethal trace gases, and I haven't--
[ Sighs ]
What the hell.
- [ Chuckling ]
- [ Chuckling ]
Look.
- Is that what I think it is ?
- Yeah. It's Mars.
[Luke]
That's where they went.
[Jim]
Look. One stayed behind.
[Terri]Earth.
Before the continents separated.
[Luke]
My God. That's it.
Hundreds of millions of years ago, there was a sudden explosion of life on Earth.
The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared.
No one has ever understood why or how it happened.
[ Luke ]
They seeded Earth.
[ Luke ]
They seeded Earth.
They're us.
We're them.
Luke ? Terri ? Jim ?
Anyone ?
E.R.V. to rover.
Rover, this is E.R.V.
Does anyone copy ?
Does anyone copy ?
[Phil Breaking Up OverRadio]
E.R. V. torover. Rover, this is E.R. V.
- Do you copy ?
- Phil ?
- Oh, thank God.
- Phil, we read you.
Listen, this storm is getting really bad.
It's going to totally sock us in in a few minutes. You've got to get back.
- Phil ?
- I repeat.. You've got to getback to theship.
Phil ?
We're in a ship.
This... is a ship.
And the... countdown's already started.
- He's right.
- Yeah.
Yeah, let's get the hell outta here.
Jim ? Jim ?
Come on, we gotta go.
- I'm not comin' with you.
- [Terri] What ?
What are you talking about ?
You've gotta get home.
That's where I'm going.
Don'tyou see ?
That's-- That's what all this is for.
Terri, you were right.
This is an invitation.
This is aninvitation for us to follow them home.
I'm going.
It's what
I was born for.
Like Maggie said.
To stand on a new world and... and look beyond it to the next one.
I know this is right... for me.
You're running out of time.
You gotta get back to the E.R.V., and you gotta get off this planet.
Thank you for saving my life, buddy.
It was a privilege.
[ Sniffles ]
I wish Woody were here to see you.
He is here, Terri.
We wouldn't have made it without him.
[ Sighs ]
He would have wanted you to have this.
E.R.V. to rover.
Rover, this is E.R.V. Do you copy ?
E.R.V. to Rover.
Rover, this is E.R.V. Do you read me ?
Phil, this is Luke.
Do you copy ?
- He's not reading me.
- I can barely read you.
- Let's get the hell out ofhere.
- Yeah.
I've lost the base camp beacon.
- We're driving blind.
- I'm just going to keep going on a straight line, okay ?
That's our only chance.
- 1949, Terri. We're notgonnamake it.
- No.
I've worked with Phil for four years, and I knowJim gave him a direct order, but he is not gonna leave without us.
Please. Luke ?
Terri ? Jim ?
E.R.V. to rover.
Rover, this is E.R.V. Do you read me ?
[Luke Breaking Up OverRadio]
Phil, do youread?
This is Luke. We're coming in.
Phil ?
- Phil ?
- Phil isn't here right now.
He, uh, left for Earth five minutes ago !
Please leave a message after the beep !
[ Relieved Laughter]
[ Grunting ]
Where is jim ?
He caught another ride.
- Dear God, look at that.
- Is that him ?
[Luke]
Have a greatride,Jim.
Yes!
Winner!
You own this table!
Where's Bernie? They're killing us.
We need him here right away.
Yeah!
Come on, baby.
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Seven out.
Oh, man!
Come to Papa-
Hey, what the hell?!
God damn it, that's supposed to be an $800 jackpot.
- Afternoon, Doris.
- Hey.
- Got any cream?
- Sure.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
Dewar's and-
Fuck!
Dewar's and water, please.
Hi, Natalie.
- Hey...
- Bernie.
Shit, motherfucker!
Yeah, Bernie.
Yo, Doris, have you seen
Shelly around?
He promised to position me at the tables tonight.
I've been on skid row all week.
You didn't settle up with me last night.
No? You sure?
Fuck, I was way under.
It's been like an AA convention around here.
I'll make it up to you tonight,
I promise.
Where have I heard that before?
- If I see Shelly, I'll tell him...
- Thanks.
...that you're looking for him.
Conway, party of 11.
Please check your reservation in the Paradise Lounge.
Hey, Bernie,
Shelly needs you on 11.
All right.
Let's do the Chivas Regal.
And have that- have Natalie bring it over, the one working the nickel slots by the Paradise.
I spoke to Shelly earlier.
He wants her out on the tables.
All right.
I'll take care of it.
Great shot.
How about that?
Hi. It's you, right?
Yeah, over here.
Joe said
I should stick around.
You say something to Shelly?
Um-hmm.
Wow, that was fast.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
It's over here.
I'll win you a fortune on five and nine.
Did you order the Chivas Regal?
Hey, back off, will you, pal?
Can't you see I got a roll here?
- Seven out, line away.
- That motherfucker.
- Thanks for the bet, folks.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
Oh! Shoot!
Better luck next time.
Ah-hh.
- Shelly, they're here.
- Relax, shorty.
Hey. Nicky, you didn't tell me you were coming.
I'm having a manicure here.
You think I don't wash up after going to the john, huh?
Forget about it. You look like a million bucks. How are you?
You should have called ahead.
I would have sent the car.
- No, we figured we'd surprise you.
- Anytime, Nicky, anytime.
I know that, partner.
Shelly, let me introduce you to our brightest VP here.
This is Larry Sokolov.
His numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.
- How do you do, Shelly?
- Can I get you something to drink?
I'd love a vodka tonic, thanks.
...comes out of the confessional and she says, "Move over, I have to gargle. "
So Nicky, what brings you to town?
Shelly, I've got a smart kid here.
He's got some good ideas about how to revitalize the Shangri-La.
Revitalize? What are you talking about?
We did $35 million last year.
Why don't you just hear the kid out, huh?
Shelly, I want you to know that I have nothing but the utmost respect for you.
You've done a tremendous job with the Shangri-La over the last 16 years.
I don't think anybody can dispute that.
Yeah, nobody doubts that, Shell.
But the business has changed.
Just take a look at the Strip, you'll see what I'm talking about.
What?
You mean that Disneyland mookfest out there? Huh?
Come on, you know what that is?
Huh? That's a fucking violation is what that is.
It's something that used to be beautiful.
It used to have class, like a gorgeous high-priced hooker with an exclusive clientele.
Then along comes that Steve Wynn cocksucker and knocks her up and puts her in a fucking family way.
Now, she's nothing but a cheap fat whore hiding behind too much make-up.
I look at her and see her stretch marks.
It makes me want to cry, because
I remember the way she used to be.
Am i right?
There's no arguing the bottom line.
Those places are raking it in... and the Shangri-La as she is now can't compete with that.
You think I'm trying to compete with that?
You think that's what we're about, trying to bring in the stroller crowd, fresh off some "E-ticket" ride, trying to break the house on red and black?
Fremont has never been about that bullshit.
This is where old time and real money come to play.
The numbers don't back you up on that, Shelly. Don't get me wrong.
Nostalgia is great and we love nostalgia...
...but nostalgia belongs in a museum.
I think it comes a time to decide whether you're running a museum... or you're running a casino.
Bernie.
"Mr. Cool. "
You got a minute?
- I was just heading over to 14.
- It can wait.
How's the knee?
I met this orthopedic surgeon at Vegas Memorial.
He tells me... they can rebuild a man's entire kneecap out of titanium.
Oh, of course it costs a shitload of money, but seeing as this gentleman is into us for 500 large, I thought maybe-
I told you, I'm not gonna be here after Sunday.
Where are you gonna go,
Bernie?
Where the fuck are you gonna go that's better than here?
I've got you covered in this town.
People know you work for me.
That's currency in your pocket.
That's fucking respect, when you walk the floor.
Where are you gonna get that, anyplace else?
Seven days, Shelly...
I'm out from under.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
What's your name, darling? Never mind.
This is who I am.
Yeah, that's right. I like to know who's shopping it around in my neighborhood, so what you do is be in my offiice first thing tomorrow morning, if you want to continue to work here at the Shangri-La and you and I will go over the rules together.
I also want you to bring me a clean bill of health. All right, my dear?
- Okay.
- All right, thank you.
How'd you like to "birdie" that hole, huh?
Say the word and she's yours anytime.
I'll keep a running tab for you.
Nah.
What? What? She's not your type?
Are you kidding me?
I've got to go.
Things are heating up on 14.
Let's do it in the room.
Kim, I think we got our laundry mixed up. I- I'll talk to you later.
Come on, let's go back to the room.
$50 bucks only gets you 20 minutes, man.
You're wasting your time.
Your soul is crippled.
I'm gonna change that.
Pray with me now.
Out, demon!
Let the crutches go!
Let the spirit into you!
Run with me!
Fuck me harder!
Harder! Oh!
Oh, yeah, baby.
I like that. Come on.
Come on, come on.
You're so big!
You do? Hallelujah!
The Lord has shown his face once again.
You gonna come all over me?
Oh, yeah, come all over me.
Let's do this, man.
Eight, the hard way.
- $900 for Mr. Pinkerton.
- Seven and Seven.
- Thanks, dollface.
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a fucking klutz.
- No, this stuff happens.
- Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. This guy- fucking hands all over my ass.
You might want to stick around.
I came to play.
Come again, sister, in the name of Pinkie.
Take this.
Hard eight, huh?
How you like that?
Suck on that.
That's right. Give me them dice.
Damn right.
One dollar, hard eight.
All right, everybody, get in. Here we go.
We'll bet $10.
- Out! Seven out.
- Shit! God!
What the fuck are you smiling at, bitch?
Whoa, whoa... easy.
Fellas?
- You think it's fucking funny?
- Take it easy, man.
Think it's funny this place is stealing my- fucking numb-nuts, let go of me.
I'll have you fired, you piece-of-shit bitch! Piece of fucking garbage!
~ But now I couldn't do without my supply ~
~ I need you for my own ~
~ Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day ~
~ As regularly as coffee or tea ~
~ You got me in your clutches and I can't break free ~
~ You're getting to be a habit with me... ~
Oh, Shelly.
I love you, Shelly.
He's the man, he's the best man. Salut.
- No, no, no.
- He hates that shit. He really does.
~ I used to think your love... ~
~ Was something that I... ~
~ Could take... ~
~ Or leave alone ~
~ But now I couldn't do without my supply... ~
- There he is.
- Hey.
Shelly, I was a fucking embarrassment out there, do you understand that?
You should never have talked me into going out there, Shelly.
I should have never let you.
Frank is rolling over in his grave.
I've got strep, man.
You understand that? I've got strep.
Listen to me, Pops, you were pure velvet out there. It was just silk.
And also, looky-looky what was hanging on the doorknob. Huh?
Forget about your tonsils.
When the muff confetti stops coming, that's when you know you got trouble.
Did you get a receipt?
- Excuse me?
- They're on sale in the lobby.
Charlayne's. This is "Victoria's Secret
Valentine Collection. "
What about that broad you got coming here later?
How much did she set you back? Nothing but the best for old Buddy, right?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Gimme, you don't deserve this.
You got all those ladies going home with a nice breeze between their legs,
'cause you do it the way they like it and you're saying I'm some
Buddy Stafford ego pimp, huh?
Hey, fuck you and- fuck you.
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me, man. Come on, come on!
Come on, don't be a prick.
Come on, man.
Come on, give it to me!
Come on, man.
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Do you ever watch any of those nature shows?
What?
You know, those nature shows.
You watch them?
Yeah, I've seen a few nature shows.
Yeah? Well, this one I've seen about a dozen times.
It's about... lions.
It's about... the cycle of life of the lions... and the leader of the pack.
- Pride. With lions it's a pride.
- Yeah.
This old king lion, right?
He's getting on in years and then sooner or later some young male comes along.
He challenges him... and he beats the fuck out of this old lion, right?
He just kicks the shit out of him.
And then... then they push him out of the pride... and he has to go in the jungle and scavenge and he dies alone.
The nature's got some sense of humor, huh?
No shit.
See, but Shelly, it's tragic because... he's past it, this old fucked lion... and he doesn't know it and it would be so much easier for him, if he could just... walk away.
And... he could avoid all the pain and the humiliation.
Hey... that would be like accepting that you were dead already, right?
I think I like it better nature's way, don't you?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Yeah, that's it.
Buy you a drink?
Yeah.
Shelly, you got a minute?
Shelly, this is Johnny Cappella.
- How you doing, Shelly?
- I know you from some place, right?
Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage.
Now Sony is talking about signing him to a three-album deal.
They're going to position him as the new Harry Connick.
And I should be interested in this... why?
Johnny's looking to headline.
I thought we might be interested.
- We?
- Did I come at a bad time?
Even if I was interested,
I got fresh ink with Buddy for the next five years.
I just renegotiated his contract.
Listen, you two need to be on the same page.
Larry, listen, if I don't hear from you by Thursday,
I'm taking the Stardust.
All right? I'm going there.
- I understand.
- Johnny Cappella, gone.
- We'll definitely be in touch, Johnny.
- Assholes.
Your progressed
Venus is in Gemini...
12.5 degrees... and it's in direct motion, which means...
...you're a slow starter when it comes to romance.
Sorry. You know what?
This is real unprofessional of me.
I shouldn't discuss your chart with you until I'm all done.
I can tell by the look on your face you think this is all a lot of B. S.
No, I just... I know what the outcome's gonna be.
There's not like one particular outcome.
A lot of things come into the picture, like...
- the planets, the moon phases-
- The outcome won't change with me.
- It'll be all bad.
- Oh, my God.
I have never met anyone who was so down on themselves.
Do you know what I do at the Shangri-La?
I asked around.
You're a cooler.
- You turn winners into losers.
- Do you know how I do that?
Listen, I know there's a lot of stuff that happens in casinos all the time.
I do it by being myself.
People get next to me, their luck turns.
It's always been that way.
Well, that sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.
There's a whole chapter of that in my book...
I only got six more days.
Well... really almost five.
I'm leaving town.
Only five more days?
Then we shouldn't waste any more time.
You want to go back to your place?
If this is-
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure I can afford...
- I can't afford to-
- Christ.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Wait, I didn't mean it.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I've gone and cooled the damn table.
Shut up, Bernie, shut up.
You haven't gone and cooled anything.
Not by a long shot.
Oh, God.
You know... once they're dead, they don't really grow back... in case that's what you were waiting for.
Oh, my God, you got a cat?
So... you got any music?
Hey... come here.
Sit.
Relax, Bernie, relax.
I assure you... at least one of us has done this before.
This is not the first time
I've ever-
Surprise me.
I like this.
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight ~
~ Luck, let a gentleman see ~
~ How nice a girl you can be ~
~ I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with... ~
- They're snaps.
- I think I can get it.
Ow! Wait. Pull down some.
- Okay.
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.
~ It isn't fair... ~
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit.
~ A lady doesn't wander all over the room ~
~ And blow on some other guy's dice ~
~ So let's keep this party polite ~
~ Never get out of my sight ~
~ Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with ~
~ Luck, be a lady tonight... ~
Sorry.
~ Luck, let a gentleman see... ~
It's okay, Bernie.
I've had worse.
Oh, shit. Oh, God.
I know I'm gonna pay for this,
I just-
I don't know who you are or what- I don't...
This was good and I'm glad.
I don't care.
You've got a great cock.
You've-
Thank you.
So... want to go get some breakfast?
They've got these rules about casinos hiring felons, so he got me a gig in telemarketing.
We were scamming pensioners out of their retirement money.
I lasted two weeks.
- Here you go.
- By that time...
I was really getting in deep.
I owed one of the casinos over a hundred grand.
I put Shelly in a really awkward position.
I don't blame him for what he did.
What?
Your leg?
He did that to you?
- He shot you?
- No. Baseball bat.
- I got off easy.
- What do you mean you "got off easy"?
- I was out of control.
- He maimed you, for fuck's sake!
Listen to me.
I'm grateful for what he did.
I am absolutely serious.
Anytime I get an urge to play off the clock or so much as drop a quarter in a slot,
I just reach down and feel what's left of my cartilage.
- It's an excellent reminder.
- Jesus Christ.
I thought shit like that only happened in the movies.
Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a repayment plan.
Six years offi the books at the Shangri-La cooling tables
- and in five days...
- Three.
Oh! Oh, shit.
Oh, my God! Now?
Are you sure?
I'm going into labor.
Yeah, I'm going into labor.
Ow-ww!
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Stay very calm.
Okay, everybody, we're having a baby, we're having a baby.
You fucking cocksucker!
Who puts their bag in the middle of the fucking thing so a pregnant woman can trip over it?
- Mikey?
- Bernie.
I guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie.
Huh. Is this you?
Hey, what the fuck, it runs.
Here, sit down.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Anyway, we've got to get out of here.
- Hey, Mikey.
How's your mom doing?
I'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you she's getting by as long as she's high.
Her name is Charlene, in case you were wondering.
Hey, when's the last time you saw a doctor?
About six months ago, back in Jersey.
I wasn't about to go back there after they treated me like cattle.
Just 'cause I had no insurance, you know?
All those places are crawling with TB from them spics.
Listen, Mikey, if you want to... why don't you drop by the Bettor Life Motel, give us a chance to... to catch up?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe we'll do that.
Play catch up, for the kid's sake.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
$100 minimum table, sir.
No offense, pal, but there's 20 other tables here.
What do you want to come sit on my head for?
I'm just gonna play one hand.
I'm feeling lucky tonight.
I've got this voice in my head that says, "This is the table. "
- Insurance?
- No.
Oh, yes! Yes, yes!
Busto! Mel, what's happening to you?
Oh, yeah, welcome to Mel's house.
Hey, where are you going?
Stick around, pal.
You and me, we make a great team. Hey!
What was that?
I mean, what the fuck gives?
Is it McGann?
The guy's been with me 12 years.
He's as stand-up as my fucking dick.
Maybe he's having money problems.
I'm gonna pull him.
- No, no, no.
- Was he counting them?
- The mook with the streak?
- Is there a problem?
No, there's no problem.
Fella's on a streak, is all.
Let me guess, this is one of your "coolers"?
Why don't you announce it to the whole fucking joint while you're at it?
They told me that you were a sticker for the old ways, but coolers?
What is this guy, really?
A car mechanic? Some kind of shill?
'Cause he doesn't look too effective to me.
- He's the best. Take it from me.
- All right. Sure. Whatever.
There are ways- subtle ways- that we can keep the odds in our favor.
I'm talking about more forward-thinking methods.
I'm sure you've got a whole prospectus on the subject, right?
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah, I do.
For instance,
I can tell you right off the bat the wallpaper's not gonna cut it.
It's too uplifting.
I would suggest going with some more muted tones.
- Wallpaper?
- Yeah. And personally,
I think the cocktail waitresses could pop another button or two.
Myself, I wouldn't hire anything less than a "C" cup.
- You know what that is?
- No.
It's music to be sure.
It's pleasant, not intrusive, but recorded at a subsonic level is a mantra.
"Lose... lose... lose. "
We're just skimming the surface, Shelly.
We really need to talk.
Shelly?
You better come quick.
Contact his daughter and assist with the arrangements.
The Shangri-La will cover all expenses.
- What about the Paradise?
- She's going dark tonight.
Er, that won't be necessary.
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Cool me honey,
I'm on fire ~
~ To steal your love is my desire ~
~ Hug me, squeeze me, till I'm red ~
~ Till my eyes bug out my head ~
~ Coo me, woo me, turtledove ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Please tell me, why are you driving me crazy? ~
~ Why do I dig you like I do? ~
~ If I should steal a little kiss, and you can prove that it was wrong ~
~ Then I'll give it back to you ~
~ Honey, baby with a smile ~
~ I can walk you down the aisle ~
~ I won't even need a shove ~
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
Young lady, over here.
You want to give it a shot?
- Yeah. Come here.
- Five for $1.
- Thanks, Bernie.
- Good luck.
Are you ready?
Shit.
All right, double fisted.
- Damn!
- Too bad. Better luck next time.
- You want to try again?
- Yes.
- No, no, no. Thank you.
- Thanks.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- You're an easy mark, is all.
- I'm an easy mark?
- You know where that comes from?
No.
Years ago, Shelly and me were working
Coney Island for the summer and when I'd see a guy who had a full wallet and was willing to open it up,
I'd mark him with chalk.
I'd put it on my hand and go something like,
"Hey, man, good work. "
"Hey, buddy, how you doing?"
What the guy didn't realize was that when he walked down the way...
Shelly could spot him a mile off.
An easy mark.
Thanks a lot, Bernie.
I've got to sit.
Hi.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Did you notice, last night, that tattoo on my butt?
- Little Joe?
- Yeah.
Yeah, two 2's.
"Little Joe. "
I had a son.
His name was Joe.
I was his mother for one year.
- You don't have to tell me this.
- No, I want to, Bernie.
I gave my son up for adoption.
I just wanted my life back.
I was 17 going on 18 and I was so fucking selfish.
My family didn't want nothing to do with me after that, so I hitched a ride out here and thought
I'd make it as a showgirl.
10 years later...
I'd like to think that if it happened when I was older, with a guy that I cared about, that it would have been different, you know?
I think about my little Joe sometimes and I do know I did the right thing.
I'm convinced of that.
Natalie...
I think...
I think I could kick your ass at the dime toss.
~ You may not be an angel ~
~ 'Cause angels are so few ~
~ But until the day that one comes along... ~
- Would you do something for me?
- ~ I'll string along with you... ~
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
- Bernie!
- Yes!
Oh, yeah.
Ow! Ow! Jesus, ow.
Oh, yeah!
- Bernie, let's do it up the ass.
- Okay.
- Please, please?
- Okay, okay.
- No, my ass!
- Oh!
~ And until the day that one comes along... ~
Yes!
Shut the fuck up in there!
Did we wake you?
~ For every little fault that you have ~
~ See, I've got three or four ~
~ The human little faults you do have ~
~ Just make me love you more... ~
I have to pee.
I'm always peeing.
Hey.
How did you get in here?
I told the desk clerk
Bernie was my old man.
He let us wait inside.
Is that cool with you?
Bernie is out looking for a parking space.
I must have taken the last one.
- I didn't get your name.
- Natalie, Mikey.
Tell me something, Natalie, is he paying you?
Excuse me?
My old man, is he renting your ass?
Because, otherwise,
I just don't get it.
I mean, a loser like my pops in the company of some primo tits and ass?
It don't compute.
Is this enough to get me a little taste?
Family discount?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, baby.
- Mikey!
- Hey, Bernie.
I told you we was gonna stop by.
I thought you'd call ahead first.
We were at breakfast.
Hey. Hey.
You missed some.
Hey, that's nice.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You see, Bernie, the thing is... we're kind of strapped.
I mean, Charly here is expecting like yesterday.
And we don't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her and all.
So I was wondering if you would like to invest a little... maybe in your grandchild's future, his well-being.
It's almost three grand.
That's all I got.
That's- that's very generous.
Bless you, Bernie.
You want to feel it?
You know, I really-
I don't think...
Oh- I just felt a kick.
Come on, Bernie, give me your hand.
- You feel that?
- I don't know. I think so.
- Hey, we'll catch you later, Bernie.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Take care, Dad.
New Shangri-La Hotel and Casino.
We break ground on her in six months.
She's perfect.
Three floors of gaming,
Imax theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, roller coaster.
You name it, we've got it.
She pays for herself in three years.
After that, it's easy money.
Isn't she great, Shell?
In "Lost Horizon, " these people, their plane crashes in the Himalayas and they get rescued,
Taken to this utopia in the mountains, Shangri-La.
It's beautiful.
Totally isolated, untouched by the outside world.
No war, no greed, no bullshit.
Time has slowed down.
You never age.
It's paradise.
You see, that's what Shangri-La is.
It's paradise.
Yeah, we've seen the movie, Shelly.
What's your point?
My point is, you don't fuck with paradise.
Come on. Jesus, Shelly.
Hey, we're not trying to fuck with it.
- We're trying to make it better.
- How?
How you gonna make it better?
It's perfect just the way it is.
It's the last of its kind.
It's pure.
This- this is a fucking mockery.
How is it a mockery, Shelly?
It's right out of the movie.
Who's talking about a movie?
This is not a movie.
This is my fucking life.
Let me ask you one question, where are you gonna be when they decide to change it back?
When people want the real Vegas again, before all this "Epcot Center" bullshit?
Who's gonna give it to them?
You? I don't think so.
You know who? The same fucks who started this in the first place.
You know what's gonna happen?
It's gonna come around full circle and bite you on the fucking ass, take my words for it.
Shelly, you make some good points, huh?
Maybe we'll swing back the other way someday. Who the hell knows?
But for now, this moment,
I suggest we shoot the dice.
My friend, I think you should take some time just to think things through.
I know this is a lot to digest,
I know that.
Wait up a second.
What do you say?
I thought we were gonna go eat.
Why don't you try this table over here?
It's a little less crowded.
No, let's play here.
It's my lucky table. I always play here.
Come on, it's more private over here.
Shelly, I'm a big guy. I know how to take care of myself.
Go ahead. I know how to find you.
Go ahead. Go eat.
Here we go.
Come on.
Out! Seven, line away.
- What the fuck?
- Come on, "Pops. " What the hell?
I could have paid my mortgage with the money I just lost.
File a grievance, all right?
Shithead.
Come on, give me two hot ones.
Come on, new shooter.
Give me 100 on right, 100 big yellow...
All right, shooter. Come on.
Hey, hurry up, Gramps! Come on, your soup's getting cold, huh?
- Four, hard four.
- Give me $25 yellow.
Hey, "Uncle Palsy"... come on, throw them before you fucking keel over and die, old man.
Be there!
Seven, out. Line away.
Thanks for the bets, folks.
Don't take it so hard, Pops.
Everybody craps out.
Now go fucking change your Depends.
That's good.
Who's laughing now?
Crack wise now, you fucking "Ken doll," no-dick, suburbanite, fucking scum.
Huh? Now how's that for a game?
- Nicky, Nicky. Hey, it's all right.
- Get the fuck out of here!
Disrespectful cocksucker!
How do you like the game so far?
Nicky, Nicky, take it easy.
Come on. Come on, come on!
That ain't right!
The guy fucked up my whole game.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
You're right. Forget about him, he's just a piece of shit.
- Let me see your hand.
- My hand is all right.
I got news for you. I thought this joint had more fucking class, okay?
It used to be we didn't let a bum like that in this fucking place.
Come on.
This town... this town, you know, all- all I want to do... is go some place where I can tell night from day, where they've got clocks on the walls.
I can't breathe here anymore.
Four days and I'm gone. I don't even know if I can hold out that long.
So where does that leave us, Bernie?
A week ago,
I couldn't even remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me.
I still pinch myself.
I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up-
Come with me.
Natalie, I want you to come with me.
- God, Bernie.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to spring it on you.
I- I've been working on this compatibility chart, okay?
And it looks good, really it does.
- So, what's the problem?
- The problem is it's only good here.
But that's just for now, for the immediate future.
You know, when the planets realign... maybe next year...
A year!? Natalie,
I can't wait another year.
I can't-
I can't go, Bernie.
- Hi, Doris.
- Hey.
Oh, shit.
Just a second.
Chang, party of 15, your table is ready.
Chang, party of 15.
- All right.
- Come on, papa-to-be!
Come on, y'all.
I want to send my baby to college.
Six and a three, five and a four. Let's go.
This is for our baby's future.
Don't "blow " it.
This is for you.
This one's on the line for the guys with bowties,
- with shoes.
- Oh, yeah.
Dealer's got shoes.
The point's nine.
Let's get that.
A six and a three, a five and a four,
Let's do it. Can we get it?
Can we get it? Come on.
We got a shooter.
Hi, Bernie.
Fucking rock star!
Give me them dice back.
Okay, pay me, moron, pay me. Come on!
- Give him $9,000.
We're on a streak here.
Move it, move it, move it.
God bless you all.
Point is nine. Point is nine.
Let me get all the hard ways for "Team Moron" here, okay? All right.
- This is great!
- For you guys, all right?
- Here we go.
- Come on.
- Six and three. Five and four.
- This is for the baby.
Come on.
Oh, oh, careful!
Come on, guys, with the cigarettes.
We've got a pregnant woman here.
Put them out. I'm winning you guys money. Come on!
Come on.
All right.
What gives?
He's up 18,000 since I stepped up to the table.
Sorry, Shelly. I'm kind of hit-or-miss these days.
- $9,000, $9,000. Oh, baby.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I can feel a kick.
Fucking amateurs.
Let's get it. Let's get it!
Nope. That's it. Line away.
Guys, I thank you.
My pregnant wife thanks you.
My unborn child thanks you very much, okay?
Color me up, will you?
And keep one of these little blue ones for yourself.
Thank you very much.
That's quite a run you had there, champ.
Oh, yeah, lucky!
- Lucky night, I guess, huh?
- It's so exciting to watch, too.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle this in my office.
I don't like to lay out that kind of cash on the floor.
We'll go up there, relax a bit, have a drink, name your poison, a little apple juice for the mother-to-be here.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
- Should I take this stuff with me?
- No.
Yeah...
Okay, that is not how I propose we handle this.
We turn this matter over to the authorities.
They'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined-
Then, I suppose I should stick a fucking lollipop in their mouths for the ride home, huh?
Let me tell you something, "Harvard," come upstairs with me in my office, watch and learn how to protect your investments the old-school way.
Fuck.
Ow, ow, ow... ow!
All right. Here we go everybody. Let's go.
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, wait a second.
Get offi me! No!
Shelly, wait. Wait!
Don't, don't. Don't do this.
Stay out of this, Bernie.
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's got everything to do with me.
He's my son.
Him? This little prick is your son?
- Pop, you've got to help me out here.
- Shut up!
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait. Are you in on this?
- Huh?
- What!?
I asked you a fucking question.
You come clean with me now.
No! For God's sake, what's the matter with you?
I didn't know nothing about this!
Shithead here is your son?
Let me ask you a question.
How much you think their two lives are worth?
Myself, I don't think they're worth piss, but hey, he ain't my kid.
This shithead was up
150 G's down there.
That's 150 grand that somebody's got to account for.
What do you say you cover them both, 75 apiece, huh?
Come on, Shelly.
They didn't get away with the money.
- You haven't lost nothing.
- Go to work.
- Pop! Pop!
- No, wait! Come on!
- Jesus!
- Wait.
All right, all right.
God damn it. All right.
All right, all right.
I'm good for it. $150 G's.
I'm good for it.
- It's all right, honey.
- Oh, my God, the contractions.
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Come on, Shelly.
Oh, for God's sake, Shelly.
Will you help her out?
That's my grandkid.
Oh, my God, that's right.
That's Bernie's grandchild in there.
You all right, sweetheart?
You need to go to the hospital, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- I'll bet you do.
- Jesus!
- Charlene!
Hey, everybody look,
It's a boy!
Oh, can you believe this?
Bernie, you have a grandson!
Bernie's got a little grandson!
Isn't he cute? Isn't he cute?
I think he looks like you, Bernie.
What do you think?
A nice healthy grandson.
Want to hold your grandson, Bernie? Huh?
Break out the champagne, everybody.
Bernie's a grandfather.
You still want to make good on this?
If you want to change your mind,
I don't blame you.
I'll make it up to you, Pop.
I swear.
I'm good for it.
- All right, up on the table, right now!
- Whoa, whoa whoa-
Wait a second.
Shelly, we had a deal!
$150 G's buys their lives.
This is a little slap on the wrist to remember me by.
- Wait, wait.
- No, no!
Jesus, Shelly, no!
Come on.
Fuck!
I brought this on myself.
I planted the seeds.
When Angela had run off with Mikey, I didn't-
I never made-
I never made an effort to get back in his life.
I figured... the kid don't need a fucking loser for a father.
And now it's come full circle.
I give him the money,
I open the door to all this.
This- I got this coming to me.
This is- this is payback.
Are you done beating yourself up, Bernie?
~ My funny Valentine ~
~ Sweet comic Valentine ~
~ You... ~
~ Make me smile with my heart ~
~ Your looks are laughable ~
~ Unphotographable ~
~ Yet... ~
~ You're my favorite work of art... ~
Bernie... are you awake?
I think that...
I love you.
No.
I don't think.
I'm pretty sure of it.
You blindsided me,
Bernie Lootz.
I never saw it coming.
You shouldn't do that to a girl.
There's so many things you don't know, that you should know.
Oh, fuck,
I don't want to ruin this.
It- it don't matter.
It don't matter what you come clean about, it's not gonna change the way I feel about you.
It's not.
Natalie, I...
- I'd say it, but...
- Say it, just say it.
No, with my rotten luck-
Don't- fuck rotten luck, Bernie.
That's over.
I love you, Natalie.
I really, really love you.
Trixie?
You came back?
~ What a day this has been ~
~ What a rare mood I'm in ~
~ Why, it's almost like being in love ~
~ There's a smile on my face ~
~ For the whole human race ~
~ I would swear
I am falling in love... ~
Tell Bernie to go to table six.
~ All the music of life seems to be ~
~ Like a bell that is ringing for me ~
~ And from the way that I feel ~
~ When the bells start to peal ~
~ I would swear
I am falling ~
~ I can swear that I'm falling ~
~ Well, it's almost like being in love... ~
Lovett, party of six, your table is ready.
Duty calls.
Bye.
Yes!
~ All the music of life seems to be ~
~ Like a bell that is ringing for me ~
~ And from the way that I feel ~
~ When the bells start to peal ~
~ I would swear
I am falling ~
~ I can swear that I'm falling ~
~ Well, it's almost like being... ~
~ Well, it's almost like being in love. ~
Hey, Shelly, check it out.
The new "Mega Million. "
I call her "Marnie. "
You know,
'cause she's one frigid broad.
You want to tell me what's going on out there?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
We're down almost a mil out there.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
I guess I'm having an off day.
No, no, no.
You don't have off days, Lootz.
You're shitty luck incarnate.
What's wrong?
You coming down with something?
You have this look about you.
No, no, I'm fine. As a matter of fact,
I've never been better.
- Give it a shot.
- What's that supposed to mean?
She loves me, Shelly.
She told me last night. Natalie.
Should I get her flowers or candy?
What is happening to you?
I think flowers.
Sweet Jesus!
You popped her cherries!
Shut the fuck up!
- I'll stay.
- Scotch on the rocks.
- Here you go, babe.
- Thanks.
Hi, Tone.
Hi, Shell.
Do you believe those fucking kids yesterday?
Don't worry about them, because you and I have other problems now.
You have really fucked things up big time, let me tell you.
I hired you to be his "cooze" companion, not the true love of his fucking life.
But no, you have to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck.
"I love you, Bernie. "
What the hell were you thinking?
Those four words of endearment have cost this casino one million and counting today.
I don't understand what that means.
Lady Luck.
You've heard of "Lady Luck," haven't you?
- Yeah.
- That's what's going on out there.
Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick.
He should have them throwing ice cubes right now, but instead I've got a meltdown on my hands.
So here's the situation. You are out of his life, before he even gets home.
Don't even tell him to his face.
Leave him a note.
I'm gonna make some calls and you're gonna be situated at another joint.
I don't think
I can do that, Shell.
Excuse me?
I said...
I don't think I can do that, Shell.
It wasn't an act.
I meant it.
- You love him?
- Yeah.
I love the schmuck.
What the fuck is there to love?
He's a loser.
Always has been, always will be.
I thought you were a smart cookie when I picked you out.
You do not want to fuck with me.
Because if you do, your next john is going to be a fucking rattlesnake in the fucking desert.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
Get out of here.
Hey, Natalie.
It doesn't matter.
Look.
A six-card 21?
Please!
~ Can I steal a little love? ~
~ Yeah, let me raid a little love. ~
Thank you, thank you.
You guys are too kind.
This next song I'd like to do for you is dedicated to a friend over there.
Brianna, this one's for you.
I want you to tell me the truth, Shelly.
Did you say something to Natalie?
Did you muscle her?
Jesus, Bernie. Is that what you think?
That I would fuck with your happiness?
That hurts me.
I don't know.
This guy is all flash.
No soul.
I miss Buddy.
It's just not the same around here.
Buddy was tired.
I gave him the easy way out.
Things could have been so much worse.
"Gave him the easy way out"?
What are you talking about? He-
Buddy never would have taken the buyout.
He would have stuck to his guns right to the end.
They would have ended up hurting him.
I could not allow that to happen.
Jesus. You- you sit here and you justify it like you're Dr. Kevorkian or something?
Hey, listen to me.
I loved that son of a bitch, but his time was up.
What was I supposed to do, leave him to those corporate fucking scumbags?
What I did was a humanitarian thing, that I have no doubt about.
And afterwards I held him in my arms and I cried like a fucking baby.
What?
What is this fucking look you're giving me now? What is that, huh?
There are the sins of the flesh.
There are the sins of the gambling halls... be it dice or in some cases,
"the devil's thumbpapers. "
Let's take off tonight.
I can't do that.
I have an obligation to Shelly. He-
Fuck Shelly.
He doesn't give a shit about you, Bernie.
Let's just climb in your car and drive the hell out of here tonight.
I can't do that, Natalie.
He'd come after me, because you're with me.
I can't have that on me.
Okay.
Winner!
Shelly! Shelly!
You have no fucking right!
Shelly, you got no fucking right!
Shelly, I tried.
I couldn't do it.
Shelly- Shelly-
I can't leave, Shell.
Shell, I love him.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
You heartless fuck.
I thought-
Bastard!
I thought he was your friend.
Who do you think you are?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You're nobody!
I could make you disappear like that and not one fucking person would miss you.
- Not one fucking person!
- Bernie would!
He loves me.
He loves me... and that kills you, doesn't it, Shell?
That kills you!
That kills you, doesn't it?
He was your only friend and you crippled him.
You crippled him and he still stood by you, but no more, Shell.
The only friends you've got now are the fucking guys on your payroll.
You don't own me anymore, Shelly, and you don't own Bernie.
We're leaving here tonight.
I am taking him and there is not a fucking thing that you can do about it!
- And you will be all alone!
- Is that right?
I love him.
Natalie?
Don't turn the light on.
I got a headache.
Did you take something?
I've got aspirin, I've got-
Yeah, I already took something.
What-?
Oh, shit.
Natalie, what- what happened to the mirror?
Natalie?
No, Bernie, don't.
Oh, shit- Bernie!
Jesus Christ.
Natalie, who did this to you?
We've got to call the police.
- I thought, "Easy money. "
- What are you talking about?
Shelly.
He paid me to get close to you, to keep you around.
Shelly...?
Yeah. Shelly.
You were right that first night.
I was for sale.
Bought and paid for.
You were the "easy mark,"
Bernie.
At first I thought that you were just another way to make a quick buck, you know?
And then I started to take a closer look.
Andforthefirsttime, you were somebody who wasn't trying to hustle me, somebody who wasn't trying to pretend he was someone he wasn't.
Just a decent guy, trying to get back on track.
And it didn't hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal.
It sure puts the gutter in perspective.
Shelly paid you?
Shelly wants me gone.
He says I bring you luck.
"Lady Luck. "
I stayed to tell you to your face... and I knew you wouldn't want me no more and I could just go.
We've got to get you to the hospital.
We'll talk about this later.
Tell me again, Bernie.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
This is our time. This is you and me and we're going for it.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
You look in the mirror, you don't like what you see, don't believe it.
Look in my eyes.
I am the only mirror you're ever gonna need.
You look into my eyes,
Natalie.
Bernie, Bernie, wait, wait.
Your chart that first night-
I wasn't being straight with you.
It is the worst chart I've ever seen.
There's nothing in the cards for you, I'm telling you.
No, don't you see?
That was before.
That was before you opened up your heart to me.
Everything's different now.
I got Lady Luck on my side.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Wait.
Here. Look,
I got $3,000 he paid me.
Maybe Shelly will take it as a down payment, and we can pay in installments, when we get settled, okay?
- I don't think $3,000-
- Come on, take it, Bernie!
...street vendors in your face. I walk up there, I'd want to shoot myself.
I suppose you'd like that freak show, huh, Harvard?
Yeah, I do.
It brings people downtown into the casino. That is good for business.
- Oof!
- Hey!
You lay another finger on her,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Are you listening to me?
I will fucking kill you.
Why, Shelly?
How could you do that to her?
Because I never let go of a good thing, Bernie, and you are a very, very good thing.
The best cooler there ever was and I need him back.
He ain't never coming back.
That is a dead man talking.
Shelly...
I'm done with this joint,
Natalie and me.
We are out of here.
I'll get a job out in the world.
I'll send you half my paycheck every month.
- I'll make good on my commitment.
- Bernie, if you bail on me, they're gonna throw your fucking ass off the roof of this building snatch the broad, and throw her right the fuck on top of you.
I don't think so,
'cause if you whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't the biggest loser in the world no more.
That honor is gonna rest upon you, Shelly.
- And maybe you had it all along.
- I'm the loser?
What do you got, other than this joint?
- What more do I need?
- You got nothing.
This place- your legacy, it's a mirage.
You turn your back, it don't even exist.
There's no night, there's no day, it's just one big fucking blur and it don't count for nothing.
You believe this fucking guy?
I feel sorry for you,
Shelly.
You're the worst kind of gambler there is, too scared to throw his chips on the table.
Too scared to extend any real kind of friendship.
Always scared he's gonna end up out in the desert.
Well, sweet fucking dreams, pal.
I'm out.
If that's where it ends, that's where it ends.
Jesus Christ, that's such a fucking touching speech, Bernie.
All that Jimmy Stewart bullshit,
I got such a lump in my throat,
I can't tell you.
But it doesn't change a thing.
If you don't make good on my 150 G's,
I'm gonna close the books on you.
You and the broad.
You leave me no choice.
Change only.
Change.
Yo, 11, pay the line.
Winner, seven.
Six easy. Easy way six.
Winner. Front line.
Hey, Shelly, take a look at number four.
Winner.
Okay, folks, we're coming out now.
Hold bets, curb checks,
C&E is 11.
Come on, man, make me some money.
Winner, seven.
What the fuck is going on here?
Where have you been?
- Not now.
- Bullshit. Shut him down right now.
- Shut him down or I will.
- Not here.
Come take a walk with me.
What is your interest in this, Shelly?
Because you know what I see?
I see your guy taking us to the fucking cleaners, and I'll tell you one thing.
He's not leaving here with a fucking dime.
Now listen to me, you little Harvard turd.
Lootz is all right, so he's walking out of here with everything he's got coming to him.
If you so much as touch one fucking hair on his fucking head,
I'm gonna fucking wallpaper this fucking bathroom with your fucking ass, do you understand me?
Muted tones, isn't that what you said?
Huh? I can't hear you.
Wait, wait a minute.
There it is.
Blended in, at a subsonic level, like some kind of mantra,
"Pain, pain, pain. "
Please...
Come on, come on.
Big roll. Big roll, buddy.
Here we go, here we go.
He must be up over 100 grand!
Gray craps, line away.
Here we go.
Okay.
Hit it again. Come on.
Come on now. Come on.
12 craps. Line away. 12 craps.
What the fuck? Not all of it!
On the field?
Is he fucking crazy?
Don't do it.
Thank you, God. Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.
It's all right, right?
You guys worked it out and he took the money? It's okay, right?
You want me to get that, Shelly?
Bernie?
Can you tell me what happened?
Yeah. Yeah.
Why- why are we stopping,
Bernie?
I think- I think-
Oh, God damn.
What the fuck happened in there?
What? What?
- What!
- Look. Look.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Natalie, I won. I won.
- Oh, my God!
- How much!? How much!?
- A lot.
Bahamas, here we come.
Step out of the car, please.
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Step out of the car, both of you.
Officer, my driving, it-
I'm sorry if we were driving a little fast, we're a bit excited.
We won a shitload of money at the Shangri-La.
You didn't win nothing.
Now both of you, turn around.
Get down on your knees.
Now.
Jesus Christ, Bern,
Jesus Christ.
The kid just wants you should know, Shelly, he's just protecting our investment...
...the old-school way.
I'll see you around, my friend.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Who were we kidding?
It's a drunk driver.
This is just- this is just freaky luck.
It was freaky accident.
Gentlemen, I want to thank you for your vote of confidence.
As the new director of casino operations,
I want to make a personal guarantee to each and every one of you that your investment in the Golden
Shangri-La will be well looked after.
The future looks very bright, gentlemen.
Very, very bright.
Wanta hotdog?
No,thanks.
Just ketchup, please.
Thanks.
Listen, I've got an errand to run.
[Chuckles]
Kind of skimpy on the ketchup.
Duncan, I've go tto do this alone.
What?
Wait,wait,wait.
You called me in Paris, and you said,
"We have to meet."
Now suddenly you've got an errand to run?
What's going on?
I don't know.
It's... nothing.
You okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.
I know you better than that, Connor.
Haven't seen you like this.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
Fine.
You can tell me all about it tonight.
8:00 at the bar.
And you're buying.
Right.
8:00, and I'm buying.
Mm-hmm.
You sure you gonna be all right, Connor? of course.
Duncan... watch your back.
[ Bell Ringing]
Connor?
Connor?
(Connor)Okay.
What is it. Connor?
Open it.
Oh. A ballerina.
Wow. She's beautiful.
Thank you.
Mmm, my angel.
[ Music Playing]
(Connor)Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.
I love you, Connor.
I love you, my Rachel.
(Connor)Oh, God.
I'm proud of you.
(Rachel)Thank you.

Hello?
[ Beep Beep]
Rachel!
Rachel.
My beloed Rachel.
How long has it been since she died?
A year?
A century? More?
My mind keeps slipping. but somethings I know.
I am Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. and once, a very long time ago,
I was a Highlander.
Born of this land. and like this land, immortal.
[ Dogs Barking]
(Man)Witch.
You brought this plague on us.
You damned us all.
Connor MacLeod.
You sold your soul!
(Man)You're a witch.
You child of Satan.
They drove you from your home, cut you off from your own people.
What else do they want?
Someone to blame.
Your mother will burn!
Connor.
Your mother will burn!
Rot in hell!
Get in the house.
Get off my land.
Leave us in peace.
Get off my land.
Connor, please.
You're not going back to Glenfinnan.
I have no choice.
Connor, please.
They can't hurt me, and they know it, but they can still hurt the ones I love.
I'm afraid.
I love you, Heather.
More than anything in this world.
Do you belive me?
Yes.
Then don't be afraid.
Nothing can keep me from you.
[ Horse Whinnies]
Nothing.
[ Horse Neighs]
Connor.
I thought you might be the water horse... come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch.
No one comes to take care of you?
(Mother)Not in years.
They think I bed evil their children... because my own was banished.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Tiny mites... and soured dispositions.
I've no need of them, Connor, any of them.
Then it's settled.
You're coming with me.
[Wind Blows]
Aah!
Connor!
Connor,what is it?
I'm not sure.
It happened once before.
Aah!
Aah! Connor!
(Priest)In the name of the Holy See... and the rule of law. you are hereby charged.
Connor MacLeod, with heresy... and the practice of black magic.
We were friends, remember,Jacob?
I stood at your ordination.
I vouched for you.
You shouldn't have come back, Connor.
(Priest)Take him.
Aah!
(Priest Speaking,
Indistinctly)
(Priest)The ties of blood... cannot be seered by word or deed.
[Gasps]
(Connor)Mother.
(Jacob)Due to the infinite compassion... you are entitled to one final opportunity... to renounce all that is unholy, and declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins.
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?
If your God... should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.
[Gasps]
[Crowd Muttering]
(Woman)Burn her.
No! No! No!
(Jacob)He is your son.
I am silent for you.
(Man)Black powder.
It will ease your suffering.
(Connor)Mother.
No!
No!
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
[Grunts]
You're next,you demon.
Aah!
[Growling]
Aah!
My water horse.
Unh!
The Deil's come back to life.
Let her be, Connor.
Aah!
Father?
(Jacob)Father?
Please.
Do not leave me.
Father.
Aah!
[Jacob Grunts]
Connor--
(Connor)My endless days... are filled with memories of the past... and the death of my mother by Jacob Kell.
[ Engine Revs]
(Man)Boy,you people are extremely difficult to find.
We like it that way.
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.
Unh!
Uhh!
Aah!
[ Engine Revs]
[Gun Cocks]
[ Fires Gun ]
Aah.
Take their heads.
They might be Immortals.
Yes,they might be.
Aah!
Don't be long.
[Coughs]
The Sanctuary.
So it's true.
What sacrifices they have made of you, ware housed like rotting pieces of meat.
Tell me, is this...the better way?
(Kell)I'm sure you'e had time to reflect upon it.
What you need to understand... is that I don't care about the game.
I don't care about the rules.
I don't even care about these pathetic souls... you keep locked away as a barrier to the prize.
Which one is
Connor MacLeod?
[Whistling]
[Grunts]
[Strained Breathing]
Well,what do we do now?
What we always do.
We're Watchers, not cops.
We'll find another volunteer.

(Woman)What you fear about Connor MacLeod, fear the worst.
Who is this?
A friend.
Don't bother looking for me. Duncan.
[ Dial Tone]
He's on the move.
Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.
Hello, Methos.
What brings you to my humble abode?
Need your help.
Why me?
You're been around for 5.000 years.
I want the benefit of your experience.
And I thought it was a social call.
You ever had nightmares?
What kind of nightmares?
Bloody images... powerful enough to even break your meditation.
We live violent lives, MacLeod.
Some of that's bound to stay with us.
These ones came
10 years to the day... that Connor MacLeod disappeared.
Connor had good reason to go.
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.
The day Rachel was killed?
Something wasn't right.
Connor,you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.
I know you better than that, Connor.
I've never seen you like this.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
I need to know if he's still alive, Methos.
You know a little about Buddhist monks.
Some of them come to cherish life so much... that to step on an insect or harm a blade of grass... becomes a violation of their creed, so they place themselves under an extreme form... of protective custody--
A Sanctuary of sorts.
Well, for an Immortal... who comes to abhor the bloodshed, there's a similar solution--
Away to be removed from the game forever.
(Methos)The price is unimaginably high. but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within you.
And it's called The Sanctuary.
Connor would never do that.
(Methos)Are you sure?
It's been around since before you were born.
At least until last night.
What happened last night?
It was annihilated.
Hey. Duncan, what's the matter?
(Duncan)The British... destroyed the clans, Connor.
Scotland's finished.
Scotland will always be Scotland. and someday you'll go back.
You can beton it.
How much?
Aw, come on.
Does everything have to be a wager with you?
Well,you're the one that keep stelling me... our lives are nothing but a boundless game.
[Chuckles]
[ Duncan ]
Good morning, gentlemen.
What seems to be the problem here?
[ Man ]
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.
Really? How dare they.
These men are rogues.
(Faith)The semenare liar sands coundrels, sir.
They've done nothing but prey upon us 3 years running, right at this very spot.
And by whose authority do you act?
By Deed of the King.
There is a little  X down here.
Does the King always sign his name with an X?
Excuse me. Sorry. Ha ha.
I think these gentlemen should be paid.
That deed is a fake.
That's a matter of opinion.
You, sir, are no better than they.
That is also a matter of opinion.
Here you go.
Ladies.
It's gold!
Why not--
It's gold.
Firstman.Ha ha.
Hey,wait a minute.
They took my money! oh, it's here.
They took my money!
Let's go get 'em.
Shall we?
[Yelling]
Aye.
(Man)Aah.
-ooh.
-ooh.
Heh heh.
Not bad.
Uh-oh.
Mmm.
All right boys,time to go.
Let's go!
Come on.
Ohh. Cuckoo.
Oh, looks heavy, huh?
(Duncan)Looks like you lost your edge, lad.
(Connor)Really heavy. or could he be lass?
Could be.
Could be.
[Groaning]
Hyah!
(Drier)Come on.
Hyah.Hyah.
Hyah!
Corporal Duncan MacLeod, sir.
I'e come to pick up the wounded.
[ Indistinct Chatter]
You've improved greatly.
Ah,you really think so?
No.
I'm Just being gracious.
Hmm.
Now, remember.
You are only immortal... as long as you can keep your head... on your shoulders.
[ Duncan ] Gahh.
Duncan,what you give up to your adversary... in defeat... is everything.
I know.
And at that point,
I'm very,very dead.
Come on!
Heh heh heh.
Not Just dead, Duncan--
Empty!
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening. our strength and knowledge, our life essence, flows into the victor,feeds him, and makes him stronger,yes?
It's what drives the other Immortals... to kill us, and what forces us... to be smarter, better than the rest.
[Groans]
I understand.
Ooh.
You do?
Ohh.
(Connor)Good.
[Groans]
I slipped.
Listen, soon you and I will have to part.
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.
[Grunts]
Va ia. Va ia.
Ho ho ho. oh, aye! oh, aye.This is much more to my liking.
Good.
Bah! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh.
Attack me.
But you've got your back to me.
It's not always about strength, Duncan.
Attack me!
Aah!
It's about manipulation of the mind... as well as the body.
Aye, but now I'm in control.
Heh heh heh,Are you?
[Grunts]
Remember well, my friend.
Properly executed, this move is unstoppable.
Properly executed, we'll have this talk again.
[Wind Blows]
Who are you?
A friend... or a lover. or a wife.
Kate?
Attaboy.
Except I'm Faith now.
Part of the make over.
Whatare you doing here?
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?
I do.
[Sighs]
The way we danced.
[Scottish Music Playing]
I felt like we were flying. of course, we did come down... didn't we?
Crashing.
(Motorcyle Engines
Rewing) oh, shit.
(Man)It's time to show our Immortal brother... a thing or two.
Somebody order a club sandwich?
He's funny.
Nice outfit,too.
Faith, I told you I look like a fuckin' orange!
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.
Who are they?
Friends.
What, it's a team sport now?
What,you didn't know?
It's a whole new ball game.
Aah!
Hey!
Nice bat.
Aargh!
Told you I was gonna cut you.
[Growls]
Aaah!
Let my man Jin Ke deal with him.
Jin Ke... who served with the Emperor Chin.
The same man.
Some people say you're a man of honor.
What do you know about honor? oh, great.
Yaah!
Honor's not in a weapon.
It's in the man.
(Kell)Enough.
Boys, boys.
(Kell)I do apologize.
When it comes to discipline. the first hundred years are the hardest.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Guess I'm not much of a swords guy.
I thought I told you to stop.
(Carlos)Yeah, well.
I stopped.
Tell me, Carlos.
How much is your life worth?
Don't start this bullshit, man.
(Kell)'Cause the only way to win your freedom... is to kill me.
You're crazy.
Am I?
Then go ahead.
Stop the madness.
[Tires Squealing]
Can you live with the fear?
Can you live with the weakness?
[Saw Buzzes]
Weakness, Carlos.
I call this... decap with a twist--
No sugar.
[Gasping]
Watchers?
Huh?
Watchers observe Immortals.
They're no tsupposed to interfere.
Unfortunately, our role has changed somewhat.
Why?
Because the rules has been broken. one of your kind has gone renegade.
In doing so, he's gained himself a sizable advantage.
One that'll be impossible to overcome.
Nobody's unbeatable.
Oh,yes, Duncan. He is.
Unbeatable.
No.
[Grunting]
Ahh.
[Grunts]
Sorry about that.
There must always be two of your kind.
As long as there are two, and you're kept from fighting, then the prize is safe.
The Sanctuary must not fail again.
You're insane.
Get yourself another volunteer.
We had a number of volunteers!
Sadly,that's no longer the case.
You'll beware housed, hidden away.
Go to hell.
Don't worry.
[ Distorted ]
The drugs'll kick in momentarily.
[Woman Screaming]
[Gasps]
[ Horse Neighing]
[Swords Clanging]
[Gasps]
(Connor)Get up.
Get up.
You have better things to do than lie there on your ass.
Who are you?
Someone who knows more about you... than you know about yourself.
Are you a demon?
Heh, hehheh.
I've been called that... and worse.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.
Connor MacLeod?
And like you, my friend,
I have a hard time dying.
Dawson?
Heh,you look like shit.
Thanks.
How long have I--
We'll talk about it later.
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, can you walk?
Yeah.
Uhh.
(Duncan)Go. Go.
What are you doing here?
Keeping tabs on you.
(Duncan)Yeah?
Well... someone should keep tabs... on that psychotic asshole back there.
Didn't you get it back in London?
These guys don't play by the rules.
You don't know what you're up against, Mac.
So people keep telling me.
Stop the car.
I managed to liberate that from their lost and found.
There's blood on it.
I didn't say it was easy.
Pull over.
(Methos)What?
Pull over.
MacLeod, tell me something.
Mac, hear him out!
Mac!Will you tell me something?
Now, how many Quickenings have you had?
How many heads have you taken?
I don't keep score.
Well,we do.
MacLeod, Connor.
What's that?
The Watchers' version of a resume.
(Dawson)It's a bit like handicap ping horses. I know. but it's part of the gig, all right?
174 confirmed Immortal kills.
Sound about right?
So,what's your point?
[Sighs] Here's the gentleman you met in Connor's loft.
661 confirmed Immortal kills.
Welcome to your worst nightmare.
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.
This guy is way out of your league.
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.
Why?
[ Duncan ] Something doesn't make sense.
What are you saying?
I think he's saying he wants to see the body.
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.
They're all missing their heads!
 [ Harmonica ]
We gave 'em a Christian burial, MacLeod.
It was decent,you know.
Said all the right words.
Can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is.
(Dawson)With all these unexplained corpses.
Well, we had to take it off the beaten track.
End of the road,Joe.
Thanks.
You watch your ass, MacLeod.
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.
Did I happen to mention about all this... coming to a bad end?
No, Methos.
I don't believe you did.
You were gonna stay and dig.
Dig? Oh,yeah!
(Duncan)I need to know if he's still alive, Professor.
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.
(Methos)One of your kind has gone renegade.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
[Wind Blows]
[Connor Speaking
Native Language]
No.
What are you doing here?
You walked out on your life, Connor.
Why?
I had my reasons.
Reasons?
Every life I touch ends... brutally... and for no reason.
It's a curse... that's followed me for centuries.
[ Laughs]
I can't outrun it, and I can't outlive it.
Rachel's death made you the last soul on this planet... that means a damn to me.
I thought there was a way out.
The Sanctuary?
Yes.
The Sanctuary.
So, how did you escape?
I didn't escape.
I was let go.
I couldn't see the slaughter, only heard it... and felt it.
[Wind Blows]
[ People Yell ]
Jacob Kell.
So, here we are--
Both immortal.
Missed the signs, didn't we?
But we were both so new at the game.
[Thunder]
[ Duncan ]
Connor.
What a glorious sight.
Just look, Connor.
Look back at the endless travesties of your life, and you'll see me, always there waiting in the shadows.
When friends and loers... are wiped from your sight-
I'm there.
When those you cherish... die abruptly and for no reason-
I'm there for you.
And when your cellmates... in their so-called Sanctuary... are left twitching like headless chickens-
Guess who?
(Duncan)Connor.
Stay out of it, Duncan.
Would you kill an unarmed man... again, Connor?
(Kell)Oh.
You didn't know, Duncan?
Because you didn't tell him.
Would that finally put the agony... in your soul to rest?
Then go ahead.
Send me home.
What's stopping you?
Honor?
Guilt?
The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die?
Or somewhere along the way... did you Just lose your nerve?
It's holyground, Connor.
Ooh.
Yes.
Take your shot.
What better chance than now?
Do it.
Do it for your sweet mother.
Aah! or the sweet little war orphan...
Rachel Ellenstein... who, if I'm not mistaken, you raised as your own daughter.
Tell me, do they even begin... to equal for the murder of a man of God... who raised me as his own son?
Aah!
Slow... close--
Feels good, doesn't it?
But look at you.
Even now,you're afraid--
Afraid you'll lose.
That's your true fear, isn't it?
The thought of giving up your essence to me, making me even stronger by it.
What's wrong?
Don't you want to be inside me?
I want you to think back to this moment, Connor!
In the endless nights ahead!
(Connor)Aah.
And know...
Aah! every time you close your eyes... from now to eternity,
I'll bet here!
Ripping apart the ones you care about most!
Aah!
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.
Living is what matters.
And you will live with this.
Count on it. one far-off day, you and I will be the only two remaining.
You will look back on this... and know you had one chance to stop me.
You failed.
But until thatday,
I will take my vengeance... on those you love.
Your ling... has been my prize.
For old times' sake.
(Jacob)He is your son.
You, on the other hand... are on borrowed time.
Call you.
Is what he said true?
Is it?
Believe only what your heart... and conscience tell you.
Connor... with time, anything can be forgiven.
You taught me that.
Did I?
[Clapping, Laughing,
Music Playing]
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!
(Kate)Behave yourself, Duncan.
(Man)No more talking.
May all your hardships fade away.
Till night becomes morn. let loe remain to guide your way.
Till the day we are reborn.
Till the day we are reborn.
Kiss her,won't you?
[CheeringAnd Clapping]
(Duncan)Connor?
I thought you'd never get here.
Connor!
(Connor)You know
Kate is like us, immortal.
Aye, I sensed something the day we met. but I wasn't sure.
Well, now you know.
And you know as well as I do... that her Immortality can only be triggered... by the shock of a violent death.
Yes, I do.
And without such a death, she will simply grow old and die.
Yes, I know, Connor.
Is that what you came to tell me on my wedding day?
Come on.
Drink up, man.
[Sets Down Mug]
No.
I was wondering.
Does she know?
Why?
Many years after I was married, one night...
I found Heather in front of the house.
She had a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other.
When I asked her... why she had done such a thing to herself. she said it was the one part of her... that would never age.
It would forever remain the same... as when I first fell in love with her.
That's how she wanted me to remember her.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I once loved a woman... more than life itself-- and I watched her die.
Unlike me,you have a choice.
What would you have me tell her?
I'd tell her nothing.
She wouldn't believe you anyway.
Then I can do nothing.
She's in the flower of her youth.
Enjoy the moment, and let it pass.
And if it were you in my place?
I was in your place!
But I thank God
I never had the choice.
I love Kate, and I will hold on to her as long as I can.
And that is all I can do!
[ Duncan ]
Forever, my love.
Until the day we are reborn.
Until the day we are reborn.
[Wind Blows]
You haven't lost your touch.
What do you want?
To talk.
Oh,that's a first.
I've tried to talk to you a thousand times--
Get to the point.
I was wrong.
(Faith)Oh. no. no.
Stealing's wrong.
Lying's wrong.
Killing's wrong.
What you did goes well beyond wrong.
Fine.
I deserve that, but I want a chance to make it right.
You want to make it right?
Then give me back the ability... to have children, to grow old with the man I love.
How about anything that resembles a normal life?
And you took it all away from me.
Those things I can't give you.
Oh, something else you forgot to tell me.
Good-bye, Duncan.
Kell can't give you those things, either, so tell me, Kate,why him?
Because I've never known anybody... with such a capacity for hate--
Except me.
That's what's kept you going all these years?
Hmm?
Fine.
Go home, Faith.
Take care of what's important.
You were with him.
A woman is a temple... built on a sewer.
Remember what you were when I first found you.
A whore.
Now, look at you.
A liberated whore.
Fuck you.
Oh,we'll get to that, blossom.
But in the interim, be grateful...
I don't take your pretty little face off.
Hurts, doesn't it... that there is something you actually can't have?
Hmm. I can hae... anything I want.
Except me.
[Sighs]
I've already had you.
[Softly]
Not really.
Close enough.
Forever.
May love remain to guide our way... till the day we are reborn.
Forgive me.
- Uhh!
- [Screams]
I'm sorry.
You had no right.
-(Wind Blows)
- Uhh!
[Thunder]
(Duncan)Kate?
No. Don't be frightened.
You're immortal.
We both are.
Aah!
(Faith)Uhh.
I did it for you--
For us.
- Uhh!
-(Duncan)Kate.
Kate? oh, no!
(Duncan)Oh. no.
Oh. my God.
What have I done?
Kate!
You wanted this.
You forced it on me.
I never asked for eternity.
[Crying]
I never wanted us to be apart.
Would you have really understood?
Which part?
The endless, numbing sameness of it all?
Or never bothering to love someone... because whole lifetimes tick by so fast... they don't even count anymore?
Then why did you come?
To see if I could feel again--
Anything.
[ Elevator Bell Dings]
You're missing the point, Kate.
The difference between Connor and I... is that as long as you're still alive, there's a chance that one day...
I might be forgiven.
It may take years--
Centuries, even.
But at least I can carry that hope inside me.
That's one blessing of immortality--
There's always tomorrow.
Even for us.
What are you doing,Jin?
Just thinking.
Men, for the most part. can mend their ways... only after they have made a mistake.
(Jin)One day soon. we will all... serv every little purpose to Kell, except dead.
(Kell)A toast.
I see tonight... as a celebration of the spirit.
To all of you... who continue to stand by me-- even those who might waver... at times-
You are my flock.
You... nourish my soul.
You are all a part... of a great Journey-- a 400-year quest-- for Justice.
And here, my friends. is the instrument of that Justice--
The giver... and taker of creation... baptized in blood.
It is the living... that matters... after all.
It sings like an angel.
Just listen.
(Jin)Uhh.
(Man)Uhh.
(Carlos)Uhh.
[Gasps]
Till the day we are reborn.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Aah!
Uhh!
[Wind Blows]
[ Distant Siren ]
Kell.
Jacob Kell.
Connor?
[Sighs]
We've lived many lives, you and I.
We've seen things... that most people could never understand.
But now what do you see?
I see someone who would never kill an unarmed man.
I also see someone who has lost hope.
Life brings hope and pain... but revenge never brings redemption.
The path and choice are ours.
Connor,what the hell's going on?
I have chosen mine.
Aah!
What are you doing?
Kell's too strong, and he's getting stronger.
Neither one of us can beat him alone.
Are you out of your mind?
Aah! If we let him win, it could mean the end.
Connor, no!
Kell is going to kill you, Duncan, just to torment me, and there is nothing you can do about it--
Nothing.
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.
Alone, neither one of us can beat him.
Together,we can.
You know the rules. only one Immortal can challenge another.
And only one will.
This isn't the answer.
Listen to me.
In the end, there can be only one, and that hasto be you.
No.
We can beat him together.
Then we are in agreement.
Enough, Connor!
I won't fight you.
I will never fight you, Connor.
Then you die!
Uhh.
No!You're not doing this, Connor.
Oh,yes,we're doing this.
Every day, every breath we took was for this end.
Look inside and tell me I'm wrong.
Aah!
Aah!Aah!
Do it!
I can't.
Remember how you first found me?
Sitting in that bloody bog, scared out of my mind?
You taught me how to live, Connor.
You taught me why we live.
Have you forgotten all of that?
No. our bonds... are all that hold us in this world.
Don't break this one.
Please, Connor.
I'm begging you.
It's too late.
This has to be done.
Haah!
No, Connor!
Not like this!
Come on, stop!
Connor, stop!
Duncan! one of us has to die now, old friend.
No.
And you know it.
No.
Good-bye, Duncan, my true brother.
I love you, Connor.
Aah!
No!
(Connor)Aah.
[ No Audible Dialogue]
[Thunder]
[Screaming]
[Thunder]
Duncan.
Well done.
I ever thought you had him in you.
What does it feel like to kill a brother?
Feels good, doesn't it?
You'll never know,will you?
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.
Are you going to run?
Are you going to hide?
Run?
Uhh!
Aah!
Brother, come on.
Aah!
[Grunts]
Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
How bad do you want it, Duncan?
You'll pay!
Ahh! ohh!
Duncan!
[Grunts]
Okay, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.
[Camera Winding]
Just watch.
Merry Christmas.
A valiant effort, Duncan.
Too bad.
And this is just the beginning.
You see,when you absorbed Connor's spirit, you inherited his curse.
Revenge... is so sweet.
I wonder who we'll start with?
Oh, Kate.
[Thunder]
[Whispering]
Forever.
Oh, God.
Kell!
Jacob Kell!
Revenge... will never bring you redemption, so I'm going to do it for you.
Aah.
Is that all you've got?
(Kell)Dunc.
I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner... an hour ago, but this is very impressive.
Come on.
Come on.What are you waiting for?
I'd be delighted.
Yaah!
Impressive... isn't it?
Uhh!
Duncan!
[ Drops Sword ]
You see at last your fate!
Yes!
Because this game is done!
Uhh!
Well, look on the bright side.
At least you went down swinging.
[Connor's Voice]
Jacob Kell.
Time for redemption.
The game isn't over yet.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to be inside me?
In the end-
[ Duncan's Voice]
...there can be only one.
[Connor's Voice]
And you're not it.
Uhh!
Call ya.
No!
[Screaming]
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Wind Blows]
Hope you found peace, my friend.
Oh, Bonnie Portmore
I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction
Of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore
For many's the long day
 Till the long boats from Antrim
Came to float it away
[Wind Blowing]
So,why are you here?
You hoping you'd find me?
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.
So, um, what now?
Trust.
You can always trust me, Faith.
Faith is dead.
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.
Not yet.
Till the day we are reborn.
You hold onto it for me.
We've got plenty of time.

- Come on.
- Central Security Agency.
This is Wallace.
Operation Big Drip is cresting Level Two.
I need Devlin.
I need him now.
Hold, please.
No, no, don't put me on hold!
Mother...
Hello, Agent Wallace.
I need your nine-digit security code, please.
Hello? Agent Wallace?
Agent Wallace?
Agua la vista... baby.
Hello, my name's Jimmy Tong and I was wondering if there's anything I could say that would convince you to have lunch with me.
Oh, Jimmy, you're so cute.
Let's go back to your apartment and make like... donkey.
You got me nervous again.
It's just a salesgirl.
To you. But to me...
I dream of her... before I ever saw her.
No, that there! That!
Shh.
That is the line.
Go tell her that. That line.
Listen.
Hi.
My name is Jimmy Tong.
When I see you,
I have a wet dream.
Is that what I say?
No, no, you know... just ask her out to lunch now and, later, we work out that line.
But hurry up, man.
We be wasting time, man.
Come on.
We have to drive.
And whatever you do, do not be yourself.
Just joking.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome. Goodbye.
I can do it.
Hi. My name's Jimmy Tong.
Okay...
Hi.
Hi.
Pretty colors.
Will you excuse me for just one moment?
Okay.
Ah...
Just between us guys... you don't come around here for the art, do you?
Who would?
Heh. Yeah.
Uh... let me, as owner of this gallery, give you a little bit of friendly advice.
Don't waste any time.
You go over there and you ask Jennifer out.
You think so?
Yes. That way, she can say no and we can get on with our little lives.
- Thank you for your advice.
- Yeah.
Hello. My name Jimmy Tong.
What can I say to convince you to have lunch with me?
Oh!
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?
I'm terr... I didn't...
Come here, you little runt.
Hi. Hello.
Get back here! Come here!
Where'd you go?
Where are you?
Sauer... sauerkraut or sauercrop?
Sauerkraut?
Hey... hey, hey!
Hey! I just washed that car.
What the hell wrong with you, boy?
Want I jam this in your ass and break it?
You want a go?
Come down here.
Whoa, wait, wait, oh.
Not too fast, not too fast.
Hey, I just want to talk.
Eh, eh, you do that there, man. You do that.
Oh, you're scared now.
Yes, yes.
Go on and get yourself some training wheels!
Go get a tattoo of a chicken!
- Go!
- I thought all your people know karate.
Not everybody Chinese is Bruce Lee.
Just calm yourself, eh,
Jimmy, calm yourself.
Just not my day.
Whoo! Wow.
Do you think you can get me to 70 Fleming Street?
Of course.
Wait-wait a second.
- You Jimmy Tong?
- That's who I am.
- Who are you?
- The name is Steena.
- So, how come you drive so fast?
- More fares.
Mmm. Is that why you had your license suspended nine times for speeding?
But no accidents.
- Do you remember where I'm going?
- 70 Fleming.
Get me there before
I finish putting on my makeup
- and I'll, uh, double the meter.
- You serious?
Do I look like
I have a sense of humor?
Okay.
Hurry, open the gate!
Hey, Jimmy... ho, ho, ho, ho!
You drive too fast!
Yeah, I got mascara and eyeliner left.
You got five blocks.
Don't tell me you're slowing down.
You know, you drive like an old woman.
Hmm.
You're not scared, are you?
Hey, you!
What do you think you're doin'?
Back off, buddy.
She's mine.
Oh, it's you, miss.
Well, you lived up to your reputation.
The job is yours.
I have a job. A good one.
Oh, yeah? How much do you make at this "good job"?
475 a week, plus tips.
So, how would you like to make
2,000 a week plus room and board?
- When do I show up?
- Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
You'll be driving
Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.
Good day, miss.
Now, you!
Outta here!
Good morning, Mr. Tong.
Huh.
You put your face on without me, huh?
Please, have a seat.
Those are the house rules.
Memorize them.
Especially number one.
"Never talk directly to Mr. Devlin."
If you've any questions, you'll find all the answers in there.
And, if I were you, I'd get rid of the mildew on the chin.
My soul patch?
Yeah.
You like working for this Devlin guy?
I don't work for him.
I'm not a professional driver, but I'd always believed that thing you're staring into is designed for the monitoring of traffic, not passengers.
Am I wrong?
While I'm really enjoying our time together, shall we try moving?
Wallace has been my partner for years.
Something's happened to him.
He wouldn't just disappear.
Now, you get your job done and find my partner.
So tell me how.
You're the head of an intelligence agency.
Why don't you be intelligent?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Well, why don't you call me back when you do understand what I'm talking about.
Did we just take the Balsam Road exit?
Of course.
You have to take the surface street.
Sorry.
Did you get a copy of the rules?
Did you read them?
Jimmy, let me tell you something, my friend.
I hate the rules.
Take Grant Boulevard all the way.
The lights are timed.
Thank you.
And, Jimmy...
- crank the music up.
- Yes, sir.
Deputy Director Chalmers, ladies, gentlemen,
I present to you special agent Wallace.
Deceased two days, 14 hours, five minutes... approximately.
Pretty interesting.
Now, why don't you, uh, tell me a little about him?
Well, in simplest terms, he drowned in his bathtub.
Contusion here suggests he hit his head, fell prone, unconscious.
The man infiltrated a Serbian death squad with not even a scratch.
- He goes down in a bathtub?
- Life's a bitch.
You wanna put him back in the fridge?
He didn't drown, sir.
He was murdered.
Does that make life a little less bitchy?
- And-and you would be...?
- That's Del Blaine, sir.
She's having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week.
So, you-you don't think he drowned?
Well, sir, there was water in his lungs but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets, indicative of dehydration.
- He died of thirst.
- Thirst.
And it wasn't just city tap water.
The mineral profile fit a high-end bottled water but what was really weird is that it contained a strain of bacteria that I, so far, haven't been able to culture.
Anyway, uh... didn't mean to interrupt.
Ooh, the woman seems to know a lot about water.
Yeah. She thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things.
You know, we have a special situation in the field.
I think we could use your talents.
You interested?
When do I start?
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?
Rumors and innuendo.
Del, I could tell you a thing or two about Clark Devlin.
Uh, you think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second?
Meet me upstairs in an hour.
You might just become
Clark Devlin's next partner.
I'm gonna need that
Gerris marginalis as soon as possible.
Yes. Uh, my contacts in Guatemala have what you're looking for,
I'm sure.
Good.
And, meanwhile...
I'll take one of these beautiful Uticella marginalis.
Just gorgeous.
- Now, you're going to call me?
- Is your phone number on file?
I'm having a bit of trouble with the phones at the moment.
It might be better if you dropped it off yourself.
It may take a while.
Well, why don't you familiarize yourself with the route?
Uh, there's a little gathering at my house tonight, a fund-raiser for the Natural History Museum.
I would so love to have you.
- Should I send a car?
- I drive myself.
Admirable.
Eight o'clock.
And, uh, be sure not to wear anything too distracting, or no one will get their checkbooks out.
How did you learn to be so smooth?
I've seen the way you drive.
You have the same instincts I do.
You lack confidence.
The girl in the art gallery's not beyond you, you know.
You know about her?
Every time we leave the house we go by the art gallery and slow down.
You just need a little polish.
I'll never be a Clark Devlin.
Don't tell anyone this, Jimmy, but... there's a lot less to Clark Devlin than meets the eye.
Got a couple of good lines and a couple of very expensive suits.
Apart from that, we're exactly the same.
How about a couple hundred million?
Trust me...
90% of it is clothes.
The other ten percent?
The other ten percent's in there.
You've got plenty of it.
Oh, Mr. Devlin, can I ask you a big favor?
Yeah?
Can I stop wearing my hat?
- All right.
- Thank you.
No, just stay smooth.
Remember... smooth.
Thank you.
Steena, Devlin.
This driver, this... Jimmy,
I like him.
Let's get him a proper suit.
Something sexy.
You pick it out.
All right.
Always a delight talking to you, too, darling.
- Home, James.
- Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.
- Oh!
- Oops!
- Watch your step.
- Thank you, sir.
Oh...
This definitely not a rental.
Hello.
My name's Clark Devlin.
Would you like to dance?
Would you like to dance?
Admirable.
There is just one rule.
Never... touch my tuxedo.
I didn't.
Good. Don't.
Yes, sir.
Jimmy.
Get the car.
Let's go for dinner.
Yes, sir.
What'll you have?
It's my treat.
Anything.
All right.
Two Whoppers, hold the onion, extra ketchup.
Toast the bottom bun only, medium well-done.
Two large fries, extra well-done.
Two chocolate milkshakes, however the chef likes.
That's it.
Your order's ready.
Pull forward.
- That's pretty quick.
- It's fast food. Anything else?
Yeah. I'll have a personal pizza, crispy crust.
He doesn't eat out much.
They don't serve pizza at Burger...
New item, huh?
Do you have chicken chow mein?
Thank you.
- Jimmy?
- Yes?
It's a drive-through.
Let's drive.
Watch out!
Watch it, man!
Sorry, pal.
Let's go.
Why are we running away from a skateboard?
I think it's probably a bomb.
Ha-ha. I thought you said a bomb.
What do you mean, a bomb?
No good. Out!
- Mr. Dev...
- Move!
- Jimmy, you okay?
- I'm fine.
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah.
Yeah. All in a day's work, eh?
Look.
Oh, damn.
- Mr. Devlin.
- Have you got any aspirin?
- Who did this to you?
- Water stri...
Walter Strider. He's the one?
Wat... er... stri...
Walter... Walter Strider.
- No, no... police.
- Okay. Uh...
I-I need an ambulance right now.
His name is...
Trust... nobody.
Uh... his name is...
Brad Dillford.
- Wear it.
- Wear...
Boss! Boss!
Hold on, boss. You'll be fine.
Give me the clipboard.
I'll take care of you.
Wa... stri...
- Huh?
- Sir!
Oh!
- Please wait in the waiting room.
- Okay.
- I will find Walter Strider.
- Hey! Hey!
I'm sorry.
I promise.
Wh-what do you want my mother's maiden name for?
Last time she was in here, I was born.
I'm sure my dad had something to do with that, at least I hope so.
Dr. Angela.
Where is dr. Angelo?
Dr. Angelo.
Are you dr. Angela?
Dr. Angela.
Dr. Ang... ela.
Hey!
There's no smoking in a hospital.
I was nervous. How is he?
He might be here a while.
You might wanna get 'im some things from home in case he... comes to.
Oh. He had this clutched in his hand.
I don't know if it means anything.
Orderly with wheels to the front desk.
I do need dr. Angelo.
Dr. Angelo.
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
I'll tell you,
I'm pretty excited.
I mean nervous, but I'm... I'm excited.
I'm pumped, you know.
I-I knew I was doing good work for Banning International, but I didn't know, uh,
Mr. Banning would be taking so much notice of me so soon.
I'll say this, though, when I'm CEO of this place,
I won't be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat, you know what I mean?
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?
He questioned my growth projections.
No, that's not it.
I don't like his hair.
Mr. Banning.
So, word filtered down to me that you don't share my optimism about our company's future.
- Oh, no. Actually, I just...
- Drink?
Oh, yes, thank you.
I just felt that, to meet your projections, pretty much every person on Earth would have to drink only Banning Springs water.
Yes, indeed.
Water, Mr. Lundeen, comprises 60% of your body.
Don't you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to... create something so beautiful, so useful, so essential?
I find water to be... miraculous.
- Do you think I'm silly?
- Not at all.
- Feeling... thirsty?
- Yes.
You're helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product.
Oh, I see.
What a brilliant idea.
Water that makes you thirsty.
What's in it? Salt?
There's no... profundity in salt.
Bacteria.
Once ingested, its DNA will instruct your cells' cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream, causing dehydration.
It's virulent.
Unfortunately, it's too fast.
Way too fast.
As we speak, your internal organs are shriveling.
You're becoming as dry as...
Well, as dry as your limited imagination.
Gentlemen, fetch the vacuum, won't you? Thank you.
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf,
Sondheim, Springsteen...
No Strider.
Wow.
Welcome to the Tactical Uniform
Experiment.
Tuxedo recognizing new user.
Mapping user's neurological structure.
Activate wristwatch for desired function.
Demo...
Okay, show me.
Uh-oh.
Caution. Demolition mode.
The tuxedo will consider
any object a target and act to destroy it.
Oh, what's happening?
Exit the demolition mode immediately.
Mr. Devlin, is everything all right?
This is Jimmy.
I think Mr. Devlin wants you to clean his room tomorrow.
It's a little bit messy.
I think he threw the party.
Should I send someone up now?
No. Maybe after he leaves.
Very good.
Hmm?
Hello?
Are we on?
Are we on what?
I take my work seriously,
Mr. Devlin, so please stop using that ridiculous accent.
What? What accent?
All right.
You're the senior officer.
I'll play it however you want.
Deitrich Banning is holding a meeting with water CEOs.
The Agency wants us to find out what he's planning.
Wh-what about Walter Strider?
Who is he?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay.
So, we will meet tomorrow.
V-15, 10 o'clock.
I'll be wearing a gray suit.
Your code is "nice rack".
I'll respond "I forgot my bra".
That passes for humor around here.
10 o'clock, V-15.
- What's the cross street?
- Very funny.
- May I join you?
- Uh, yeah.
Nice rack.
Hello.
Mr. Devlin, there's been a change of plans.
But I'm here already.
Where are you?
Don't get all pissy about it.
They just told me, so I'm telling you.
We'll meet tonight
8 o'clock, Pier 17, base of the silo and... forget the password.
Oh, now you tell me.
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.
- I-I gotta go.
- Guy in the raincoat.
- I see you tonight. Sorry.
- Get him!
Stop! Stop!
Get back here, you creep!
So, we've got five minutes to get into position.
I secured the rooftop.
The equipment's good to go and... I just have to say it is such an honor to be working with the legendary...
Clark... Devlin?
I... I'm Del Blaine.
- Have we met before?
- No.
Good.
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do what we've come here to do.
I'll follow you.
Ladies first.
Okay.
A couple of details changed from what was in the file.
- You read it?
- The files are crap.
Uh, give me the short version.
Deitrich Banning's holding a meeting of international water company CEOs.
We think he's trying to force them into selling their companies to him.
- Where are you going?
- Huh? I'm thinking.
We had agent Wallace working undercover at his bottled water factory.
That is, until last week.
Wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us that the operation had reached critical mass and, suddenly, wham! Dead.
As you requested, a Klineholtz bolt-action nine-millimeter titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope and counterweighted micro-rifled barrel.
My favorite gun.
But I don't kill people anymore.
Killing?
You're planting a bug.
I-it was all in that "crap" file.
Go look through your binoculars.
They're arriving.
Ready?
It's critical we get a listening device in Banning's meeting.
Range: 962 feet.
A-aim for the briefcase.
Should be a piece of cake for you, sir.
You kind of missed.
In the year 2001,
35 billion dollars worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide.
Today, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline.
We, my friends, are the new oil barons.
We at Banning Springs
have developed a new filtration process
that would protect your assets
against the biological holocaust that's coming.
- Looks like we got company.
- CSA would be my bet.
You've heard what I have to say.
Now I'd like to hear you.
How much is this plan gonna cost us?
It won't cost you a penny, out of pocket.
All I ask is to become your slightly-more- than-equal partner.
Banning says he's got the only process to make their water safe.
But to use it, they've got to give him half of their companies?
He's trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him.
Banning says that their water sources are in danger.
Something about everyone being defenseless against more deadly forms of bacteria.
I can barely make out what he's saying.
Do you wanna listen to this?
What do you think that means, sir?
Del Blaine!
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Yeah, I'd really like some help up here, sir.
- Del Blaine!
- Do you hear me, sir?
I-I know this is not near as exciting as most of your missions, but could you humor me with just a little professionalism?
I would really love some help...
What are you doing?
- What's with the jumpy-jumpy?
- Take off your headphones!
- What?
- Your headphones!
Okay, Chapter Six of the training manual.
Unarmed assailant.
Frontal... attack.
Begin!
Stomach, head! Stomach, head!
God!
What's my name?! Yeah!
You okay?
Oh! Where the hell have you been?!
Stop pushing!
Aah, my hand!
Whoa!
Yeah! Not bad.
Sir?!
Sir! Are you okay, sir?
Don't let go! Don't!
No, no, no, let go!
You're-you're-you're ripping... my sl-sleeve! You-you...
No, no. No, not, not my...
Sir!
My ring.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my... Oh!
This was not... part of the plan.
Del Blaine?
Del...
Confidence.
Del...
Nice of you, moron.
Not in the manual.
Creep!
Del Blaine! Stop!
Get off of me!
Why didn't you stop?
God, what the hell is wrong with you?!
How do you... fall off a building and end up... uh...
You okay?
Would you stop that?
It's okay.
I am in the car with a psychopath.
- We are not safe.
- Are you upset?
Why would I be upset?
I've always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure!
Thank you very much,
Mr. Devlin.
It's my first time.
I mean... every mission is like my first time.
It's so difficult being Clark Devlin.
Oh.
Sorry.
Aah!
I didn't do that.
What i... is wrong with you?!
I'm not who you think I am.
Stay away!
I'm a little over-amped myself right now.
Let's just... call it a day.
Get some rest and medication.
- What?
- We'll be in communication.
Oh.
I don't have your phone number!
Who am I kidding?
I have no idea what I'm doing or why I'm doing it.
I felt the same way
when I took my first field assignment.
Then I met Clark Devlin and life just got a whole lot better... and a little more complicated.
Let's, uh, can we get a close... can we, uh...?
- How do we pan down...
- Yeah. Just hit the second button there.
Everybody warned me, he was unorthodox but he's way irrational, bordering on nutso.
We'll just get, uh... That's it.
- There, yeah. That's it, there.
- Look at that.
Move it over, over just a bit.
He's getting under your skin, isn't he?
He got under my skin once and I'm still feelin' it.
Yeah, you told me.
What about his English?
Oh, I can never understand half of what he says but don't you just love his accent?
She can't hear anything from here...?
No, I don't think... Whoa!
God, I wish I was still back in the field.
How do you like me now?
She's got issues, man.
Holy...
Can your, uh, can your girlfriend shoot, uh...
A groin out of a target?
Let's go.
Get our nails done.
- Okay.
- Have a nice day, boys.
Dr. Angelo, Dr. Angelo...
They ran out of "Get well soon".
You said to wear this, but I don't know.
Being Clark Devlin is not easy.
Hello.
So, Mr. Devlin, how are you feeling today?
Not so good, I'm afraid.
Well, you've got a few hours to pull yourself together.
What do you mean?
After the fiasco of planting the bug,
I'd say we have only one choice:
Level One surveillance.
In other words...
Infiltration.
Banning's gonna be at the Lanford Hotel tonight entertaining three of his new partners.
Chalmers has agreed to... get us at the next table.
Is this a black-tie event?
No. But I'm sure you'll wear whatever you want.
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.
Meet you there at 8:00.
Water... strider...
What?
Wa-ter...
Mr. Clark Devlin.
Stri... der...
What are you doing?
Huh?
Uh, uh, he needs help.
Security! Security!
- Del Blaine.
- Hey.
I know how partial you are to that monkey suit of yours,
- so... I got gussied up.
- Good job. You gussy very well.
Oh, and here's a little something for you.
Hm?
Ooh.
Thank you.
Sorry, I don't have anything for you.
It's a video camera.
Shh. Act normal.
We don't want everybody to know.
Sorry.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Uh, name, please.
- Name?
Um...
Lincoln.
Washington.
Washington.
You're a billionaire and you try to grease the guy with seven bucks?
You think I have money to throw away?
You on the list?
- Perfect.
- Let me talk to him.
No. You know what, we'll do this my way.
I've got a T-135 disorientation module.
You just stand there.
Hi. Could you... hold this for me?
Aw, thanks.
Now, where did I put those tickets?
What's happening, Snowman?
What's happening?
What's happening, Snowman?
What's happening, Snowman?
Hey... what's happening?
Oh, hey.
I can't believe it.
James Brown.
The godfather of soul.
- Hello.
- What's happening?
Mr. Brown.
Forgive us for bothering you.
We came to see your show and...
Yeah, she forgot to make reservations.
Don't worry about it.
I can get tickets for the front row for you.
Oh, thank you very much,
Mr. Brown.
See? The things work out.
There's one more thing
I'd like to say, um...
It's not the in thing today to give compliments to a young lady, but... I just gotta let you know that... you got a nice rack.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.
Enjoy the show.
- What... is wrong with you?!
- He f-fell down by himself.
You killed James Brown.
- No, he's fine.
- He's not fine.
And Banning is gonna leave.
Don't panic.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you... praying?
Miss Cleo told me this would happen.
4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo?
Just go out and tell them
Mr. Brown is not here.
There will be another act.
Nice to meet you.
And right about now, it is style time!
If you will, ladies and gentlemen introducing the hardest-working man in show business ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Dynamite,
James Brown!
Uh, l-ladies and gentlemen...
What's going on?!
Mr. James Brown will not be appearing tonight due to unforeseen circumstances but stay right where you are because the Lanford Hotel is really proud to present the Last Emperor of Soul.
And, um, well, here he is.
Hi.
Hi, everybody. Good evening.
How are you tonight?!
Go home!
- Who wants to get funky tonight?!
- Go ahead and make it funky.
Yeah.
Oh!
Ooh.
Good God!
So, you had fun up there.
I was blending; that's what agents do.
Would you please stop?
I'd like to get to Banning's table before morning.
Whoa! Hey, slut, thanks.
I hate celebrities who brush off their fans.
Banning's girlfriend has been drinking.
Okay, she might be able to tell... Clark!
- Yes.
- Stop.
Get on the scene, Sex Machine.
Great job, man.
Hi.
- Hi. Good evening.
- Hello.
Well, we're all... vaguely honored you could join us, I suppose.
Singing is my favorite type of music.
Oh, admirable.
Regrettably, this is my... vacuous fiancee.
I think her name is
Cheryl... something.
Oh... charmed.
I could look at you all day.
Do you ever dance unprofessionally... Emperor?
Uh, let's see what I can do.
Oh, excuse us.
Of course.
- Do you know how to mambo?
- I hope so.
Whoo!
Hmm... '92 Dasani.
Gentle bouquet with a hint of vinyl polychloride.
Earthy yet... ethereal.
Cheers.
Oops.
I spilled.
You and Banning seem very close.
Tell me about his work.
I don't wanna talk about him.
I wanna talk about you.
You're such a handsome devil.
So are you.
When I can't sleep at night, which is quite often,
I step into my laboratory and I play.
It's not work, you see, it's... glorious... wet... play.
Well, maybe I can... come over and play.
That would be very nice.
The thing is, I, uh...
I have a small problem... trusting people.
I don't know if I can trust myself with you, Deitrich.
Well, maybe we can come up with a way for you to pro...
Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.
Oh, bloody hell.
He drives a BMW, registered to Clark Devlin.
You told me you dealt with Devlin with the skateboard bomb.
Yeah, well, he looks pretty alive to me.
Pretty good dancer.
He's all over Cheryl.
You want me to do something about that?
No.
Maybe the rancid tart might actually be of some use for once.
Get the boys, would you?
Whoo! I am so bushed.
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.
Unfortunate interruptus.
So, my long streak of love, here is the key to the hospitality suite should you feel the need to spend the night.
Goodbye.
Well, I think I'll just go up to room 7-2... excuse me... 6-8 and take a long, hot bath in room 7-2-6-8.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And once again, we end up with nothing.
- I can get her to talk.
- And say what?
Oh, Emperor, would you sign my bra?
Oops, I'm not wearing one.
What is it with you and bras?
She has information.
Oh, right, and that's why you have to go up to her hotel room.
You have never seen my work.
This is what
Clark Devlin does best.
- Can I go home?
- No, you have to cover me.
With what, a shot of penicillin?
- Huh?
- Fine. I'll be waiting by the pool.
Oh, wait.
What's her... room number again?
Yoo-hoo!
Cheryl!
Hey, you little devil.
What kind of bubbles do you like?
Little...
...or big?!
Hang it for me, will you?
So...
I know you can dance, but... what else can you do?
Get on the bed.
I'll show you.
Oh!
Okay, Mr. Devlin, let's see your magic.
Oh, my God, your hands are like a machine.
Oh, I am never working with him again.
So, tell me about Deitrich's good friend, Walter Strider.
Ah! Never heard of 'im... but I know dry Martini.
Maybe someone should mix us a couple.
Y-O-U spells "you".
Oh.
- You're smart.
- Really?
And a good speller.
Hm. Thanks. I graduated top two-thirds of my sixth grade class.
What a gentleman.
Look, it's Cocktail Barbie.
Take your clothes off and stay a while.
I-I like my clothes on.
Kinky boy.
Wh-wh...? Where did you get that pin?
Oh. Deitrich.
- Wanna have a closer look?
- Huh?
I'm sorry.
Look at the time. I gotta go.
Oh, Emperor.
- Where are you going?
- What are... what are you doing?
Oh, Emperor.
Oh, where are you going, you naughty... boy?
I adore romance when it's rough. Whoo!
Get back here!
You're dead meat! Come on!
Take a bath.
Oh, yes, because I've been a dirty, dirty girl.
- Go fill the tub.
- Do you like it with bubbles?
- Hot bubbles.
- Ah, yippee!
Yippee!
Tiny bubbles in my wine...
... makes me feel fine.
Come on, her voice reminds me of my mother.
Is that room service?
What's happening?
What's going on under those cute little boxers of yours?
Emperor, the bubbles are perfect.
- Come to mama, Emperor!
- Coming!
Ow!
Help!
Say good night... agent!
Del Blaine. Del Blaine.
Sorry.
Emperor...
This is not what I signed up for!
- Shh. She's in there taking a bath.
- I need my bathroom bud.
What happened to your nose?
Sorry!
Honeymooners.
Yes, some things never change.
Emperor!
Emperor, come back!
Please!
Oh...
Go! Get going.
Ouch!
C-can't you do anything?
- Why are you so mad?
Gee, let me think.
Because big, ugly men are trying to kill me?
Because I got stuck with a millionaire playboy dilettante for a partner?
You don't care how you make people feel.
I happen to be an extremely sensitive person.
Okay, you think you know feelings.
Look at me.
How do I feel?
- Sick.
- Sad!
What about now?
Constipated.
Creepy.
Horny.
Is-a funny.
Is angry.
Is crazy.
You know nothing.
This is why you don't have a boyfriend.
No wonder you didn't get anything from Banning.
Oh! Right, I didn't get anything from Banning except where his friggin' lab is.
Where?
Let's see if the great master
"agent" can figure it out.
Banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping.
Big secret.
All men have trouble sleeping.
Sometimes at night, he goes down and works in his lab.
- He sleeps in his lab?
- He sleeps in his bedroom.
- His lab's in his bedroom?
- No.
Get your facts straight.
His-his lab is at his house... his casa, where he lives... get it?
Excellent.
You passed the test.
I put in a good word with the boss.
Well, let's go see Chalmers tonight.
No.
Keep him out of this.
Just you and me.
You know, if you're so good at this, why-why don't you tell me something about me?
Okay.
You have big crush on me and I know your name is Del Blaine.
First of all, you wish, and... my real name is Delilah.
Delilah?
Suits you.
- Hey!
- Hm?
Ooh!
Ow!
- Oh... Emperor!
- Hey!
Oh, God, Clark, isn't anything sacred?
Ow, rug burns are so sexy!
It's the driver!
Oh, my God!
Thank you.
- Invitations?
- Oh, yes.
Why don't you offer him five bucks?
I have them somewhere.
Nice party, huh?
So, you're the strong, silent type, huh?
That's the whole bouncer package.
I didn't mean your package.
Thank you... dr. Schwartz.
Shalom.
Come, darling.
Product launch, my ass.
Let's go find Banning's lab.
Let's go.
Are you trying to get me alone?
Where'd they go?
Don't tell me the great Clark Devlin can't come up with an answer.
Although... he can walk on water.
It's a trick, right?
Come on.
Wow!
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.
What?
Oh, uh, uh, I mean... sometime I speak of myself in the third person.
Hm, Del Blaine thinks you're a freak.
Have you cleaned the tanks?
- What are they doing down there?
- I don't know.
When you're done here, you can go and sweep the tunnels.
Don't use the blower!
I can tell the difference.
And don't touch the tequila for me and Mr. Banning.
Whatever you say there, dr. Simms.
- Yes, dr. Simms.
- Louder!
- Yes, dr. Simms.
- Yes, dr. Simms.
We better hope the little ones follow the queen.
Well, if they don't the stock is gonna be worthless.
"Follow the queen"?
Huh? You seen Cheryl?
Maybe he's gay.
Cheryl? No...
Man, let's get outta here.
Let's go have a smoke.
It still stinks.
Hey.
How did you...?
Whatever.
Look at this.
He's pinpointed the national reservoirs.
He's going to poison the water?
Not with that stuff.
It's too detectable and there's government safeguards.
- Let's check out the computer.
- Now you're thinking.
Who are they?
- They shouldn't be in the lab.
- Let's go.
Oh, my God.
Oh, your God what?
DNA recombinant microbes carrying a T-4 genome.
English.
Genetically induced hydrogen-oxygen barrier.
Normal person's English.
Dehydrating water.
Drink it, you'll shrivel up and die, but the big question is how is he possibly gonna introduce it into the water supply?
- I think we better go.
- Huh?
Go.
Quick, over there.
By the wall.
- Nobody here.
- Let's check the hatchery.
You're on my foot.
- What was that about?
- Shh! Go!
How did they miss us?
What, are they blind?
Don't look up my skirt.
Banning's got the bacteria but he has to transport it from his lab to the water.
- There's no way he can.
- Maybe with airplanes.
Not possible.
Besides, even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water's broken.
- You're really smart.
- It's an act.
I'm an inexperienced girl who's trying to bluff her way through.
You are?
Come on, stop humoring me.
Just be honest.
Honest? All right.
You think
I'm the great Clark Devlin.
Yeah, hello?
Steena, I can't talk right now.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can handle it.
Bad news?
Can we go somewhere and be... alone?
Sure.
I didn't know you were so strong.
Take off your clothes.
Let's not do anything we'll regret.
Take off your clothes.
What's happening?
Look, I knew the second I met you you weren't Clark Devlin.
Now, take off the tuxedo.
It doesn't belong to you.
I wanted to tell you, but I just didn't know how.
Take off your clothes.
What is that?
Hey!
- Whoa!
- You, out here!
Okay.
- Take the clothes.
- Okay.
Slow down.
My name is Jimmy Tong.
I'm Mr. Devlin's driver.
He asked me to find
Walter Strider.
I don't wanna hear any more of your lies.
Now, give me the watch and the shoes.
Now, where's Clark Devlin and how did you think you were gonna get away with this?
Things happened.
I decided to go with the flow.
- What about the underwear?
- They're mine.
I-I mean, my roommate.
Jimmy.
Suits you.
- These are my roommate's, too.
- Go finish your business.
- Have you seen the Emperor?
- No.
Impolite to leave without saying good-bye to the host.
- I was just looking for Deitrich.
- I'll take you to him, then.
Like a big terrier with a little rat.
I think she was down in the lab.
Well, at least your interest in water was genuine.
Look,
I'm here because of you.
You wanted to know if I could be trusted?
I bet this tux is just your size.
Thank you.
We got a positive location on Blaine, sir.
How long till we get to her?
20 minutes.
I've transmitted the coordinates.
Dear Mr. Devlin,
I did the best I could, but it wasn't good enough.
I did not find Walter Strider for you.
I also lost your tuxedo.
I'm sure you will get it back.
I guess I will go back to being what I was before I met you.
Oh!
Water strider.
Water strider.
Water strider!
Stupid!
- My beautiful little darlings.
- Gerris maginatus.
Species native to Southeast Asia.
Commonly known as the water strider.
Walter Strider.
Yes, the water strider.
Very good. Very good.
Well, it's... brilliant.
They touch down on the reservoirs.
Their little feet transfer a deadly bacteria without breaking the surface of the water, so no alarms sound, and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature.
Fortunately, there is one drinkable water source.
Yours.
Deitrich, you're a genius.
Too bad it won't work.
Ohhh... you so wrong.
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong.
It will work because my plan is perfect.
Sorry, Mr. Banning, it's your plan... and mine.
- And... it's ours.
- Shut up. Explain.
Oh, all righty.
The life cycle of the Gerris maginatus begins with... mating, something dr. Simms is not personally familiar with.
Anyhoo, the insects swarm to... freshwater where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae.
Spare me the Discovery Channel blather.
Tell me why it won't work.
Yes, tell us.
Why it won't work?
This is the northern hemisphere, correct?
You incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere.
So, simply, it is too cold for them to mature sexually, much like... Simms here.
Therefore, they won't seek out water.
Is this true?
No, I knew a girl once, in college, quite well.
Very well.
And then, you remember cousin Doris?
No, Simms, the bugs.
The bugs.
You're not gonna believe this... hootchie, are you, Mr. Banning?
Oh, yeah?
Ask him if I lied about the tuxedo.
This tuxedo is... it's all right. It's...
"All right"?
That is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet.
And I am laying it in your big, hot hands.
- Mr. Banning, release the bugs.
- Go ahead.
Do what he tells you.
You might have a chance at second prize at a junior high school science fair, but you can forget your dreams of world domination.
Slip into it, Deitrich.
See how it feels.
The other ten percent's in there.
You got plenty of it.
Hey, dr. Schwartz.
Tell your boss
Clark Devlin is back.
Drapes nicely.
Well, it certainly puts a spring in one's step.
Happy to have lightened your loafers, Deitrich.
One question.
Why are you doing this?
Hey, what the hell is this?
This is the moment where
50 CSA commandos storm in, take you, your pretentious accent, your jackass sideburns to the Federal pen where, guess what?
All they serve is highly chlorinated... tap water.
Presenting Clark Devlin.
Have I told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo?
Simms, prepare for release.
With pleasure, sir.
Hatchery doors opening.
Water sources targeted.
Pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes.
Maturation level: 85%.
- Why are you here?
- I've come to save you.
That's great.
What about the big guys with the big guns?
For years,
I've heard about you.
Now we finally meet, I find that the great Clark Devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man, who's about to die an extraordinary death.
You're right... except for one thing.
My name's Tong.
James Tong.
You okay?
Uh, Jimmy, is there something you wanna tell me?
Later.
Oh. You've got a good suit as well.
All right!
Let go!
X-4 genome bacteria-induced water striders: 100% mature.
Bacteria drop sites identified.
Pods now opening.
What are you doing?! No! No!
She's ruining everything.
Electrical malfunction.
Hatchery door is disengaged.
Ah, I knew girls like you in high school.
Yeah? Did they do this?
Uh-huh, they did.
Mr. Banning, you must open the hatch manually.
Sod off.
Manual hatch release required.
Manual hatch release required.
Rotate valve counterclockwise to open hatch.
Get... off.
Bloody open!
Manual procedure complete.
Hatchery doors opening.
Airborne striders awaiting queen release.
Hatchery doors opening.
Clark!
I mean... Jimmy, help me!
I mean, Jimmy, help me!
I'm... busy.
All mature striders ready for release.
Bacteria-laced microbes fully activated.
His head's about to explode.
Look at him.
Look at him!
You might know a few tricks but you're just a sad, pathetic man.
Smoking is bad for your health.
- You okay?
- Yeah, duh. By the way, nice going.
Now millions of people are gonna die of dehydration.
You left the hatch open.
They're not flying away.
Yeah, what are they waiting for?
They are waiting... to follow the queen.
Airborne striders awaiting queen release.
Oh, my God.
For once, you're right.
The queen is gonna lead the striders to freshwater sites all over North America.
Quick, grab it before it's released.
Queen strider disengaged.
Alert!
Queen strider disengaged.
Let's go.
He's got the queen!
Wait!
You dropped it.
Don't move!
Oh!
Ow.
Sir, excuse me,
I deserve to see this.
Ugh.
Trouble.
Okay, okay, make hustle, ladies.
Let's go. Let's go.
Watch out, Aqua-Lung.
Hey, pal, nice suit.
It's okay, kitten.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It is not okay.
You just decked the hero.
I-I-I'm a genius and I can testify for a piece of immunity.
Also, I'm from a neutral country...
Shut it.
Well, looks like we got here just in time.
Oh, to what? Take credit?
Oh, you're hilarious, Blaine.
Winton Chalmers, CSA.
I spearheaded the operation that took down Deitrich Banning.
I bet you're Jimmy Tong.
Here's your tuxedo.
You happy now?
Well, I will be when I get it safely back to headquarters.
By the way, Blaine, not a bad job for your first time in the field.
Well, I didn't do it alone.
She always says nice things about me.
When you finally do something right, you deserve the credit.
Well, sir, it's an honor to help the United States of America.
I feel exactly the same way, soldier.
You don't think you're gonna be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt, do you?
Well, I'm hoping to.
Ooh, man down, people.
Well... there is one thing you can do for me.
And that would be?
All right, tracking systems locked on.
Anybody screws up and your ass is mine.
Block off this end of the street.
Roger that.
All right, we're at
T minus 30 and counting.
Is everyone in position?
Manhole agent up.
Flower lady, hot dog vendor, go!
Replace the hot dog vendor.
Come on, hustle. Let's go!
This is Bird Three, the street is secure.
Uh-oh, bike messenger.
Hostile forces moving in.
Go on, Randall, take 'im out.
Roger. T-14 descending.
Advance the lead operation vehicle.
Bring in the package as soon as I cross.
Roger that.
Hustle, people.
The package is on the move.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's show time.
How's our package?
- I forget what to say.
- But you can do this.
- Focus. Go.
- Huh?
Go.
Package dropped.
Roger. Target locked.
Jimmy! What do you say?
The name's Tong.
James Tong.
I'm the man. I'm the man.
Del, did you tell him to say that?
- No. Well, sort of.
- Oh, God.
Come on, ladies, relax.
He's just pumping out pheromones.
Clark, shut up.
I do believe I'm in charge of this operation.
Package is locked on target.
Why did you wear those pants?
He's stopping.
- What's he stopping for?
- Why is he stopping?
Use the door, Jimmy.
He's really breathing heavy after seeing her.
He's out of his league, if you know what I mean.
Shh!
- He's like a hunter.
- It's the gallery owner.
Randall, quiet.
Nice.
Clark, please, would you focus?
He's about to speak.
Open your mouth.
Hi.
- He said, "Hi."
- Hi.
That's the girl?
He came up with that on his own.
She's not that pretty.
Jimmy, smile, come on.
Move on to something else... quick.
He doesn't look so good.
He doesn't look so good.
He doesn't look so good.
- Jimmy? Jimmy?
- He doesn't look so good.
Clark, give him a line.
Steena, shut up.
- Just look deep into her eyes...
- Clark, no.
That crap doesn't work...
Looks like he's hyperventilating.
If I remember rightly, it worked...
Don't listen to them.
Listen to me.
I can't think with you screaming in my ear.
Everybody calm down, all right?
Not you, her.
No, no, her, her.
Look deep into her eyes...
It's me.
... and tell her you had a dream about her last night.
Clark, be quiet.
Del, will you shut up?
Uh...
I hate to say this,
Jimmy, but... don't take advice from women about women.
Shut up.
Clark, you've been reassigned.
The voices are screaming in my ear.
Hey, if you can hear me, wipe that look off your face.
Remember me?
Hooters.
Soul patch.
Okay, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm the love of my life...
No, no! No, no!
You're the love of my life.
No, you never tell them you love them, Jimmy.
Can you have... dinner with me?
Get out.
Pretty sure he craps his pants, people.
- I just wanna have dinner.
- Get out... now!
- Lunch?
- Now!
Oh!
All right, we're terminating this mission.
Pack it up and roll home.
I think I blew it,
Mr. Devlin.
Jimmy, I wrote the book on this stuff.
Trust me, you didn't blow it.
You outgrew 'er.
Maybe.
Tell you what.
Take the weekend off.
First thing Monday morning we'll head for somewhere with more interesting prospects.
- How about Monte Carlo?
- Sounds good.
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.
Thanks, everybody.
It's okay, Jimmy.
Hang in there, buddy.
Next time.
Well, if you were trying to get her to notice you, mission accomplished.
What are you planning for the second date?
Running at her with a knife?
It's difficult for me.
What is so hard?
You just have to say something like...
"Excuse me, you wanna go get some coffee?"
When I around beautiful women, I can't talk.
- Sure. Beautiful women.
- You know, a real knockout.
Like the beautiful lady in the gallery.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What?
- You can't tell how I feel?
- You look... sad.
- No.
- Sick?
- No.
- Constipated?
- No. A little.
No.
A little.
Tell me, what's wrong?
It's just no guy would ever do anything for me like what you did for her.
Or... tried to do.
You know why?
Because you are a pain in the butt.
Yeah, nice working with you, too.
Hello.
Delilah, excuse me.
- You wanna have a coffee?
- I only drink organic green tea.
Wrong answer.
You're never gonna have a boyfriend.
Fine.
Coffee. I love coffee.
You learn quick.
Is that your happy face or your horny face?
I tell you later.
James. James...
Tong...
Cut.
Oh...
Couldn't tell you what I'm about to say.
Purse!
Cut.
I'm sorry.
Huh?
The bird hit the guy.
Huh?
Is this a bunch of crap.
Is this a bunch crap?
Bunch of crap.
Okay.
You think I'm speak very good English, huh?
What's in your head, flies out your mouth.
What's in your head, fly from your mouth.
What's in your mouth...
That's okay. Cut.
No wonder.
This is why you don't have a boyfriend.
That's...
That's... thought...
- Frog?
- Frowd.
Look at...
Look at her ugly face.
Every time I look...
Every time, she just like this.
How can I act?
- Can we do a single on me?
- No.
Action!
No, no, no.
Cut! Cut!
Let's follow 'em.
They'll take us to the lab.
Who?
Let's...
Cut.
I got the happy partner over here.
Jimmy.
What do you s...?
She smile the whole movie.
Waste of film, waste of time.
What is she doing?
Anything or...
- Hit me!
- Oh, no!
You're fast.
But I'm faster.

500 years had passed, and still the country remained closed.
Cut off from the world, knowing neither hope nor despair...
...the land breathed an air of quiet stagnation.
Reformers driven to armed rebellion...
...had been suppressed by the State.
The House of Takemikazuchi...
...were assassins hired to suppress the rebels.
From ancient times...
...they had been guards to the rulers of a neighboring kingdom.
That country, modernizing, had overthrown its monarch.
Driven into exile, they had reached this land.
Now they were a tribe of assassins...
...who would kill anyone they were paid to.
The Takemikazuchi...
Mother...
Byakurai wants you.
Anka fled this morning.
He who flees the Takemikazuchi is a traitor who will sell our secrets.
He's headed across Shikon Mountain.
But with his leg, he won't have reached the old mine yet.
Yuki...
...take Kiri with you.
I'll go alone.
I'll go!
He'll slow me down.
Take me with you!
Byakurai told you to!
Could you really kill Anka?
Yes.
What if he begged?
I'd still kill him!
I don't think so.
Yuki...it's you...
I'm unarmed. Don't kill me.
Please...
Take my sword.
Tell them you killed me, OK?
I see I'm no match for you any more, Yuki.
-Who are you?
My name is Kuka.
I served your mother.
I have something to tell you.
It's about who killed your mother.
You were told she died in an attack...
...but it was Byakurai who killed her.
Liar!
-Byakurai killed your mother Azora...
...Princess Takemikazuchi.
You must either take revenge and succeed to your mother's place...
...or leave.
Tomorrow you turn 20.
On that day a princess assumes leadership of the Takemikazuchi.
You must choose either to take over the House...
...or to leave it.
If you choose to leave, come to the old mine.
I have delivered the message of Azora.
Did Anka beg for his life?
Did my mother beg for hers?
What do you mean?
Your voice is shaking.
Your mind's racing.
Are you aware what you're doing?
Tell me.
Byakurai...did you kill my mother?
No.
Put up your sword, Yuki.
I'll overlook this.
I didn't want to tell you.
Your mother was killed because she meant to betray us and flee.
Liar!
Lashing out won't help!
I have no choice. Die!
Wonderful news from the Union Assembly.
Under our Great Leader, we are winning the production war.
The Ministry of Consumption reports...
...living standards have risen
20 per cent over the past year.
Celebrating this news the citizens have come out into the streets...
...in a spontaneous parade.
Aya?
What is it?
Is this to kill me with?
You're a Takemikazuchi, aren't you.
Who hired you?
Talk.
Where are the others?
There's no one else coming.
I'm not here to kill you.
Liar.
You think I believe that?
Trust me.
Trust you?
You guys kill anyone you're paid to.
If I trust you I'll end up dead.
If I was after you...
...you'd be dead now.
Trust me?
Doesn't that hurt?
-Yes...
...if you let it.
I saw a girl.
Where is she?
I'm alone here.
That's my bed.
-Good night.
We lost her at the road through the Forest Zone.
You came back to tell me that?
No.
Someone saw a truck.
We'll watch the road.
She'll be back.
She wants revenge.
Someone told her.
-Who?
Hmm...
Yuki's 20 today.
Whoever told her about Azora knew that, and what it means.
Kuka...
So you think she wants to kill you to avenge Azora?
That means she'll come here.
If Kuka wanted to talk to Yuki, where would he call her to?
To his home?
I'd find a better place than that.
How have you been?
It's Kidokoro.
I'm back. There's something
I want to talk to you about.
I'll come today.'
No. I'll come to you...
...the day after tomorrow.
Roger.
I'll be waiting at the usual place.
A man had pledged with Azora, heir to the House of Takemikazuchi.
He swore fealty to the House...
...but Byakurai framed him as a traitor and killed him.
That man was my father?
You wouldn't remember.
You'd only just turned two.
There were still many of Takemikazuchi blood.
Byakurai sought to marry Azora himself...
...and make the House of Takemikazuchi his.
But Azora refused.
Discouraged, she sought to bring the Takemikazuchi to an end.
Byakurai found out and killed her.
Then everything changed.
Many were unhappy with Byakurai, and tried to leave.
But only very few...
...managed to escape.
Princess Azora was killed here.
I'm sure she hoped you would leave the Takemikazuchi.
She wanted you to succeed where she had failed.
You need not take revenge on Byakurai.
The fate of the Takemikazuchi is to disappear.
Princess Yuki...
Your mother had been tortured almost to death...
...but the final blow came from me.
Kill me if you will.
My life since then has been one of waiting for this day.
I offered to accompany her to the next world...
...but she wouldn't allow it.
I was commanded to tell you everything...
...when you reached 20 years of age.
If Princess Yuki were to do me the honor of killing me...
Don't say that.
There's no point.
So it was you, Kuka...
Soma...
My, how you've grown!
By your leave...
Kuka!
This is what I wanted!
Princess Yuki! Don't die!
Kill me if you want...
...but don't raise your blades against Princess Yuki!
That I can't promise.
Kuka!
When I was small...
...I was always happy.
I never dreamed...
...things would turn out like this.
You know why people thought that way then?
It's because no one had any ideals.
Yes, people died when we put a bomb in the Assembly.
But it was very effective.
You should be proud.
It was a holiday.
No one was supposed to be there.
You told me that.
Losses are inevitable.
You don't get something for nothing.
Mimura knew that.
His death wasn't wasted.
No one pays any attention unless a few dozen citizens die.
I'd like to move on to the next project.
Mr Sugimoto...
...didn't think so.
He called you while I was gone?
Last month.
He's been expelled.
I trust you.
We have to do whatever's necessary to achieve our ideals.
Takashi...
...what's the safest place in the jungle?
On the lion's back.
The fleas there enjoy the most peaceful life there is.
Hey...
Hey...
Hey!
Shit!
Where are you bleeding?
You need protein, or you won't heal.
Put these on.
That's all there is here.
Hurry up!
It suits you.
What are you doing?
Throwing these out.
You saw Mr Kidokoro?
You saw Mr Kidokoro?
Takashi...be careful of him.
Did you hear about Sugimoto?
Did you hear about Sugimoto?
He's dead.
Murdered.
I'm leaving this country.
There's happiness somewhere.
You just have to go there.
Who's that?
A guest.
A guest?
So you've found happiness?
Take care.
Call me if you want to come.
Thanks.
Why did you come back?
What's happened now?
Don't want to say?
It's probably safer for me if I don't know.
Does it bother you to kill someone?
Why do you kill people?
For money?
My body moves.
When I hold my sword and close in on a target, my body just moves...
...before I can think why.
Aw, you poor dear!
Some king stops paying his guards...
...so they put their skills on the market.
You kill people for no reason.
Not to defend your country, not to defend yourselves...
You have nothing to defend.
You just kill.
But I had...
...a reason.
I had a reason.
I'm sure I had...
...a reason to kill.
Come with me.
My sister.
When she was eight...
...I came home from school to find blood everywhere...
...and just her alive.
The guys who did it were let off for lack of evidence.
So I killed them myself.
I was caught, tried, and sentenced.
Four years later when I got out,
I couldn't see things...
...the way I had before.
Everything looked completely different.
Then I met someone...
...who said he wanted me to be as happy as I'd been before.
No one else said that.
I've done things, and been pushed into doing things.
To get back to being happy,
I've rationalized everything.
Renkyo?
Yes.
I need to talk to you.
About what?
Can we really kill Yuki?
Without her, we have no leader of Takemikazuchi blood.
And then...
-Then what?
We've already lost just about everyone of Takemikazuchi blood.
But what reason do we have to exist...
...without that name?
-We don't need a reason.
Now we have nothing left to guard any more.
I venerated our ancestors,
I believed in the motherland.
But when the monarchy fell...
...our swords were taken from us.
Those who were caught had their memories erased with drugs...
...and to slow their arms...
...needles driven into their elbows.
We fled, without turning our swords on the motherland.
Remember, Renkyo?
Those tanks on that southern island we saw as we went?
A group of ruined tanks...
...all eaten away by acid rain...
...and stinking of corpses.
But there were no corpses.
The stench was coming from us.
At that time...
...we were dead.
Hello?
Hello?
-It's me.
Mr Kidokoro...
Why are you phoning?
I sent you a schematic.
Can you take a look at it?
Sure.
Be right back.
Did you see it?
I want to move in ten days.
Are you there?
Ten days...
I can't.
OK, when?
Never.
No?
No.
All right. I'll be in touch.
You always look so sad...
And you have no expression at all.
Have you ever been sad?
I make it go away. Just like pain.
And that's how you can kill people?
When you're sad you should grieve, and when you're happy, celebrate.
Have you ever laughed?
When I'm sad I grieve.
For hours...
For days...
For years...
Have you ever heard of a miki-ishi?
No.
It means 'beautiful precious stone'.
They're rare.
You can look all year and be lucky to find even one.
When you grind it on a whetstone, you get a little green crystal.
My mother collected them.
When she found one, she'd carefully polish and save it.
When she had 30, she was going to make a necklace...
...for my wedding day.
She said she'd put it around my neck the day I got married.
She started collecting them at 18...
...had me at 22...
...and died at 27.
...and died at 27.
...in a little treasure box.
Not enough for a necklace.
Soon I'll pass the age she was when she had me...
...and then her age when she died.
But I haven't collected anything
I could leave...
...to anyone.
I don't have anyone to leave anything to.
There's no one...
...I feel like I want to treasure.
Let's leave here...
...leave this country.
There's nothing holding us here.
Somewhere there must be a place we can forget everything.
Let's go there.
Mother...
...now...
...I'm happy.
You think you'll ever be happy?
Even if you kill me, you still walk the path of blood.
You can't avoid it.
Mr Kidokoro...
Your sister looks well.
What do you want?
Oh...
If it's about that schematic...
No. I changed plans.
This one's a great idea.
I'm sure you'll like it.
What is it?
We find common ground with the government.
We achieve our ideals, and very few people get hurt.
What do you think, Takashi?
Good plan, huh?
You're selling me out?
It's a deal. We respect the law, and our ideals are realized.
Traitor!
In spirit we will continue.
The plan I sent you was to be the last.
Because we'd all be killed?
Don't talk like that!
Isn't that what you've wanted all along anyway?
But this way you're safe.
I said it was a deal!
A fair deal.
So why did we do all that?
Why all those victims?!
It meant something. We all acted because we believed in our ideals.
No. We believed in you!
No. We believed in you!
...Mimura blown up...
They all believed in you!
You said we'd be happy again.
You're the only one who did!
Happiness will come.
Of course it won't be free.
I told you the price would be high.
All we can do is pray for the victims.
But you don't have to pray, Takashi.
You're one of the victims we'll be praying for.
You bastard!
I am Azora's daughter...
...Princess Yuki of the Takemikazuchi.
In the name of my mother,
I take your life!
Don't you understand?
It's over! Get lost!
I'll keep this.
Live.
Be happy.
Live for me.
Takashi...
Takashi...
{2639}{2737}You know, at first, I thought|you was old-ass Raisinet|riding on a skateboard.

{7437}{7526}How often do you have|this dream ?|More and more lately.
{7528}{7622}You seem to be very fond|of this girl, Denise.
{7624}{7683}My God, she is so special to me.
{7685}{7791}But how's she gonna love me when|I got Buddy Love inside me ?|I wanna be perfect for her.
{7793}{7862}Perfect ?|No one is perfect, Sherman.
{7863}{7957}You need to understand|that Buddy Love|is a representation...
{7958}{8033}of the uninhibited,|hedonistic id.
{8035}{8102}- He is not a real person.|- Buddy Love is real !
{8104}{8174}Well, he was real,|and he does take control|of me sometimes.
{8176}{8232}You will never learn|to control him...|Sherman !
{8234}{8305}until you accept the fact|that he is apart of you.
{8306}{8381}Yeah, and the best part too !|And I'll tell you|something else, punk !
{8382}{8450}All these diplomas on this wall|don't make up for the fact...

{8736}{8842}You see, we all have|a little Buddy Love inside us.
{8843}{8905}Yeah.|But we can't let him|rule our lives.
{8907}{8969}You're in charge, Sherman.|Can you say that for me ?
{8970}{9018}I'm in charge.|Can't hear you.
{9019}{9065}- I'm in charge.|- Can't hear you !

{11104}{11150}Yeah, keep tellin'|yoursel fthat, bubble butt !
{11373}{11450}It is theoretically possible|to isolate the elements...
{11452}{11534}of an individual's|genetic makeup and separate them.
{11536}{11667}Now someday, we may be able to|locate an unhealthy risk factor|in our DNA and remove it.
{11669}{11752}Excuse me. Beg your pardon.
{11753}{11800}l'm sorry.|Excuse me.
{11872}{11959}Whether this is advisable|is another question entirely.

{12125}{12180}I was hoping I might be able|to sit in on your lecture.
{12181}{12265}I'm sure we can accommodate you|since you were so quiet coming in.
{12267}{12342}Well, it's very hard|to be quiet...
{12344}{12390}when you're lecturing|on genomic extractions.
{12392}{12456}I think it's ver exciting.|Oh, lagree completely.
{12458}{12548}Something about the way|the nucleotides cohere|with the target sequence.
{12549}{12622}Yeah. I always say,|ifyou can't be with|the nucleotide that you love,
{12624}{12672}cohere with|the one you're with.
{12866}{12934}- Yeah.|- Uh, anyway as I was--

{13005}{13114}No excuses.|I'll see you next time.
{13168}{13222}Professor Gaines.
{13224}{13306}Oh, Professor Klump.|Yeah.
{13308}{13417}Um, yes, I was, um--|I was wondering if you had a--
{13419}{13498}- Dean Richmond, we were--|-Just having... a little chat.
{13500}{13546}Don't be bashful,|ProfessorGaines.
{13548}{13610}Pound-for-pound, this big lug's the greatest|scientist on the planet.
{13612}{13724}And let's be honest, pound-for-pound, he is aplanet.|That's said with love.
{13726}{13806}- Did you get those goo-goo clusters I sent you ?|- Yes, I did, thank you,
{13808}{13880}but I'm on a diet right now,|so I can't eat 'em.
{13882}{13934}And it's working beautifully.|No, l'm telling you.
{13936}{14040}When I came in, with this light and in that outfiit,|you could really think for a second that--
{14041}{14112}Anyway, you said you had|something to show me.
{14115}{14185}I am so excited about this, Dean.|You will be too.
{14187}{14257}You got that ?|Come on. Jason, where's our patient ?
{14259}{14331}Right here, Professor. Come on, boy.
{14332}{14422}Now this is Buster.|Buster suffers from acute|arthritis and diminished vision,
{14424}{14472}which are both signs of advanced aging.
{14474}{14556}We're gonna see if we can fix all of Buster's|problems right now, aren't we, Buster ?
{14557}{14608}Yes, we are.|This little experiment...
{14610}{14700}makes use of Professor Gaines's brilliant|research on gene targeting.
{14702}{14784}Now, if I've composed this formula properly,
{14785}{14858}this should be most impressive.
{14860}{14942}All right, Buster.
{15124}{15170}Jiminy freaking Cricket !
{15172}{15268}Sherman, this is amazing.
{15270}{15372}You've just discovered--|The fountain of youth. This is huge.
{15373}{15454}Do you have any idea|what you've done ? This is unbelievable. We're rich.
{15456}{15515}We're gonna have every |pharmaceutical-company in the world...
{15517}{15552}lining up|to throw money at us.
{15553}{15598}Of course, it all has to be|properly tested first.
{15600}{15690}Exactly, yes.|He makes an interesting point. |Here's another. Shut up !
{15692}{15769}Besides, look at the little fella.|He can lick his own winky again.
{15771}{15840}|There's not a guy in the world|who wouldn't wanna do that.
{15841}{15912}Klump !|Dean Richmond !
{15914}{15964}The effect is only temporary.|l'm sorry, sir. You're sorry ?
{15966}{16041}Oh, my goodness.|I'm just tring not to think|where that tongue has been !
{16043}{16089}You all right ?
{16329}{16409}Klump, party of six, please.|Yes, and we're hungry.
{16892}{16943}Mama, you know, you really look good.|Have you been losing weight ?
{16945}{17018}Oh, thankyou, baby, no, but I'm getting ready|to start a new diet.
{17020}{17112}Have some of this ambrosia.|I don't even like ambrosia.
{17113}{17175}Don't tell me you don't like|ambrosia. You had some before, and you liked it.
{17177}{17241}Have some adventure !|Oh, now I'm a child-- I don't know what I like.
{17243}{17291}...for the all-girls soccer team.
{17292}{17360}Let me get that for you.|Oh, my baby's so gallant.
{17362}{17468}Sherman, come here.|And it's called ''All the pork you can eat'' diet.
{17469}{17570}You can have all the pork you want. |You can have ham, bacon, sausage.
{17572}{17639}I got the wrong thing.|Take that. Thank you.
{17640}{17695}Now I got a full portion.|Whateveryou wanna eat,
{17696}{17743}just as long as you have|three glasses of grapefruit|juice afterwards...
{17744}{17811}because the grapefruitjuice|breaks down all the unwanted--
{17812}{17905}Get away from there !|Stop that ! Baby !
{17907}{17990}Honey, get the baby. He's a boy, and boys|don't be doing stuff like that.
{17992}{18068}- Hey ! Get your ass--|- What ?
{18070}{18134}Please teach that boy manners.|He ain't gonna be acting like no hooligan with me.
{18136}{18206}That was a spoon or fork ?|That was a spoon. All right.|Boys will be boys.
{18208}{18281}- Boys will be boys.
{18283}{18360}Oh, this looks fabulous.|Yeah, it looks really good.
{18362}{18419}How about getting another bottle|of red over here ?|Get some more wine.
{18420}{18490}Hey, Ernie, maybe|you wanna pace yourself|and take it easy, huh ?
{18492}{18581}Pace myself?|Hey, this is a celebration|for Daddy retiring.
{18583}{18690}We owe it to Daddy|togetshit-faced,|andl'm gonnagetshit-faced.
{18692}{18748}By the way, congratulations, Mr. Klump.
{18749}{18835}She's so polite.|Look here, Denise, you have to|stop that ''Mr. Klump'' stuff...

{25917}{25997}Jason, I just know I'm not the one saying|all those awful things.
{25999}{26108}It was him. You may be right, Professor.|Take a look at this reading.
{26181}{26273}Right there. Recombining with the gene that governs|testosterone production.
{26325}{26381}Buddy Love.
{26443}{26496}I told you.|That's Buddy Love.
{26497}{26541}Don't panic. Allright.
{26543}{26617}We should be able to get rid of him.|According to Denise's theories,
{26619}{26679}we should be able to isolate that gene and extract it.|No, no way.
{26681}{26740}Professor, what you're talking about|is extremely dangerous.
{26742}{26801}Those traces of Buddy must've been |in your system this whole time.
{26803}{26876}You've been able to keep them under control.|Not anymore. He's back now.
{26877}{26976}He's coming back 'cause he knows |I'm happy and he wanna ruin everthing.
{26978}{27042}Yeah, but he is not a he.|He is a gene.
{27044}{27132}He's just part of you.|Oh, no, he's not.
{27134}{27185}Am I interrupting ?
{27187}{27325}Oh, uh, not at all.|We were just doing some|last-minute tests on Buster.
{27327}{27364}Yeah.
{27365}{27452}Uh, Sherman, can I talk to you|in private for just a second ?
{27549}{27629}Sherman, I got a call today,
{27631}{27714}and, well, I've been offered a full professorship|at the University of Maine.
{27716}{27847}University of Maine ?|But, Denise, that's in Maine. |Yeah.
{27873}{27935}Oh.
{27937}{28033}Well, uh, that's a fine department|over there in Maine.
{28035}{28112}It is gonna be a...
{28113}{28168}tremendous loss to Wellman, though.
{28170}{28265}Well, I haven't decided|to leavejust yet. You haven't ?
{28266}{28331}Well, no, I mean--
{28333}{28400}There's something|ver important to me here,
{28401}{28482}and I'm not so sure|I can just leave it behind.
{28484}{28583}Well, Denise, you can fii nish|the research we started on your own.
{28585}{28696}Sherman, I'm not talking|about research. Really ?

{29613}{29708}You are...|the most brilliant man I've ever known.
{29781}{29873}Uh, speaking of which, I shouldn't keep you|from your research,
{29875}{29916}so, um, I'll talk to you later.
{29918}{29989}Okay, I'll see you soon.
{30110}{30157}My goodness.

{31421}{31468}You even get used to people|making fun of you.
{31545}{31632}Somewhere along the line, |I got used to being alone.
{31685}{31767}And I just don't wanna|be alone anymore.
{32885}{32943}Denise! Denise!

{58326}{58394}We are already committed to purchasing|Professor Klump's formula.
{58395}{58446}Oh, Professor Klump's formula ?|That's if it works.
{58447}{58568}Let's just that although he's a brilliant scientist,|at times, he can be unstable.
{58570}{58616}Yes.|Huh.
{58618}{58666}Interesting. Yes, now, my formula works...
{58668}{58794}and can be yours for the price|of $149 million, if you act now, pretty lady.

{58896}{58962}Oh, no, not at all.|Just say when, and I'll|make it available to you.
{58963}{59024}All right.
{59026}{59094}If Klump can't deliver and you|can prove your formula's better, Yes ?
{59095}{59169}Phleer would have to seriously consider it.|Is that right ?

{73876}{73934}So, uh, genomic extractions.
{73935}{73986}Fascinating.
{73988}{74090}But the whole concept|ofremoving faultygenes must|haveyou in an ethicalquandary..

{74461}{74514}- Oh !|- [ Laughing ]|- [ Laughs ]
{74615}{74726}Sherman is known as the leading expert|in genomic extractions.
{74727}{74802}Give us a little preview of the speech you're going to make|at the press conference.
{74907}{75000}- Say what now ?|- l know we would never be able to keep up,
{75002}{75072}but is there some way that you could explain it|in layman terms ?
{75074}{75142}Oh, you'd like me|to explain to you ?
{75144}{75214}Yes.|Well, I would love to.|I would be honored.
{75216}{75285}It's really quite simple.|This corn, for instance--
{75287}{75370}This piece ofcorn here|can represent a strand of DNA.
{75372}{75419}[Chuckling]|And these little--
{75421}{75495}the individual--|the bumpy things that go--
{75497}{75551}The Green Giant|calls them ''niblets.''|Uh, niblets.
{75553}{75626}These niblets represent each gene, |and they determine everything about you.
{75628}{75724}For instance, Mrs. Gaines,|let's say if a person was to have big titties, like you.
{75726}{75779}- [Denise]|Sherman !|- l'm sorry. Big titties.
{75781}{75843}No, breasts. Scratch it.|Get off you. On me.
{75845}{75909}- Now, I have a big ass. Never mind that.|- [ Fork Clatters ]
{76018}{76131}What we're attempting|to do here is to extract|the, uh, the bad, badgenes.
{76133}{76193}Extract that titty out.|Andass comes out.
{76195}{76241}And just leave|the good genes,
{76243}{76295}which is very simple|if you think about it.
{76343}{76385}Just ignore that.
{76387}{76451}Please ignore those.|Those are the badgenes.
{76453}{76547}What I'm really tring to do|is go deep, deep down|into the gene structure,
{76549}{76599}which oftentimes|is much more difficult.
{76674}{76740}Crackers !
{76742}{76788}Oh, goodness !

{116616}{116672}But we can get right back|to work with the youth formula,

{129165}{129240}This is an impressive package for a toddler.|All right, Mr. Toddler.
{129242}{129327}Nothing to see here, folks.|This mutant is about to dissolve into liquid,

{130866}{130912}All right, that's it.|Slow the car down !|Slow down !
{130914}{130960}We can't help Sherman|wrapped around no light pole.

{131370}{131450}If you quit now, you're|gonna be empty-headed.|Come on, Klump. Let's get him.
{131451}{131523}Get a hold of this, chubby.|[ Screams ]
{131674}{131737}Whoo !|You got a big ass !
{131795}{131875}- What ?|- Follow that ass.
{131932}{131983}Aw, hell.|Now, what's all of this ?

{133190}{133261}Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.|Oh, that's marvelous.
{133370}{133447}The deal is dead,|you know that ?
{133449}{133525}I've been calling you a moron for years.|Now you're finally--
{133643}{133715}I'll just get a cab.
{133968}{134066}- Ohhh, Sherman !|- I raised a genius.
{134068}{134124}- No one isperfect.|- l want to beperfect forher.|- Perfect ?
{134125}{134199}- About time you told Denise ?|- l checked the file.|- There's no future.
{134201}{134307}You will never learn to control him |till you accept the fact he is apart of you.
{134630}{134694}Sherman.
{134721}{134763}You okay ?
{134925}{135036}Gone-- he's all gone.|Buddy ?|He evaporated ?
{135037}{135128}Gone. And me no smart.|Never. No more.
{135129}{135200}Sherman, that's okay.|I mean, we'll figure something out.
{135201}{135268}There has to be something|that we can do.
{135269}{135328}I want to say|I'm-- I'm sorry.
{135365}{135454}I never--|I didn't want to hurt you.|You understand ?
{135456}{135556}I thought that if you knew|that Buddy was a part of me,
{135558}{135618}I thought that you|wouldn't have me then.
{135620}{135674}Sherman.|Now, hear me.
{135676}{135722}Hear me out now.
{135760}{135816}I should've had|more faith in you.
{135850}{135899}Should've had|more faith in myself.
{135901}{135964}But I--|Sherman.
{135965}{136062}Sherman, what's wrong ?|Sherman ?
{136064}{136123}- Can't you hear, son ?|- Sherman, look at me.
{136125}{136180}Who am I ?
{136335}{136396}Pretty lady.|Oh, honey.
{136398}{136444}Oh, that's nice.
{136446}{136558}- It's gonna be okay.|- Nice.
{136560}{136607}I'll take care of you.
{136609}{136672}Oh ! Come on.|Let's get the boy home.

{137350}{137408}Oh, my God.|lt's Buddy.
{137409}{137491}- His DNA burst into water molecules. Sherman, quick.|- What the hell ?

Mutants. Since the discovery of their existence... they have been regarded with fear... suspicion, often hatred.
Across the planet, debate rages.
Are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain... or simply a new species of humanity... fighting for their share of the world?
Either way, it is an historical fact:
Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute.
"We are not enemies, but friends.
"We must not be enemies.
"Though passion may have strained... it must not break the bonds of our affection. "
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural address as our nation's 16th president.
It's one of my favorites.
So, if you’ll please have your tickets ready... we can begin the tour.
Jackie, could you clear my schedule this evening?
I wanna have dinner with my son. Yes, Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you lost?
Perimeter breach at visitor's checkpoint.
Multiple subjects.
Mr. President, security breach. Jackie, leave. Let's get him out to the car.
Exit's not clear. We don't know how many there are.
Post five. Secure.
- There's something in the corridor.
- To the shelter.
Negative! Not clear!
- It's outside the oval office.
- Lock this place down!
- Don't shoot!
- There!
My God.
Neanderthals. We once believed that they were wiped out... by years of conflict with a much more advanced branch of humanity... called Cro-Magnon man.
But recent research into our own DNA... suggests that these two species may have interbred... evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?
Us.
Us. Right.
Artie, not here.
Come on.
Pay attention.
Makes me insane when she does this.
What are you looking at, you sick—
Busted my lip.
- I have cancer.
- To the shelter!
- No!
- Hi.
They're gonna kill—
What's wrong with this?
It doesn't work.
Jean? You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, uh— just a headache.
It's not just a headache, is it?
Listen, I— I wasn't really sure how to say this... but ever since Liberty
Island, you've been— Scott.
You've been different.
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't seem to focus. I can hear everything. It's not just your telepathy.
A month ago, you had to concentrate just to levitate a book or a chair across the room.
Now, when you have a nightmare, the entire bedroom shakes.
My dreams are getting worse.
Scott.
I keep feeling something terrible is about to happen.
I would never let anything happen to you.
Hey. Have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?
Something's happening in the food court.
My brother asked you a simple question. Why are you being such a dick?
Yeah, why are you being such a dick?
Because I can.
Can I have a light?
Hmm.
- Sorry. I can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.
- Why don't you stop showing off?
For her? I can't help it if your girlfriend's getting excited.
- I don't think she's getting excited.
- Trying to have a good time.
I think you're the only one having a good time.
Hey!
That's real cute, man.
What are you gonna do?
Suddenly, you're not so tough.
Hello? Honey, can you hear me?
Bobby, what did you do?
I didn't do this.
No.
I did.
And the next time you feel like showing off, don't.
Breaking news. We're coming to you live from Washington... where there's been an attack in the Oval Office of the White House.
Details are still coming in, but we have been informed... that the president and vice-president were not harmed.
Sources say the attack involved one or more mutants.
I think it's time to leave, Professor.
Authorities have closed off-
I think you're right.
Yearrgh! Unh!
My opinion?
Magneto's behind this.
No. I don't think so, Scott.
While Eric is capable of organizing something like this from prison... for him it would be irrational.
It would only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.
You mean superiority.
You're right.
If Eric had his way—
Of course, you know how the government will respond.
They'll reintroduce the Registration Act.
Or worse. The president could declare a state of emergency.
Place every mutant in the country under arrest.
Do you think the assassin was working alone?
Well, we'll only know that if we find him before the authorities do.
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro... but his movements are inexplicably erratic.
When I have more exact coordinates...
Storm, Jean, I'll need you to take the jet and try and pick him up.
It was close, wasn't it?
Closer than anyone's admitted.
What do you need, William?
Just your authorization... for a special operation.
Uh, no, thank you,
Mr. President.
And somehow I thought you were here to talk about school reform.
Funny you should say that,
Mr. President.
Senator.
Mr. President.
Thank you for having me.
Senator Kelly, this is
Colonel William Stryker.
How do you do?
His department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon... since before my time.
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter of the Registration Act, Senator.
It seems your ideas on the mutant problem have changed recently.
For the best,
I hope.
So, what are you proposing,
Mr. Stryker?
Uh, may I,
Mr. President?
We've managed to gather evidence of a mutant training facility... in the Salem region of upstate New York.
Where did you get this information?
Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists... from the Liberty Island incident.
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?
You have access to him?
Magneto. Yes.
We developed the technology that built his plastic prison.
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.
What the hell is that?
Ajet.
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know... but it comes up out of the basketball court.
If we’d been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr. President, before this incident—
All right. Listen.
William, you enter, you detain, you question... but the last thing we need to see... is the body of a mutant kid on the 6:00 news.
Mr. Stryker.
Senator Kelly.
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.
Quite a handshake.
What can I do for you?
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison. I'd like to arrange a visit if possible.
It isn't a petting zoo,
Senator.
In this conflict, he is the enemy.
You're just a spectator. So why don't you sit this one out, all right?
Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really want to turn this into some kind of war?
I was piloting black-ops missions in the jungles of North Vietnam... while you were sucking on your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.
You're dead. You're so dead.
You're dead.
I—I don't wanna hurt you.
I'm not afraid.
Hey.
Logan!
It's Logan.
You miss me, kid?
Not really.
Mm. How you doing?
I'm okay. How are you? Who's this?
Oh, this is Bobby. He's my— I'm her boyfriend.
Call me Iceman.
Right.
Boyfriend?
So how do you guys—
Well, we're still working on that.
Look who's come back.
Just in time.
For what?
We need a baby-sitter.
Baby-sitter? Nice to see you again, Logan.
- Hi, Logan.
- Hi, Jean.
Uh, I should go and get the jet ready.
Yeah, well, it was good to meet you.
Come on. Let's go. Bye, Logan.
I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.
The professor wants us to track down a mutant who attacked the president.
So it was a mutant?
You'll be here when we get back— unless you plan on running off again.
Well, I can probably think of a few reasons to stick around.
Find what you were looking for, Logan?
More or less.
I'll see you boys later.
- Be safe, okay?
- You too.
- Bye.
- See ya.
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?
Your bike needs gas.
Then fill her up.
Mr. Laurio.
How long can we keep this up?
How long is your sentence?
Forever. Not necessarily forever, Mr. Lehnsherr.
Just until
I've got all that I need.
Mr. Stryker.
How kind of you to visit.
Have you come back to make sure the tax-payers' dollars are keeping me comfortable?
Ohh!
Done. You can go.
Now...
Mr. Lehnsherr...
I'd like to have one final talk... about the house that Xavier built... and the machine called Cerebro.
Logan, my tolerance for your smoking in the mansion notwithstanding... continue smoking that in here and you'll spend the rest of your days... under the belief that you're a six-year-old girl.
- You'd do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.
Welcome back.
Ooh.
You want me to leave?
No. Just don't move.
These lights represent every living person on the planet.
White lights are humans.
And these are the mutants.
Through Cerebro,
I'm connected to them.
And they to me.
You see, Logan...
We're not as alone as you think.
I found the base at Alkali Lake.
There was nothing there.
The broken line represents the path of the mutant who attacked the president.
I've been finding it difficult to get a lock on him.
Well, can't you just concentrate harder?
If I wanted to kill him, yes.
There.
Looks like he's finally stopped running.
I need you to read my mind again.
Logan...
I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.
We had a deal.
The mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked and opened.
It's a beehive with a million different compartments.
Spare me the lecture.
I have no doubt that your amnesia, your adamantium skeleton, the claws... are all somehow connected.
But, Logan... sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.
I promise you we'll talk again when I return.
Oh. If you will be kind enough to watch over the children tonight...
Scott and I are going to visit an old friend.
I'm sending coordinates of where the mutant seems to have settled for now.
Soon as you find him, bring him back to the mansion.
Let's hope he cooperates.
Yes. For his sake.
Good luck.
Stryker, William.
What are you doing in here?
Estoy tirando la basura.
Garbage.
These are the coordinates.
He's a teleporter.
- Must be why the professor had trouble locking onto him.
We're not here to hurt you!
We just wanna talk!
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.
Sure you don't wanna come down?
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.
Are you?
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.
Now why would people have gotten that impression?
What's your name?
Wagner. Kurt Wagner.
There was so much shooting... such fear... and then there was only pain.
I could see it all happening... but I couldn't stop myself.
It was like a bad dream.
Perhaps He is testing me.
And before you were in the White House... what do you remember?
Nothing. I was here.
Jean.
I'd rather get him back to the professor.
The professor?
Did you do these yourself?
Yes.
And what about this?
I need you to read my mind again.
I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.
He'll be indestructible.
His entire skeleton—
Adamantium. Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.
Wolverine.
No memory. He'll have no memory.
A dozen tourists in the White House during the attack... are still being held for questioning.
Best tasting food.
A machine that's so darn easy—
...president will address the nation—
For the White House assassin, following hundreds of-
Can't sleep?
- How can you tell?
- 'Cause you're awake.
Right. How about you?
I don't sleep.
Hey.
Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
Apparently not.
Got any beer?
This is a school.
So that's a "no"?
Yeah, that's a "no. "
Got anything other than chocolate milk?
There should be some soda in that small cupboard.
Thanks.
No problem.
I'll take him from here.
It's all right, Scott.
Nice shades.
Thanks.
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?
Sorry, Eric. Not today.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
The assassination attempt on the president—
What do you know about it? Nothing.
Only what I read in the papers.
You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles.
What's happened to you?
I've had frequent visits from William Stryker.
You remember him, don't you?
William Stryker.
His son, Jason, was once a student of yours, wasn't he?
Yes. Years ago.
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to help him... at least not in the way that his father wanted.
And now you think that taking in the Wolverine... will make up for your failure with Stryker's son.
How long you been here?
Couple years.
And your parents just sent you off to mutant school?
Actually, my parents think this is a prep school.
Oh, I see.
I suppose lots of prep schools have their own dorms, campuses— Jets.
So you and Rogue, huh? Yeah.
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just—
It's just that it's not easy... when you wanna be closer to someone... but you can't.
You know, I've seen how you look at Dr. Grey.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
You haven't told him about his past, have you?
I've put him on the path.
Logan's mind is still fragile.
Is it?
Or are you afraid of losing one of your precious X-Men... old friend?
Eric, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Charles.
I couldn't help it.
What have you told Stryker?
Everything.
The war has begun.
Scott! You should've killed me when you had the chance!
But now and then... every mother needs to get away.
Without her, the babies are helpless.
Sensing danger, the mother rat races home.
The babies can't even see the killer.
And someone uninvited is coming to dinner.
She arrives too late for one baby.
The centipede was deadly.
Hi.
- What is it?
- Shh, shh.
You picked the wrong house, bub.
You all right?
Stay here.
Come on!
Run!
Move, move, move!
This way.
Let's go. Come on!
Go, go, go!
Run!
Run! John! Hey. Where's Rogue?
I don't know.
I gotta find her.
Hey!
Come on!
Here. Take her.
Hurry!
Go on. Get in.
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go! Come on!
Hey. Take him.
He's stunned.
I can help you.
Help them.
Rogue!
Bobby!
This way.
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.
Move! Move!
Go! Go!
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on. This way.
This is it.
Logan!
You wanna shoot me?
Shoot me!
Don't shoot him!
Not yet.
Wolverine?
Well, I must admit, this is certainly the last place...
I'd expect to find you.
How long has it been?
Fifteen years?
You haven't changed one bit.
Me, on the other hand—
Nature.
Wait! Wait! You guys, we gotta do something. They're gonna kill him.
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby!
Please.
I didn't realize Xavier was taking in animals— even animals as unique as you.
Who are you?
Don't you remember?
No! No!
Logan, come on.
Let's go.
Logan.
Go! I'll be fine.
But we won't.
Go. Keep going.
All right. Get in. Get in! I'm driving.
Hey. Maybe next time.
This is Cyclops's car.
Oh, yeah?
What the hell was that back there?
Stryker. His name is Stryker.
Who is he?
I can't remember.
Zone one clear.
Roger that.
Here. This is yours.
I don't like uncomfortable silences.
What are you doing?
I don't think that's the CD player.
Whoa.
Sit back.
Where we going?
Storm and Jean are in
Boston. We'll head that way.
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.
Sergeant?
Most of the mutants escaped through a series of tunnels that weren't in our schematics.
We have several in custody.
How many?
Six, sir.
Welcome, Professor.
Take what we need, gentlemen.
Look, I just think all this anti-mutant protesting... underscores the genuine growing concern among most Americans.
I think mutant registration—
But why stop there?
Maybe it would be easier to round up mutants by the truckload.
Or maybe you'd like all-out war, Mr. Shaw. Oh, please.
Turn that shit off, Lou.
Lot on your mind?
Mr. Laurio?
I'm Grace.
You want another beer?
Of course you do.
You're really aggressive.
Yes, I am.
Oh, I— I've never hooked up with a girl like you before.
I know.
It's, uh, kinda dirty in here, don't you think?
That's the idea. Velcro.
Nice.
Bottom's up.
I certainly hope so.
Bottom's up.
- William.
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.
I call it the neural inhibitor.
It keeps you outta here.
What have you done with Scott?
Don't worry. I'm just giving him a little reeducation.
Of course, you know all about that, don't you?
William, you wanted me to cure your son.
But mutation is not a disease. You're lying!
You were more frightened of him than I was.
You know, just one year after
Jason returned from your school... my wife—
You see he resented us.
He blamed us for his condition.
So he would toy with our minds... projecting visions and scenarios into our brains.
Well, my wife, in the end—
She took a power drill to her left temple... in an attempt to bore the images out.
My boy, the great illusionist.
For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.
Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.
You arranged the attack on the president.
You didn't even have to read my mind.
You know, I've been working with mutants as long as you have, Xavier... but the most frustrating thing
I've learned... is that nobody really knows how many even exist... or how to find them— except you.
Unfortunately, this little potion won't work on you, will it?
You're much too powerful for that.
Instead, we'll go right to the source.
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.
The fluid secreted by his brain acts as a mind-controlling agent.
But that's only where it begins.
Jason.
Oh, my God, William.
This is your son.
What have you done to him? No, Charles!
My son is dead... just like the rest of you.
Mom? Dad? Ronny?
Is anybody home?
I'll try and find you some clothes.
Don't burn anything.
Hey. I found some of my mom's old clothes.
I think they're from before I was born.
Groovy.
Hello.
Come on, Jean.
Where are you?
These are my grandmother's.
Thanks.
You won't hurt me.
Wow.
I'm— I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Mmm.
Hey, Ronny. Next time you—
Who the hell are you?
Uh—
Bobby.
Honey, aren't you supposed to be at school?
Bobby, who is this guy?
- Uh, this is Professor Logan.
There's something I need to tell you.
You're clear.
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?
There's something different about you, Mr. Laurio.
Yeah. I was having a good day.
No. No, it's not that.
- Sit down.
- No.
Sit your ass down.
What could it be?
What are you doing?
Ahh. There it is.
Too much iron in your blood.
Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman... especially one who's interested in you.
So, uh... when did you first know you were a—
A-
A mutant?
Would you cut that out?
You have to understand,
We thought Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.
Bobby is gifted.
We know that. We just didn't realize he was—
We still love you, Bobby. It's just this mutant problem is a little—
- What mutant problem?
- Complicated.
What exactly are you a professor of, Mr. Logan?
Art.
Well, you should see what Bobby can do.
Bobby.
I can do a lot more than that.
Oh. Ronny!
This is all my fault.
Actually... they discovered that males are the ones who carry the mutant gene and pass it on... so it's his fault.
...the assassination attempt...
911. Please state your emergency.
I need the police. There are people in our house.
They won't let us leave.
Authorities refused to comment... but it's believed that a manhunt for several fugitives from the facility... is now underway.
Nobody's responding.
I can't get a signal.
Why don't you take a break?
I'll keep trying.
Right.
So, what are they?
They are angelic symbols... passed on to mankind by the Archangel Gabriel.
They're beautiful.
How many do you have?
One for every sin... so quite a few.
You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers?
Yes. At a school for people like us... where we can be safe.
Safe from what?
Everyone else.
You know, outside of the circus, most people were afraid of me.
But I didn't hate them.
I pitied them.
Do you know why?
Because most people will never know anything... beyond what they see with their own two eyes.
Well, I gave up on pity a long time ago.
Someone so beautiful should not be so angry.
Sometimes anger... can help you survive.
So can faith.
Storm, I found an active com device.
Where?
Oh, it's for me.
Bobby... have you tried not being a mutant?
No one's left, Jean.
Soldiers came.
What about the children? Some of them escaped. I'm not sure about the rest.
We haven't been able to reach the professor or Scott either.
Where are you, Logan? Boston, with Bobby Drake's family.
- Okay. We're on our way.
- And Storm? Make it fast.
We have to go now.
Why?
Now!
Logan, what's wrong?
Drop the knives and put your hands in the air.
What's going on here?
- Ronny.
I said drop the knives.
Open the door!
Break it.
Turn around.
- Up against the wall.
- Okay!
This is just a misunderstanding.
Put the knives down.
I can't.
Look.
Oh!
All right, the rest of you, on the ground now.
Look, kid,
I said on the ground.
We don't want to hurt you, kid.
You know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news?
I'm the worst one.
Look out!
Guten tag.
Who the hell is this?
Kurt Wagner.
But in the Munich circus, I was known as "the Incredible Night crawler"—
- Aw, save it. Storm?
We're outta here.
Whoa.
Jason, stop it!
It's all right.
You can come out.
Have they gone?
Yes.
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.
Well, then, we'll have to find them, won't we?
We'll use Cerebro.
Come on.
How far are we?
We're actually coming up on the mansion now.
I've got two signals approaching.
Coming in fast.
Unidentified aircraft, you are ordered to descend to 20,000 feet.
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air
Force base. You have 10 seconds to comply.
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.
We are coming up alongside you to escort you to Hanscom Air Force base.
Lower your altitude now.
Repeat, lower your altitude to 20,000 feet.
This is your last warning.
They're falling back.
They're marking us.
- What?
- They're gonna fire. Hang on!
I gotta shake 'em.
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.
Don't we have any weapons in this heap?
Warning, warning, warning.
Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning.
Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning.
Warning, warning, warning—
- Everybody okay back there?
- No.
Oh, my God.
There's two of 'em.
There's one more.
Jean—
Oh, God!
Rogue!
No!
- Jean?
- It's not me.
When will these people learn how to fly?
Thank you.
Bitte schön.
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.
His name is
Colonel William Stryker... and he invaded your mansion for one purpose:
He wanted Cerebro.
Or enough of it to build one of his own.
But that doesn't make any sense.
Stryker would need the professor to operate it.
Which I think is the only reason my old friend is still alive.
Oh, my God.
Now, what are you all so afraid of?
While Cerebro is working,
Charles' mind is connected... to every living person on the planet.
If he were forced to concentrate hard enough on a particular group— let's say, mutants, for example—
- he could kill us all.
- Wait a minute.
How would Stryker even know where to find Cerebro in the first place?
Because I told him.
I helped Charles build it, remember?
Mr. Stryker has powerful methods of persuasion.
Even against a mutant as strong as Charles.
So who's this Stryker anyway?
He's a military scientist.
He spent his whole life trying to solve the mutant problem.
If you want a more intimate perspective, why don't you ask Wolverine?
You don't remember, do you?
William Stryker, the only other man
I know who can manipulate adamantium.
The metal on your bones.
It carries his signature.
- But the professor-
- The professor trusted... you were smart enough to discover this on your own.
He gives you more credit than I do.
- Why do you need us?
- Mystique has discovered plans of a base... that Stryker's been operating out off or decades.
We know that's where he's building the second Cerebro... but we don't know where this base is... and I believe one of you might.
- The professor already tried.
- Once again, you think it's all about you.
Oh... hello.
I didn't mean to snoop.
Just try and relax.
I'm sorry.
Stryker's at Alkali Lake.
That's where the professor sent me. There's nothing left.
There's nothing left on the surface,
Logan. The base is underground.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
How we doing?
Not good.
It'll take four or five hours before
I can get it off the ground.
That's not what I meant.
I'm just worried about
Scott. I'm worried about you.
That was some display of power up there.
Obviously, it wasn't enough.
Hey, hey. Come on. All right?
I love him.
Do you?
Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan... they don't take him home.
They marry the good guy.
I could be the good guy.
Logan, the good guy sticks around.
Jean.
Please. Please.
Don't make me do this. Do what?
This.
Excuse me.
They say you can imitate anybody... even their voice.
Even their voice.
Then why not stay in disguise all the time?
You know, look like everyone else.
Because we shouldn't have to.
Look—
No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
What do you want, an apology?
You know what I want.
But what do you want?
What do you really want?
I want you to get out.
Jesus.
Why don't we get uniforms?
Yeah, where's ours?
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.
We love what you've done with your hair.
Hey, hey.
Come on. Let's go.
So, they say you're the bad guy.
Is that what they say?
That's a dorky-looking helmet. What's it for?
This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing that's gonna protect me... from the real bad guys.
- What's your name?
- John.
What's your real name,
John?
Pyro.
Quite a talent you have there, Pyro.
I can only manipulate the fire.
I can't create it.
You are a god among insects.
Never let anyone tell you different.
Sir, the machine has been completed to all specifications.
Good.
Ow!
If I may ask, sir, why are we keeping the children here?
I'm a scientist,
Sergeant Lyman.
When I build a machine, I wanna make sure that it's working.
All right, this is a topographic map of the dam.
This is the spillway.
You see these density changes in the terrain?
They're tire tracks.
That's the entrance.
Mm-hmm. And this shows the depth of the ice that's covering the ground.
Now, this is recent water activity.
If we go in there, Stryker could flood the spillway.
Can you teleport inside?
No. I have to be able to see where I'm going... otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.
I'll go. I have a hunch he'll want me alive.
Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs to be able to operate the spillway mechanism.
What do you intend to do?
Scratch it with your claws?
I'll take my chances.
But I won't.
Sir, there's someone coming down the spillway.
I'm flooding it.
Wait.
Stryker!
Stryker!
Well, look who's come home.
Move and you're dead.
The one thing I know better than anyone is my own work.
Seal the room. Shoot it.
Seal the room
Step away!
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.
Anybody?
What—
Can you override the spillway mechanism?
Everything's controlled from inside that room. That's why the doors are so thick.
Oh, really? Get some charges! Blow the doors open!
Take out these cameras!
I'm in.
She's good.
You have no idea.
Fire in the hole.
Move, move, move.
Sergeant, she's opened the spillway doors.
More mutants have entered the base. How many?
We've lost coms. There's some sort of electrical interference—
Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of your men and meet me outside Cerebro.
You carry on. When I come back,
I want this door open all the way!
Welcome, Professor.
- Don't leave me alone, please?
- You can come inside.
Have you found it?
A large portion of energy from the dam has been diverted to this chamber.
Cerebro.
There it is.
Can you shut it down from here? No.
Come. There's little time. Not without us.
Oh, my God.
The children.
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.
Where are they? They're being held in a containment cell one level down.
Stryker.
All right... we'll get the children and meet you at Cerebro.
Okay. I'll try to find Scott and the professor.
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.
Where's Logan?
He's gone.
You, set up a perimeter.
Move, move.
Jason.
It's time.
Time to find our friends.
Is it time to find our friends?
- All of them.
- All of them?
- All of the mutants.
- All the mutants?
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?
That's right.
Every one of them?
Oh, yes.
Good.
It's time to bring it to an end.
Make me proud.
Just don't move.
Kill anyone who approaches... even if it's me.
Go! I'll take care of him!
This is one lover's quarrel we cannot get involved in, my dear.
Scott!
Scott?
Help us! Anybody!
- Listen.
Help! Get us out of here.
- Julie?
- Storm.
Get us out of here!
Okay, we're coming.
Scott!
Scott, don't do this!
Jean, no, no, no.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's me.
Scott.
I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry. I could see you, but I couldn't stop myself.
I tried. I'm sorry. I love you so much.
I love you.
My leg.
Okay, easy. Easy.
Scott... something's wrong.
My God. No!
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?
I'm trying.
There are so many of them.
Then concentrate.
Concentrate.
The tricky thing about adamantium is... that if you ever manage to process... its raw, liquid form, you gotta keep it that way.
Keep it hot.
Because once the metal cools, it's indestructible.
But you already know that.
I used to think you were one of a kind, Wolverine.
I was wrong.
Holy shit.
That's it.
Whoa. Where do you think you're going?
I'm sick of this kid's table shit.
I'm going in there.
John, they told us to stay here.
You always do as you're told?
Find all the mutants.
Find them.
Find all the mutants. Find them all. Each one. All of them.
Good.
Kill them.
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.
Now, find them all.
Find all the mutants.
You, concentrate harder.
Kill them.
Kill them all.
Kill them.
Cerebro.
We're too late.
Eric, hurry!
That's strange.
How does it look from there, Charles?
Still fighting the good fight?
From here, it doesn't look like they're playing by your rules.
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.
There's been a change of plan.
Good-bye, Charles.
There's been a change of plans.
Now find them. Find them all— the humans.
Find all the humans.
Every one.
How does it feel, bub?
Why did you come back? You cut me open. You took my life!
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.
As I recall, it was you who volunteered for the procedure.
Who am I?
You... are just a failed experiment.
If you really knew about your past... what kind of person you were... the work we did together-
People don't change,
Wolverine.
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.
I just gave you claws.
What the hell is that?
What is it?
The dam's ruptured. It's gonna flood water into the spillway.
It's trying to relieve the pressure.
It's too late.
In a few minutes, we'll all be underwater.
Come with me, and I'll tell you everything you want to know.
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.
You're a survivor, always have been.
Oh, I thought I was just an animal... with claws.
If we die, you die.
Aaah!
There are no exits that way, Wolverine!
Find all the humans.
Every one. Find them.
Find all the humans.
Find them all.
- What is this?
- Cerebro.
Storm.
Jean. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine.
What's happening?
Professor's still in there... with another mutant.
He's trapped in some kind of illusion.
Oh, my God.
Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants anymore.
Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.
Impossible.
Everybody stand back.
Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro.
Opening the door could kill him and everyone his mind is linked to.
Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside.
- Storm, who is this guy? Who are you?
- My name is Kurt Wagner... but in the Munich circus—
He's a teleporter.
I told you, if I can't see where I'm going—
I have faith in you.
Don't believe anything you see in there.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, they will be done on Earth—
As it is in heaven.
Hello.
What are you looking for?
Professor, can you hear me?
- You've got to stop Cerebro now.
- Who are you talking to?
No. Don't move.
But she's just a little girl.
No, she's not.
I've got my eyes on you.
Mr. Stryker.
Funny, we keep running into each other.
Mark my words, it'll never happen again.
Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here.
I'm not going anywhere.
What are you doing?
Find all the humans. Kill them.
Every single one.
Find all the humans.
Focus. Focus.
Find all the humans.
Stop it!
Jason. He's going to be so angry at me.
Logan. Logan, where are you?
We have to get out through the spillway.
You don't want to go that way. Trust me.
Come on. There's another way out of here.
The helicopter was right here!
I will take him.
Okay.
It's okay, Rogue. It's okay.
You can let go, honey.
- Let go.
- Go. I'll be fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
Who has the answers,
Wolverine?
Those people?
That creature in your arms?
Huh?
I'll take my chances with him.
One day, someone will finish what I've started, Wolverine!
One day!
Scott, we've got to get to Washington.
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.
Bobby.
I got 'im.
You okay?
I am now.
- What's wrong?
- Vertical thrusters are off line.
So fix 'em.
I'm trying.
- Has anyone seen John?
- Pyro?
Where the hell is he?
He's with Magneto.
They're functioning, but I don't know how long they're going to last.
I'm trying to override.
It's not responding.
- Come on!
- Oh, no, we've lost the power.
There's power in the fuel cells, we're just not connecting.
Okay. I've—
Scott, the engine control system is shot.
- Which part?
- All of it.
Where's the override?
- It's gonna take some time.
Storm, we need some kind of external power.
- Jean?
- Wait. Where is Jean?
She's outside.
No, we're not leaving!
Lower the ramp!
Storm, lower it!
I can't.
She's controlling the jet.
You, get her, now!
She's not letting me.
Damn it!
I know what I'm doing.
- This is—
... the only way.
Jean, listen to me.
Don't do this.
Good-bye.
- Oh, no! No!
- No! No!
She's gone.
- She's gone.
- Don't you say that!
We gotta go back.
She's gone.
No! No.
She's gone.
She's gone. She's—
She's gone.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of the death...
I will fear no evil... for thou art with me.
Today I've been given an opportunity to shed light on recent occurrences... from the attack that ended in this office— Good morning.
Good morning— to the unexplained phenomenon that swept the Earth... nearly annihilating our way of life. Good morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning. Do we like this word "annihilating"?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Mr. President.
Thank you.
Mr. President, we're live in five, four, three, two—
My fellow Americans, in this time of adversity... we are being offered a moment... a moment to recognize a growing threat within our own population... and take a unique role in the shape of human events.
Did we just lose the feed?
Are we still live?
Good morning, Mr. President.
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.
- Who are you people?
- We're mutants.
My name is Charles Xavier.
Please, sit down.
- I'd rather stand.
- Rogue.
These files were taken from the private offices of William Stryker.
How did you get this?
Well, let's just say I know a little girl who can walk through walls.
I've never seen this information. I know.
Then you also know
I don't respond well to threats.
Mr. President, this is not a threat.
This is an opportunity.
There are forces in this world, both mutant and human alike... who believe that a war is coming.
You will see from those files that some have already tried to start one... and there have been casualties.
Losses on both sides.
Mr. President... what you were about to tell the world is true— this is a moment.
A moment to repeat the mistakes of the past... or to work together for a better future.
We're here to stay, Mr. President.
The next move is yours.
We'll be watching.
Mr. President.
You know... even when Jean was a student... she was always hesitant about her powers.
Always looking to others.
Feeling that in some way she was left behind.
Do you think—
Could we have done more to save her?
In the past, she may have let us.
There had to be another way.
Why did she leave the plane?
Because she made a choice.
Yes, come on in.
Hey, hey.
Listen, she did make a choice.
It was you.
Professor?
Is everything all right?
Yes, I think it will be.
Now, tell me, have any of you read a book... by an English novelist named T.H. White... called The Once and Future King?
No? Well—
Mutation.
It is the key to our evolution.
It is how we have evolved from a single-celled organism... into the dominant species on the planet.
This process is slow... normally taking thousands and thousands of years.
But every few hundred millennia... evolution leaps forward.
Montauk train on track "B."
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
Last call...
to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi. Cindy?
It's Joel. Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning,
I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished,
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see...
who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out! Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble?
Sure. Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah. I would have thought
I would've remembered you.
Jesus! Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right. Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red... Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah. I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
No?
I'm sorry. Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right? Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no. I just...
Sure. No. That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
Never mind.
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure
I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really... I'm... I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm. You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa! I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh. So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.
Ohh! Oh, my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here. Please.
Come on.
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um... Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh. Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?
I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...
Is that him?
I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
Patrick, stop it.
Ohh! Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Whew. Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.
Quiet.
Hey, Joel. What's up?
Oh. Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
Yes! Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick! Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
Hi.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.
Uh-huh.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off. It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right?
Right?
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning. Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
Sorry. Sorry.
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Oww! Fuck!
God, Rob! Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh... to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,
is to go home...
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts,
books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,
journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning,
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened...
a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello. I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink,
one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...
and I, uh, met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh. Sorry. Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.
- Here's another object.
- That's so...
Next item. Okay.
Potato head.
Next item. Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How's that?
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?
There we are,
Mr. Barish.
That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."
Whoa! Jesus!
What? What?
Come on! Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain. Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry. Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just... I was just...
I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.
Clem?
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...
Yeah.
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is... is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem! Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
Right.
Yeah.
Was. We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What? You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
They were clean!
What? D-Don't! Stop!
Okay. Yeah! All right!
We got work to do.
Give me my papers.
There's, um...
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of...
went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
It's not really that bad.
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
First thing to do is...
sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No! I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God... Mmm!
It's you, Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...
Oh. Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
Find us okay?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm? Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
Stan. Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
God!
Can you wake him up?
You can't wake him up.
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or...
love?
November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples...
you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No. No. Thank you.
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey, Tangerine.
Oh, Patrick, it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
Why? What's wrong?
I don't know.
Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something, sir?
Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
Do you think I'm ugly?
No! You're beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.
I don't know.
I- I'm a mess, Patrick.
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go. I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm! Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel. Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash... the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up! Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hello? Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited. Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What? thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow. What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It... It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight...
and I have these toys,
these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What? Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,
so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...
was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said. Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look! Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why... No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me...
everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look. Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,
baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey. What?
Clem!
Wait. Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah. Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
Don't! That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...
It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second,
but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what? I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You... You!
You know me. I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.
It's working!
I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm! He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay. Crap.
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh! Oh!
What? Oh! What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's... There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know. I'm so sorry.
That's okay. Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary... Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me! Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat? I just... Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy... he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really? Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You... You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay. All right.
Okay. Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool. Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings...
of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah. Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already... I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory,
see if something comes up.
I love being bathed in the sink.
Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is... this is not good. No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow. That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?
Hmm. Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know,
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh! Oh! What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel... What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc? Please.
All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!
I'm sorry, okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night, sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.
Look! Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere... somewhere really buried.
Hit it! Hit it!
I can't! I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on, you big sissy!
Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him! Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live... lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go. One, two, three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo... Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel? Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool. Look out! Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on. Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go. Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah! Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me! Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work,
Howard.
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah. Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant...
with a huge trunk like that.
Clem? Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.
I- I- I- I- I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's... You're a wonderful girl.
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.
You know
I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis. Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh, we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could... Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing. Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet. Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm. Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm. I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think
I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well...
and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah. Like that.
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female. Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches...
and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house... just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more... Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut,
but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed. I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.
Aah!
Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Just...
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh. Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now,
and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you. Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi. because she would pronounce...
library "libary."
Hi.
Libary. Libary.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine,
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite...
will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that...
it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair... it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her...
is to fuck 'em...
or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure...
that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,
only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for... just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Senators, consider the opportunities for the Empire.
At last, the destinies of the planets
Romulus and Remus will be united.
Shinzon of Remus is offering us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever before.
It would be madness to reject it.
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance.
By joining Shinzon's forces with ours, not even the Federation will be able to stand in our way...
That's enough!
The decision has been made.
The military does not dictate policy on Romulus.
The Senate has considered
Shinzon's proposal and rejected it.
He and his followers will be met with all deliberate force and sent back to that black rock they came from.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.
If you will excuse me, Praetor.
I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador.
Of course.
Senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
Then I call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II.
As you know, the Reman mines have not been filling their quotas for months now.
I hope that you will all bear in mind the trade committee's findings.
As much as we don't want...
Would someone alert security?
Bring back Senator Tal'Aura.
Duty.
A starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty.
I have commanded men in battle.
I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies.
I have represented the Federation in first contact with 27 alien species.
But none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man.
Now, I know on an occasion such as this, it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union.
But have the two of you considered what you are doing to me?
Of course you're happy, but what about my needs?
This is all a damned inconvenience.
While you're happily settling in on the Titan,
I will be training my new First Officer.
You all know him.
He's a tyrannical martinet who will never ever allow me to go on away missions.
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code, Section 12, Paragraph...
- Mr. Data.
- Sir?
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.
Fifteen years
I've been waiting to say that.
No, seriously.
Will, Deanna, there's still time to reconsider.
Yes?
- No.
- No.
No? Oh, very well, then.
Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for 15 years.
You have kept my course true and steady.
Deanna Troi, you've been my guide and my conscience.
You've helped me recognize the better parts of myself.
You are my family.
And in best maritime tradition,
I wish you both clear horizons.
My good friends, make it so.
The bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.
You ever think about getting married again?
No. Twenty-three was my limit.
Worf?
- Are you all right?
- Romulan ale should be illegal.
It is.
- That was a lovely toast.
- It was from the heart.
And you needn't worry.
I'm going to brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Oh, like hell you are.
You already know too much about me.
I take it that there will be no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed?
No. No speeches and no clothes.
Ladies and gentlemen and invited transgendered species, in my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites
I've discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift.
Given Commander Riker's affection for archaic musical forms,
I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation.
Conjugation!
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue skies
Smiling at me
Irving Berlin.
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see
It's tradition, Worf.
You, of all people, should appreciate that.
I will not do it.
Won't do what, Mr. Worf?
Captain, I do not think it is appropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear naked.
Oh, come now.
A big, handsome, strapping fellow like you? What can you be afraid of?
Captain, I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
- What sort of signature?
- Positronic.
It's very faint.
But I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
- What do we know about it?
- Uncharted.
We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize there is an android on Kolarus III.
Just what I was afraid of. Captain, diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
It's still well on our side. I think...
I think it's worth taking a look.
Don't worry, Number One.
We'll still have you to Betazed with plenty of time to spare.
Thank you, sir.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid tradition.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the gym.
Mr. Branson, lay in a course for the Kolarin system, warp 5.
What do you think, Data?
A long-lost relative?
I'm reading six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the planet's surface.
What do we know about the population of Kolarus III?
Isolated pockets of humanoids.
It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain, I wouldn't recommend using the transporter.
That ion storm doesn't look very neighborly.
It could head in our direction without much warning.
Understood.
- Data, Mr. Worf, you're with me.
- Captain, I don't have to remind you...
I appreciate your concern, Number One.
- But I've been itching to try the Argo.
- I'll bet.
Captain's prerogative.
There's no foreseeable danger.
And your wife would never forgive me if anything were to happen to you.
You have the Bridge, Mr. Troi.
I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.
Over that rise, sir. Half a kilometer.
The radiant electromagnetic field is interfering with my tricorder.
We are within a few meters of the signal.
Fan out. Let's search around.
- It appears to be a robotic arm.
- Very astute.
Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle.
This doesn't feel right.
The final signature is approximately
100 meters to the north, sir.
It's you.
The resemblance is striking.
- Fascinating.
- Fascinating.
To the vehicle.
I think it's time to try some unsafe velocities.
Why do you have a shiny head?
This is not the appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Because the Captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
- Why?
- Because...
Data!
Sorry, sir.
Have I said something wrong?
Data.
- That's negative 3, cos/bar standard.
- Valve transfer initiated.
You know, all things considered, Data,
I think you have nicer eyes.
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.
So what have we got, Geordi?
I'd say he has the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic development.
The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated.
I'd say he's a prototype.
Something Dr. Soong created prior to Data.
Do you have a name, sir?
I am B-4.
B-4?
Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end.
Can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
I do not know.
Do you remember anything of your life before you were on the planet?
No. Why does the tall man have a furry face?
Number One, keep me informed.
And, Geordi, reassemble him.
Aye, sir.
B-4, do you know who I am?
You are me.
No.
My name is Data.
I am your brother.
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication
- from Starfleet Command.
- Acknowledged.
Admiral Janeway, how good to see you again.
Jean-Luc. How would you like a trip to Romulus?
- With or without the rest of the fleet?
- A diplomatic mission.
We've been invited, believe it or not.
Seems there's been some kind of internal political shake-up.
The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
- New Praetor?
- Here's more. He's Reman.
Believe me, we don't understand it, either.
You're the closest ship.
So I want you to go and hear what he has to say.
Get the lay of the land.
If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Understood.
We're sending you all the intelligence we have.
But it's not much.
I don't need to tell you to watch your back, Jean-Luc.
Hardly.
The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans.
You seem to get all the easy assignments.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus. Warp 8.
- Aye-aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in.
- Romulus?
I'm afraid The Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One.
Engage.
As you can see, one side of Remus always faces the sun.
Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet.
Almost nothing is known of the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire.
But they also have a reputation for being formidable warriors.
In the Dominion War, Reman troops were used as assault forces in the most violent encounters.
Cannon fodder.
Yeah, but how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Coup d'état?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet.
They must have been behind Shinzon for him to have overthrown the Senate.
What have we learned about Shinzon?
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.
We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander.
He fought 12 major engagements in the war. All successful.
Beyond that, we know nothing.
Well, it seems as though we're truly sailing into the unknown.
Keep at it. Anything you can give me will be appreciated. Dismissed.
I still can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-4 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Yeah. But he would also have all of your memories as well.
- You feel comfortable with that?
- I feel nothing, Geordi.
It is my belief that with my memory engrams he'll be able to function as a more complete individual.
- An individual more like you, you mean?
- Yes.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you, Data.
Maybe he's supposed to be exactly the way he is.
That might be so.
But I believe he should have the opportunity to explore his potential.
Okay. We're done.
B-4, do you know where you are?
I am in a room with lights.
Can you remember our father?
- Our father?
- Yes. Dr. Soong.
No.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Captain... No.
Data, he's assimilating a lot of programming.
Remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
We just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
We really need to give him some time.
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?
- What?
- This.
That's a redundant memory port.
Maybe the provisional memory storage is in case his neural pathways overload.
Do you mind if I keep him here for a while?
Run a few diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
Data.
No. You must remain with Commander La Forge.
He is going to try to help you.
Captain's Log. Stardate 56844.9.
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates.
All our hails have gone unanswered.
We've been waiting for 17 hours.
- Counselor?
- They're out there, sir.
Captain, I recommend we raise shields.
Not yet, Mr. Worf.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocol, the Federation Council isn't sitting out here, we are.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation.
- We will wait.
- Captain.
- Raising shields.
- No.
- Captain.
- Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.
Fifty-two disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary shields.
She's a predator.
We are being hailed.
On-screen.
Enterprise, we are the Reman warbird, Scimitar.
- Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
- I am not Shinzon.
I am his viceroy.
We are sending transport coordinates.
- Not very chatty.
- Away team, Transporter Room 4.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness.
We are not comfortable in the light.
- Praetor Shinzon?
- Captain Picard.
Jean-Luc Picard.
I'd always imagined you a little taller.
Isn't that odd?
Now, you may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data.
- You are not as we imagined you.
- No?
You are human.
Why have you asked us to come here?
Praetor?
- I've never met a human woman before.
- I'm only half human.
Deanna Troi of Betazed.
Empathic and telepathic abilities.
Ship's counselor.
All this I knew.
But I never knew you were so beautiful.
You seem quite familiar with our personnel.
Oh, I am, Commander Riker.
May I touch your hair?
We came to Romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation,
I suggest you do it now.
Yes. I'm sorry, Captain.
There is so much we need to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain.
Tearing down the walls between us to recognize that we are one.
I'm talking of the thing that makes us the same.
Peace. We want peace.
Right now you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true, but you're also thinking that the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.
Am I right?
Yes.
Then, perhaps it's time to add some illumination to our discussion.
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.
When I was very young,
I was stricken with an odd disease.
I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.
Even the slightest whisper caused me agony.
No one could do anything about it.
Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had some experience of Terran illnesses.
And he diagnosed me with Shalaft's Syndrome.
Do you know of it, Captain?
Yes.
Then you know it's a very rare syndrome.
Genetic.
Apparently, all the male members of a family have it.
Eventually, I was treated and now
I can hear as well as you can, Captain.
I can see as well as you can.
I can feel everything you feel.
In fact,
I feel exactly what you feel.
Don't I, Jean-Luc?
Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus.
Just the two of us.
Or should I say, just the one of us?
I think you'll be wanting this.
Until tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.
Computer, return lighting to previous level.
There's no doubt, Captain.
Right down to your aggressive strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.
He's a clone.
They probably used a hair follicle or a skin cell.
- Why?
- I intend to find out, Number One.
Inform Starfleet of the situation.
I need to know where the hell he came from.
Counselor.
We supported you, Shinzon, when you assassinated the Senate.
You told us the timing was perfect for an attack on the Federation.
I don't understand why now you delay.
You don't have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here, what possible purpose could that serve?
- I have a purpose.
- Then, perhaps you'll enlighten us.
Silence, Romulan!
You really must learn patience,
Commander.
Spend 18 hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard and you'll soon understand patience.
Now go.
Commander Donatra.
Please remain.
There's a word I want you to consider.
Allegiance. It's something I demand from those who serve me.
- Do I serve you?
- Yes.
And, I think, faithfully.
Commander Suran, on the other hand, gives me pause.
Here's another word, Praetor.
Trust.
Do you trust me?
How far does that trust extend?
How deep does it go?
What must a commander do to prove herself faithful to you?
What must a woman do?
You are not a woman.
You are a Romulan.
Serve me faithfully and you will be rewarded.
Keep those lovely eyes on Commander Suran.
And at the first sign of treachery...
Dispose of him?
Then you will have proven yourself.
Now go.
And, Commander, if you ever touch me again,
I'll kill you.
The Romulans had somehow gained possession of your DNA and I had been created.
And when I was ready, they were going to replace you with me.
Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet.
- It was a bold plan.
- What happened?
As happens frequently on Romulus, a new government came to power.
They decided to abandon the plan.
They were afraid that I might be discovered and that it would lead to war.
Not quite the face you remember.
Not quite.
A lifetime of violence will do that.
They broke my nose, my jaw.
But so much is the same.
The eyes.
- Surely you recognize the eyes?
- Yes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
And yours are so confident.
So, I'm not as tall as you expected?
I had always hoped
I might hit two meters.
As had I.
How did you end up on Remus?
They sent me there to die.
How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
Not that it mattered as I was no longer part of their plans against the Federation.
In those terrible depths lived only the damned.
Together with the Reman slaves,
I was condemned to an existence of unceasing labor and starvation under the brutal heel of the Romulan guards.
Only the very strongest had any hope of survival.
I was only a child when they took me.
Then I didn't see the sun or the stars again for nearly 10 years.
The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me.
But one man took pity on me.
The man that became my viceroy.
He protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive.
And in that dark place where there was nothing of myself,
I found my Reman brothers.
They showed me the only true kindness
I've ever known.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
That is the single thought behind everything I have done.
From building the Scimitarat a secret base to assembling my army.
Finally, coming to Romulus in force.
I knew they would never give us our freedom. I would have to take it.
How many Romulans died for your freedom?
Too many.
But the point is that finally the Empire is realizing that there is a better way.
And that way is peace.
- You don't trust me.
- I have no reason to.
You have every reason.
If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people you'd be standing where I am.
And if you had lived my life you would understand my responsibility to the Federation.
I cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
All I have are my personal feelings.
I want to know what it means to be human.
The Remans have given me a future.
- But you can tell me about my past.
- I can tell you about my past.
- Were we Picards always warriors?
- I think of myself as an explorer.
Were we always explorers?
I was the first Picard to leave our solar system.
It caused quite a stir in the family.
But I'd spent my youth...
Looking up at the stars, dreaming about what was up there, about...
New worlds.
I'm trying to believe you, Shinzon.
If there is one ideal that the Federation holds most dear, it is that all men, all races, can be united.
What better example?
A Starfleet captain standing in the Romulan Senate.
Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship.
In time.
When that trust has been earned.
Captain, we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Source?
It's gonna take some time to figure that out, Captain.
The data stream was re-routed through sub-stations all over the ship.
- What programs were accessed?
- That's what I can't figure out.
It's mostly just basic stellar cartography.
Star charts, communications protocols, some uplinks from colony tracking stations.
It's not even restricted material.
Nevertheless, we must learn the source.
Keep me informed.
Captain, there's something else.
I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Look at this.
When the Scimitarde-cloaked, there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band. There.
You're not going to believe this.
It's thalaron.
I thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its biogenic properties.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.
I can't overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc.
A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I understand. Keep on it.
I want to know what he has and how we can neutralize any threat.
I need options.
This was a mistake.
We're wasting time.
My time.
And I shall spend it how I choose.
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.
We must act. Now.
We'll return to the Scimitar.
I was merely curious about him.
Come.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
- He was a bit cocky, as I recall.
- He was a damned fool.
Selfish. Ambitious.
Very much in need of seasoning.
He turned out all right.
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.
But this thalaron radiation just can't be explained away.
Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.
Is he very much the way you were?
Oh, yes.
- Data to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.
Captain,
Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access.
And I believe we have found a way to gain a tactical advantage.
On my way.
Will?
As ship's counselor,
I recommend you get some sleep.
Some honeymoon.
Come to bed.
Imzadi.
Imzadi.
He can never know you as I can.
He can never touch you as I can.
- This isn't real!
- Then feel my lips.
I'm with you, imzadi.
I'll always be with you now.
- This isn't real!
- Deanna, what's the matter?
- No!
- Deanna?
- Deanna!
- No!
The bond has been broken.
Find her again.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
It's accelerating.
You have no more time for games.
Have the doctors prepare.
Transport.
Begin the download.
Tea, hot.
Aside from slightly elevated levels of adrenalin and serotonin, you're perfectly normal.
Deanna, can you describe it?
It was...
It was a violation.
Shinzon's viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts.
I've become a liability.
I request to be relieved of my duties.
Permission denied.
If you can endure more of these assaults, I need you at my side.
Now more than ever.
The Enterprise is far from Federation space...
Worf, shields up!
Hello, Jean-Luc.
Why am I here?
Why have you done this?
I was lonely.
- What are you going to do?
- I need a sample of your blood.
What is it your Borg friends say?
"Resistance is futile."
Oh, yes, the android.
- The bait you couldn't refuse.
- All of this so you could capture me?
Don't be so vain.
After we found it, we had to make a few modifications.
An extra memory port, a hidden transponder.
I've now gained access to Starfleet's communications protocol.
I now know the exact location of your entire fleet.
- You may go.
- Where?
Out of my sight.
What is all this about?
It's about destiny, Picard.
- It's about a Reman outcast.
- You're not Reman!
And I'm not quite human. So what am I?
My life is meaningless as long as you're still alive.
What am I while you exist?
A shadow? An echo?
If your issues are with me, then deal with me.
This has nothing to do with my ship.
Nothing to do with the Federation.
But it does.
We will no longer bow before anyone as slaves.
Not the Romulans, and not your mighty Federation.
We are a race bred for war.
And conquest.
Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
- I'm incapable of such an act.
- You are me.
The same noble Picard blood runs through our veins.
Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am.
So look in the mirror. See yourself.
Consider that, Captain.
I can think of no greater torment for you.
Shinzon.
I'm a mirror for you as well.
Not for long, Captain.
I'm afraid you won't survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice.
His cloak is perfect.
No tachyon emissions, no residual antiprotons.
Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in.
Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner.
- About time, Mr. Data.
- My mission was a success, sir.
I've located the source of the radiation.
This entire ship is essentially a thalaron generator.
Its power relays lead to an activation matrix on the Bridge.
- It's a weapon.
- It would appear so.
What about the download?
Shinzon believes he has our communication protocols.
They will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
- Good work.
- Sir.
Geordi supplied me with a prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit.
I recommend you use this, sir, to return to the Enterprise.
- It'll only work for one of us.
- Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together.
It is time for the procedure.
Move, puny human animal.
A bit less florid, Data.
Kill him!
This way, sir.
There is a shuttlebay
94 meters from our current position.
- There it is, sir.
- Go!
Data!
It appears to have an encrypted security system.
Alacrity would be appreciated,
Commander!
Reman is a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots...
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that door open!
According to the ship's manifest, they're Scorpion-class attack fliers.
- Data, what do you imagine this is?
- Port thruster, sir.
Would you like me to drive, sir?
Data, can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Negative, sir.
They've erected a force field around the external portholes.
Well, then, only one way to go.
Do you think this is a wise course of action, sir?
We're about to find out, Data.
Power up the disruptors.
- Ready, Captain.
- Fire.
Tractor beam, now!
Worf, lock on transporters.
I have them, sir.
This has gone far enough.
I thought we'd discussed patience,
Commander.
Mine is wearing thin.
We supported you because you promised action.
And yet, you delay.
The Enterprise is immaterial.
It won't even make it out of the Neutral Zone.
And in two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair.
Does that satisfy you?
For the moment.
And when I return, you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect.
What's happening to his face?
Commander, a moment.
Are you truly prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?
He's not planning to defeat Earth.
He's planning its annihilation.
And his sins will mark us and our children for generations.
The more I studied his DNA, the more confusing it got.
Finally,
I could come to only one conclusion.
Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing.
He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly.
He was engineered to skip 30 years of his life.
But when the temporal sequencing wasn't activated, his cellular structure started breaking down.
He's dying.
Dying?
Can anything be done for him?
Nothing, except a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible DNA.
You.
- How long does he have?
- I can't say for sure.
But the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
Then he'll come for me.
Brother,
- I cannot move.
- No.
I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
- Because you are dangerous.
- Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
I know.
Do you know anything about
Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship?
No.
Can I move now?
No.
What are you doing?
- I must deactivate you.
- For how long?
Indefinitely.
How long is...
A long time, brother.
It's called a cascading biogenic pulse.
The unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limit.
Depending on its radiant intensity, it could encompass a ship or a planet.
He would only have built a weapon of such scope for one reason.
- He's going after Earth.
- How can you be certain?
I know how he thinks.
Destroy humanity, you cripple the Federation.
- The Romulans invade.
- No way of penetrating his cloak?
No.
So he could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they'd never know.
We do have one advantage, though.
He needs your blood to live.
- He might come after you first.
- I'm counting on it.
We've been ordered to Sector 10-45.
Our fleet has been diverted to meet us there.
- Strength in numbers.
- Yes, at least that's what we hope.
He must not be allowed to use that weapon.
All other concerns are secondary.
You understand me?
Yes, sir.
All hands, battle stations.
Initiate the force field.
Captain's Personal Log, supplemental.
We're heading toward Federation space at maximum warp.
The crew has responded with the dedication
I've come to expect of them.
Like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields,
I wait for the dawn.
How long?
A matter of hours.
We must begin the procedure now.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Seven minutes.
Data, what's our current position?
How soon until we reach the fleet?
At our current velocity, we will arrive at Sector 10-45 in approximately 40 minutes, sir.
"For now we see but through a glass, darkly."
- Sir?
- He said he is a mirror.
- Of you, sir?
- Yes.
I do not agree.
Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created a unique individual.
If I had lived his life, is it possible that
I would have rejected my humanity?
The B-4 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced.
But even if they were, he would not be me.
- How can you be sure?
- I aspire, sir, to be better than I am.
B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift, sir.
The projection will return when we have cleared it.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
The Rift affects all long-range...
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers.
Target weapons systems and shields.
I don't want the Enterprise destroyed.
Can you learn to see in the dark,
Captain?
Report.
He's firing from the cloak.
We can't get a lock.
He disabled our warp drive with his first shot.
We only have impulse, Captain.
Mr. Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation.
All banks on my mark.
Scan for shield impacts.
Stand by photon torpedoes.
Aye, sir.
Fire!
You're too slow, old man.
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Full axis rotation to port!
Fire all ventral phasers.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Get the shields online, Geordi.
Already on it.
Counselor Troi, report to the Bridge.
Captain, we are being hailed.
On-screen.
Captain Picard, will you join me in your Ready Room?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captain, so don't bother.
And you can't contact Starfleet.
It's just the two of us now, Jean-Luc.
As it should be.
- Why are you here?
- To accept your surrender.
I can clearly destroy you at any time.
Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain.
Look at me, Shinzon.
Your heart, your hands, your eyes are the same as mine.
The blood pumping within you, the raw material is the same.
We have the same potential.
- That's the past, Captain.
- It can be the future.
Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, there is something that has never been nurtured, the potential to make yourself a better man and that is what it is to be human.
To make yourself more than you are.
Oh, yes.
I know you.
There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Childish dreams, Captain.
Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.
I am what you see now.
I see more than that.
I see what you could be.
The man who is Shinzon of Remus and Jean-Luc Picard could never exterminate the population of an entire planet.
He's better than that.
He is what his life has made him.
And what will you do with that life?
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?
There is a better way.
It's too late.
Never. You still have a choice.
Make the right one now.
- I can't fight what I am.
- Yes, you can.
I'll show you my true nature.
Our nature.
And as Earth dies, remember:
I will always, forever be Shinzon of Remus.
And my voice shall echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory.
Two ships de-cloaking, sir. Romulan.
Captain.
Just when I thought this couldn't get any worse.
We are being hailed.
On-screen.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the warbird Valdore.
Might we be of assistance?
Assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security.
We regret you've become involved.
Commander, when this is over,
I owe you a drink.
Romulan ale, Captain. Let's get to work.
You heard the lady.
Let's go to work.
Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack with the Valdore Tactical Officer.
Triangulate all fire on any shield impacts.
Aye, sir.
Aft shields down to 40%.
Keep our bow on the Scimitar.
Auxiliary power to forward shields.
Aye, sir.
Target the flanking warbird.
All forward disruptor banks on my mark.
- Forward shields down to 10%.
- Bring us about.
Drop cloak on the aft port quadrant.
Prepare for full emergency stop.
- What?
- You heard me!
He's losing his cloak.
Stand by all forward disruptor banks.
She's almost on us.
Not yet.
- Praetor.
- Full stop. Fire!
Restore the aft cloak and bring us about.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait,
Captain.
- You have life support?
- For the moment.
- But we're dead in the water.
- Understood.
We're losing structural integrity on Decks 12 through 17, sections 4 through 10.
Emergency Force fields are holding.
Evacuate those decks.
Re-route field power to forward shields.
Captain,
I think I may have a way to find them.
Prepare for a lateral run, all starboard disruptors.
What is it?
What is it?
She's here.
He's resisting me.
No!
Remember me?
Now.
Fire at will.
Prepare a boarding party.
Bring me Picard.
You.
Get the cloak back!
Target all shield coordinates, Beta-3.
All disruptors fire!
Captain, we've lost ventral shielding on Deck 29!
Divert all power and compensate.
- Intruder alert.
- Number One.
- Let's go.
- Security detail to Deck 29.
The Romulans fought with honor.
Yes, they did, Mr. Worf.
Worf, cover me.
Medical teams to the Bridge.
Report.
We have exhausted our complement of photon torpedoes.
Phaser banks are down to 4%, sir.
What if we targeted all our phasers in a concentrated pattern?
The Scimitar shields are still at 70%.
It would make no difference, Captain.
What's he doing?
He wants to look me in the eye.
We've got him.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Geordi, divert all power to the engines.
Take it from life support, if you have to.
Give me everything you've got.
Ready, Captain.
We are being hailed, sir.
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.
- I hope you're still alive, Jean-Luc.
- Yes, I am.
Don't you think it's time to surrender?
Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Shinzon, I don't think I ever told you about my first Academy evaluation.
In particular,
I was thought to be extremely overconfident.
Captain, as much as I enjoy listening to you talk, I really think...
On my mark, Deanna.
All hands, brace for impact.
Engage.
Hard to port!
Divert all power to the engines.
Full reverse.
Reconfiguring now.
Computer, stand by auto-destruct sequence Omega.
Recognize voice pattern
Jean-Luc Picard.
Authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.
Auto-destruct is offline.
Disruptors are not functional, sir.
Deploy the weapon.
Kill everything on that ship, then set a course for Earth.
We must complete our mission.
Matrix initiated.
Sequencing procedure for thalaron radiation transfer activated.
Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean-Luc?
Thalaron intermix procedure initiated.
Deployment of targeting arms commencing.
How long until he can fire?
The targeting sequence should take about seven minutes, Captain.
When the targeting arms are fully deployed, the matrix on the Bridge will relay the thalaron radiation to the firing points at their tips.
No one on the Enterprise will survive.
- How can he? He'll kill you.
- It's not about me anymore.
- Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
- I don't think that the transport...
- That's an order, Commander.
- Sir, allow me to go.
- Data, this is something I have to do.
- Sir.
- Data.
- You have the Bridge, Commander.
Try and put some distance between you and the Scimitar.
- Now, Mr. La Forge.
- Aye, sir.
That's it. Transporters are down.
System is fused.
Counselor Troi, please assume command. Geordi, come with me.
Thalaron intermix level: 30%.
Four minutes to firing sequence.
Thalaron intermix level: 50%.
Three minutes to firing sequence.
Thalaron intermix level: 60%.
Two minutes to firing sequence.
Thalaron intermix level: 80%.
I'm glad we're together now.
Our destiny is complete.
One minute to firing sequence.
Thalaron intermix level completed.
30 seconds to firing sequence.
Goodbye.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Data?
Captain.
It's Data.
Captain, we're being hailed.
On-screen.
Open a channel.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore.
We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Thank you, Commander.
You've earned a friend in the Romulan Empire today, Captain.
I hope, the first of many.
Valdore out.
Geordi, prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals.
They don't know our procedures.
- Just open the doors.
- I'll take care of it, Captain.
You have the Bridge, Number One.
Thank you.
To absent friends.
To family.
First time I saw Data, he was leaning against a tree in the holodeck, trying to whistle.
Funniest thing I ever saw.
No matter what he did, he couldn't get the tune right.
What was that song?
Can't remember the song.
Come.
- Will.
- Permission to disembark, sir.
Granted.
So, where's the Titan off to?
The Neutral Zone.
We're heading up the new task force.
Apparently, the Romulans are interested in talking.
I can't think of a better man for the job.
If I may, just a word of advice about your first command?
Anything.
When your First Officer insists that you can't go on away missions...
Ignore him. I intend to.
Serving with you has been an honor.
The honor was mine, Captain.
I don't know if all this has made any sense.
But I wanted you to know what kind of man he was.
In his quest to be more like us, he helped us to see what it means to be human.
My...
My brother was not human.
No, he wasn't.
But his wonder, his curiosity about every facet of human nature allowed all of us to see the best parts of ourselves.
He evolved.
He embraced change because he always wanted to be better than he was.
I...
I do not understand.
Well, I hope someday you will.
Captain, the warp engines are ready to go online.
I'm on my way.
Please inform Commander La Forge.
We'll talk later.
Never saw the sun
Never saw the sun
Never saw the sun
Shining so bright
Shining so bright
Never saw things
"Going so right."
Going so right
You've sold us a bill of goods,
Gordon.
Promised new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer.
- We'll deliver everything we promised.
- I'm sorry, but the adventure is over.
We're exercising our option to liquidate...
...Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.
Jack, show these people how filthy rich we're gonna make them, please.
I don't think you understand what I just said.
Oh, I think I understand.
Jack.
Perrinia immortalis.
The Blood Orchid.
First described in 1892 by Houghton...
...the last person to see it until our team brought a sample from Borneo.
It lies dormant for seven years, then blooms for just six months.
Which means we just got lucky as hell, gentlemen.
Anyone here familiar with the Hayflick limit?
He proposed a cell could only replicate 56 times...
...before it died from a buildup of toxins.
According to him, it's the reason we die.
But what if we could transcend that limit?
That would be impossible.
Not according to our data.
Our research indicates the presence of a chemical in Perrinia immortalis...
...that can significantly prolong cellular life.
I can't support this.
Does that mean what I think it means?
Are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent...
...to the fountain of youth?
Exactly.
That'd be bigger than Viagra.
- Have you put this into human trials?
- We can't yet.
Our sample was degraded in the initial study.
We need more of the orchid.
See, and that's our only problem, gentlemen.
That orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks.
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get your asses down to Borneo.
Yes.
- Welcome to Borneo.
- Thanks.
- What's wrong with this picture?
- I don't know. Let me see, you're in it?
We don't have a boat, okay?
Your company had one responsibility:
Get a boat.
- And you've already screwed it up.
- Wait. Your girl chartered the boat.
Sam confirmed with the company.
They're waiting for your payment.
Hey. Hey, I've got something.
Payment cleared.
Really?
- Where's the boat?
- It's not coming.
All of the charter companies have shut down.
No one'll risk going upriver till after the rainy season.
- And when's that?
- Two, three weeks.
The orchid's only in bloom for one more week, tops.
There's a local captain named Jin-Soon.
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver, for the right price.
Are you sure this is the place?
They said the one with the red door.
I bet you somebody's playing
Russian roulette in there.
Maybe we'll get lucky and you'll get a turn.
Hey, why don't you two just get a room.
Come on, Sam.
Wait here.
Yeah, if you insist.
Hey! Hey!
Jin-Soon.
Jin-Soon?
Your Indonesian sucks.
- Stick to English.
- We heard you could take us upriver.
In rainy season?
Won't be cheap.
We can pay you 25,000.
- I'll have a talk with the captain.
- You're not the captain?
Jin-Soon!
These tourists need a boat.
I told them not in the rainy season.
- You're Jin-Soon?
- Local nickname.
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.
It's a pronunciation thing.
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.
Now, you want me to drive it, well...
...that'll cost you 50.
Fifty grand? Are you high?
You know what?
Don't answer that.
I'm not trusting him with the expedition.
Listen. Lady.
Let's cut the bullshit, please.
If one of the other charter companies could take you...
...you'd be on the river by now.
You only came to me because you're desperate.
Fifty grand's my price.
Take it...
...or leave it.
I've seen subway cars in better shape than this.
Yeah, she may be ugly...
...but she puts out.
- Shit!
- What took you so long?
Hey, you try getting a GPS locator, a Sat-Nav EchoStar...
...and a UV spectrometer past Indonesian customs.
- Complaining already.
- Yeah.
- You rather be back in the office?
- Hell, yeah.
I had courtside seats at the Garden on Saturday.
I was gonna sit right between
Spike and Woody.
Oh, man, is that our ride?!
Look at the bright side, Cole.
At least the weather's nice.
Ben Douglas, team doctor.
You must be Sam.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
Glad to have you aboard.
I'm gonna get you for this.
Oh, yeah. This could be fun.
You can forget about that, dog.
That's one car you ain't never gonna catch.
There's always a way.
- Your team's a little green, huh?
- My former grad students.
Best in their field.
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall:
You want the best young talent...
...recruit early.
Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.
I think I resent that.
You and the other gal can stay in here.
You live here.
The way you say that,
I can tell you're impressed.
All right.
If you need anything...
Well...
...if you need anything, you're shit out of luck.
Okay.
Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.
In the Selatan Basin.
- It took them three days to get upriver.
- Yeah.
That was before the rainy season.
These waterways could be dangerous now.
- You said you'd get us there safely.
- And I will.
But safe isn't always quick.
We'll work our way up one bend at a time.
If I don't like what I see, we change course.
Can't chart the fastest route before you begin.
Already have.
Check it. All right.
Now, we're uplinked in real time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.
Now, under ideal conditions...
...this is the fastest route.
But once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 10 years...
...and then extrapolate...
Bingo! It's Padrang to the Selatan Basin.
I'm a bad man.
We got less than a week to get to that orchid.
If you can't get the job done, give our money back...
...and we'll get somebody who can.
- I'll get you there.
God help me.
Something attacked me!
- Oh, my God!
- She said something attacked her.
No, no, no!
It's okay. It's okay.
What the hell'd you do?
You scared him.
I scared him?!
This is Kong.
Kong lives here.
You're guests.
Be nice.
Disgusting animal.
You okay now?
I'm fine. Just keep your hands off of me.
Oh, yeah. Well, it's gonna be tough, but I'll try.
No, no, the S-1 has to be on file before the week is out.
- That's the whole point.
- Hello?
- The S-1 needs to be on file before...
- Yes, we were able to get on the river.
That's the purpose. We need the comments from the SEC.
- Excuse me.
- It's the only place I can get reception.
- No, just get it done. Be ready to go...
- No, that's impossible...
- Hello? Hello? Damn!
- Hello? Bob? Damn it!
Try my phone.
Works just as good, but it's free.
Okay. Maybe you can use my special antenna to boost your reception.
We're dealing with a lithophytic vine, so we want to search any rock face.
Now, this ridge here seems a good bet.
Sam.
Come on, Sam. What do you say?
We're young. We're single.
We're in Borneo.
What do you got to lose?
Not satisfied, walk away.
No commitments.
"No commitments."
That's your pitch?
Did I say "No commitments"?
I meant marry me.
Am I gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
Yep.
So you were one of Jack's students?
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology.
Soon as I finished my dissertation, he hired me.
Well, that's one way to get a leg-up.
What's that supposed to mean?
I had a professor who wanted to hire me.
Of course, he wanted me to be his secretary.
Look, if I've done something to offend you...
No. No, dear, not at all.
Actually, I admire you.
Took me 10 years to get where I am.
Clearly, your generation has it figured out.
Man, this is good.
Where'd you learn to cook like this?
- Little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka.
- What were you doing there?
Doctors Without Borders.
It's my day job.
You guys expect to need a doctor?
Can't get the expedition bonded without one.
Well, you just think of me as a charming insurance policy.
Hey!
You've had your dinner.
Get out of here.
What'd I say?
There's not that much...
I'm not sleeping up there.
I ain't sleeping on the floor.
I ain't sleeping on no damn...
- Oh, shit. What was that?
- What the hell was that?
- Something's getting eaten.
- By what?
Everything gets eaten out here.
It's the jungle.
Kong.
Hey. You guys seen Kong?
No. Not since last night.
Where are you?
Kong?
We need those results by next month if we want the FDA off our backs.
Hello? Shit!
I can't hear you!
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
Can you hear me now?
- Can you hear me now?
- We can!
Can you hear me now?
- Gail! Oh, my God.
- Shit.
Stop the boat!
- I'll go.
- All right.
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?!
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!
Stroke, Gail, stroke. Come on.
- Watch your back.
- Hey, Gail! How's the water?
Drop the phone.
It's probably holding you back.
- All right.
- Stay calm.
- Stay calm.
- Use your phone for flotation.
All right, come on, Gail.
- You're almost there.
- It's just like a phone.
I got it.
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!
Come on! Come on!
- Get out!
- Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Come on! Come on!
- Gail, grab it.
- Look out!
- Watch out!
Oh, my God.
Get him, Bill! Get him, Bill!
Get him in the eye, man!
Bill?
Where'd he go?
- Where'd he go?!
- Bill!
I don't see him.
- Where's he gone?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, shit, you won.
- You're okay?
- I lost my phone.
Sorry to hear it.
That was either the bravest or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
It's a fine line.
- Good as new.
- Thanks.
To Gail...
...who knows it's better to eat than be eaten.
- To Gail.
- Yeah, yeah, baby.
Almost eaten just to find a flower.
- Hardly seems worth it.
- Oh, it's worth it.
I mean, think about it.
A pill that you take every day for the rest of your life.
Now, even if we charge, say, a dollar a pop...
...we're billionaires.
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- At $100 a bottle...
...I'll dive in that river and fight that croc myself.
So how many flowers does it take to save the world?
Figure 50 orchids will yield about an ounce of chemical.
You could have a football field full of those orchids...
...still doesn't mean you can get it through human trials.
She doesn't even believe in you.
Comes with the territory.
In research, you've got to go out on a limb.
And there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
Where the hell have you been?
- Damn that thing!
- Where you been, boy?
Calm down. Calm down.
- Poor guy.
- It's okay. It's all right.
Looks like he's seen a ghost.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
What if Gail's right?
I mean, cells in a petri dish are one thing.
- Human trials are another.
- She's wrong.
And when it goes to product...
...and you and I can cash in our stock options...
...we'll rub her face in it.
- Stock options.
I spoke to Mitchell.
We're each giving you half a point.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
You deserve it.
All this...
...wouldn't be possible without your work.
Jack.
Thought we decided against that.
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.
It would be fun, though.
I mean, here we are, traveling upriver...
...to the greatest discovery of our careers.
Now, if this orchid thing works out, then...
...who knows?
Is that why I'm here?
So you can give us one more try?
You're here because you're the best researcher I've got.
Am I interrupting something?
No. No, I was...
- I was just going to bed.
- Yeah.
Well, before you do that, we need to talk.
We got a problem.
See the water level?
In high water, the Mendranang gets rough.
We could turn around, try to find another course.
- But that would take at least two days.
- We don't have the time.
If the river becomes impassable, it'll take a lot longer.
And if we turn back, then we're definitely screwed.
We're gonna have to risk it.
What if I don't wanna risk it?
Do you have any idea what this flower means?
We're talking about the biggest medical discovery in history.
That does sound great, Jack.
But I was never any good at history.
You want me to risk the Mendranang...
...it'll cost you an extra 50 thousand.
Done.
Done?
You gotta ask the boss lady or something?
I'll pay it myself.
All right.
You got yourself a deal.
But if we hit trouble...
...your people do what I say, you got that?
You're the captain.
Research proposals?
Yeah. Research proposals.
You're not the only company we're in bed with.
We're the prettiest and most popular.
Like sleeping with the head cheerleader.
Not quite.
Come on, you know you love us.
I love your cash.
Then let me get a look at that file.
After this orchid thing goes bust, you'll be finished at Wexell-Hall.
Unless you got something else lined up.
You really wanna see us fail, don't you?
No.
I just think that you will.
I am a scientist, you know.
Scientist.
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?
I like science.
I just like money better.
I'll drink to that.
River's flooded.
We can't see the banks.
Miss our turnoff?
It's just ahead.
What the hell was that?
- Rudder's jammed.
- What?
Watch out.
Shit!
Get up! Everybody up!
Hey.
What's going on?
Goddamn it.
Shit! We've blown the head gasket.
Are we all right?
Hey, what's going on?
- What is it?
- We got problems.
- What's wrong, man?
- Bill, wait.
What are you talking about?
What problems?
Son of a bitch.
The current's too strong.
- We missed our turnoff.
- I know. Come on, baby.
Come on, man.
- What is it?
- What is it?
What do you see?
Come on.
You got this. Come on, girl.
- Everybody! Hang on!
- Hang on to what?!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Holy shit.
It's sinking, it's sinking!
- Where's Cole?
- Swim to the rocks, this way.
Keep going.
- Come on, get to the rocks.
- Get to the rocks.
- Where's Cole? Cole!
- Over there.
Over there! Over there!
Come on, man. Give me your hand!
Come on.
You got it, Sam. Come on.
Give me your hand.
I've got you, I've got you.
Give me your hand, give me your hand.
Okay, I got her.
You almost got us killed!
You almost got us killed!
You think I wanted this?
I just lost my damn boat!
You'll lose your pay if you don't get us out.
You said you'd get us there safely.
You should've turned around.
That's enough!
There's nothing we can do about that now.
It's a waste of energy.
What have we got?
Some specimen jars, a map, a little water, no food.
Hard drive's ruined.
Well, pretty much all the equipment's shot.
Except one of the SAT phones still works. It's on-line.
Thank God, we can call the police.
Police. The nearest river patrol is back in Padrang.
The only way to get to us is over that.
Are you saying we're stuck here?
Maybe not.
We're here.
The valley's completely flooded.
But I got a friend who operates a boat on the Tokut River.
I can give him a call, and he can meet us here at Naga Rock.
How far is that?
I don't know.
A two-day hike down the river.
But if we bushwhack, we cut at least a day off the trek.
Oh, my God.
You wanna go through that?
It's the shortest way.
We could be safely in the Tokut by nightfall.
So we can continue with the expedition.
- Yeah. I'll get you to the flower.
- I don't care about that flower...
...just get us to safety.
- It's the same thing.
We can either be on my buddy's boat in 10 hours, or we can sit here...
...and wait for the river patrol for days.
Your friend. Is he reliable?
Absolutely.
You better not screw me on this.
Sounds like you're already screwed, mate.
Pay you two grand.
I need you on this one, John.
Yes, yes, so it seems.
Look, Billy, I'd love to help you out, but I'm flat out, mate, you know.
Probably squeeze you in for, say, 5 grand?
You're killing me.
That's mates rates.
Or you could always...
...hike back to Padrang if you wanna save bucks.
- Up to you, pal.
- Fine. Five.
- Yes!
- But you better be there.
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife about that little trip to Bangkok.
Wife's long gone, Billy.
Long gone, mate.
All right, people, we're on.
Saddle up.
Stay together. This jungle is all green all the time, and you will get lost.
It's like doing a StairMaster in a sauna.
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke, but I'll have a nice tight ass.
That's the spirit, Cole.
- You want me to grab that?
- Is that a trick question?
Here, man.
Right between Spike and Woody.
Right between Spike and Woody.
You okay, Sam?
I'm fine.
See, a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders.
Yeah. Can see that.
What, that?
That's nothing.
I tricked him into taking my bag.
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your boat.
Yeah, well...
...it was a piece of shit anyway.
Can we go around?
Yeah, we could.
But we'd lose another day.
Let's go.
Shit.
Hey. Knock it off.
- Shit! What was that?
- What was what?
- Something just moved.
- Please don't say that.
I'm serious. Something moved.
"Something just moved" as in something's alive?
Shit! There it is again.
There's something in here!
There's probably a million things in here.
He's right. Just keep moving.
Stop it.
I swear to God, if you don't stop it...
Very funny.
Ben?
- Where'd he go?
- Shit!
Help me!
Run!
- What the hell was that thing?!
- Anaconda.
- Oh, great!
- There's snakes out here that big?
- Yes, but...
- But what? It swallowed him whole!
Calm down and listen for a second.
I can explain...
No, you calm down and listen!
Ben was eaten by a freaking snake.
- Okay? A freaking snake!
- Cole.
- Oh, God. Oh, my God. I mean...
- Cole.
Oh, my God, did you see that thing?
We don't got a chance against that!
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell.
Listen to me, man.
I watch the Discovery Channel.
I'm telling you, we got no chance!
We're like mice in an aquarium.
You understand?
I mean, we're gonna die, girl.
We're gonna die!
Cole, calm down. Okay?
- Okay?
- All right, Jack, I'm okay.
Okay. I'll just...
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna sit right here.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.
There won't be another one for miles.
We gotta get to the boat.
It's not that far.
So if we keep moving and stick together...
...we should be fine.
- We should be?!
How big do they get?
That was the biggest one I've ever seen by far. A freak of nature.
The odds of running into another that size are astronomical.
Yeah, but how do we know the one that got Ben...
...is not gonna come after us?
It takes them weeks to digest.
Meal like that, he'll be sleeping it off for a while.
Let's just get to that boat and get home.
What about the orchid?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It won't bloom for another seven years.
- This expedition is over, Jack.
- Now, hold on a second, Gail.
- There's a lot of money at stake here.
- I don't care. Ben is dead!
We have lost someone.
As Wexell-Hall's representative,
I am calling this expedition off.
- You don't have the authority.
- Check your contract.
We're in the middle of the jungle.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Jack, I'm with her.
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.
Look. Ben was my friend, okay?
I got him into this, and no one feels worse about it than I do.
I don't wanna do anything stupid.
I just wanna accomplish what we came here for.
If we turn back now,
Ben's death would be for nothing.
Let's just get back to the boat.
We can regroup and make our decision then.
Fine.
Jack.
- Maybe Gail's right.
- She's just scared.
Once we get back to the boat, she'll be okay.
When we get back to the boat, this expedition is over.
I'm taking these people to safety.
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.
Keep your money, doc.
Someone is dead.
We're officially in over our heads.
You said we wouldn't run into another one of them.
And we probably won't, but I can't guarantee it.
So I'll get you to the boat...
...and after that we're done.
Well, that answers it.
That answers nothing. I'll just throw more money at him at the boat.
If he doesn't take it,
I'll offer his friend the same deal.
- Jack. Maybe we should listen...
- lf we don't get to that orchid now...
...all of our work will have been for nothing.
I need your support, okay? You have as much riding on this as I do.
Don't let me down.
I saw this special on Animal Planet.
Anacondas are vicious.
They hunt for sport.
Don't even need to see you.
Just use their tongues to sense body heat...
Shut the hell up.
I knew this guy who knew this guy who shot documentaries.
He went to the Amazon with this crew, and they were all eaten by snakes.
Come on, you knew a guy who knew a guy, that's an urban myth.
I'm sorry about Ben.
I never should've stayed on the Mendranang.
What do you mean?
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others, but I thought you knew.
Knew what?
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river.
I told him it might get rough, but he wanted to risk it.
Hey. Don't blame him.
It was my call.
I took the money.
I thought I could get us through.
You wanna blame anyone?
You blame me.
These boots are killing me.
- Cole.
- What?
You got some...
Oh, God, what is that?!
Get it off! Get it off!
- Oh, my God! Take it off!
- Relax.
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on.
- Get it off me!
- Hey! Calm down!
- Get this off me!
- Calm down!
Cole! Cole! Calm down.
What is it? What is it?
- Get it off me. Get it off.
- All right. Look.
- Just a lighter. Just a lighter.
- Oh, hell no! You ain't burning me!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You burn me, I'll kill you.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- What?
- Hold on. Put your arms up.
What are you doing?
Why are you going under my shirt?
- What are you doing?
- Jesus.
What, what? What is it?
What is it? What is it?
Anybody got a blowtorch?
Stop!
Careful.
- What's it...?
- Lf that thing bit you...
...you would be lumpuh.
Paralyzed, like stone, for two days.
- What do you call this fella?
- Laba laba batu. Stone spider.
I may have discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.
Oh, no, no, no. Forget Wexell, we can get this to the highest bidder.
All right. Show and tell's over.
We gotta get to that boat.
Put your boots on and let's go.
Bugger it.
What the hell was that?
Holy bloody hell.
Whoa! What was that?
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
No, no, no! Oh, come on, man!
What the hell happened?!
Livingston!
Here we go.
He got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!
Your friend! Your friend!
Now what we gonna do now?!
Shit!
Search the wreckage.
Find anything we can use.
And hope to God there's a phone.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
- Come on, come on!
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?!
Hello? Shit.
Hello?
Come on, man. Hello?
All right, keep looking!
No phone?
- Nothing.
- Couldn't get a signal on the radio.
Now what?
What's going on?
Where'd these come from?
- Lopaks.
- Who?
Local tribe.
- Descended from headhunters.
- What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
- Headhunters?
- There's still some villages here.
- Must be one of their fishing spots.
- Hold on, excuse me.
Did you say headhunters?
There haven't been practicing headhunters in Borneo for a century.
Just because they ain't practicing don't mean they don't remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village, maybe they can lend us a boat.
So wait a minute. We just gonna walk towards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.
You mention food one more time...
...I'm voting you off this island.
Oh, God.
- Is that...?
- Livingston.
Oh, my God, man.
What the hell happened to him?
Anaconda.
If he was eaten by the snake...
...why is his body...?
- Listen, listen!
All right. These things are at their weakest when they digest.
But if threatened, they will spit up their food and attack again.
What? There's a snake out there with an empty stomach?
- Yeah.
- The same one that got Ben?
No. No. There's no way that snake could've gotten to Livingston.
- It had to be another one.
- You said there wouldn't be...
...another one for miles.
- There wouldn't.
- Unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless it's mating season.
- Oh, my God.
- Mating season?
- Yeah.
You see, the males are territorial, but when they smell a female in heat...
...they come running from everywhere.
Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit, and they all go after her at once...
...in one big mating ball.
So there's some snake orgy out in the jungle?!
Yeah. Something like that.
Look, we're losing the light.
All we gotta do is get to that village.
So please, pay attention.
Do not stray from the group.
Let's go.
Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.
Jesus.
I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen.
It was.
- Well, this one's...
- Bigger.
The males must've come through here looking for the female.
Some bullshit.
- They took their boats.
- Good for them.
Bad for us.
Which one's the Mendranang?
On the right.
The Tokut keeps going to the left.
- Fastest way to Kotabaru.
- How long?
You'll be soaking in a tub at the Four Seasons in two days.
How, man?
We don't even have a boat.
We're gonna build one.
Man, do that in my neighborhood, and that's your ass.
Shit.
Sam.
What does this look like to you?
My God.
Perrinia immortalis.
Now we know why these snakes are so big.
What?
Anacondas keep growing till they die, right?
And these are the biggest
Bill's ever seen.
- Because they're living longer.
- Exactly.
Because Perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain.
These snakes have transcended the Hayflick limit.
The chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted.
And not in theory, in the real world.
This is proof, Sam, of your research, carved in stone.
This is proof?
It's anecdotal evidence at best.
- Let's get to the orchid and find out.
- You are out of your mind.
Do you have any idea how close we are?
The orchid was found here...
...on the Mendranang, just around the next bend.
- We'll be going right past it.
- No, we won't.
We are going down the Tokut.
If we go down the Mendranang, it's gonna be a week...
...before we reach another village.
I'm not waiting that long for my bath.
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.
Jack.
Maybe you can just come back.
Come back?
In seven years?
What if it's not here?
What if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin?
Instead of the fountain of youth, we'll have a giant rice paddy.
This is our only chance.
You know it is.
Do you wanna give in when we're this close?
Look. You know
I got your back, right?
We've been in the trenches a hundred times together.
- But I'm not going in that jungle.
- Damn straight, man.
Thank you.
This is my expedition, and we're going to the orchid.
No.
We're not.
Don't be an idiot, Sam.
This is bigger than penicillin, for God's sake.
Lives will be saved by this drug.
People will live longer.
They'll stay young longer.
If we don't put this to human trials, it'll be a crime against humanity.
Two people have died already.
Scientists have always risked their lives to change the world.
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.
- We all knew the risks.
- We thought we did.
Until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs.
- What are you talking about?
- He offered Bill an extra 50 grand...
...to keep going, even though he knew it wasn't safe.
Oh, my God.
Is that true, Jack?
- I was thinking of the expedition.
- You were thinking of your career.
Look. You're my assistant.
I don't need to consult you!
I'm the one with the authority here.
We're in the middle of the jungle, Jack.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.
Thank you.
Okay. Keep it high.
Careful.
Center it right here.
All right.
What are you doing?
Never seen a man shave before?
Probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator.
Crocodile.
What's that mean?
That means "a new beginning."
It's Korean.
I got it when I was in the military.
What brought you here?
- Long story.
- Where am I gonna go?
All right.
Here's the deal.
I was in the Special Forces...
...and I saw and did things...
...that I wanted to forget.
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?
It's not very long, as stories go.
Yeah.
Well, I got out of the military...
...came here and bought the Bloody Mary.
Just wanted to start a new life.
Thank you, Jack.
On three.
Ready? One, two, three.
It works.
All right.
Let me explain.
Why in the hell didn't you tell me about this?
The minute someone makes a call...
...this expedition's over.
Exactly.
All I'm asking for is a few more hours.
We continue on the Mendranang...
...take our orchid samples, then we call for help.
Forget about it, Jack.
I'm getting us out of here.
Think about this, Gordon.
You're about to become a billionaire.
Do you really want to give all that up?
I don't care about the money, all right?
I wanna live.
It bit me.
Jack, what are you...?
What are you...?
Help.
Help.
Help me.
Where's Mitchell?
Resting his feet.
- Should I go get him?
- No, no.
- Let him rest till we get loaded.
- Okay.
Those blisters are pretty nasty.
Mitchell...
...you okay?
Mitchell?
What is it?
Tell me.
What did you do to him, Jack?
- What is it?
- Something's wrong with Mitchell.
- What are you talking about?
- You were alone with him.
What did you do?
He was resting his feet.
I didn't do anything.
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Gail, no! Let's go!
Get out! Get out! Go!
Come on! Come on!
Move! Move! Move! Go!
The raft!
No! You son of a bitch!
We can build another one.
With what?!
With what, Sam?!
We gotta get to the raft.
- It's our only way out of here.
- FYI, Bill, the raft is gone!
- We can get it back.
- How?!
How? We gonna swim after it now?
Look...
...the village is here.
Jack is following the Mendranang.
We cut across the jungle.
- We can catch him on the other side.
- Right.
- Catch him where?
- He's going to that orchid.
We find that flower...
...we find that raft.
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.
Listen, something terrible has happened.
We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We went over a waterfall.
I haven't seen anyone since.
I am...
I think I'm the only one left.
Wait, wait. Listen.
Oh, shit. Come on!
It's in front of us.
Son of a bitch.
It's trying to separate us.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, Christ, it's everywhere.
- Turn that goddamn thing off.
- They can see it.
- Doesn't matter.
- They can sense our body heat.
- He's right.
Let's just get the hell out of here.
- Which way?
- Hold on.
Any way.
- Let's go, Cole!
- Okay, okay!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
Hold on, wait for me!
Oh, my God.
If there's a way in, there's a way out.
Oh, shit!
- Guys?!
- Cole!
Which way?!
Over here!
- All right, say it again! Say it again!
- Cole! Over here!
Over here, Cole!
- Hello!
- This way, Cole!
- Guys!
- Cole!
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
God, come on!
Cole!
Oh, no, no!
Stay together.
Okay. I promise.
Now can we please go?
- Let's go.
- No problem. Okay, okay.
Which way?
- I don't know.
- What?
What do you mean, you don't know?
I found you, didn't I?
Tran?
Tran!
Tran!
Say something!
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!
I can see light.
- Is there a way out?
- I don't know.
Cole!
Tran!
Can you hear me?
Cole!
Where are you?
I think I found a way out.
Take this. Go. Now.
- Where are they?
- Go.
Oh, my God.
Go.
- Help!
- Cole?
- Cole?
- Hey, right here!
Almost there.
Holy shit!
Move! It's coming up my ass!
Help me! What did I do?!
Where's Cole?
- Cole, come on!
- Cole! Come on!
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, God! I'm stuck!
- Give me your...
- I'm stuck! Pull me!
- Give me your arm!
- Hurry up! Come on!
Oh, my God! It's coming!
Let's go! Pull!
Pull!
That's what I'm talking about, Sam!
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam!
You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!
How you like her now, bitch?!
She sliced you, diced you, cut you up!
Sam with the samurai action!
Hell, no.
Cole!
Get up, Cole. Get up, man.
Wake up, man.
Come on, man. Wake up.
No, no, no.
Cole. He's not breathing!
- He's got a pulse.
- Give him air!
Okay.
Again, again!
Come on, wake up!
Don't you die!
Don't die. Come on, no.
What the fuck?! Get it off me!
- No, no. It's okay! It's okay!
- Hey, it's okay.
It's me. Stay down.
- You're okay.
- I'm okay?
- Yeah.
- You're okay.
Perrinia immortalis.
- Son of a bitch finally got his orchid.
- Yeah. He can have them.
All I care about is that raft.
Let's go.
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I think I know what happened to Mitchell.
I can't let you take that.
You guys look like hell.
- You don't know what hell is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But you gave me no choice.
- Did you give Mitchell one...
...before you killed him?
- I didn't kill Mitchell.
No...
...you just let him die.
I saw the spider bite on his arm.
What was I supposed to do, Sam?
- The right thing?
- It's always a good place to start.
Let's not be stupid about this.
Let's get to the flower, we can all go home.
The mating ball.
Give me the flare.
Tie him up.
Now!
- Fill it up.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
Do I look like I'm kidding?!
Fill it up!
Get up!
- Now get the flowers.
- Okay.
Throw me the pack.
Drop the gun!
Throw me the pack.
Get up, Bill! Get up!
Come on, man!
Get up!
Get up!
- Sam, come on!
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on, girl! Hurry up!
- Come on!
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up, Sam!
- Come on, baby!
- You got it, honey, come on!
Shit!
- Come on, baby.
- You got it!
- You got it, honey!
- Almost there! Come on!
- Spider...
- Reach for me!
Come on, Sam, please!
Just reach! Reach!
Give me your hand.
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!
No! No! No!
No!
Oh, God!
Come on, Sam! Come on!
- Keep coming!
- Come on!
Climb up that wall, Sam!
Keep coming.
Come on, girl!
- Come on!
- Come on. I got you!
Come on, Sam, get back!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Hey!
Over here, bitch!
Holy shit.
Nice shot.
What can I say?
I'm a bad man.
You two look like you made up.
He's not so bad.
How's that?
Much better.
I think I'll live.
Good.
It's kind of nice having you around.
- So how much further to my bath?
- Kotabaru?
I'd say...
...another day downriver.
- Another day?
- I'm not rowing another day, homeboy.
- All right.
Let's see, we got this shortcut right up...
No!
Carl's Jr. has this $6 burger, which really only costs $3.95... so you think you're getting some deal... but the truth is, it may be the best franchise burger out there.
I went there yesterday and ordered three.
By golly, those suckers almost filled me up.
When I got home, I still had to have a box of Eggos... but that doesn't take away from Carl's achievement.
I mean, here's a guy who's got to go...
- ...through life as Carl Junior, right?
- Barry?
Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.
Do you think this compulsive eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother?
That you're eating yourself to death as punishment?
- You do think you killed her, right?
- I never said that.
She called out to you from that big, fancy oak bed.
- She said she was having chest pain.
- I never told you any of that!
- How could you know this?
- She begged you to dial 911.
But she was always calling out for you, wasn't she, Barry?
You weren't there. How could you know what happened? How?
- Doesn't matter. Stop blaming yourself.
- Doesn't matter.
If you don't, you'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason.
You're looking in my head! Stop it!
- Don't look in there.
- You don't have to do it, Barry.
Leave me alone!
It wasn't your fault.
Jonesy?
Ah!
Hey, how are you doing, Henry?
What's that you say?
Are you going deaf?
How are you doing?
You know. SSDD.
Well, yeah, of course.
Hey, I was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see Duddits.
Yeah, absolutely. He's been on my mind a lot too.
It's been a long time.
Yeah. It's open!
I gotta go. I got a thing here.
I'll see you Saturday.
Yeah, right.
See you Saturday.
So, Mr. Defuniak... do you know we're both escapees from Maine?
You're from Pittsfield.
Know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams?
You had the flu that day, didn't you,
David? You didn't take the exam?
You missed the test. And since you were ill, why not write me an essay instead?
3000 words on the short-term results of the Norman Conquest.
- Go get started.
- Yes, sir.
Better to be from Pittsfield than go back to it.
Thank you, sir.
How did you know?
You weren't even there that day.
Sometimes I just know.
Hello.
This probably won't work.
Never start like that with a car salesman.
We love challenges. Pete Moore.
In one hour I'm showing a house in
Fryeburg. It's a big commission.
And I just lost my damn car keys.
Could you possibly make me duplicates?
- That takes at least a day.
- Oh, boy, I just knew it!
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help.
I'm always good at finding things.
- Did I say my name? I don't remember...
- I guessed.
Now, let's find those keys.
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey, Pete.
- I looked again. I couldn't find them.
- Okay. I need your help.
You had the coffee in your hand, bought aspirin... went to your car, realized the keys were gone.
- That everything?
- Yes.
Look. This is gonna seem weird, but it's just a thing I do to help me think.
You bought a candy bar before the aspirin.
Mars bar.
Yours, right?
One more question. If I find your keys, will you let me buy you dinner?
West Wharf? 6:30?
Best fried clams in the state?
It's right on your way back.
Sure. Okay.
- That'd be nice.
- All right.
So you got here.
You opened your purse.
Coffee, candy and aspirin, you're juggling it all around.
And that's when... you dropped your keys.
It's just luck, is all.
Thank you.
- West Wharf, right? Half past six?
- You got it.
Another fuckarow.
- Jones.
- How are you doing?
- Hey, Beaver. Same shit, different day.
- Same shit, different day.
- Wanna talk?
- No, you're trying to get home.
- What's up?
- Really, I got nothing. Go home.
- Wait, Jonesy?
- Yeah, Beav?
- You be careful.
- Be careful of what?
Wish I knew.
Oh, my gosh. He's right there. Yeah.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Right. Sorry.
Hey!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, look!
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- It won't do any good.
I looked away for one second. Then
I heard a thump. What happened?
- Careful, careful.
- Back up, back up.
- Seriously....
- My God! Professor Jones!
I just saw him. He can't die!
Is he dead?
I didn't see it. Why did he run out?
Clear!
No good. Flatline. Hit it again!
Clear!
- What do you think?
- I think it's no good. I think he's gone.
Watch out for Ister Gay.
Out of my way.
Jonesy, don't try to lift that stuff.
- Just go up to the cabin.
- Here, here, look. Big jacket.
- Beaver, I'm going in!
- I'll see you in a second!
Watch the beer.
- Got blown last night.
- Good for you.
- First time?
- Bite my bag.
Met some lady at bingo, went back to her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.
- As opposed to a fuckarow.
- Obviously.
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash.
- Try Viagra.
- Viagra?
I'm practically at full salute all day.
I'm.... What do you call it? Privatic?
Prag... Prasmatic? Henry will know.
- You're thinking of fourth grade.
- You're having wood problems?
- You haven't tried it, have you?
- Hell, no!
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.
Twelve hours?
I'm talking Yastrzemski. You don't have to need it to love it.
Bingo? Did you say bingo, like the game in church basements?
- There's trim there.
- Beaver!
I thought my deal was pathetic.
- Ah!
- You just watch. That's your job.
- I'm fine.
- Uh-huh.
H, you been thinking about
Duddits more than usual?
Uh-huh.
Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend?
- I remember.
- Then I got hit.
I gotta tell you something weird.
The night I got hit, I was standing there and across the street, I saw Duddits.
Just like he was that day we first saw him back in Derry.
He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him.
Then he looked over at me.
He looked directly at me.
And he motioned for me to come to him.
You believe I saw him, don't you?
Yes, sir, I do.
Duddits loves me, I know that.
He loves us all.
He would die before he'd ever hurt us.
So why was he calling me into the street to get hit?
Maybe there's more to the story we don't get yet.
- You don't know shit.
- Name it!
I'll name it after we come up with a small wager.
- 50 bucks.
- What's the subject?
In the movies, when people wake up together... they immediately start kissing and going at it.
But they never get up first, take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth.
Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up.
What's it called when you got a constant woody?
- You mean priapism.
- See? I'm practically priasmic.
Priapismic.
- Whatever! It's hard.
- That's what you're betting on?
I can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.
- I'll give you a quarter.
- A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.
- Promised Land.
- Promised Land? Never heard of it.
Meg Ryan and what's his name?
Reefer Sutherland.
- Kiefer.
- From, I don't know, 1988 or something?
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning and says, "Where's the cat?"
And he says, "What cat?" And she says,
"The cat that shit in my mouth."
That will be 50 small.
- Bullshit! You made it up.
- Could Beaver make that up?
You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free.
I'm filing that in the "Who-gives-a-shit" section of my memory warehouse.
- What's the memory warehouse?
- You don't remember?
- I must've forgot.
- You forgot the memory warehouse?
- Just remind me. Don't give me shit.
- It's in his head. We've all got one.
- Hasn't that place been condemned?
- Not yet.
It's so crowded I throw something out every time I learn something new.
When I got my new laptop I had to throw out my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.
My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago.
I didn't know they had enough beer.
Hey. Hey, hey.
Jonesy, if that really is your name...
- ...what do you do with the old files?
- I burn them.
- You threw out the "Blue Bayou" lyrics?
- No.
No, if I really can't let go of something...
I sneak it back to an office where I keep my secret stuff.
Where do you keep the stuff on Duddits?
He's got a special section all his own on the third level.
I can't stop thinking about the
Duds lately. How about you guys?
It's this place. He's all around here, even though he's never been here.
This is our 20th year coming out here to Hole in the Wall.
And fuck me, Freddy, here's to 20 more.
Yeah.
Twenty more.
Here's to Duddits... our dreamcatcher.
Wish he was here.
To the Duds.
- To Douglas Cavell.
- To Duddits.
Why is Tina Schlossinger's pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers?
Because I said so. It's a picture.
- Have you seen it?
- No... but the kid who sits behind me in shop, he saw it.
Tracker Brothers is deserted for years.
You don't want to see the homecoming queen's pussy?
Don't come.
Fuck me, Freddy! Some kid's shirt.
- So?
- It's new!
Scooby-Doo.
"I belong to Douglas Cavell."
"If the boy I belong to is lost, please bring him to 19 Maple Lane, Derry."
Must belong to one of those kids from the Retard Academy.
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it and you can go.
Hey, you guys! Quit it!
Just fucking quit it!
What are you doing?
You're trying to make him eat that?
What's wrong with you?
Got it. I'll make him eat this dog turd, then he can go.
You go now. Unless you want half.
Take a hike, girls, while you have the chance.
Piss off. That's your final warning.
- You better watch it!
- Why is that?
- I know who you are.
- I'm trembling with fear.
- You're Rich Grenadeau, the quarterback!
- So?
What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing?
You won't tell anybody anything because you'll be dead.
- Get ready, Pete.
- Give the word, Henry.
Pete can fly. When you come for us, all we have to do is get in your way.
I can't catch that little dick?
You know who that is?
That's Pete Moore.
That's right, fat-ass. Pete Moore.
No one can catch him.
He's going straight to his house to tell his mother.
She'll call the cops and then we'll see.
- You know him, is that it?
- Never saw him.
Then why ask for trouble?
I mean, look at this moron!
- He likes this attention.
- How do you know what he likes?
Come on, you dickweeds!
- You want to fight us?
- Yes! Yes!
I'm gone, Henry. Just say the word.
- Why? You'll lose! Why?
- Because you can't do that! It's wrong!
And I'm gonna tell the world!
Tell everybody!
- You want us to leave, is that it?
- No! Let's kick their asses!
Let's go. We'll get him later.
You know that.
Get you all later.
It's okay. You can stop now.
Do something. Somebody!
If I do... and you tell anybody, I'll never hang with you guys again.
I never knew Beav could sing.
- Beaver, that's beautiful.
- I mean it. Not one word.
Beaver!
You've got a fan.
This yours?
Douglas Cavell. That's your name, right?
I Duddits.
- What?
- I Duddits!
- Duddits?
- Duddits.
Duddits, we got to get you home.
Hey, guys! Come here!
Leave the kid there.
Stand right here, Duddits.
Right here with Scooby, okay?
Jesus Christ bananas!
No way is that Tina
Jean Schlossinger.
Maybe her grandmother.
Good going, Beav.
Holy God. We came all the way here just for that?
No. We came for him.
Hey, Pete. You forgot the dogs.
Uh-oh. Weather moving in.
Double storm.
Alberta Clipper first, maybe 8 inches... with a nor'easter on its tail.
- Get on back to the cabin, Henry.
- Heading straight there, Mr. G.
- Don't mess around.
- No, sir.
Easy, fella.
Easy. You're okay. You're all right.
Thank God. Thank God.
Gee, thank God!
I'm lost. I've been lost in the woods since yesterday.
Let's get you inside. Get you warm.
- How would that be?
- Sure.
Here, let me get that.
- Rick McCarthy.
- Gary Jones. It's Jonesy to everybody.
Our damn cell phones are on the blink now, so I can't call for help... but our car will be back soon.
I didn't think I'd make it.
I lost the folks I was with.
You saved me, that's for sure.
What's that?
It's a dreamcatcher.
Indian charm. Catches nightmares... keeps them away.
Keeps you safe down here.
I've had enough nightmares.
Been doing that all night.
I ate some berries in the dark.
I think they must have upset me.
I know what you're thinking.
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs to take the cure, but I only do it here.
In the real world, I never drink till after 5:00... and if it ever does,
I'm on the wagon for life.
Glad to hear it.
What's the matter with you?
About six months ago, the day Jonesy got hit...
I did something terrible with a patient.
I humiliated him. Drove him out.
Barry Neiman.
Couple days ago, I saw his picture in the paper. He ate himself to death.
Mind if I don't use that story next time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?
You were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity.
Thanks. You're a real comfort.
You got a real delicate touch to you.
Here you go, Rick, buddy.
That will fix you up.
Jesus Christ bananas! Some fuckarow this is turning into!
- Thanks a lot, Beav.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.
What happened to you?
Hi. Joe Clarendon. Call me Beaver.
Rick here had a bad night in the woods.
Welcome.
- Is that frostbite?
- No, I get the same thing from peanuts.
It's allergy.
Grilled cheese, anyone?
- No, the soup's fine for me.
- I'll bite. Sail it over here.
My mother used to feed me pea soup when I was feeling...
Bitch in a buzz saw!
I've heard some mighty burps in my time, but that's the blue ribbon.
I am so embarrassed.
- Rick ate some berries in the woods.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, that's awful!
I'm so sorry!
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it.
There's more room out than in, anyway.
What have you been eating, woodchuck turds?
Know what I think?
I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap.
You know, I bet you're right.
I'm just tired, that's all.
- Come on.
- My hat.
Beaver?
Come on. In here.
Thank you for taking me in.
Thank you both.
- Shit, anybody would have.
- Maybe. Maybe not.
All right, this is in case you have to urk... if you can't get to the bathroom, which is the third door to your left.
If you go in the first, you'll take a shit in the closet.
If you need anything, we're outside.
Fuck me, give me some air!
We got any gas masks handy?
We need a biohazard team in here.
- Wanna hear what'll freak you out more?
- Not really.
You know his huge stomach?
When he got here, his stomach was normal, but his chest was out to here!
I wish Henry was here.
He's a shrink, not an internist.
He went to med school. Did you?
I thought about it.
You better get a run at it.
- Shit!
- Watch it!
What the hell?
- Pete, are you okay?
- I broke my leg! My damn leg!
- Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.
- Help me!
- I'm caught! I can't...
- God!
- God.
- Henry! A little help here!
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.
- Okay. Here comes the seat belt.
- I just opened that beer.
I got you.
How's your leg?
Well, it ain't broken.
It's just locked up, is all.
You don't suppose he got exposed to radiation?
I saw that once in a movie. Guy ended up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that red mark got bigger while I watched it.
- What are you doing?
- Peanut butter calms me down.
- Somebody else might want to use that.
- I'll leave some.
Beav.
Beaver.
Criminettlies!
I think it's a woman.
I ought to warn you.
I'm gonna strangle this broad.
- I'd guess she's already dead.
- I'll strangle her anyway.
She almost got us both killed.
Hello! Here we come, ma'am.
Don't be startled.
Hello?
Forget it, H. She's gone.
Hello!
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
I wonder if maybe that's how they say hello around here.
Listen, Miss Road Kill, you almost got us dead.
Say something.
I have to find Rick.
- Okay.
- Rick.
Yeah.
Fuck me, Freddy.
- What's all that red stuff on their fur?
- Just like McCarthy's cheek.
- I never saw anything like this before.
- Even the bears look scared.
- Of what? Where are they going?
- It's not where that worries me... it's what are they running away from?
What the hell?
This could be perfect. They can get Stinky to a hospital.
Hey, you guys!
We need help! Got a sick guy inside!
This area is under temporary quarantine.
- Stay where you are.
- What quarantine?
- We got a sick guy down here!
- We need your help here!
- We got a real sick guy!
- Take him with you now!
Glad you're okay. This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.
Kiss my bender!
I gotta ask you, old buddy.
Because I'm confused.
- Is this SSDD or not?
- Definitely not.
Different shit today, Pete.
And a pretty weird day so far, if you want to know.
Over here.
Okay. There you go.
Easy.
Nine miles to Hole in the Wall.
I think I can manage it.
I'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both.
Now, Pete, you listen to me.
Don't go back to the car for beer.
- Stay with her. Keep her warm.
- Right hand to God, Dr. D.
Henry!
If we die before you get back... promise you'll tell everybody she wasn't my date.
- I don't like this.
- Me neither.
Not at all.
This is turning into a double fuckarow. A real jobba-nobba.
- Rick, you okay?
- I'm a little sick, fellas.
- I just need to make a little room.
- McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.
- Go away!
- Open the door or we break it down.
- Can't a man have privacy?
- Rick, where are you bleeding from?
Bleeding? I'm not bleeding.
- Let's do it.
- I'm not positive I wanna go in there.
What if he's dying? Scooby-Dooby-Doo, we got some work to do now.
On three. Ready?
One.... Two....
Hold it! What if we just bounce off?
- No bounce, no play.
- Right. No bounce, no play.
One....
And a two.... Three!
Oh, fuck! Oh, man! Fuck!
I don't want to see this!
I can't see this.
- Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy? Rick?
- Is he still alive?
I don't know. Rick?
Rick, are you...?
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still do that, he must be alive.
Can you hear me? I think he's dead.
Bullshit! He dropped a clinker! I heard it.
- I don't think that was a clinker.
- That's enough, snap out of it!
- Oh, my God!
- My God!
- No!
- No?
No.
Good move! It's trapped. Got nowhere to go but the septic tank.
Okay.
Oh, shit!
- Listen, we're gonna change places.
- What?
- One of us is gonna go to the shed.
- No way!
Shut up and listen!
There's friction tape there.
You go get it, come back.
We'll tape the lid down.
Then we're gonna get the hell out of here!
- You get the tape, Jonesy.
- Don't be brave, Beav.
You're faster than me.
I'll sit on Thumper.
No, if it does get out, you can't fight it. Not with your hip.
Oh, my God! Goddamn it! Go!
- And Beav?
- Yeah?
Sit tight, buddy.
Okay. Okay.
All right. Okay.
Shit! Earth to Jonesy!
Come in, Jonesy!
Jonesy. Jonesy.
Okay. Calm down now. Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here it is. Okay.
Find the damn tape!
Where is it?
Coming, Beav!
Beaver! Beav!
I got the... What the...?
Jonesy, get out of here!
Beaver.
- Get out! Shut the door!
- No.
Run, Jonesy.
You killed him.
You killed Beaver.
You killed him, you fuck!
Ah!
What do you want?
They call the red stuff Ripley, after the broad in the Alien movies.
We eradicate the animals as they flee the Blue Zone.
The populace?
We bring civilians to Gosselin's. We'll detain them till we figure this out.
And, Owen? This time the ETs belong to you. That's right, bucko.
- You'll be Blue Boy leader.
- Finally.
- How many left?
- About a hundred.
Yeah. Not nearly enough for a serious incursion.
My guess is, it's a crash-landing.
They've never picked terrain like this before or cold weather.
What's your call?
The biggest threat is them getting out of our net.
Crash-landing or not... they'll try to get out and spread the infection.
I always say they never visited a world they wouldn't rather own.
They're up to their old tricks.
Using a standard grayboy look... with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin.
They project what they think we want to see.
But I've had a look at the real thing. You wouldn't want it marrying your sister.
- Difference of opinion about the Ripley.
- Really? Who has an opinion?
- Who do you think?
- General Matheson.
- Three-star General Matheson.
- Three?
- When did you see him?
- They called me in yesterday.
What's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers... who've never been near an ET?
They say the fungus doesn't take hold in all victims. Some of them get over it.
Really? And what about the shit weasels?
The ones blasting out the basement door?
Does Matheson think folks get over one of those puppies?
Their theory is, they only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population.
Do you like that theory, bucko?
I think it's crap.
So if you thought someone had been exposed...
- ...and you had them in your grasp...
- I wouldn't want them walking out...
- ...to wander as they wish.
- Bucko, I think we're on the same page.
Pissing in the same latrine.
If the Ripley gets out of this pine-tree paradise....
Well, it just can't be allowed to do that.
I've quarantined the entire area.
- Nothing leaves alive.
- Roger that, boss.
Come!
Got Maples here, boss.
- Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss.
- I know who you are, Maples.
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy.
Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss.
- Do you know the catechism?
- Yes, the B.U.C. for all buckos.
- Is Blue Unit part of regular Army?
- No, boss. Better.
- How does Blue Unit operate?
Under the radar. We don't salute, display rank, say "sir." A force unto ourselves.
- Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?
- Pussies.
- What rules does it operate by?
- Rules of combat.
That's right, laddie.
When a soldier disobeys a superior's orders, he puts everyone at risk.
And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel.
That's me. Capisce? Good.
Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here.
But you have to answer honestly.
You were on containment detail at 0600 this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.
Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-old daughter... to exit the zone in their own vehicle on Hickam Valley Road?
Colonel Curtis, she hadn't been in the zone.
She made a wrong turn a few miles back.
She couldn't have been contaminated.
You know this for a fact?
Or because she told you so?
- For a fact, boss.
- Scout's honor?
Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact?
Then do it, Maples.
Swear on it. Scout's honor.
Scout's honor.
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!
You just avoided a court-martial, boy.
You lie to me again, you'll be facing a firing squad.
- Get him out before I change my mind.
- Let's get him out of here.
Sentry!
- Jesus, Abe.
- I warned him.
Could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.
- Instead of taking his whole hand?
- He crossed the Curtis line!
He came into my house, told me lies.
- You think I'm crazy, Owen?
- A little.
I lost my temper there. But that little worm did something worse.
The pretty mom he let pass this morning?
She's down at the barn right now crawling with the Ripley.
Twenty-five years, Owen.
Twenty-five years I've been going out to fight these alien bastards... show them they picked the wrong place, knocked on the wrong door.
And frankly, laddie, the tank is running a little low.
Luckily for me, there's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit.
I have you. To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow.
- What are you talking about, Abe?
- It's my last dance, Owen.
From now on, you will lead the band.
- You know where I got that?
- John Wayne.
That's right. He gave it to me.
And now I'm giving it to you.
- Abe, I don't know how to....
- Let's not get all girlie with each other.
- Just tell me how we do it.
- We go in fast and hard.
- How do we come out?
- Clean... and smiling.
Ah.
Honey, I'm home.
That's a good idea.
Catch a little shuteye.
Save your energy for those horrendous farts!
Well, it's very nice of you to say so.
I find you very attractive also.
You're one of those rare women who can handle the full-size Ford Expedition.
The truck that handles like a luxury car.
A really big luxury car.
But seriously, folks, there is one issue I'd like to bring up... just in case I should, you know, kick the bucket out here... turn into a goddamn Petesicle.
Not that I think that's inevitable.
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver will be coming to get us soon.
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.
Now, ma'am, I'll be very candid with you about this... so please, don't get freaked out or think that I'm some kind of weirdo... who you shouldn't meet for the best fried clams in Maine.
Just some innocent fried clams at the West Wharf!
You see, the four of us, best friends... we all have this other friend by the name of Duddits.
And our friend Duddits, well, he's not your average old buddy.
One day, a long time ago, he gave us all this kind of gift.
It's this.... How shall I put it?
This ability. This ability to know things... to talk to each other without talking at all, just mind-to-mind.
Do you see what I'm getting at?
I knew you would.
Lately, I've been having this dream... and in the dream, I understand how
Duddits could give us a gift like that.
I think maybe our friend Duds is not from this planet.
I think Duddits is from somewhere else... and he came here to prepare us for something.
It's crazy.
Talking shit about the only perfect person I ever knew.
He's so goddamned good.
I can't believe he's a human.
I should be singing his praises, not questioning what galaxy he's...
I gotta pee.
That's what I should do.
Here's to you, Duds.
The highest civilian decoration.
Lord, I will never drink again.
Let me get this straight.
Yesterday you want to call it quits, throw in the towel, pull the plug.
Today, you're begging, praying.
Couple more hours. Couple more miles.
Make up your mind.
Jonesy! Way to go, motherfucker!
Here you come to save the day!
What the hell?
Who's Mr. Gray?
What are you trying to tell me, Jonesy?
You're not Jonesy.
What was that, Mr. Jones?
What did we just pass?
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?
That's what your friends call you, isn't it? Let's be friends.
- Why are you letting me live?
- I'm borrowing you.
- We're going to take a little journey.
- Beaver never hurt a soul. You killed him.
He had nothing in his head.
I've found something useful in yours.
- Fuck you!
- I know what that expression means.
I've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse.
Rather distasteful, I must say.
How about this, Mr. Gray?
Eat shit and die.
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?
Watch out for Ister Gay.
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?
If you want to know, why don't you read my mind?
Surprisingly, you're able to keep things from me...
I don't understand it. But I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.
Oh, Pete, Jesus!
Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off, Jonesy.
I always thought it would be my ex-wife did that.
Let's get you to some help.
Can you still see the line, buddy?
- I don't need it to get to Gosselin's.
- No, I know that, but... if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's, how would you get us out to 95?
95? Who gives a shit?
I'm hurting here, Jonesy.
What's wrong with you?
- Wait a minute, you're not...
- Shut up, Pete.
You're too messed up to know what you're saying.
Too late for that. Pete, I need you to get onto the snowmobile right now.
Who the fuck are you? You sound like one of those James Bonds!
This has to do with the fucking eel, doesn't it? You're not...
Stop it! I'll get him to help. Pete, tell him what he wants to know.
Now, Pete, which way to I-95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.
My, my. That is a gift.
Who taught you that?
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.
Climb aboard.
- Show's over. Let me in.
- Let me in.
What have you got in that part of your mind, professor?
Your memories are out here in the warehouse, aren't they?
I want to know who warned you about me. And who taught Pete that trick?
I'm sure the answers are here.
It'll just take me a while to find them.
- To find them.
- Think about letting me in.
- It's the polite thing to do.
- Polite thing to do.
Beav!
What is this?
Oh, Beav.
Shit!
Fuck me, Freddy.
Oh, shit.
Asshole!
So long, Beav. Love you, man.
We all made them in art.
I finished first.
I made one for Duds.
Mine's deformed. I couldn't figure out the string.
- Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet!
- That's right, my man.
I Duddits.
- Yes. I Duddits.
- I Duddits!
I Duddits!
- Duds will find her.
- How?
- He can do anything.
- She's from the Academy.
- She always waves.
- We've gotta save this girl.
- Save this world?
- Not the world, Duds. A girl.
- We'll save the world some other time.
- Ister Gay?
- Yeah, it's a mystery.
- We need you to solve it.
- Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds.
- Not this.
Shut up. We gotta think of Josie.
Josie, Josie, Josie.
"Josie Rinkenhauer."
- Josie?
- That's right. Can you find Josie?
- This is completely crazy.
- You can say that again.
- I didn't say anything.
- You did. I heard you.
- You said, "This is completely crazy."
- I didn't say that.
I thought it.
Kiss my bender. Duds can hear people's thoughts. We can't.
Are you sure of that, Beav?
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!
Josie, you down there?
Josie! Josie!
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.
I know it. I can see her in my head.
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Help! Please!
- Help me.
- Hold on, Josie, we're coming!
Josie, hang in there!
Don't sing. She's scared enough.
- Shut up. There's, like, rat shit.
- Hold on to my feet!
Pete, do you see anything?
- Duds! We got her!
- Here's Josie.
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?
- Right here, boss. Fast and hard.
- Wouldn't have it any other way.
Sir?
I see it.
- Don't hurt us.
- We're dying.
- There is no infection here.
- Whose radio is that?
It's not the radio. They're putting it into our heads.
- We are helpless.
- There it is, gentlemen.
- There's no infection here.
- Directly into our heads.
This gives you an idea what we're up against.
If anybody's thinking,
"Those poor, helpless little folk... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic Winnebago... what kind of a dog, what kind of a monster... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?"
- Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster.
- We are helpless. We are dying.
These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse.
And I'm here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?
- Yes, boss!
- Roger that, boss.
Right on, boss.
Don't hurt us.
I have a visual.
Holy shit!
Damn, look at the size of that.
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Target imminent. Go to level 4 readiness.
Gentlemen, lock and load.
Hellfires are hot.
Sing it out, Owen!
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Clean up the forest, get rid of this trash!
- Don't hurt us.
- Please, don't hurt us.
- There is no infection here.
- We are helpless.
- Fire at will!
- Fire!
Owen, get them out of there!
It's gonna blow!
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!
- We can get them!
- It's self-destructing.
- Blue Boy group, get out of there!
- We're on top of it!
Owen, pull out now!
- Pull out! Get out of there!
- Pull out!
Jonesy, I've been thinking about our friend. Our Scooby-Doo buddy.
For a long time I thought he was sent to us to warn us about something.
- I could never figure what it was.
- Don't talk about him.
Not till today.
It was this, right now.
- He wanted to warn us.
- Tell me about your friend.
- Did he show you that nifty trick?
- No. Jonesy's right.
- Come on, Pete. Let's talk.
- Bite my bag, motherfucker!
All right, Pete, I'll bite.
Your bag and everything else.
No, no! You bastard! No!
Pete.
Don't talk to him! Get out of there!
Ah.
- What's up?
- Thank God you came by, governor.
I'm broke down here and fearing for my life.
That's a good-looking dog.
- Where you headed?
- Gosselin's.
Any chance you're going near there?
That's where I'm going.
Well, I believe your tailgate has come open.
Let's take a look.
I see you have some cargo you're taking to Blue Base.
Got a treat for you, Ike.
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.
Good doggy. Yes. Good boy.
Have your fill. Tasty, tasty.
Eat all you want...
Jonesy. What are you up to?
Jonesy!
Oh, God!
Halt or we'll fire! You cannot leave the quarantine zone!
- Halt!
- I think I just about halted here.
Come with me, Owen.
I'll show you things you'll wish you'd never seen.
- How long we gotta be here?
- It'll be all right.
- I demand to see my lawyer!
- There must be something they can do.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- When do we get out?
- Within hours.
- You can't do this to people in America!
- I told you to stay over there!
- My wife...
- Government's doing what... they can to get you out of here.
Don't worry. It's all right.
We're doing everything to make sure you're safe.
We'll get you back to your homes within hours.
All clear.
Can I help you, sir?
What's your name?
- Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin.
- A doctor? Good.
We need doctors in there.
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.
- You, sir, where you from?
- Boston.
Beantown? Great city. We'll have you back there in no time.
Maybe by morning.
Hurry up, bucko.
You see that crud on the faces of children... you know why I relish a turn in the country like we had today.
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to...
Abe? Abe, you okay?
Abe?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I must be getting too old for this shit.
I don't know what the hell that was about.
It's the only way, Owen.
We've got to cauterize the site.
They've all got to die.
It's the only way.
But we don't know that.
Studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects.
The studies show squat, that's what they show.
If Matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter-century... you'd have never made it to your first jerk-off.
Those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.
Some get better. At least half will be over it in a few days...
Which ones, Mother Teresa?
Can you guarantee they won't take it home like a present for the family?
I'll tell you what you should be worried about. What should be on your mind.
Not these few unfortunates.
What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker.
- What?
- A hitchhiker.
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride... with somebody and would carry them out of here, without being consumed.
To scatter the infection, like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.
- Are you sure there isn't such a person?
- No.
But I am sure that if there is one he won't get out.
Not with the net my boys put up around the Blue Zone.
And if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got.
If we don't get gooey about the little picture... when our job is taking care of the big one.
Capisce?
Owen, if you think this is easy for me, you're crazier than my mother was.
Those poor schmucks.
They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart... never miss an episode of Friends.
These are Americans.
The idea of slaughtering
Americans... it just turns my stomach.
But I'll do it. I'll do it because it needs to be done.
So if we start at 2, we can be done by 2:30. And it's all behind us.
Except for the dreams.
Yeah, except for them.
What are you gonna tell Rita about what you did here?
What are you gonna tell Katrina when she's old enough to ask?
You know me, don't you?
I don't remember when we met... but you know me.
We don't have time to screw around.
You've got two problems.
- One you know about, one you don't.
- Go ahead.
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.
Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people.
- Who are you?
- Me?
Talk about that later, once we get out of here.
- Hey.
- You're predictable.
You won't let me burn on this fence... any more than you'll help
Curtis kill those people.
What you're thinking now is whether that digital sat-scan transmitter... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody.
- Somebody named General Matheson.
- Hmm.
"Sometimes we have to kill, but our real job is to save lives."
Your father was a great soldier.
Those were his last words.
You carry his picture with you always.
Tell me everything.
You'll save these people.
When we're done talking, get on the transmitter, contact Matheson.
Cavalry rides in.
That takes care of problem number one. Now comes the hard part.
You think the infection's been contained, that there's no hitchhiker.
You're wrong. He's riding with my best friend on earth.
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he's out there.
You and I don't get after him right away, he'll get out of my range... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan.
Our nightmare hitchhiker.
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend.
- Very convenient.
- I'm saying you ought to hear his story.
Okay. Where is he?
Had him taken to the tractor shed.
Okay. I'll check him out and we can compare notes.
Whatever you say, boss.
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.
All right, lad, open up.
Dr. Boston?
Are you in here?
I'm here.
Where I've been put.
A prisoner on my own damn property.
Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Get in!
You almost ran me down.
Figured you'd read my mind and get out of the way.
Blue Unit, stand down. You are under regular Army command.
- Put down your weapons at once.
- Get down!
Your mission is rescinded.
This is no longer a
Blue Unit operation.
Put down your arms.
Repeat, put down your arms.
General Matheson has assumed command.
Okay, Owen.
Okay.
You just drove over the Curtis line.
- Where we going?
- South.
All I know right now. Just get me in range of Jonesy... we'll know everything we need to know.
That's some gun. Can I have a look?
- Kind of flashy for a guy like you.
- It's a gift.
I know.
Where are you, Jonesy?
Pick up the phone. Call 1-800-HENRY.
Hello? Jonesy!
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where's he taking you?
Massachusetts? He is?
Duddits? Okay, I will.
You hang in there, Jonesy.
Jonesy?
He hung up.
Give me back my gun.
- We gotta go to Derry.
- That where they're going?
No, they're going towards
Massachusetts. We need Duddits.
Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits.
Your buddy, he's still alive after all this time with Mr. Gray?
Yeah, he's immune.
I think it's because he died.
He got hit by a car and his heart stopped. Twice.
I don't think he even knows it.
He came back from the dead.
Must have changed him somehow.
It's almost like Duddits saw this whole thing coming. Is that it?
Jonesy told me it was Duddits who drew him into the accident.
If we catch him, we're gonna have to kill him.
You know we have to do it. It's the only way to stop Mr. Gray... assuming we can catch him.
When was the last time you saw Duddits?
Long time ago.
Years.
What makes you so sure he can help?
Duddits can do anything.
I didn't understand that then, but I think it's always been true.
He's the one who made us like this.
- Like what?
- You know, weird.
He's been waiting for you.
Blizzard slowed us up.
Henny, Henny.
Henny.
I miss you, Henny.
I miss you.
Henny.
Long time, Henny. Henny.
- My God, Roberta, what is it?
- Lymphocytic leukemia.
I'm gonna let you take him, but I have to tell you why.
Just now, when he was getting ready...
Henry, he was so excited.
Like he hasn't been in such a long time.
I think... that if he's with you, he might die happy... instead of in this awful room.
Be sure the parka stays on tight. Cold devastates him.
The medication and instructions are in here.
Bye, Mom.
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.
Now, go save the world.
All right, laddie.
They haven't got enough courage to take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.
What've we got?
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.
Massachusetts?
Stay with it, bucko.
General Matheson. Come in, please.
This is very nice, Abe.
Been home through some rough times.
Was there something we hadn't covered?
I don't think I got to say before how much I respect the work you've done.
It was with sincere regret...
Herman... May I call you Herman?
We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives, but we do agree on this:
I'm past it. Burned out.
Just needed a push, that's all.
Should have quit after that mess in Montana.
Even I don't trust my judgment anymore.
Oh, yeah....
My techies tell me we're getting some electronics reading hot from in here.
Yes, I've been talking to the wife on my sat phone.
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara.
She's been after me for years to retire.
She's very happy, I can tell you that. I'll have everything shut down in an hour.
If that's soon enough.
That will be fine.
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?
Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper.
You're making yourself at home.
You have no idea, Jonesy.
Tell me how you like this:
"Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.
He's in a police car now.
Can you see where they are, Duds?
Ownzy. He's in Ister Gay.
Mr. Gray.
That's right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.
We gotta save this girl.
Save the world?
Not the world, Duds, a girl. We'll save the world some other time.
Ister Gay?
You already knew.
Where's he going, Duds?
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy? Duds?
Ister Gay, he want war.
- War?
- Not war, water.
Mr. Gray wants water.
I know where he's going.
- He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
- What's Quabbin?
It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.
- Hmm.
- What?
One worm kills the world.
One worm kills the world?
Oh, my God. One worm.
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms that come out of these weasels.
Mr. Gray must want to get one into the Boston drinking supply.
Just one worm infects the whole world?
- Are we going right?
- Yes.
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike.
It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.
Are you ready to try something hard?
I want to ask you something hard.
Yes, Henny.
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?
Can you make him hear you?
Ownzy... and Ister Gay.
Duddits.
I knew it. I knew it.
He's been here all along.
Waiting.
Jonesy? It appears we didn't meet by accident.
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.
- I don't know what you mean.
- No? Maybe not.
Maybe your clever friend didn't want you to know what he was up to.
That's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me.
Duddits didn't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you.
It doesn't matter.
His little scheme didn't work.
Did it, Ike? No, no.
We're almost there.
What was it your poetry file had to say?
I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep
Stop that chopper!
Punch it, dude. Don't be a pussy.
Thank you, Gary Jones.
Go up around the reservoir.
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.
Patience, bambino.
Just up ahead.
Shh....
Stay here and take care of your friend.
No matter what you hear.
So long, doctor.
Good doggy.
Good girl.
Shit!
You son of a bitch!
Wait.
Wait.
Go back to car, Duddie.
You'll be safer there.
Look out, Jonesy.
I knew you'd come, Henry.
I knew you wouldn't let me die.
Who the fuck are you?
- Don't you know me, H?
- I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.
Just to be sure.
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.
I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.
He could be hiding in here somewhere... waiting for his chance.
Tell me something Mr. Gray couldn't possibly know.
Tell me something only we would know.
SSDD.
Not good enough.
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.
At Tracker Brothers, day we met Duddits... what was painted on the wall by the window?
No... bounce....
No play.
Hello...
Ister Gay.
You.
Ooby-Ooby-Doo... we got some work to do now.
Ister Gay... go away.
No!
I Duddits.
H?
Jonesy.
Jonesy, if that really is your name....
- That'll be 50 small.
- Bullshit.
- I Duddits.
- I Duddits.
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.
Here's to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.
Come on, Spike. Get up.
Get up.
Listen to me.
It's like a pot of stew bubbling on the stove.
All mixed up...
...with no telling what's good or what's bad.
It's all the same.
But there's one thing you shouldn't forget. You know what it is?
Meat?
Everyone says that, but that's wrong.
Without the basic stock, you don't have a stew.
If you add curry powder, you get curry.
We have stock cubes in the pantry.
Not that, you idiot!
Great, a wannabe preacher with a gun. Come on, Spike.
I'll go around the back.
All right.
No point waiting for the cops.
I know your security here.
- You know why?
- Renzi, hurry it up.
You see this logo?
That's your security company.
I used to work for your security company.
I got laid off, so I took up robbery.
Funny, ain't it?
Go on. Laugh.
Funny, is it?
It sure is.
Stop laughing!
We're closed.
Go someplace else.
Now, go ahead and fill up my money card.
Who the hell are you?
Are you deaf?
Damn it!
You!
Take those earphones off!
I'll take this.
Hey, Spike!
These crooks will pay for my doughnuts.
Don't move!
- Hey, Jet.
- What?
You said there were three.
Drop your guns!
To fool an enemy, first fool yourself.
What's the point?
- Listen up!
- You spend too long on the toilet!
You want the old lady to die?
You hear me?
You see the gun?
Sorry, Granny. We ain't cops or security guards.
It ain't our job to save your life.
- What?
- Bad luck, ain't it?
That's Cowboy...
- What are you blabbing about?
- Don't shoot me!
Cowboy?
Who the hell are you?
Just a bounty hunter.
- It's your move.
- Don't rush me.
Do you plan your moves?
Just hurry up.
Listen, Spike.
In shogi, Japanese chess...
...you look 100 moves ahead, then make your play.
You head off your opponent's attack.
That's how you play.
You don't just move at random.
I want to move here.
Take your finger off, and you've moved.
You're far too easygoing.
Now, listen, Spike.
One's character merges in shogi.
- You obviously react to each move.
- Hurry up. Move.
What would you have done if you'd hit the hostage?
I'd have dealt with it.
It was too risky for a measly
1.25 million bounty.
There's no drama in bounty hunting.
Before you became my partner, life was much quieter.
Good, I was considering that myself. Well, Spike?
I found it!
I found it!
Faye, a message for you.
Target heading for town, using Booth 8 on Route 12.
Get me an ID on him and the vehicle.
It's some kid.
I hate bounty-hunting boys.
That's not him.
Time for the CBC News.
Today's top story:
At 10 a.m. On Highway 7...
...a tank er truck exploded into flames.
Seventy-two persons are dead and 425 suffered injuries.
We have a live report from Lylie.
Reporting from the scene.
The wreckage is being removed and the area cleaned up.
People within a two-mile radius of the crash site...
...were soon overcome by the noxious fumes.
A general panic ensued.
Three hours after the accident, calm has returned.
Is there a possibility the truck was carrying a poison?
The police suspect either a toxic chemical...
...or a biological hazard.
The area has been sealed off.
Any leads on why it exploded?
No information at this point.
But police say the vehicle had been stolen earlier.
They suspect this could be a case of biological terrorism.
Live from the scene.
It's on every channel.
Déjà vu, huh?
It feels like I had instant noodles last night too.
Don't be so stupid.
You've had that for dinner for three days in a row.
Really?
I thought it was a dream.
We've got other instant food.
We have flat white and buckwheat noodles, all instant.
We've even got instant sushi, but it's over a year old.
- Try your luck.
- I partake!
Just carbohydrates aren't very good for you.
Man needs protein.
What are you going on about?
I said I like meat.
Forget the smalltime punks.
We need a big bounty.
How did it go with you, Faye?
Terrible. You want to hear?
Didn't you say your hacker was easy to trace?
I got caught up in that explosion.
I'll take one.
Plus, I lost big at the races.
Look. That's it!
Were you there?
Well, it was quite an accident.
Virus? I see.
Oh, no! A chemical weapon?
I'm not contaminated!
Hey! Even the dog's avoiding me!
Dirty, dirty, full of germs!
Cut that out!
The Mars government is offering a reward of 300 million Woolong.
Three hundred million?
What can it be?
- You too?
- Yes.
- Well?
- I've never seen symptoms like these.
They all show unnatural pressure on the brain...
...but we have no idea what's causing it.
I haven't got a clue.
On admittance, they all showed reactions in the lymph corpuscles.
Their condition is worsening, but the lymphs are now normal.
Could it be smallpox or Ebola?
It's no virus that we know of...
...and it's not a nerve gas.
What does that mean?
We can't find any traces...
...not even in the dead bodies.
It must be some kind of an unknown virus...
...or some form of a germ-warfare agent.
This could be dangerous.
Sorry. It's my allergy.
I know by now we've cured most allergies...
...but this could be viral.
Someone could be deliberately spreading it.
It's a no-smoking area.
What do they want?
Are you sure?
If not, we'll all end up dead.
It's starting now.
Bio-terrorists?
You'd better watch this, Spike.
- Why me?
- This information doesn't come cheap.
We know that.
Hurry it up.
- It's very valuable.
- Edo, start now.
Lee Samson, computer hacker.
A bounty of 5 million.
We traced his card with false ID on it.
- How?
- I hacked their database.
He used the card to rent a car that was blown up.
But Lee wasn't in it.
Probably an accomplice.
Yes, that's the guy.
I don't get it.
You expect us to hunt him down with these flimsy leads?
But it's all inside my head.
Here you are.
You can draw on the monitor with it.
We don't even know if he's the terrorist.
He didn't have a mask on, so he'd be dead by now.
No, he didn't die.
- How do you know?
- Women's intuition.
Intuition?
Finished.
That's his face?
That's a hell of a face.
If you can find a face like that...
...l'll pay the bounty.
All right.
I'm wasting my time here!
I'll get him by myself.
Sounds like a waste of time to me.
I'll start on the virus.
What? Now you're interested?
You can bank on a woman's intuition.
- But still...
- I'm sick of eating out of Styrofoam.
I used to fly every day.
We sure did.
I'd love to fly again, maybe as far as Saturn.
You liar!
The biggest thing you ever flew was a crop-duster.
- Is that right?
- Excuse me.
I have a question.
No point. We're all going deaf.
Where's the bean-seller?
There's a lot of them down there.
No, I want to buy the other "beans."
You're an undercover cop.
Do I look like a cop?
More like a gangster.
Same thing, really.
I'm a bounty hunter.
So you're the Cowboy?
We used to be cowboys too, in the old days.
Good. We can talk.
That's more reason not to.
Are you looking for beans?
You've got some, have you?
Of course. You can get anything at Moroccan Street.
That's why you came.
Is Pistachio around?
Almond?
Calabar beans. They tell if your wife's cheating.
The innocent eat them all at once and vomit them out.
The guilty eat one at a time and the poison sets in.
That's how it works.
- I don't have a wife.
- You're a lucky man.
- What I want to know...
- Broad beans are bad.
Pythagoras died after eating them.
Don't underestimate the bean.
I want to know about the virus...
...from that truck accident.
Do you believe in demons?
With so much in the world about us...
...why does man's imagination go beyond that?
Why does man long for the skies and yearn for the universe?
Because in the old days, man used to fly.
Do they sell drugs?
If you can imagine it, it can happen.
Even if it cannot be seen.
So you have the virus?
That was no virus.
Hello, Rashid.
I've got a vase for you.
This was made for you.
No, he needs it more than me.
Yes, my friend, it was made for you.
Made for me?
You should always buy such things.
Look, I didn't come here for shopping.
- You made a good buy. See you.
- Wait a minute!
- Inshallah.
- Hey, I said to wait.
Games from the 20th century are much better.
I'm sick of the games they make today.
I'm addicted to these old-school games.
Back then, they were happy with such games.
Same with hackers.
Back in the good old days of Cap'n Crunch.
Such a small thing, but now it's part of history.
Everything's so well-guarded now...
...it's hard to become famous.
So I'm really impressed with what we did.
I've long wanted to do something.
A real terrorist attack.
Oh, no. He's dead.
Your license.
Where are you going?
It's only warehouses down here.
Oh, no. He's dead.
In those days, the sheriff could see his enemies.
So, what was in that tanker truck?
We haven't found a trace yet.
- What do you mean?
- What I said.
Something we can't see and we've never seen.
What's that?
A space truck was found near one of the asteroids.
The driver was dead and the cargo gone.
A truck hijack?
The truck belonged to Cherious Medical...
...but they didn't report it missing.
Rumour has it that it was carrying some sort of contraband.
- Soon after, the terrorists struck.
- Smells fishy.
Cherious guards their secrets far too well.
Why don't you investigate them?
Get them on some trumped-up charges.
Things have changed since you were a cop.
The ISSP has no teeth these days.
We're powerless.
Our bosses only think about their promotions.
The rank and file are in cahoots with gangsters.
We're so rotten, we're falling apart.
Things haven't changed.
That's why I quit.
Ever hear of purgatory?
The place between heaven and hell.
It's where souls that didn't make it to heaven suffer eternally.
Right. This world of ours.
Is this all there is?
There are 30,000 units in the capsule.
Once it's opened, they'll start to replicate.
Be careful with it.
Where's the money?
That's less than we agreed.
You'll get the rest after the party.
Then you can do as you please.
Then I can say goodbye to this pitiful life.
Can I ask you something?
Why does it have to be on Halloween?
In the old days, Halloween was the day when the souls in purgatory...
...could, through prayer, reach heaven.
Start praying.
Hey, amigo!
Hello to the solar system's...
...three million bounty hunters!
It's time for the Big Shot!
Giving you full details of current bounties.
Today's special show will run for an extra 20 minutes.
We'll focus on the extraordinary bounty...
...of 300 million offered by the Mars government.
Yes, it's the largest bounty ever offered!
But no one knows who or where they are.
Are there no clues?
No, they left nothing at the scene...
...and no living witnesses.
So how shall we do this?
Well, we're offering a special prize to anyone...
...who calls in information.
Be the first to access the number on your screen.
Let's tak e a commercial break.
They're totally useless.
Hey, Faye.
Take a look at this.
It's just like before.
- Tattoos?
- I searched for a matching symbol.
Which one is it?
Well, it's not this one.
- This one?
- Is that a true lie?
This one. No mistake.
Unit 7, Mars Special Forces attack team.
Special forces?
So they're military?
They were disbanded three years ago.
Any data on them?
Of course.
What? Most of them are dead.
Next.
What's the matter, Ein?
No way!
Hurry up. Next.
Ein says he's the one.
How would a dog know?
Look, he died two years ago in the Titan Wars.
I've had enough.
Clean it up.
I really hate this kind of boring desk work.
I know that somewhere there's a perfect job for me.
Faye.
Why do I have to waste my youth alongside these jerks?
- Faye, Faye.
- Where did I go wrong?
Lee is using his card again.
They're connected!
- Is that a spittoon?
- Kind of.
- An octopus tank?
- Kind of. What's this?
Ein says this guy is the one we're after, but Faye disagrees.
But unfortunately he's dead.
Vincent Volaju.
Any luck, Spike?
A vase?
They made me buy it.
How about you?
I love Western movies.
Give me a look at it!
I reckon we could sell Edo to a circus.
I saw my old pal Bob.
A drug company's up to something.
Drug company?
There's something in here.
What is it?
You're pretty good.
Here they come!
Are you alone?
Why don't we play together?
I much prefer the real thing to virtual reality.
The real thing?
At last I've found you, hacker boy.
I only needed 500 points!
Then Sporky Dorky appears.
Are you listening?
Damn it. That was my best score ever.
How will you repay me, bounty hunter babe?
Do you realize the trouble you're in?
It's "game over" for you, kid.
You owe me for Sporky Dorky.
What's going on?
Come back!
What the hell?!
That is so weird.
What's inside there?
They're lymph corpuscles.
The things you find in human blood?
But this one is not normal.
What's different?
I don't get it at all.
This is a normal lymph corpuscle.
But this one is slightly different.
What's different?
I'll blow it up.
I still don't get it.
Let's heat it in the microwave.
It's really weird.
What the hell?
Hello? Is that Totas Cleaning?
Make your report.
The ISSP are treating it as a terrorist attack.
They're still investigating, but have no firm leads yet.
They're still analysing it as if it were a virus.
We're safe for a while, but we mustn't waste time.
What about Mendelo, colonel?
We've had reports he's been seen on Moroccan Street.
I contacted my spies there, but he'd already left.
We have to make sure this doesn't go any further.
Life on Mars could end because of it.
But did Vincent actually activate the process?
It is pure evil personified in a test tube.
Its very existence is a threat to all life.
Vincent and Mendelo don't deserve to live.
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Have you seen my car?
Didn't you just drive it out?
Put your hands up.
I know you from somewhere.
I like your outfit too.
- Yours doesn't suit you.
- You think so?
Now turn around.
- What do you know?
- Wanna flip a coin?
If it's heads, I'll tell you.
You're pretty tough for a drug company office girl.
Knowing too much can shorten your life.
But tough girls are my type.
Halt or I'll shoot!
Happy Halloween.
Trick or treat.
I'll mak e mischief unless you give me something sweet.
I'm so tiny that no one can find me.
So great, no one can see me.
But to the marrow, I'm part of you.
What's he trying to say?
I don't know, but as a statement, it's meaningless.
Has anyone seen a really disgusting hat here?
No time for that.
We've just had a terrorist statement.
Probably a hoax.
Perhaps, but yesterday's capsule makes it far too real.
That vase?
What we thought were lymph corpuscles...
...are actually a mass of micro-robots.
A new type of nanomachines.
What's that?
- Heard of them?
- No.
What are they?
Micro-robots, invisible to the naked eye...
...made from a form of protein.
You like your protein...
...but no way you could eat these guys.
Originally used for medical purposes.
So why put them in the vase?
One clue is that lymph corpuscles are composed of bone marrow.
So what?
The one who made the statement knows that fact.
- So what?
- That's all.
What? We still don't know what's going on.
What a waste of time.
How did it go at Cherious?
Security is far heavier than their business demands.
Their guards all carry
G-21 submachine guns.
That's a military-issue weapon, isn't it?
Few civilians can get ahold of them.
I saw a woman with the same tattoo as Vincent.
And she was really...
- She was what?
- Quite beautiful.
If the military's involved, it's a whole new ball game.
It seems that the more we learn, the less we know.
Where are you going?
I'll go and sleep on it.
Everything comes to he who waits.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Has anyone seen that hat?
No, I haven't.
Where did it get to?
What a weird smell!
What is it, Ein?
Here?
Trick or treat!
Idiot! Halloween's not till tomorrow!
It's not him, then.
Trick or treat!
You're welcome to trick me.
Treat, please.
How about if I trick you, son?
I'm not a boy.
I'm a girl!
I've got no time for women! Get lost!
Not him either.
I've found him.
- Hello?
- I've found him!
- Is that you, Edo?
- I've found Lee.
Really? That's great!
I knew you were special.
Where are you?
I'm sending my location now.
Watch him carefully.
I'll be right over.
Don't move.
No problem.
Bye-bye.
Trick or treat, trick or treat.
Give me something good to eat.
Level one cleared.
That was too easy.
You're always playing that.
Is it fun?
What game is it?
She's just a stupid kid!
Which building is he in?
Which apartment?
It's quite a simple game.
The one who has the last ball remaining wins.
That's "game over."
Did you win?
The real game starts now.
What do you mean?
Don't tell me that's a capsule?!
"It's just a game."
No way!
You're kidding, aren't you?
Only one can win.
I'll never get to see
Sporky Dorky.
Hey, don't you go and die on me!
Press my restart button...
Emergency call from Alpha 1.
I've found Humpty Dumpty.
Current location is 2415, and he is mobile.
I'm on my way.
Don't move a muscle till I arrive.
What about bones?
Leaving Sector 17, moving to 18.
Heading for Central Station.
This way. I'll follow you.
You stay here.
Watch the car.
Vincent!
I knew you by your smell.
You stink of spilled blood.
A bounty hunter, huh?
Bad luck for you.
Blame those who put the bounty on your head.
- Why don't you shoot?
- What?
Or are you just putting on a tough-guy act?
Go ahead. Shoot.
No point.
You're worth nothing dead.
I'm not afraid to die.
Death is but perchance to dream.
To dream for all eternity.
You asshole.
Is that all you've got?
What's your name?
Spike Spiegel.
- I'll see you in another world.
- Vincent!
Vincent...
It's me, remember?
Why only me?
Vincent.
Can you hear me, Spike?
You're dying.
He's dead.
He was dead from the beginning.
Just like you.
He's the one who found the body...
...floating in the river.
Thank you.
What did you see?
You were on the verge of death.
I was dreaming.
Well... which is the dream?
The first time ever...
...first time I've been truly scared.
Shaking with fear.
If one single atom had given way...
...I would have died.
It was not destined to be your time to die.
Swimming Bird...
...these blue eyes see everything.
They see the past, the present and the future.
They look upon the full flow of time.
They see not the reality...
...they see only the truth.
Open your eyes of truth.
There is nothing to fear.
Yes. I understand.
So you're not dead?
What about Vincent?
He disappeared.
As if he was never there at all.
We've gotten mixed up in something fatal.
As my father always said:
"The ship that sets sail...
...either keeps sailing or it sinks."
We're just bounty hunters.
This is far too big for the likes of us.
We can still quit now.
We should back off.
Okay, Spike?
He can sleep anywhere.
Why did you disobey orders?
You don't wish to answer?
Did you consider that disobeying orders...
...was the direct cause of so many innocent deaths?
I'm very sorry.
You're restricted to barracks as of now.
I'll give my final decision at a later date.
- Watch her closely.
- Yes.
Our investigation shows the element used on the monorail...
...is the same as that from the tanker truck.
Have you managed to identify that element?
We're doing it now.
The hacking of our computers was carried out by one Lee Samson...
...with a similar MO in a previous attack.
We're running a trace on his path of access.
- Any chance he's their leader?
- Yes, there is.
We believe he has had contact with terrorist groups.
What is their aim?
Is it ideological, or do they want money?
We're still checking.
Is everything still "being checked"?
How long must we wait?
The medicals should be ready by now!
I feel so heavy.
- What's that?
- My legs feel heavy.
- Hey!
- I got it!
I hacked into Cherious Medical.
Check their trucking records for October 15.
- Back on the job, Spike?
- No way.
I'm just checking up.
Otherwise, I can't sleep.
You sleep too much.
Truck, truck, where have you been?
It carried a load of macadamia nuts.
Macadamia nuts?
I wouldn't try to eat them.
I'll check it out.
"Macadamia Nuts Control Department."
"Macadamia Nuts R&D Department."
Why such attention to mere nuts?
Edo, take a look into the R&D Department.
- Any clues to what they're doing?
- No.
My hacking program has crashed.
Now? We were so close.
Edo, try another route and get a profile on him.
Dr. Mendelo al Hedia.
At SIT, he was researching nanomachines.
There's no way that's a drug company.
They're developing war nanomachines for the military.
So Vincent stole some of their nanomachines?
But war nanomachines were banned by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
If this is a military operation, they're doing it underground.
That means Vincent is still alive.
Hello, Steve.
What can I do for you, Electra?
What's that?
A blood sample?
Check it out for me.
Okay, if you agree to a date.
Well, okay.
I'll reserve a table for Halloween night.
What's going on?
Why am I still alive?
What did you do to me?
I gave you my blood.
Now you won't die when I unleash the power.
Just like me.
It won't be much longer now.
Did you find what you wanted?
No, just a lot of things
I don't need.
That's how the world turns.
There are people who make things we'll never want.
Who's making these demons?
Why did you give me that vase?
It was perfect for you.
I mean what was inside.
Nanomachines in the form of lymph corpuscles. Dr. Mendelo's.
A man escaped here over three years ago.
He said he had made a hideous development...
...one that's programmed to spread through touch...
...or through the atmosphere.
In the blood, it assumes the form of lymph corpuscles...
...and endlessly replicates...
...until it reaches the brain and destroys it.
Then it turns to protein and exits the body...
...leaving no trace at all.
That's as much as I know.
There's only one thing
I want to know:
How come Vincent's still alive?
What are you trying to do?
Are you doing this for money?
For revenge?
Or is it just a game to you?
I am only trying to find the door.
The door?
Have you ever had a dream where you're aware...
...that you are in the middle of a dream but can't wake up?
That's when it started.
From when I was still on Titan.
Vincent was a guinea pig.
He injected an anti-nanomachine into Vincent's blood.
Anti-nanomachine?
It replicates like nanomachines.
It destroys nanomachines.
It was a vaccine experiment.
Vincent started it.
Only he can stop it.
But we don't know his motive.
Maybe he doesn't have one.
Perhaps Vincent is just waiting for Judgment Day.
Doesn't Dr. Mendelo have everything?
Nanomachines, the vaccine?
He disappeared and deleted all the data from his computer.
He never imagined anyone could use his discovery.
He disappeared without a trace.
No one can stop Vincent.
I lost two things on Titan.
One was my past.
There were no opposing armies in that battle.
They were all killed to test the nanomachines as weapons.
I was used as a guinea pig...
The only one who survived.
I lost all memories of my early life.
I didn't even know who I was.
What was the other?
Did you see the butterflies?
I saw countless butterflies.
So many, so very beautiful.
When the nanomachines reach the brain, a light is seen.
It's as if...
The most beautiful sight in the world.
I've talked too long.
Rashid, please give this to the doctor.
Should you happen to meet him.
Yes, I will.
Okay, then. Inshallah!
What's this all about?
We're the ones who'd like an explanation.
Why does your blood have the anti-nanomachines?
How did this escape our attention?
We thought only Vincent had it.
How did you get it?
Have you contacted him?
We'll place you in protective custody.
If I have the vaccine in my body...
...can't we use it to protect the population?
You just don't get it.
Our sole purpose is...
...to completely destroy all record of the nanomachines.
With no records, they never existed.
Hi.
What is the bond that ties us all together?
It's not as if we're family.
There's no linking bond like that.
We each go our own way and do as we please.
They give me so much trouble.
I've had enough.
I want to be alone again.
One more move and I win.
Hey, leave them alone!
But does it matter?
So what if they don't come back?
The toss of a coin.
If it had come up tails,
I would've asked you on a date.
Nothing special, mind you.
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?
They'll either kill us or wipe out our memories.
We'll lose our identities anyway.
We'll be like the living dead.
Like Vincent?
The reason you survived the attack is because...
...you have them in you.
That... What is it?
Nanomachine vaccine?
- You know everything.
- It's like you said.
Knowing too much can shorten my life.
You're no ordinary bounty hunter,
Spike Spiegel.
You're too good to be just a soldier.
My name is Electra Ovilo.
So now I know.
It's a strong name.
I didn't know I had them inside my body.
Vincent was...
Poor Vincent was all alone from birth.
All he had as a boy was hate and the will to fight.
No one has ever loved him.
That's why I wanted to help him.
I thought I could, but I was very wrong.
Back there, on the monorail...
...he looked at me as if he didn't know me.
He had forgotten all about me.
Did you love him?
I don't know.
Have you ever experienced a brand-new feeling...
...that welled up inside your heart and filled you...
...with indescribable pain?
Yes, I have.
Maybe I was looking to be saved.
Years ago, back when
I was much younger...
...I was afraid of nothing.
I had not the slightest fear of death.
I was ready to die anytime.
But then I met a special woman.
She made me want to go on living.
For the first time,
I was afraid of death.
A feeling I'd never had before.
Where is she now?
She went away.
You're the first person
I can talk to like this.
What's between you and Vincent?
We share similar souls.
That's why I must find him.
He said his name was Spike, didn't he?
So he's a friend of yours?
How do you know?
What do you plan to do?
I came here to finish it.
The final party begins.
My next trick is special nanomachines.
These will not self-destruct.
They will multiply until...
You plan to destroy the world?
You... You're insane.
You think so?
Who decides where to draw the line of insanity?
Aren't there those who cross and recross the line?
Soon you will understand.
It's not me.
The rest of the world is insane.
Will you join me?
We'll be the only ones left alive.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't know what will happen, but I don't want that.
Do it by yourself.
- Vincent!
- I said never to come here.
Everything is ready to go.
I want to get away.
The cops are closing in.
- Pay me what you owe me.
- Have you prayed?
I'll be at the bridge connecting this world to heaven.
You can watch it all alone from purgatory.
What will happen to me?
You're a soldier.
You're prepared for it.
Do I get a cigarette?
One will do.
- Shall I, sir?
- Ignore him.
No, don't shoot!
Throw down the gun.
Open the door.
I'll have these.
Where are they?
At the waterworks.
I tracked Lee's hack route to the waterworks.
So he plans to put it into the city's water supply.
- The antiterrorist squad!
- Yes!
- That'll fix him!
- Don't we need permission?
If we don't, there'll be serious trouble.
This is a no-smoking area.
If we go through channels, we'll run out of time!
We've got a job to do.
Where's your blood sample?
This way.
It's open.
- Protective suits?
- No time!
They're behind us!
Where's Electra's vaccine?
It's being cultured in number three...
No, case number two.
- Is this it?
- The yellow packs.
I'm not lying, but it's not finished yet.
In 20 hours, each pack will have 100,000 units.
I'm sorry, Electra.
You can get out through Level 3.
Thanks.
So no date, I guess.
- Who are you?
- ISSP. We're taking over here.
I've had no such orders!
We ask your cooperation.
I can't let anyone see me like this.
Rest in peace.
Waiting for a call?
No, not particularly.
Aren't you waiting for Spike to call?
What? I didn't notice them leave.
- Hello?
- Vincent has gone.
Where the hell have you been?
He's planning a very nasty Halloween party.
How do you know that?
Spike! You idiot!
Where the hell were you?
- ISSP are headed for the waterworks.
- City waterworks?
Gate 2 all clear, sir.
Tank 3 shows no abnormalities, sir.
A suspicious object near the gate to Plant 4.
Bomb squad on the way.
Object appears to be...
...a pumpkin-shaped balloon.
That's strange.
Why is he dressed like a warlock?
There's a Halloween costume parade in Alva City.
So he wants to blend in?
He'll do it in the middle of town?
But how?
His accomplice said Jack was in place.
Jack?
Yes, I see.
Jack-o'-lantern?
Yes, a Halloween lamp.
We're starting now.
What's that?
Unit A, report!
Damn it! Find out what's going on.
- Sir!
- What is it?
It's the army, sir.
- Damn!
- Sir!
Who's in charge?
Who ordered the army to take over?
That's classified.
We're in charge now.
What gives you the right?
- National emergency.
- A what?
Test results are in.
Hurry up. Tell me.
I told you to leave!
It's composed of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide...
...with traces of argon, neon and krypton.
It's air, sir.
But the town will be full of jack-o'-lanterns.
He said he'd be at the bridge joining here to heaven.
What's that mean?
Jet, we need 20 to 30 aircraft as soon as possible.
What are you planning to do?
I'll take Swordfish.
Wait a minute!
Faye, go to the weather control centre.
Hey, not so fast.
You can't beat Vincent.
He's indestructible.
- We have unfinished business.
- It's a waste of time!
If he wanted to destroy the world, he'd have done it.
This invitation says the party won't start without the guest.
If you don't go, the party won't start.
Go for it!
Only death cures stupidity!
The army. What a nuisance!
I've got no time to play with you!
It's an emergency.
We need help!
But we have rules.
All our fighter jets are at the airshow celebration.
There's no time.
Anything that can fly will do!
You said anything?
It's too early to start the party.
They made good planes back in those days.
Can they actually fly?
We'll have no trouble spraying the vaccine for you.
Don't overdo it, old fella.
Where are we headed?
Saturn?
No, we're going to vaccinate the city to save it.
We're only going as far as Alva City.
I was just kidding!
They really can fly!
They're all museum pieces.
Haven't been flown for decades.
Don't give up now!
Hey, taxi!
Who's in charge?
Who are you?
As you can see,
I'm just a terrorist.
- What do you want here?
- Your demands?
I want it to rain.
Rain? What for?
Well, how about...
...rain on the parade?
This is hopeless.
The parade is tying up traffic everywhere.
The bridge to heaven?
You forgot to pay!
Has the party begun?
It's just starting.
Reminds me of the sinking of the Bismarck.
You old liar. That was back in WWll.
We're almost there.
Get ready.
I knew you'd come, bounty hunter.
The last time we met,
I managed to survive.
Your eyes are more than empty holes.
Come to save the world, have you?
You're too late for that.
Sorry. I'm just a bounty hunter.
It ain't none of my business.
I'm only here to get revenge on you.
You think this is just a threat?
I will do it.
Go ahead.
Before you die, tell me one thing.
I died up there on Titan.
Is this world the one the butterflies showed me in the dream?
Or is that world the actual reality...
...and my world just a dream?
I don't understand.
Vincent!
You won't get away this time.
No. Stay back, Electra.
Shall we go... together?
Vincent!
Why didn't you shoot?
I remembered...
She was the one I loved.
I wanted to escape from here.
I searched for the door out of this world.
But now I understand.
There is no door.
You should've known.
You were frightened to open your eyes and see.
Electra...
The time I spent together with you...
...was my only reality.
I'm so glad we could meet again at the end.
What did the rain do?
It spread the vaccine much faster...
...than the nanomachines could act.
Do you think there'll be a rainbow?
Jet? Want to go to the races?
You never learn, do you?
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.
Subtitles by Filou ;-)
You're going to love this one.
Listen up, here we go.
Here you go, Pluto. What did you think?
I don't know what to think, Tony.
I mean...
You got a dress on....
This is not a dress, it's a kilt.
Scottish tradition. Very manly, a kilt.
It's a manly dress.
No, a kilt.
That's how people know who I am.
People think of Anthony Frankowski, they immediately think "Scottish crooning."
There lies your problem. That's not even a thing. Did you make that up?
Yes, I made that up.
It's a thing if I made it up.
- It's horrible.
- It's my hook!
You know what you need to do if you're going to croon? Be Italian.
Be Anthony Frantucci.
- You want me to change my name?
- Yeah, to something that swings.
- Anthony Frandicci.
- That doesn't swing.
Anthony...
...Francis.
- Tony Francis.
- You like that?
I'm Tony Francis.
That's a good name.
You're Tony Francis now.
Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Francis.
Absolutely. I like it.
Lose the dress, change the name.
- Is your bathroom back there?
- Through the doors.
Tony Francis.
Am I supposed to piss in the kitchen?
No, it's off to the right.
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome Mr. Tony Francis!
"Oh, my God! It's Tony Francis! "
How is showbiz?
Disgusting.
Take a walk, hotshot.
Pluto, help me!
Pluto?
- Pluto Nash?
- That's right!
- When did you get out of the joint?
- A week ago.
Congratulations.
Thanks a lot.
I'm Gino.
This is my nephew, Larry.
Larry, say hello to Pluto Nash.
What's going on?
My brother was inside with you.
Angelo Sotobolo.
Angelo Cheesecake is your brother?
We used to play cards in his cell every weekend. He'd have the shit catered.
- He thinks the world of you.
- It's mutual.
Pluto is my best friend.
What are you guys doing?
What's going on, Gino?
We're cleaning out his digestive system.
Gino, I can't let you do that, man.
Pluto.
Your pal borrowed $2.5 million from me four years ago...
...to buy this joint.
- On an easy payment plan.
Here. I think that will get it off.
- How much does he owe you now?
- $2.5 million.
- He didn't pay anything back?
- No.
Any idiot can make money here.
This guy has to do his cockamamie act each night.
It's like a damn freak show.
I seen it. You see where this shit got you?
Gino, listen.
I'm not in the smuggling business anymore.
I'm opening my own club.
No kidding.
It's always been a lifelong dream of mine to have my own club.
Life...
Dinner and dancing and nice atmosphere.
Good place, hot music.
Once I get it going, I'll sit back, light up a cigar and enjoy the party.
What could be better?
Nothing could be better.
We could be partners.
You know what?
What if I pay off his debt, take over this place, and we call it square?
Let's have a drink and talk about it.
Out of these glasses?
- Are you crazy? Across the street.
- All right.
What will you do about my friend?
Anthony?
My gift to you.
You're a prince.
I'll go across the street and have some beers and work out the logistics.
Just sit here in your skirt and I'll see you in a minute.
9:18 Lunar Grand Express... 
... now ready for general boarding on platform 22. welcome to the Moon. while you're here, be sure and visit the Lunar Grand Resort and Casino... 
... only two hours away by hover shuttle. 
Remember, Moon Beach is the only place in the universe where gambling is legal. 
The Lunar Grand. 
The perfect family vacation. 
Incoming!
Thanks, Pluto!
Pace yourselves. It's only 10:00.
This ain't a bachelor party.
Yeah, it is.
Tommy here is getting divorced tomorrow.
- Really? Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I tell you what. Drinks are on the house for the rest of the night.
You're the best, Pluto!
Excuse me a second.
Thanks a lot, Pluto.
He's the best!
Crank it up. I'm not running a library in here! Crank it up!
All right!
Keep it like that! Keep it pumping!
Hey, Miguel!
- Not bad for a Tuesday night.
- Not bad at all.
It's like the whole city turned out.
We've come a long way, baby.
Long way. All right, partner.
- Look at that ass. I'll be right back.
- Oh, my goodness.
Sorry, I'll get that.
Sorry.
It's all right, it's okay.
Could you help me?
I'm looking for the owner, Pluto Nash.
Why are you looking for that lowlife?
It's personal.
He doesn't even know you.
- Yes, he does.
- No, I don't.
You're him?
Last time I checked. How can I help you?
I just came all the way from Salt Lake City.
Rough town.
I'm a good singer. I got this gig, they gave me a one-way ticket up here.
But the guys who own the nightclub sold it.
I'm dead broke. I need a job.
I want to go home. Can you help me out?
Sorry, I can't help you.
I'm sure there's a bunch of clubs that can use a good singer, but we got a DJ.
Take it easy.
I'm sure they could, but my Moon card expired...
...and I was told you were the one person in town who might overlook that.
Who told you something foolish like that?
You know my father, Nicholas Lake?
Never heard of him.
Nicky Sticks?
That's your father?
Unbelievable. That's something.
Normally I don't call in favors, but my dad did save your life back in '76.
He didn't save my life, I saved his life.
And I lost a fine automobile in the process.
Unless you got a new Plymouth with my name on it, I got nothing to say.
So, good night.
Thanks, Dad.
I should have known. I'm sorry.
Maybe I got something.
Really? Great! Shall we say two shows a night, five nights a week?
Shall we say six nights a week waiting tables?
You can save up your tips, make enough money to get back home. Deal?
Deal.
- Is it like this every night?
- Only the slow ones.
Somebody is coming in.
Sorry, fellows, we're closed.
We're here to see Mr. Nash.
Is he expecting you?
$10 million is more than a fair offer,
Mr. Nash.
I don't know. I own the most successful club in Little America.
I own it outright.
I'm my own boss, and I have the hottest...
I got the best party in town.
Why would I want to sell this place?
$10 million?
Get your shit off my desk!
No, boys.
Please meet my friend and bodyguard, Bruno.
Gentlemen.
Bruno, the boys.
Looks like you're about due for a trade-in.
Hey, Bruno.
What are you, a '65?
Model '63 Deluxe.
'63? Talk about ancient.
Your sister didn't seem to mind.
Screw you, robot!
He can be fixed, you can't.
We don't mean to cause any problems.
He's reaching, you know?
Okay. No reaching.
Mr. Nash...
...this is non-negotiable.
Rex Crater is buying your club.
I was wondering when you all was going to get to me.
$10 million.
Tell Mr. Crater, thanks, but no, thanks.
I won't sell my club.
If I have my way, no one here will sell their place...
...because we like this town the way it is.
So, if you'd be so kind, get out.
Rex Crater does not like to be disappointed.
I'll just have to send Mr. Crater a case of Scotch!
- Great first night, Dina.
- Thanks.
Do me a favor. Run this up to Pluto.
I need to lock up the back.
Thank you very much.
Miguel?
This isn't some send-up-the-new-girl kind of a thing, right?
No. Relax. He wouldn't do that.
You're safe, go ahead.
Come on in.
Perfect timing.
Miguel asked me to bring it up.
Perfect.
Should I make it for you?
No, I mix my own martinis.
But thank you, anyway.
I got it down to a pretty good science.
Perfect.
I wanted to thank you again for the job.
- Don't even mention it.
- Well, I am mentioning it. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Let me get this, okay?
- Hello?
- Hello, Nash. 
Don't call me this time of night.
What's wrong with you?
You know Tony Francis?
I knew him back when he was Anthony
Frankowski. We were like brothers.
We grew up together. Me and Anthony
Frankowski, who would later become...
I'll tell you a real funny story in a second.
Hello?
Just wanted to give you one last chance to change your mind. 
Look, no now and no tomorrow.
No means no. Leave me alone.
Now, you look...
Clown.
Who was that?
One of Rex Crater's boys, trying to buy me out.
Why is he so set on buying your club?
Because they're about to approve gambling in this town.
If Crater gets his way, they'll turn the Moon into a big casino.
You can't sell your club till I make enough money to get back home.
I'll let him know the next time he calls that you got to get your money first.
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- I don't know!
Come on.
Bruno!
Bomb detonated. Evacuate.
Evacuate.
Bomb detonated.
Evacuate.
Bruno, look what they did to my place!
Pluto!
Damn!
Let's get them.
No. Stay here with her!
- Bruno, I think that's one of them.
- I'll intercept the call.
"Nash is alive. He took off after Jimmy, who's headed for the Vac.
"Be ready for him."
What's the Vac?
The Perfect Vacuum, at the corner of Glenn Avenue and Fifth. Why?
Didn't you hear the phone call?
I'm sorry, I cannot listen and hear at the same time.
You see, I'm a '63.
Only later models can do that!
- Pluto's in trouble. Come on.
- Trouble?
- Is that as fast as you go?
- I'm a '63! I'm at top speed!
Get out of the way!
Reset. Reset. Reset. 
You try to shake me down, then you blow up my club?
You blew up my wood barstools!
You know how hard it is to get wood on the Moon?
Shit!
You want to play games?
You have to shoot around your boy!
It's easier to shoot through him.
Shit!
- Pluto, it's a trap!
- Yeah, no kidding!
Did you ever shoot a gun before?
Time to go, Bruno!
All clear, boss!
Come on!
Bruno, heel!
- You are really something, you know that?
- Thank you.
You walked right into a trap any idiot could see from a mile away.
I was walking right out until you came along.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
You put your neck on the line,
I appreciate that.
But in the future, not that there'll be a future, if I need your help, I'll ask.
Don't worry about it,
I'm getting out of here.
I saved your life twice. Least you can do is loan me enough money so I can go home.
I would, but they'll be looking for you at every bus station and shuttle launch.
Me? They don't even know what I look like.
Every club in this city has a biometric camera system.
They took hundreds of pictures of you.
They know what you look like.
Only way you're going home now is in a box.
That's just great. Now what?
After you.
Hey, Roy.
Pluto! What are you doing here?
My place is getting redecorated and I need a place overnight.
Sure! 3D. The code is 4-5-7.
Thanks, Roy.
So, this is the Garden of Paradise.
My, my.
If this is too glitzy for you...
...tomorrow we can get a room at the Garden of Eden.
They got a bathroom on every floor.
I hate the Moon.
Know why Mooners can't stand Earthlings?
You think everything back Earth is better and can't stop talking about it.
I went back Earth once and the air smelled funny.
Sneezing all the time, rained every day, bugs and shit everywhere.
You know the only thing I liked about it?
- You could see the Moon at night?
- Bingo.
- Is something wrong with your toaster?
- He's all right. He's just recharging.
Can he hear us?
Not while he's charging.
Shouldn't your bodyguard be able to keep up with you on the way to a gunfight?
You might want to think about trading him in.
I can't trade in Bruno.
We got a history together.
I got 20 years of rill-hopping experience wired into him.
- Rill-hopping?
- Well, that's a...
Smuggling. That's what I went to jail for.
He ain't the fastest thing in the world, but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes.
A little smokier than usual.
- He's a fire hazard.
- He's all right.
Where are you going?
I got to go talk to an old friend, see what I can find out.
What am I supposed to do?
Make sure
Bruno don't burn the place down.
- You're leaving me alone with him?
- I left.
Pluto!
You're getting kind of old, Rowland.
You should be so lucky. Every lowlife in town is looking to whack you.
I'm a popular guy. What can I say?
You want to lose some money?
No, but you'll lose money.
We'll play some eight ball, regular stakes.
- I will kindly empty your wallet for you.
- You're on.
How is your mother?
Still breaking hearts.
Pizza time. 
She should have married me.
You should have went to the gym and lost weight.
I'd have lost the weight if she married me.
Otherwise, what's the point?
I really need your help.
I got to get to Rex Crater.
Forget it. Nobody gets to him.
- Who the hell is this guy?
- A myth, an enigma.
He lives in a penthouse above the Lunar Grand Hotel.
Never comes out.
You was a cop for 20 years.
You got to have some kind of idea who he is.
Some people think he's a clone.
There was a clone doctor named Runa Pedanken.
Made a big name for herself creating a basketball team from one old guy.
The Air Jordans.
Right after cloning was outlawed back Earth, Pedanken came up here.
She was the best in her field until she got herself murdered.
That was about eight years ago.
I'm going to need to hack into police files.
You mean, you need me to hack into police files.
I thought you'd never ask.
Pedanken, Runa. Initiate global search.
File deleted.
Sorry, that's all there is.
She wasn't doing this by herself.
Who worked with her?
She had an assistant.
We questioned her for days about the murder. Got nothing.
That's because you have no finesse.
Who is she and where do I find her?
Mona Zimmer.
Runs a body alteration shop on Microsoft and Sixth.
That's what I love about you.
I ask you a simple question, four hours later, I get a simple answer.
Boss?
Where did the boss go?
I don't know. Out.
He said to wait for him here.
Out?
He never goes anywhere without me.
And I heard that toaster crack.
Bruno, give me that old badge you got.
- Who are we going to arrest?
- I need your help.
Sure.
Where are we going?
It's just got to be the two of us.
You go next time. Promise.
That's gratitude for you.
We were hoping that for our anniversary we could get a brand-new us.
How romantic.
You're in luck!
I just happen to have a cancellation.
Fantastic!
Are you all original or have you been previously improved?
All original.
Really?
Yes, from top to bottom.
Okay, then.
Well, what exactly did you have in mind?
We were thinking we could start with some ass-resculpting for her...
...to get a little more bubblage...
I happen to have a great ass!
I'm not saying your ass isn't great.
We'd like something...
Could you do something about his big mouth?
Do you have any catalogues?
Maybe we could get some ideas.
Come this way,
I'll show you exactly what you want.
Thank you.
Come on, honey.
Look at the asses on the wall.
Yeah. Don't push it.
Let's start with some of the basic body types.
Here's one I think you'll really like.
The Amazon.
I don't like that. That makes me look like a big dufus, doesn't it?
- Where would we buy clothes?
- I don't want to be the big dufus.
Good point. Let me try again.
This one I'm particularly proud of.
The Venice Beach.
Wait a minute.
I think you done found something there.
Look at that, honey.
Yeah, look at that. Look at me!
This is me?
It could be.
Honey, I'm looking and I'm thinking...
...that you need to rethink the ass enhancement. It will work, it will help out.
What you want is to have a... You know?
She also needs a little more of this, too, up top. Can you fix this?
If you could spruce these up a little.
Just a little sprucier.
I know that she has ample now.
But I'm talking titties galore.
Let's have the titties really flowing.
Yeah, like that.
Look at that.
Why don't we step into my office and discuss the terms?
Yes, let's go in and sign up! Look at that!
Before we get started, there's a few things
I'd like to talk over with you.
First of all, will you be paying in cash...
...or would you like to take advantage of our flexible financing plan?
All in cash, all at once.
- Excellent! Medical records?
- Right here.
And police permit?
Our police permits?
I think you'll find that our police permits are in order.
Police permits.
Sorry, no can do. Not without a police permit. It's Body Alteration 101.
You could be fugitives, killers, anybody.
No, we're just a couple trying to put the spark back in our relationship.
The idea of revealing such personal details to the police.
Please, Dr. Zimmer?
All right. Come back tonight, 8:00 sharp.
But it's another $10,000 upon completion.
All right. Then, doctor, you are busted.
Give me a break.
What are you guys, the Health Department?
You wish we were.
Listen, you got one chance.
You answer some questions for me.
And I want the truth.
Okay, what do you want to know?
- When you worked for Runa Pedanken...
- I never heard of her.
You want to play games?
Put the cuffs on her.
Come on, cuff her.
No! Just hold on!
Hold the cuffs.
Tell me everything you know and don't play games with me, Mona.
Talk to me. What do you know?
Right now.
All right, all right.
Towards the end, Runa was dealing with some pretty heavy characters...
...but she didn't tell me who.
And she didn't keep any records.
But one day I walked into her office as she was showing one of the guys out...
...and he left his briefcase behind.
The initials WZW were embossed on it...
...in gold.
And it was made out of genuine alligator skin. Are you with me?
Earth goods.
That's all I know. I swear it.
Just for the record, I have never had one complaint about my ass.
I was just playing. I said that for the lady.
It was part of the scam.
Ma, what are you doing here?
Seeing that you're all right.
Ma, this is Dina. Dina, my mother.
You're his mother?
Why, you got a problem with that?
I'm surprised.
You could easily pass for his sister.
Thank you.
Why are you gallivanting around?
You'll wind up dead.
I got to take care of those guys that blew up my club.
- You got to get your ass off the Moon!
- I don't think so.
You think you're a hot-shit, ex-rill-hopping, burned-down-club-owning guy...
...but once in a while, listen to your mother.
All right, I'll get off the Moon!
But can I get something to eat first?
God!
Bruno, get some beer and sandwiches.
And you ought to be a little nicer to your robot.
Be nicer to my robot?
You been in here bitching to my moms?
Gentlemen.
Suite with a hot tub?
Which room is Nash in?
Lie to me and I will blow your head off.
3D.
You take the stairs.
You two, take the elevator.
Let the robots take the stairs.
You stay here.
Pluto, this is Roy. You got company.
We got to move out of here.
Come on, this way!
Bruno, check and see if we can get out the window!
Model DRL '84.
Very nice.
Bruno!
Excuse me.
Too high to jump!
Bruno, see what you can do with these bolts.
Okay. Ready?
Go!
Freeze!
Raise your hands!
Excuse me. Can I get through here?
Go back to your room, lady.
- Nice shooting, Ma!
- Thanks, baby.
I'll call you back.
Stay here!
Bruno, enough!
Rowland, it's Pluto.
I got to get to the Far Side.
I need you to get me a spacesuit.
Make that two spacesuits.
One for a female about 5'7".
I'll tell you when I get there.
- This is Dina.
- Nice to meet you.
Hi. Thanks.
I'm getting ready to leave town.
How will you get to the Far Side?
Walk there?
I got that covered.
I'm arranging for some transportation.
That's it.
- Code generator serial number?
Check.
It's not my business, but why don't we just rent a car instead of stealing one?
Because you can't rent these.
- What's so special about it?
- It's a Chrysler DeSoto S-5000.
It cruises on a 14-inch cushion of air, hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain.
It's heat and meteor resistant, with a torque compressor power thrust...
...and a kick-ass sound system.
Trust me on this one.
Bruno, I need an ignition chip.
This might do the trick.
It will work perfect.
Got to love a place where your bodyguard and car have interchangeable parts.
Smart-ass. After you.
Good evening, Mr. Vandervoort. 
James here. Aren't you early, sir? 
We're surprising Mrs. Vandervoort with some jam and scones...
...and picking her up at a spa on the Far Side.
You're not Mr. Vandervoort at all. 
You're some hooligan trying to steal his motorcar. 
I won't have it! 
Shut up and drive. Head for the Far Side.
I'll give you to the count of three before I alert the authorities. One. 
Sorry, James. You're too late.
I have disconnected your alarm relay.
So get moving, Jimmy boy, or you'll have a speech impediment.
Good God, I'm being stolen! 
Take over for a while, James.
I will not be an accomplice in this. 
You're not an accomplice, you're a hostage. Do it.
- I won't be intimidated. 
- Do it!
All right. 
Thank you.
Nice work, James.
Yeah, James. You little asshole.
I heard that. 
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.
Hey, listen,
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.
All right.
How long does the night last up here?
Two weeks.
- That's so depressing.
- No, it's not. It's nice. Look at this.
When I was a little boy,
I used to come out here with Rowland...
...look up and count the stars, and dream about what was out there.
I never heard such drivel in my life! 
What kind of refreshments you got back here?
Dreadfully sorry, sir. we weren't expecting anyone. 
I know you got something.
You going to make me house it?
Champagne and caviar!
Don't touch those, they're for guests! 
James, we are guests.
He'll get her drunk and have his way with her. 
You know something?
Bad luck, old boy! 
We were ambushed?
- Ambushed?
- Yes, sir.
Really? Well, they're just not playing fair.
Any other excuses? Problems at home, cold coming on, work too stressful? What?
- Nothing, sir.
- Good.
Because the next time I talk to Rex Crater,
I need to say Nash is dead.
- That's all he wants to hear.
- It's as good as done.
Or else you are.
Get out of here.
We'll get right on it, sir.
Where are we?
Safe. It's an old prospecting dome.
We found it years back.
Nobody knows about it but me and Bruno.
What's the temperature out here?
It's about 200 below.
Balmy.
Play's over. Get down here.
Okay.
That was fun.
Memories.
Had a lot of memories in here, Bruno.
Look at all this junk.
What do you mean "junk"?
This is called inventory.
Show a little respect.
This is what's left of my life's work.
Very interesting help you have around here.
That's an old program I forgot to delete.
Left it on "Oops! "
I forgot that was in there.
Miss me?
Guess not.
She's an excellent piece of multi-functional software.
Initiate search.
Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials WZW.
WZW.
No WZW.
Nothing. Thank you.
Thanks for nothing. Worthless computer.
How's it going?
It's not going at all.
Babette made lunch.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Can I help?
Computer's got no information on our mystery man.
I'm starting to think that that Zimmer conned us.
Here's your problem.
Zimmer said WZW, not MZM.
You're just looking at it upside...
Wait a minute.
You did it! Look at you! You're a genius!
Look what you did.
She saw it upside down.
Watch this.
Initiate search. Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials MZM.
Okay. You see? Now we have something.
Open file 10-1 7 MM.
How do you feel about your acquittal, 
Mr. Marucci? 
Makes me proud to live in this great country where justice is still served. with gambling to be outlawed on Earth, will the Giovanetto syndicate... 
... engender a consortium to perpetuate a new gambling coalition on the Moon? will the what do what to the what? 
Speak English, sweetheart. will you and the other major organized crime figures on Earth...
Organized crime? 
I don't know nobody in organized crime. 
Listen, darling... 
... you want to ask me a question, let's sit down somewhere. we'll open a bottle of wine, get to know each other better. 
Get a new dress, a nice pair of shoes. 
Be at my hotel around 7:00. what are you waiting for, a dance? 
I forgot the stairs were there. 
Back it up.
Let me take it in a little closer here.
And closer still.
What do you see?
So Mike Marucci is Rex Crater?
One way to find out.
That's pretty far-fetched, Pluto.
But I buy it.
Marucci had the bucks, he had the balls.
He had the background to build Moon Beach.
Not to mention he wouldn't mind whacking anybody who got in his way.
So I noticed. 
Pluto, when you make an enemy, you don't mess around.
Yeah, you know me. 
I'm gonna see an old buddy at the FBI,
I'll get back to you.
Right. 
Listen to that! That's Connecticut.
Listen how clear.
What's this?
No, don't do that! Stop!
That's a cryogenic Chihuahua!
It's a real dog?
Yeah, it's very delicate.
You know it's illegal to bring pets here.
But I got a friend back in Juárez who knows how to freeze-dry these things.
Look at that. It's a girl.
Pop that little bitch in the particle wave for two minutes on defrost...
...she'll be running around the room.
I used to get $5,000 a pop for these things.
Where'd you do your singing back Earth?
Weddings, bar mitzvahs, reincarnation rituals.
The usual gigs. I hit a rut...
...so I sent my tape to a club I heard about up here. Figured, what the hell?
They sent me a one-way ticket.
But when I got here, the place had been sold.
I checked the water tanks.
We have enough to stay here for months.
What about food?
Plenty.
Let's have a dinner party.
Let's change the mood in this place.
All right.
He seems a little... Does he get angry?
No. He has a happiness chip
I had installed. That's why he's always...
- Does he mind when you make fun of him?
- No, the happiness chip.
I wish I had a happiness chip in my ass so I'd always be happy.
Has one-sixth gravity been giving you chronic back pain? we at the Lunar Lumbar Clinic specialize in replacing the lumbar vertebrae... 
... with our patented epoxy spinal substitute. 
You see, once Dr. Pedanken was murdered...
...there's no link to prove a Marucci clone ever existed!
- Please, after we eat, okay?
- Now I got to buy you dinner, too?
I'll tell you, Jack...
...detective work was a lot easier before they invented cloning.
At least you knew who your friends were.
Who is that?
Nobody even has this number.
- Ma!
- Pluto! 
Get off this line.
What if somebody is tracing this call?
Pluto, Rowland is dead! 
They found him murdered. 
How could they do this? 
I can't believe this. 
Pluto, please get off the Moon! 
They're going to kill you, too. 
Did you hear me? 
I got some business to take care of. I'll be back in touch.
Pluto.
Bruno!
- Come on!
- Yes, boss!
They killed Rowland!
You know why? We came too close to the truth. It's time to confront Marucci!
- We better wear protection.
- You'll be safe here.
You're leaving me behind?
- What is that?
- Recreational vehicle approaching.
Let's get it right this time, okay?
Registered to Lunar Grand Hotel.
- What the hell is that?
- I'd put on my spacesuit if I were you.
I count five of them.
Four with 43-K Magnums and one Scorpion rocket launcher.
- Initiate countermeasures!
- There are no countermeasures.
- Break out all the assault weapons!
- We sold them, remember?
Where's that big-ass street sweeper with the supercharger?
It's at your mom's.
Great! What are we going to do?
Bathroom!
- Bathroom?
- Yeah, come on!
Babette, secure yourself!
Bruno, hold us down!
Johnson, stay with me.
You three, go in and make sure we got him.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Come here!
- What are you doing?
- Saving your ass!
Shit!
Johnson, behind you!
Goddamn it!
Stay with me!
James, open up!
Bruno!
Bruno! 
Let's go!
- How did they find us?
- Obviously you did something stupid. 
That's good.
Hold it.
Engage power thrust, now! why don't you just give yourself up? 
- Engage the power thrust right now!
- Power thrust engaged. 
We lost them. We're good to go now. who's going to pay for the damage to the vehicle... 
... not to mention the caviar and champagne? 
I'll send you a check.
Shit!
- Ram them.
- What?
Ram them!
Stay on them.
Okay!
Go, go, go!
Die, die, Pluto Nash.
- I'm hit! 
- Quiet!
I'm hit! 
Bruno, you see that rill right there?
No rills, please! 
It's a clear approach and a perfect lip!
- What's a rill?
- That's a rill!
Pluto.
- Are you crazy?
- Hold on!
Say when, Bruno!
Three, two, one...
...go!
Stop, stop!
That's why they call us rill-hoppers.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Evacuate! Evacuate! 
Put your helmet on!
- Why?
- Hurry, get it on! where are you going? 
- Overboard, brother.
- It's been real, James.
Great, so I'll just sit here and blow up, shall I? 
- Can we go home now?
- No!
Get us to the other side.
All right.
Even if they bailed out before the explosion, they still couldn't survive out here, right?
Let's go.
Excuse me, could you give me a lift? 
I have some information about the people that you're looking for. 
Come back here! 
I can help you find them, you bastards! 
What do we do now?
We start walking.
We don't have any food or water.
We'll run out of air long before we need food and water. Trust me.
- I can't breathe.
- Come on, Dina, hang in there.
Hang in there.
Dina.
Dina.
Boss.
Boss...
...battery...
...low.
Shit!
- Stay down or you'll pass out again.
- Okay.
You on a nature walk or something?
No, the thrusters on my vehicle blew out.
What's going on? Where are we?
It's okay. I just rescued you.
My name is Felix Laranga.
Felix, I'm Pluto and that's Dina.
Pluto?
- Pluto Nash?
- Yeah.
The Pluto Nash?
Yeah.
Get out of here, I'm your number one fan!
You're the reason
I got into the smuggling business.
Honey, let me tell you something.
This man is the Tito Puente of rill-hopping.
Right here, this is the guy.
Could you bring my robot inside?
He needs to be recharged.
Well, look, I had a really bad robot experience once.
I had this fine robot mamita and I rented her out...
...took her back to my place, we started getting busy.
All of a sudden, there's a malfunction, and bam! She does a Terminator on me.
Busted a couple of my ribs, dislocated my shoulder.
I'm lucky I'm still alive.
Don't worry about Bruno, he's not going to hurt you.
As long as you don't try to get busy with him.
Ordinarily, I'd say no.
But for Pluto Nash, I'll do anything.
I appreciate it.
You think you might be able to give us a ride to Moon Beach?
Bro, I'll take you to Miami Beach if that's where you got to go.
I'll be right back.
Check it out.
Lunar Grand Casino dice, loaded and 100%% % undetectable.
You want a set, as a personal gift from me?
Thanks, but I'm not really a big gambler.
With those dice, you ain't gambling.
We're not going to gamble.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
If you're not a gambler, why are you going to Moon Beach?
- I'm going to see an old friend of mine.
- Who's that?
Rex Crater.
Rex Crater is a friend of yours?
Yeah, sure.
Can you comp me a suite with a sunken living room bathtub...
...and a waterbed with a mirror on the ceiling?
Yeah, probably.
Damn!
Pluto Nash is down with Rex Crater.
You know what, Felix?
Take these Hillarys.
We appreciate your helping us out.
No, you my man. You don't got to do that.
Take this, you helped us out.
I appreciate it.
I'm all right. I'll tell you what.
- Would you sign my helmet for me?
- Get out of here.
- Come on, give me an autograph.
- Are you serious?
It's not every day I get to hang out with Pluto Nash.
- Please.
- Okay, I'll sign it.
This is my first autograph.
What do you want me to sign?
"To Felix...
"...my buddy, who stuck with me through thick and thin, who I'll never forget."
Bro, I just saved your life.
"My buddy, who stuck with me through thick and thin, and saved my ass.
"Peace and love, Pluto Nash."
What's all that stuff you got on the rack back there?
That's a new shipment of stuff
I just smuggled in from Puerto Rico.
Is that right?
Top of the line, designer labels.
Why, you need something?
Yeah, we could use some clothes. welcome to Moon Beach and the Lunar Grand Hotel... 
... where luck is always on your side. welcome to Moon Beach and the Lunar Grand Hotel... 
... where luck is always on your side. 
Bruno, lay low for a minute.
Go get a magazine or something.
Meet us over by the elevators.
Hey, good-looking, how about slipping up to your room and playing with me awhile? 
Don't you want to do something exciting tonight? 
No!
Afraid you might get lucky? 
Hello.
Good evening. Checking in?
Actually, we're here to see Tony Francis.
The early show or the late show?
We're old friends. We come to see him in person. Where's his dressing room?
I can't tell you that, sir.
Really?
Tell you what, just give us a room and two tickets to the early show.
All set. Just give me a thumb print for the charges.
I'll pay in cash.
Cash is always easier.
Mr. Francis' show is black tie.
We have rentals available from the concierge.
All prettied up for Tony? Absolutely.
Peekaboo, I found you. Come on, big boy... 
... right here in the lobby! Oh, baby! 
You sick bastard! 
Security! 
All set.
Enjoy your stay.
Crazy-ass Tony!
All right. So far, so good.
Come with us.
- What's the problem?
- Is he with you?
Yes, he's my old friend from West Virginia.
What's going on?
Nice try.
After you've paid for the damages to this slot machine, we'll give Earl back.
- Wait a second...
- Here's your claim check.
Pick your robot up when you leave.
Let's go.
Sorry, boss.
You're not a robot, you're an animal! 
Line it up!
Yo, baby, you love me?
'Cause I love me, too!
Come here, baby!
I want bottles of champagne for those people over there...
You ready? Blow!
Yo, Pluto! My man, Pluto Nash!
Pluto Nash, come on!
Come here, Pluto.
I want to show you how to win big time!
Pluto, where are you going? Come on!
They're giving away $1,000 chips!
Come here!
Mr. Belcher, Nash just walked in the lobby.
Nash is alive.
You idiots!
All day, all day!
Watch this, honey!
Want a sip of champagne?
Let's go.
Give me those back.
Get your hands off me or I'll have you fired.
You know who I am? Felix Laranga!
Who?
You never heard of me
'cause you're stupid.
Ladies and gentlemen, the undisputed master of the universe... 
... Mr. Tony Francis! 
What an amazing act.
He's so different, so original.
Yeah.
What makes you so sure he'll help us out?
He'll help us.
He couldn't sing a note if it weren't for me.
You taught Tony Francis how to sing?
No, I convinced a bookie not to pour some acid down his throat.
Pack your bags,
I'm taking you home with me!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Please welcome the master of musical disaster...
...Ted Jefferies and the Ted Jefferies Orchestra.
Hit it, maestro!
There's a guy over there checking faces.
Turn towards me.
Okay, I think that worked.
It worked for me.
You were so wonderful, Tony.
What a great show!
It was a magnificent evening, wasn't it?
Is this the refund window?
Pluto Nash! My goodness, it's marvelous to see you! How have you been?
I'll tell you about it. This is Dina.
- I loved your show.
- Tony loves you for loving his show.
I want you to meet my wives,
Gina and Filomena.
A pleasure to meet you, Pluto and Dina.
My man, Anthony Frankowski!
- It's Francis, not Frankowski.
- Your wives don't know you're Polish?
- Nobody knows. You'll blow my cover.
- All right, it's our little secret.
You want to stay for dinner?
We made osso buco and pork and gnocchi, all Tony's mother's recipes.
No, thanks, we ate already.
- You're a freak.
- You have no idea.
Can I talk to you in private?
Absolutely.
Would you excuse us for a minute?
Sure!
You married twins?
They're not twins. I met the perfect woman and I had her cloned.
- Which one is which?
- Who cares?
Me and your boss, Rex Crater, we had a little misunderstanding.
What kind of misunderstanding?
He tried to have me killed and he blew up my club.
- How do you know it was Crater?
- I know it.
He offered to buy my club and I wouldn't sell it, so they blew it up.
Shit.
You got to help me get to Crater.
- Babe, I'm fond of breathing, you dig?
- Just tell me how to get to him.
I never even met him! He watches my show from up in his penthouse.
He sends down these messages:
"Your jokes suck. You walk like a peacock."
You wouldn't be singing if it wasn't for me, right?
Come on, man.
I might know a way for you to get up into his penthouse.
- After that you're on your own, Pluto.
- Thanks.
Pick up Bruno and pay the damages on that slot machine.
Rent a car and wait outside the front entrance of the hotel.
I might have to make a fast getaway.
- But what if you don't get away?
- I always get away.
Come on, we'll go this way.
Rex Crater's private penthouse elevator is right next to mine.
There's a way for you to get from my elevator into his.
How you doing?
Trust me, you'll love this.
All right, here we go.
I'll stop this so nobody bothers us.
- I gotta get that later.
- Shit!
That's Rex's elevator down there. See?
It only stops at the subbasement and his penthouse.
My elevator only goes as low as this floor.
How do I get from one elevator to the other one?
That's what Tony is here to help you with.
I'll tell you the whole thing.
Back up as far as you can go, get a good running start, jump out across.
- Jump across to what?
- The ledge! See that ledge down there?
Grab onto these wires and swing down onto the ledge.
- You want me to grab hot wires?
- How do you know they're hot?
Look, the shit is hot!
Grab the ones that aren't hot.
Swing down, get down to the ledge.
Then you wait an hour and a half till they bring Rex's late supper up to him.
When the elevator goes by, before it passes you, you jump on top.
Use this casino chip to unscrew the trapdoor on top of the elevator.
Jump down inside and take out the two robot guards, pop-pop!
Boom! You're alone in the elevator, you got a meeting with Rex.
What's plan B?
This is Plan B.
I'm here to accept Mr. Crater's offer.
- Is that right?
- It's all settled. $10 million.
- We'll have to get back to you on that.
- I got to get ready for my next show.
Get them out of here.
Sorry, your robot remains property of this casino...
...until the damages to our slot machines are taken care of.
I'm here to pay you.
Repairs hasn't sent down a bill yet.
You would be a real peach if you could get me that bill.
Harry, I got a Bruno '63 Deluxe. wrecked a slot machine. 
Owner wants to pick him up. 
How much they owe? 
I haven't even looked at the damn thing yet. 
Have him check with us tomorrow morning. 
What are they saying?
You'll be spending the night.
It's been fun.
Excuse me.
- I got to take a leak.
- Robots don't take leaks.
You're absolutely right.
Come on.
We need to get a car.
What are you in such a hurry for?
You wanted to talk to Mr. Crater?
Here you are.
I finally get to meet the great Rex Crater?
Or is it Mike Marucci?
Yeah, Mike Marucci.
Thought you were so damn smart,
I figured you out.
I should come over there and put my foot in your fat grease-ball ass.
So you got it all figured out, huh?
It is a pleasure to meet me.
I'm pretty feisty, huh?
What's this, a rented tuxedo?
You know, you're old enough to own your own tuxedo.
Sit down! You know, you should be honored.
Only person besides yourself to ever come up here is Belcher over there.
What's going on here?
Remember when they cut your appendix out eight years ago in prison?
Gambling had just been outlawed on Earth, so my old boss...
...Mike Marucci, commissioned
Dr. Runa Pedanken to create a clone...
...of someone who knew their way around the Moon.
For what?
He was starting a gambling operation and needed someone to front for him.
Someone intelligent, that he could control.
A puppet.
That didn't jive with my career plan so I sent Marucci and Pedanken into orbit.
Then, for sentimental reasons, or because I'm a nice guy, I let you live.
Until you got in my way.
Let's face it, why should I keep you around?
For what? I got your good looks, your charm and your wit.
I even got your memories.
- You got my memories?
- Yeah.
Never wondered how my people knew to look for you in your hideout?
Or the Paradise Motel, which, by the way, is a disgusting establishment.
I'm surprised you didn't break into a rash after staying there.
Next time I'll remember to find better accommodations.
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp have arrived, sir. 
Yes. By all means, send them in.
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp.
I've been waiting for those two gentlemen.
- Boss?
- Quiet.
Hey, everybody!
Nash.
- What's Nash doing here?
- No, I'm Rex Crater.
No, you're Pluto Nash.
No, I beg to differ. I'm Rex Crater.
This is Pluto Nash.
Oh, my God.
Isn't it something? But enough about him.
Mr. Mogan, I want to personally thank you for the outstanding job you've done.
Thank you, sir.
It was a pleasure and an honor.
You see, when you have the experience me and my men have, it's quite easy...
Oh, shit.
Incompetent jackasses.
Get them out of here.
I'd love to let you hang around so you can entertain me...
...but we might have a conflict of interest.
But there's something I want you to see before I say bye-bye to you.
Look at that.
An excellent piece of real estate, but you never took advantage of its potential.
This...
This is wrong.
That should say Rex's, because this is Rex's.
Little America's most exclusive new casino!
Tell me, what do you think?
Little America is not a gambling town and Pluto's isn't a casino.
I think you're a clown and you should take all this stupid casino shit out.
If you get your dumb-ass name off the front...
...maybe you'll be in business for more than a week.
- Sorry, it's not wood, is it?
- Yes, and it's hand-carved!
Sorry! I'm sorry!
Pick that shit up!
Shit.
Hold it, right there, robot.
Which one's Pluto?
Which one's Rex?
Belcher!
- Shoot him, Belcher!
- Shoot him, Belcher!
Damn it!
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!
Don't aim at me, he's Nash! Shoot him!
He's not me, I'm me! He's him!
Shoot him!
Boss, which one is you?
Pluto?
Idiots! He's the one in the rented tuxedo!
Rex!
Boss?
- It's him!
- This piece of shit belongs to him!
Now shoot him!
- What's the matter with you guys?
- It was hairy there for a minute.
Hairy for you?
Get the hell out of here! Get out!
Hairy, my ass.
You sing, don't you?
You're a singer, right? I got a job for you.
Just kill me and get it over with.
You're going to work, but not singing.
Waiting tables, six nights a week.
If you're lucky and save your tips, maybe you'll get back to Utah.
Pluto.
I didn't scare you, did I? You all right?
Boss!
I was hoping it was you.
Never leave home without an undershirt, right?
Isn't that what you always say?
Never leave home without an undershirt.
That's rule number one.
I agree!
Craps, you lose!
For the grand reopening of Club Pluto... 
... please welcome Miss Dina Lake! 
Pluto!
Pluto, baby!
Fantastic club! Great joint, baby.
Thanks a lot. Let me say that the Mrs. Francis'...
...are looking lovely tonight.
- Thank you, Pluto.
- Have a good time.
- All right, baby.
Did I tell you ladies how I got Pluto started in the business?
Tell us, Tony.
What about a ham sandwich without the cheese? How much would that be?
Free!
Felix Laranga's money is no good here.
Knock yourself out, whatever you want.
Thanks, Pluto!
Pluto Nash, I love that man!
Honey, I tell you what: Eight steaks, a crate of lobsters, shrimp cocktail...
...onion rings, fries, a doggy bag to go...
How is it going with you and Babette?
Me and Babette?
I don't think it's gonna happen.
I found out that I'm 1 10 volts and she's a 220.
Go to the hardware store and get an adapter.
No. That just ruins it for me.
I guess it wasn't meant to be, huh?
Bruno, you see my new bodyguard running around here?
- New bodyguard?
- I bought a '78, fully loaded, out the door.
Shall I begin disassembling myself?
If you do that, how will you manage my club in 500 pieces?
Manage? But no robot has ever been in management.
You want the job or not?
Oh, boss!
Oh, thank you, boss!
You're the best boss on the whole Moon!
You almost broke my ribs.
Pull up a chair. Let's sit back and celebrate and enjoy the party.
Sorry, no can do. We've got a pile of bills, the payroll is tomorrow.
We need a new doorman and we're low on shrimp.
I'm swamped!
This is it, Digipals.
In a few seconds, the doors will open for the best movie of all time.
A Digimon movie.
Seven hours of waiting in line and skipping breakfast...
...have finally paid off.
Nanette Manoir.
The end of the line starts at the end.
Au contraire, Angela Anaconda.
The end is for riffraff, which is French for:
Those who must wait since they don't have...
...all-access, VlP passes.
But thanks ever so for keeping our spot warm.
"Thanks for keeping our spot warm."
We are going to have to get digidrastic if we want to get the best seats.
Get ready to rumble.
Hey, wait up! I was first in line!
Saved!
Guys? Where are my best friends?
Refills are free, right?
Taken! Sorry! Saved! Back up, Grandma!
That's it!
If my friends do not get here soon--
Popcorn! Thanks, Johnny Abatti.
Digimon! Digimon!
We're about to have the best view of the best movie, in the best seats ever!
Hats, view, blocking!
S'il vous plait, Angela Anaconda.
As if we would ever be so gauche as to wear them in the actual theater.
Mrs. Brinks, we saved you a seat.
Enjoy the show, Angela Anaconda.
So Mrs. Brinks and Ninny-poo think they can block the Digimon show...
...with their big, fat,
Digimon-blocking heads, do they?
Well, not for long.
Angela Anaconda, digivolve to Angelamon!
Well, look who's here.
Ninnymon and her Brinksimonster robot...
...come to block our view of the entire world.
Prepare for battle, you pathetic Pukimon.
But first, let's make some concessions.
After all, refills are free. Right, Ginamon?
"Help me, Angelamon, more powerful
Digimon than l", you will cry.
Don't worry, Ninny-whinnymon.
My pal Johnnymon is here to give you a kick-start.
And now, get ready for my ultimate, anti-Ninnymon...
...super-secret powers.
Angela!
Angelamon! Angelamon!
Digimon!
-Digimon!
-Excusez-moi, but if you common...
...Iine waiters can't adhere to theater etiquette...
...then I'll be forced to summon an usher.
Oh, Guinevere, je t'aime depuis le premier jour.
I've loved you since the first day.
This isn't Digimon!
This is some boring, phony, fake French film.
But that means....
We're in the wrong theater.
I called dibs on the best seats!
Good heavens!
Who says,
"There's no such thing as monsters "?
You're never quite the same after you meet your first Digimon.
My name's Kari. I'm part of a team called the DigiDestined.
There were a handful of us at first, but we've added a few members since then.
That's me with T.K., another one of the DigiDestined.
And that's Willis, in America.
While the rest of us in Japan only had one Digimon, he had twins.
And while we had our team to count on...
... Willis didn't have any human friends, only his two Digimon.
His digital adventures, as well as ours, began that night, eight years ago.
Did you know there are actually two worlds?
Our world and the Digital World.
Now, don't plan a vacation there.
I'm not even sure where it is.
But when I first saw it, I was so scared,
I was so nervous, I was so cute.
That's my brother Tai, when he was a little kid.
Even back then, he was a born leader.
Brave, strong and graceful.
That night started like every other one.
Tai was making his fourth trip to the bathroom.
Kari, what are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to play with the computer.
But it's doing something weird.
I was right. It was our first DigiEgg.
On the other side of the world...
... Willis was getting his DigiEgg at the exact same time.
Tai, wake up!
Tai! I'm going to the health-food store.
What a weird dream. A computer egg?
I gotta stop watching scary movies before I go to bed.
Take care of your sister.
But, Mom,
I was gonna play soccer with my friends!
The egg's real!
I bet you this is gonna taste a lot better than your egg.
I know what we can do.
Let's use it as a soccer ball.
You're right, it probably wouldn't bounce that high.
If anyone asks where that weird-looking egg came from...
...Iet's tell them our chicken coop is on a nuclear-waste dump.
The rest of the kids are gonna be jealous of us this Easter.
Kari, where'd you go?
Kari, l--
It's alive!
Oh, it's cute. Come here, little baby.
Kari, stay away! I'll protect you.
As usual, Tai came up with a brave plan of action.
It worked about as well as his other plans.
It's taking a bubble bath.
That was the first time any of us really connected with a Digimon.
As time went on, we learned that not all Digimon turn out to be so friendly.
Kari, stop feeding it so many candy bars.
You'll make it sick.
Hey, those are mine! Thanks a lot.
Well, now that it's here, how do we get rid of it?
We can't keep it.
Where's it gonna sleep?
Oh, no, not in my bed!
Fine, then it sleeps on the couch.
I guess we'll just have to tell Mom it's a throw pillow.
I'll get it.
Hello? Tai speaking.
This is Sora. Mimi told me you were the one who threw up in my hat.
Something's wrong with her phone.
Perfect timing.
That's weird. All the electronic stuff in the house is going nuts.
Kari, look out!
It changed. It got bigger.
What did you do? Oh, no.
Where are we gonna hide him?
What's Mom gonna say if she finds out?
It can't get any worse.
It just got worse.
You'd better pin his ears back so they don't get in the food.
Boy, he looks pretty hungry.
He had a strange way of showing his appreciation.
Cut it out! Stop kissing my sister, you!
His breath stinks!
I've had enough. He's outta here.
We don't make much of a tag team, do we?
Kids, I made your favorite: liver sticks.
Great! In a minute.
-So, do you have a name?
-Koromon.
We're in luck. She burned them.
-Tai, his name is Koromon.
-Whose name?
Koromon, what are you anyway?
I'm a Digimon, short for Digital Monster.
I'm from the Digital World.
How come you talk to him, and only whistle at me?
My name is Kari. Kari.
And this is my brother.
His name is Tai. Tai.
-Hi, Kari-Kari, Tai-Tai.
-Never mind.
He can talk.
-You two are the best friends I ever had.
-We're the only friends you've had.
Thanks for saving me from that scratching fur-ball.
Just warn me before you kiss me again.
Once a Digimon truly becomes your friend, they'll do anything for you.
Anything.
Let's have a warning for this, too.
Every time that thing changed shape, or what we now call "digivolved"...
...there was a weird electrical surge throughout the city.
Of course, there was only one way to get Tai's attention.
I'm up. What?
Koromon? What's the matter with him?
Is he sick?
You gave him your liver sticks, didn't you?
You should know that this Koromon isn't the one we befriended later on.
Look! That's gotta hurt.
When this one digivolved, he expanded more than my Uncle Fred at Thanksgiving.
Nice dinosaur. Friendly dinosaur.
Kari, get down from there!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get grounded for this.
What's going on in there?
Did you kids break another lamp?
Piggyback?
Kari, no!
Now let's play horsey.
If Mom's worried about the lamp, wait till she sees her car!
Look both ways before you cross the street.
See any cars?
Do you even know what a car is?
Just be careful, then.
Soda. I'm thirsty. Are you?
Mom usually just puts money in, but I guess that works too.
Just one each.
Where are you going?
How hard could it be to find a dinosaur?
You know, we really shouldn't be playing in the street.
-Did you see that?
-No, I was sleeping.
But you're driving!
-Can we do that ride again?
-Pepper Flame.
Tai wasn't far behind us. He was following our footprints in the diet soda.
Why are you looking at that bus?
Please don't blow it up.
I know my mom says they're always late...
...but they can't help it.
Don't be a bad boy!
I wanna go home now, okay?
Oh, boy!
And that's when we saw our second DigiEgg.
But this one was a lot bigger, and the Digimon inside it, a lot meaner.
I'd hate to see the chicken that egg came out of.
That's a big bird.
Pepper Flame!
Mimi, it's Joe.
Quick, look outside your window.
Polly want a cracker? A really big cracker?
Koromon? Kari!
-Koromon, please don't fight!
-Kari, come on, we gotta go!
-Koromon!
-Kari, it's too dangerous!
Pepper Flame!
My turn.
Sonic Destroyer!
Izzy, did you see that?
What's wrong with the phone?
-You okay?
-Who's that?
Koromon?
I'm Greymon now.
You can be whoever you want, big guy.
Nova Flame!
Cool!
Greymon!
Don't quit!
Sonic Destroyer!
Oh, no, Tai! He's hurt.
-There's nothing you can do.
-Greymon, get up!
Greymon, wake up. He's coming!
It worked on me.
Come on, Tai.
-Go for it!
-Nova Flame!
Greymon!
That night changed our lives.
It was a while before we realized that those of us...
...who saw what happened became the DigiDestined.
Greymon...
...don't you wanna play horsey with me anymore?
Where are you?
It was even longer before we found out that Willis met...
...his Digimon that same night.
He learned alone that being a DigiDestined means...
...sometimes you gotta save the world...
...even if you're the one who caused the problem.
It was another DigiDestined, Izzy, who first noticed there was trouble.
Prodigious!
A computer virus on the lnternet.
Wait a minute.
It's attacking something.
Let me see if I can get an image of its target.
Izzy wasn't the only one tracking the virus.
The whole world was watching.
But no one was prepared for what was about to happen.
Looks like a DigiEgg.
Where'd that come from?
The virus is causing the egg to develop abnormally fast.
I think it's gonna hatch.
Across town, Tai and another DigiDestined,
Sora, were facing their own problem.
"Dear Sora:
I'm sorry about what happened.
"l haven't felt so bad since I accidentally...
"...threw up in your hat and didn't tell you before you wore it.
"l know our relationship has been stormy lately.
"You love thundershowers, what's a few raindrops between friends?
"Love, Tai."
"Love." I mean, "From." I mean....
Who are you writing to, Tai?
It's just an e-mail joke.
What are you doing in here anyway, Kari?
I wanted to show you my new dress.
I'm going to a birthday party.
I got my friend a pink Power Ranger.
Tai and I had a give-and-take relationship.
I would give and he would take.
-Who cares?
-To send...
...you have to click this. Click!
I wasn't gonna send that letter.
-Then what did you write it for?
-Go to your party.
I can't believe Sora's gonna read my letter.
Wait a minute, "Unable to deliver"?
I can't believe she's not gonna read my letter.
You try to tell a girl you're sorry and your computer shuts you down.
Surprise!
Mom? Can I make a complaint?
Kari's eating birthday cake right now, and all we have is leftover tofu.
I can make you a cake, Tai.
Hand me an egg, please.
No.
I needed to use up the rest of the wheat germ anyway.
You get the door and I'll start on that cake.
Izzy, you're all sweaty. What's wrong?
Well, it's about the egg.
The egg has already hatched.
Not that egg. A DigiEgg!
My Digimon analyzer doesn't even recognize it.
Looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a contact lens.
-It's part Digimon, part virus.
-A Digimon with a virus? So?
You kidding? If it stays on the lnternet it could destroy technology as we know it.
If it just hatched, how do you know this stuff?
This kid I met on the lnternet,
Willis, from Colorado, e-mailed me.
I don't know where he gets his information.
He's smart though.
He's in elementary school...
...but he's already taking classes at Colorado State.
So what? I'm in junior high school and I take classes at junior high school.
Look! The jellyfish digivolved.
He's sending an e-mail.
It says: "I'm hungry! "
Am I supposed to call for pizza?
He's eating computer data.
When he's done in this buffet line...
...he's gonna look for a database with more food.
More food? What does he expect to find?
A grocery store?
Okay, that's one box of chocolates.
Your total comes to 1,000,125--
Yeah, that's what it says.
That must be really good chocolate.
Paper or plastic?
In supermarkets all over, computer systems are failing...
...causing congestion at the registers.
And now for the weather.
I made beef-jerky shakes.
-No, thanks, Mom.
-Where are you going?
We need to use Dad's computer.
Don't you want your shake?
-I'm glad someone appreciates my recipes.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kamiya.
-We gotta be careful with my dad's stuff.
-Get out of my way.
A Digimon is eating the lnternet and you're worried about a few books!
But my dad likes his mess where it is.
We'll have more capabilities by networking our computers together.
Why don't we just call up the Digimon on the screen and hit "Delete"?
Don't you think I've tried that?
If this is dangerous, maybe we should call someone...
-...Iike the principal or Bill Gates.
-They won't listen.
Willis warned his lnternet carrier about the new Digimon.
They said, "Great! Let's sign him up and give him 50 free hours."
-All right, we're online.
-He's digivolved again.
My name is Keramon.
-I think he's at the Rookie level.
-This soon? He's digivolving too quickly!
-He's probably at a fast food web site.
-Now what?
Nothing.
We have to watch it eat...
...the world out of house and homepage?
I wish Agumon was here to help us.
I can almost hear him now.
You can hear me now.
It's like he was here.
I am here.
Agumon, where are you?
I can barely hear you.
-Take me off speakerphone.
-It's a transmission...
...from the Digital World.
-Agumon!
-And he's with Gennai.
-It's been a long time.
-Don't forget me.
Tentomon!
Who else is there?
-Biyomon.
-Pabumon.
-Palmon.
-Patamon.
-Gomamon.
-Gatomon.
We need to talk.
Something's threatening the Internet.
We know. The Digimon's already causing major problems in our world.
-I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
-But it is dangerous.
The evil Dark Masters were cupcakes compared to this guy.
That's it, then. Let's do it!
We found a way to enter the Internet.
We'll help you guys because you're the best friends we've ever had.
What better way to express friendship than to save your world.
Tentomon.
Don't get so emotional.
Thanks a lot, guys. You won't be alone.
We'll be right here on the computer.
-lzzy, Digivice?
-I'm one step ahead of you, Tai.
Our Digivices will help you digivolve and together we'll squash that bug.
It'll take a minute for Agumon and Tentomon to get on the Net.
My modem 's older than I am.
I'll call the other DigiDestineds so their Digimon can help, too.
Hi, this is Tai Kamiya.
Can I speak to Joe, please? A test?
He's the only kid I know who volunteers for summer school.
Hi, is Matt or T.K. there?
They're visiting their grandmother in the country?
Hey, Tai. Any luck yet?
Would you like a glass of potato juice, lzzy?
Great! I'd love some.
Be there, be there.... Hello there!
This is Tai.
You're selling ties?
No, my name is Tai.
I'm looking for Matt or T.K.
That's a coincidence.
Those are my grandkids' names.
That's great. Are they there?
Right now? Can I talk to them?
I love to talk to them, too.
They're here visiting me.
Please, I need to speak to them right away.
Okay, I'll tell them. Kids!
I can't take this!
You know, lzzy, I can never get Tai to try any of my recipes.
-I think they taste great.
-Want to try my spinach cookies?
I got Mimi's machine.
Hi, it's Mimi. I'm so glad you called.
Let's get together for lunch.
Leave a very short message after the beep.
Mimi, I--
That girl loves to talk.
You're a natural in the kitchen, just like me.
Mom, I need to get a hold of Kari, right away.
Did she take your cell phone with her?
Do I have enough of this stuff?
Beats me, it's the first time
I've used flour to bake a cake.
Of course she's got it, in case of emergency.
Emergency. What does she think this is?
Happy birthday!
-Make a wish.
-Blow them out.
-Call them back.
-I can't come home.
A magician's coming over later and I volunteered to be sawed in half.
Whatever. Just tell the half with feet to run home soon.
I can't get anybody on the phone.
I want you to call Sora for me.
But you and she are good friends.
It makes more sense for you to call.
Just do it!
Are more friends coming?
I'll make three-bean salad.
Nobody's coming over, Mom.
That's all right.
I only have two beans, anyway.
Sorry, Sora's not home.
I'll tell her to call Tai's house as soon as she gets back.
Hold on, she just walked in.
I'll put her right on.
-Sora, I think Tai wants to speak to you.
-I'm not home.
I already said you're here.
Make something up.
I don't care what you tell him.
But, Sora l--
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.
Sora said she's not home.
-Did you two have an argument?
-None of your business!
You must've been a jerk if she doesn't want to talk to you.
-I didn't do anything!
-I meant that in a good way.
I can't believe she's still mad.
It all started over a hair clip.
He'd better have written me.
Greetings. You have no new mail. Okay?
No, it's not okay. Stupid Tai!
Thank you for visiting meow.com.
Miko, get down from there.
Agumon and Tentomon should be on the lnternet by now.
Does this information superhighway have a rest stop? I've got to go potty.
You should've gone before we left.
Just hold it!
You're gonna need a password.
You can use mine to get on the Internet:
Prodigious.
-Prodigious.
-They're in!
So this is what the lnternet looks like.
They need new wallpaper.
I hope this doesn't take long, it's my bath night.
There he is, go get him!
He doesn't know we're here.
Let's sneak up on him quietly.
Super Shocker!
That's quietly?
Pepper Breath!
That should have worked, but it didn't.
Keramon's sending us an e-mail. It says:
"So, you like to play games?"
I got a bad feeling about this, Agumon.
You better digivolve. Both of you. Now!
Agumon, digivolve to....
Tentomon, digivolve to....
-Greymon.
-Kabuterimon.
Bug Buster!
Electro Shocker!
Nova Blast!
You guys make this stuff look easy.
Hold that thought!
Keramon, digivolve to....
Infermon.
-No way, he's digivolved again.
-We've never seen this before.
Now he's at the Champion level, like Greymon and Kabuterimon.
-Electro Shocker!
-Nova Blast!
-Yeah!
-All right!
He's stronger than a Champion.
Spider Shooter!
Kabuterimon!
-Greymon, no!
-I think I've got it figured out now.
He's bypassed the Champion level and digivolved into the Ultimate level.
He's too strong for our Digimon now.
Then they're just gonna have to digivolve again.
Not so fast.
Greymon, digivolve to....
MetalGreymon!
He's gotta digivolve faster.
Agumon, say something!
Don't take me out, coach.
Tentomon?
I'm fine. Just one question:
Who's Tentomon?
They'll be okay, Tai.
They just need to rest for a while.
I can't believe that two Digimon at the Champion level weren't enough.
We'll never be able to defeat this thing.
Check this out. We're getting e-mails from around the world.
Here's one from Willis in America.
It says, "lzzy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Find a way to slow him down."
-What's he mean, "his fault"?
-I don't know.
Infermon is e-mailing us, too.
Why is he saying "hello" over and over again?
Look at the address.
He's at the telephone company taking over the phone lines.
If we lose our phone connection, we're finished.
That's the only way we have access to the lnternet.
I've got to warn everyone.
All circuits are busy. Try again later.
Oh, great. It's busy. Mimi!
-All circuits are busy. Try again later.
-Come on! How could that be busy too?
-All circuits are still busy.
-Don't tell me!
-Didn't you hear me? It's busy!
-I'm sorry, lady.
All the phones are dead.
-That Digimon did it.
-Not a single call can get through.
Hello, this is Tai.
Hello. Did you program me?
It's lnfermon.
Hello?
Talk about speed dialing!
Infermon was looking for someone.
He was calling every number in the world.
His long-distance bill will be enormous.
What?
"Connection terminated."
What next?
Kids, cake's almost ready.
Phones have gone dead worldwide.
If your telephone is dead, call your phone company.
At least my sister can't call me three times a day.
-See you!
-Are you leaving so soon?
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Save me a piece of cake.
What's the matter with you?
Have you heard? The phones are out.
The stock market is in chaos and people are rioting.
That's nice.
Tai says call, then he won't get off the phone.
We interrupt this programming for a special bulletin.
Goody, I bet it's one of those high-speed chases.
The phone company has set up an emergency voice-mail system.
Simply dial 171 for easy instructions.
Believe me, it wasn't so easy.
First you had to leave a message, then call back to hear one.
Basically, it was playing phone tag.
Perfect! Voice mail!
To leave a message, press 1.
To retrieve a message, press 2.
Please leave your message at the tone.
Matt, T.K., this is an emergency.
Call me right away! By the way, it's Tai.
Kari, if you want to see your toys again, get home right away!
Sora, listen, I'm sorry about the hairpin.
But I need to talk to you right away.
Call me. Or just come over.
Stupid Tai.
Mimi, it's Tai. Please come to my house as soon as you get this message. 'Bye.
That reminds me.
You got this postcard in the mail from Mimi.
What?
She's on vacation? In Hawaii?
Hawaii is paradise.
I don't have a care in the world.
I'm wishing you were here.
-Hi, lzzy. Welcome back.
-Thank you.
So, when's everybody coming over?
Cheer up already.
What happened to the days when we were a team?
We are a team, Tai, but we're just kind of spread out right now.
By the way, where did you disappear to?
-Well, I went to pick this up.
-What is it?
A satellite uplink.
We can get onto the lnternet by tapping into the military's satellite system.
You're a genius. How does it work?
Do you know what a semiconductor is?
One who works part-time on a train?
Never mind!
-ls it hooked up yet?
-Almost.
In the meantime, check the messages to see if anyone called back.
I forgot.
You have one new message.
Tai, it's Matt. What's the big emergency?
Call me back.
I gotta go.
Grandma fell asleep on T.K. again.
Good old Matt.
I knew that somebody on the team would come through.
Matt, did you and T.K. bring your Digivices with you?
Did you pack them?
This is T.K., of course we have them.
What's going on?
An evil Digimon has taken over the Internet.
Agumon and Tentomon are fighting it, but they need help.
Get your Digivices to a computer as fast as you can.
What do we do now?
The closest thing our grandmother has to a computer is an egg timer.
We're going into town to find one.
The uplink's working. We're back online.
Now let's exterminate that bug.
He left the phone company.
Now where is he?
He sent another e-mail.
"I'm close to him"? Close to who?
-He's in America.
-He doesn't even have a green card.
-I said slow down!
-I can't hear you!
The Digimon's in New York.
He's eaten all the data at Kennedy Airport and is headed for the subway system.
Good, that'll slow him down for sure.
I'll e-mail Willis and let him know that lnfermon is heading his way.
I do have one question though:
What do you think that Digimon would be like if the virus never attacked him?
I have one too:
Why are you still drinking that junk?
Just 'cause you don't eat healthy, doesn't mean that I don't.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
-We've got the Digivices.
-Now what?
Awesome! We'll tell Gennai to upload
Gabumon and Patamon onto the Net.
You can do that?
That sounds like fun.
-Usually I just play Solitaire on that thing.
-Careful, Floyd, you almost cut my ear off.
Kids today are so smart, aren't they?
I still can't set the time on my VCR.
Matt, who are all those weird people?
They're not weird. They're my best friends.
Considering this is the only computer in town.
Gennai's transfer of the Digimon is almost completed.
Can I have yours?
You're the bravest kid I have ever known.
We're going back in.
I assume lzzy and Tai were unsuccessful in finding anyone else.
Then you and I'll have to try to beat that thing by ourselves.
-Sorry we're late.
-I was surfing the Net and I wiped out.
Gabumon and Patamon!
-ls T.K. on this ride?
-He's not tall enough.
Gabumon!
Patamon!
Say hello later. We've got work to do.
Keep your legs and wings inside the ride at all times.
Just a little further, guys. Remember, he's dangerous, so stay focused.
I'm looking for the programmer.
Don't interfere!
-He's teasing us.
-Then let's get him.
It's time to digivolve.
-Gabumon, warp digivolve to....
-Agumon, warp digivolve to....
WarGreymon.
MetalGarurumon.
-All right!
-Patamon, you better digivolve.
Patamon, digivolve to....
Infermon, digivolve to....
Diaboromon.
-What's going on?
-He digivolved.
Cable Crusher!
Look out, Patamon!
I'll save him.
-Patamon, are you all right?
-Tentomon!
I'm fine. What about Patamon?
Patamon, speak to me!
Come on, get up! Say something!
-I'm coming! I'll come get you!
-You can't.
But you can.
Wipe him out!
Ice Wolf Spikes!
Web Wrecker!
Tentomon, circle around!
WarGreymon, attack!
-It's no use.
-What are you saying? We're winning.
-This could be it.
-Great.
Not that!
-What's going on?
-There's something wrong with me.
-What is it?
-I think it's your mother's recipes.
I hate to tell you I told you so, but, I told you so!
Look, something's wrong.
Oh, no, they're slowing down.
Come on!
Tai, where'd you go?
WarGreymon has practically stopped moving.
Oh, no!
-I feel a lot better.
-I didn't touch anything, I swear!
-Tai, what did you do?
-lt wasn't my fault.
Who told you to go to the bathroom at such an important time?
Like I had a choice!
Why did you crash the computer?
Now it has to reboot.
-It's not like I did it on purpose.
-Just like it wasn't your fault with Sora.
That wasn't my fault.
Okay, maybe it was my fault.
What happened?
I gave her this great hairpin for her birthday.
Then she got mad and said,
"You don't like my hair style?"
I said "Who could tell?
You always wear a hat. "
Then she said, "Now you hate my hat?"
It's very confusing.
That's what you fought about?
I tried to apologize, but she won't return my phone calls.
We're back online.
WarGreymon!
Where were you?
You two picked a lousy time to take a lunch break!
What happened to him? WarGreymon!
Tai, I can't move!
I let him down. I should have been there.
-"Your Digimon's a loser."
-What did you say?
"How could two Mega-level Digimon get beat by one lousy bug?
"WarGreymon quit like a coward."
You take that back or I'll--
I was reading an e-mail from another kid.
You didn't have to read it so well.
You two, this isn't the time for fighting.
Stupid e-mails!
Go back to the beginning.
Diaboromon's back! Another e-mail?
"Who can count backwards from ten?"
Is he giving us a math test?
What's that?
What's with the timer?
He's making copies of himself.
He's multiplying.
It gets worse! The USA just launched two nuclear missiles.
Willis says the government can't explain it...
...but he knows Diaboromon's in the Pentagon's computers.
I hope I didn't lead him there with my satellite uplink.
One of the missiles is headed for Colorado.
-They'll land in less than ten minutes.
-That explains the timer.
But what's in Colorado?
I have no idea. In the meantime,
Diaboromon keeps multiplying.
The military has the power to stop it.
Every country is trying to intercept them, including Japan.
But Diaboromon has infiltrated all their computers...
...and is rerouting them to fall in the ocean near Hawaii.
Fireworks!
I've got the trajectory for the other missile.
Let me calculate it.
Four carry the two, times three....
It's aimed right for this neighborhood.
Look, e-mails from around the world:
"Get that evil Digimon.
You're our only hope."
Here's another: "Be home by 6:00."
Wait. That's from my mom.
I'm trying to save the world and you're reading fan mail.
-We just lost our connection.
-Great!
I'll get it back. If we defeat the original
Diaboromon, the rest will disappear.
What?
All we have to do is destroy each one, until we find the original.
Sounds great. How many are there so far?
Spit it out, lzzy. How many are there?
There are over 75,000 and counting!
What's that?
It didn't sound like my stomach.
-Tai! Have faith! I'll find the original.
-WarGreymon!
I'll help you.
MetalGarurumon.
They're so slow.
It's because of all the e-mails.
They're slowing down our Digimon processing speed.
I'll write to everyone to stop them e-mailing till the Digimon are strong again.
Are you crazy? Do you know how long that'll take? There's no time.
Now we're...
...just about...
-...finished.
-lt can't end like this.
Tell me, will they make it?
I'm not sure.
But they're gonna try.
Don't give up! No matter what happens, don't give up!
Don't interfere!
How many copies of Diaboromon are there now?
To be honest, I don't know.
I stopped keeping track a while ago.
It's got to be well over a million.
MetalGarurumon!
WarGreymon has started to slow down again.
It's the e-mails.
They're coming in faster than ever.
They're slowing down the processing speed even more.
They're sitting ducks out there.
Please, guys, stop writing!
I know your intentions are good, but you're hurting our cause.
Your e-mails are putting our Digimon in danger.
I've got to help.
There must be a way....
Somehow.
More juice, lzzy?
I just squeezed some onions.
No, thanks, I'm rerouting incoming data from the remote server into local memory.
I'll just leave you two alone.
Wait a minute, where did Tai go?
None of us are sure how, but Tai's bond with WarGreymon was so strong...
... Tai, himself, became digital.
WarGreymon, I'm here.
MetalGarurumon!
Wake up! Don't quit now!
-Why won't he answer me, Tai?
-Keep trying, Matt.
Listen, I don't have a whistle to wake you.
But I want you to know you're not alone.
The mail keeps coming. It won't stop.
Kids from all over the world are writing to you.
They need your help.
You're the only one who can do it.
Feel their hope. Feel their strength.
I feel them.
Where'd your brother go?
They combined.
Part WarGreymon.
Part MetalGarurumon.
They digivolved together to become....
Omnimon.
Transcendent Sword!
Hurry!
Supreme Cannon!
Tai, there's the original. Get him!
We're running out of time!
Omnimon! Quick, attack!
Where is he?
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
Squad leader to Command, we were unable to destroy the target.
The missile will impact.
Repeat: The missile will impact.
He keeps moving.
Every time he's in our sights, he jumps somewhere else.
He's too fast for us.
We have the power to destroy him now, but we don't have the time.
Willis was right, we have to find some way to slow down Diaboromon.
Thirty seconds left.
The e-mails!
If I forward him all the e-mails, it'll slow him down, just like it did to us.
Keep sending them, kids.
You've got mail.
Ten seconds left.
Nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
...five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Connection terminated.
Willis!
Lousy microwave!
How come every electronic appliance has to have a bug in it?
Greetings.
You have one new piece of mail.
It's about time.
"Dear Sora: I'm sorry.... Threw up hat....
"What's a few raindrops between friends?
Love, Tai."
Stupid Tai!
I'm about to barf.
Wait till you try the cake.
When Willis saw what happened on the Internet...
...he was as happy as the rest of us.
So were the twins,
Terriermon and Kokomon.
They figured that would be the end of it.
But they were wrong.
It was just the beginning.
Kokomon!
Willis was about to face the Digibattle of his life.
But he was all alone.
These days the team is older, but some things never change.
Tai's still obsessed with soccer, and Sora 's still waiting for him to call.
Izzy's idea of a fun night is upgrading his computer...
...and Matt's trying to make it as a rock star.
His stage name is: "The DigiDestined formerly known as Matt. "
Even though the older kids don't have much time for the DigiWorld...
...there are new DigiDestined kids to pick up the slack.
That's Cody, a real sensitive little kid, and that's his Digimon: Upamon.
Yolei and Poromon can match wits with the best of them...
...as well as tan lines.
And there's Davis and DemiVeemon.
I know, Davis looks like my brother Tai.
They even have the same personality: obnoxious.
While they were having a good time at the beach...
...I was in New York with T.K...
...partly to visit Mimi and partly to make Davis jealous.
Smile!
Not again.
-lt didn't go through?
-No.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. It says all lines are busy.
There must be an electrical surge.
What do you think we should do now, T.K.?
How about lunch?
Did you guys hear that?
Did we hear what?
I'm getting a feeling there's something strange out there...
...but I'm not sure what it is.
It needs our help though.
I hate it when I'm right.
It turned out that the person who needed our help was Willis.
Kokomon, this has to stop!
Go back!
What do you mean "back"? Back to what?
Destroy!
No!
Terriermon!
Bunny Blast!
Koko Krusher!
Bunny Blast!
Terriermon!
Hurry, T.K. It's over this way.
Kokomon, stop!
A Digimon!
I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
All right, tell me, what do you want?
Go back.
He vanished.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Don't follow me! You're in danger!
Leave it to me.
I'll find out where he's going.
-What does he mean, "we're in danger"?
-All I know is he needs help.
Hi, Mom. Our summer camp is going backpacking in Colorado.
-We're leaving--
-Please deposit $2 for....
I'll call you when I get there.
Come on, Terriermon.
We have to find transportation.
I can't keep running from him.
We're going back.
Colorado? Why there?
I'm sending an e-mail to Davis and the others.
I told him to meet up with us.
We could really use their help, and I'm sure he misses me.
The D-Terminal!
"Found new kid with Digimon"?
Yeah, a new friend.
She wants us to meet them in Colorado.
Well, how does she expect us to get to America?
We don't have the money.
Willis, do we have to go to Colorado?
You heard what Kokomon said.
"Go back." That's where it all started.
But why do we have to walk?
My soles are worn out and I don't even wear shoes.
Terriermon, listen. We--
Come on, Willis, can't we just call for someone to give us a ride?
I'm sorry. You know
Kokomon's getting more violent.
He makes anyone close to us disappear.
I'll find us a ride.
-Let's get out of this sun. It's too hot.
-Wait!
What exactly do you think you're doing?
This way I don't have to walk, and you can stay in the shade.
That's better.
I don't suppose you could turn into a glass of lemonade, could you?
Look, my Digivice.
What's happening to the train?
I don't think this is the entertainment portion of the trip.
It's that Digimon we saw in New York.
Don't interfere!
There's definitely something different about this Digimon.
We're not moving. Where are we?
Don't interfere?
I don't think that Digimon wants us in Colorado.
Explain one more time why we have to stop in three different cities?
We're using my uncle's flyer miles and restrictions apply.
Why did we have to take this particular taxi company?
I've an uncle who lives in Houston.
He has an account with them.
-It's not really that bad.
-At least it's free.
What do you say, guys, wanna hear some music?
Sure, why not?
We prefer something on the slow and easy side.
Sure.
I'm pretty good.
'Bye, Uncle Fred.
Thanks for the lift. Goodbye.
Yolei, your uncle's a lousy pilot.
On the map, we're abut 60 miles from where we're meeting Kari.
-How do we get there?
-I have an uncle who owns some horses.
No! No more uncles, no more horses, no trains, no planes.
It's got to stop!
Did someone say stop?
Come on, guys, this is our chance.
Well, at least my way we weren't stowaways.
-Climb in. It's perfect.
-Let me handle this.
Yeah, ma'am, I said stop. I'm starting my own truck stop and was testing it.
It seems to work fine.
You stopped. Thanks.
-Let's go.
-Come on.
Hey, pal, you must've had the same idea we did.
Hey, would you cut that out? That's rude.
Sorry about that. He's young.
Davis, guess what? He's a Digimon.
A what?
Hey, he's right.
Wow! In America, they have Digimon by the truck load.
Our Digimon like each other.
And the guy says,
"l was talking to the duck."
This is kind of nice, being around others for a change.
Yeah, for as long as I can remember, it's just been me and Willis.
Having a Digimon makes you a DigiDestined...
...and we're all part of a team.
Why are you alone?
Well, let's just say I have my reasons.
Anyway, it's nice meeting someone as cute as you.
Back off there, blondie.
What's wrong, Davis?
Did I say something wrong?
We found this kid. Now what do we do?
He's angry because he wanted to be with Kari by now.
My family's vacation home is just a couple of towns away from here.
You guys can wait for them there if you want to.
I'd better e-mail Kari and T.K. to tell them where to meet us.
-Where are they coming from?
-From New York.
The kids behind the fence.
That girl was cute, too.
That's it, lover-boy. Leave Kari out of this.
I'm sorry.
Listen, Davis,
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.
Maybe I should just make a phone call and get us a lift to my house.
I'd like a pizza for delivery with mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni...
...pineapple, Canadian bacon, anchovies, and green peppers.
That sounds delicious, but aren't you going to have anything?
If Davis eats it all....
-There's no fat below my neck.
-Since you're delivering that pizza...
...to my house, would you mind picking us up on the way?
-Tell him to forget it. I want Chinese.
-Shut up!
I said, "Line up."
We'll line up on the side of the road with a sign, so we're easy to spot.
-You've done this before.
-They'll be here in two minutes or it's free.
-Willis, you're smart.
-Well, it was mostly my idea.
Great, then you're buying the pizza!
-Pizza!
-Guys, come on, let's go!
-Why do I have to be the one paying for it?
-It's your pie. You buy.
Don't open your big mouth unless it's to eat pizza.
If I'm paying for it, I get the first half.
And I get the second half, too.
Now that that's settled,
I guess we're ready to go.
We'll tell you how the pizza tasted.
If that driver thinks he's getting a tip, forget it!
What is it?
Davis!
Destroy!
Kokomon.
You know this Digimon?
DemiVeemon, quick, digivolve!
DemiVeemon, digivolve to....
Veemon!
Vee Head Butt!
How about a little teamwork?
Pick me up. We'll attack him from the air.
All right, we've got you!
Watch out for that sign.
Time for plan B.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Flamedramon, attack!
Fire Rocket!
One small detail.
Who is that? And why is he attacking us?
Cable Crusher!
Koko Krusher!
Kokomon, I'm doing what you want.
I'm going back.
Go back...
...to the beginning!
Willis, use your Digivice.
I feel strange.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
He's got pants now.
Bunny Bubble!
Gargo Pellets!
Go back.
-What for?
-Go back.
He put up a good fight, but we won.
We didn't win anything.
He won't stop until I give him what he wants.
What does he want? Maybe I can help.
Don't ask questions.
It's for your own good.
-The less you know the better.
-Willis, wait.
We're a team now.
It's okay to tell them the truth.
Well, the truth is, we don't have a ride anymore.
No problem. I can handle that.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Raidramon! The Storm of Friendship!
-Did somebody call for a ride?
-That's cool.
Couldn't you have done that before?
Can we get a ride, too?
Sorry, we're on a mission.
-It's a big gust of wind.
-No, it's Davis.
Same difference.
How do you stop this thing?
So, this Kokomon attacked you?
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
Where are your friends T.K. and Kari?
They're still not here yet.
What? What do you mean,
Kari's not here yet?
Good question.
They really should have been here by now.
If I know Kokomon, your friends aren't coming at all.
That's it, pal.
Enough secrets.
You seem to know a lot about this monster.
Spill it. How do you two know each other?
And more importantly:
Why is he only attacking you?
Because I created him.
You must be kidding.
You just can't create a Digimon out of thin air.
I've told you too much already.
Kokomon makes everyone who tries to help me disappear...
...Iike I'll bet he did to your friends T.K. and Kari.
Willis.
I have to do this by myself.
I need to be alone.
Great, I'll go with you.
Willis, we've been walking for hours and you haven't said a word.
Being a DigiDestined means you don't have to face things alone.
What are you running away from?
Eight years ago, a DigiEgg came out of my computer...
...and it hatched into twin Digimon:
Terriermon and Kokomon.
I finally had someone to play with.
My very own pets, and they talked, too!
It was the best.
They depended on me.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Sometimes they would even do my chores for me.
I wanted more of them...
...so I got the stupid idea of creating a DigiEgg on the computer.
That's when it all went bad.
Before my DigiEgg hatched, it was attacked by a virus...
...and it mutated into Diaboromon.
When Tai and the others destroyed him,
I thought my bad dream was over.
But the real nightmare was just beginning.
The virus tracked us down and dragged Kokomon away from me.
I watched helplessly for four years as he slowly became this terrible monster.
And now he's obsessed with chasing me.
During the battle he said to you,
"Go back to the beginning."
What did he mean?
I think he wanted me to come here where it all started.
Every time he tries to tell me why, the virus stops him.
He can't fight it.
This won't end until he's destroyed.
But I can't do it. It's all my fault, not his.
What's the matter with you?
That's the saddest story I ever heard.
I'm the one with the problem, not you.
-Get over it.
-Okay.
That was fast.
You know what? We're gonna help you.
You will? How are you gonna do that?
My friend, we're DigiDestined.
We'll find the answer together, as a team.
I've never been on a team.
Anything I should know?
Yeah, I'm the only one who can kiss Kari.
-Just a little one?
-Don't even joke around about this, got it?
-She and I really hit it off in New York.
-I'm not kidding.
Willis?
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I've got really big ears.
I know you're facing Kokomon tomorrow.
I want to be right there next to you.
I couldn't live with myself if something were to happen to you.
This is my mistake and I won't risk your safety to correct it.
-He's my brother.
-I don't care!
Willis, I'm not your pet. I'm your friend.
And friends are always there for each other.
Now that's what I'm talking about: teamwork.
Thanks, pal.
Okay, let's find Kokomon.
Don't worry. He'll find us.
Go back!
I did! I'm here! What else do you want?
Destroy!
He has a lot of issues.
He's digivolving.
Terriermon, be careful. He's stronger now.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
Veemon, your turn.
Show him what you're made of!
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Armadillomon, you too!
Armadillomon, armor digivolve to....
Digmon, the Drill of Power!
Hawkmon, go for it!
Hawkmon, armor digivolve to....
Halsemon, the Wings of Love!
Fire Rocket!
That's the way!
I'll trip him up. Almost tripped myself.
Gargo Pellets!
Don't make me do this.
How do you like your Kokomon, flame-broiled or grilled?
Can't we end this quickly?
After all, I'm on vacation.
Howdy.
Aren't our Digimon fantastic?
Digmon could be a little more animated.
I guess that's it.
I don't think he's gone.
Now what?
I'm not a duck.
I need a nap.
I think I strained something trying to digivolve.
We're being sucked in.
This is my fault.
Why? Are you the one who taught him to juggle?
Put us down, you clown!
-Leave them alone! Take me instead.
-Okay.
Watch out!
What do we have to do to end this fighting?
Destroy!
Bunny Blast!
A little help here.
Veemon!
Let me help you up.
Now let me help you up.
-Hawkmon, I'll help you.
-No need. I'm--
Oh, Hawkmon, I'm so glad you're not hurt.
Yes, I know, but you don't have to choke me to prove it.
Armadillomon!
Cody, I've been digging all over for you.
Vee Head Butt!
Bunny Blast!
Bombs away!
-We got him!
-Think again.
He's gonna eat us.
Hand of Fate!
Angemon!
And Angewomon!
You saved us! Exquisite timing.
Sorry we're late.
-Hey, look, T.K.
-Kari!
We would've been here sooner, but our plans got derailed.
Yeah! Kari, you made it!
Gatomon and Patamon were worried.
So they digivolved into Angewomon and Angemon.
Celestial Arrow!
Angel Staff!
Either this is an eclipse, or we're in trouble.
-I'm not supposed to be out after dark.
-It's cold.
Look, his wounds are healing.
It's got to be that virus inside of him.
Poromon, there's nothing you can do.
Stay here.
Let me go!
Davis, what's happening to you?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, you big bully?
Kokomon is making time go backwards.
Everyone's getting younger.
Davis, you're a baby.
Who are you calling a baby, you baby?
I'm a baby, look!
"Back to the beginning"?
Willis, "Back to the beginning" didn't mean go back to Colorado.
It means, go back in time to when the virus first attacked Kokomon.
-That's it.
-We have to stop him.
Before you know it, we'll be changing diapers.
Let me go!
I'm sorry but you're grounded.
We don't have the strength to defeat him.
The new Digimon will have to use the power of the golden DigiEggs.
We must digivolve to our Mega forms to release the golden DigiEggs.
Angemon, warp digivolve to....
Seraphymon!
Angewomon, digivolve to....
Magnadramon!
Aren't they beautiful?
Hurry, here he comes.
We released the golden DigiEggs.
Now the others can golden armor digivolve.
This is our last shot.
-What do I do with this?
-Just do exactly what I do.
You ready?
Golden armor energize!
Golden armor energize!
Veemon, golden armor digivolve to....
Terriermon, golden armor digivolve to....
Magnamon!
Rapidmon!
Is that the coolest thing you've ever seen, or what?
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
-lt didn't work.
-He's too strong.
Every time we attack, he regenerates.
Let's blast him from the inside.
Good idea. Follow me!
He ate them. Terriermon!
Listen to me, Poromon.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Time to heal.
What's that up ahead?
I don't know. Look!
What's he doing?
He's trying to tell us something.
-What's he pointing to?
-There must be something inside of him.
The virus!
He's trying to show us how to help him.
What does he want us to do?
Destroy!
Destroy the virus!
Right. Time to heal.
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
Kokomon!
Willis!
The virus, it's all gone.
Thank you.
Now I've lost both of them.
You'll never lose me, Willis.
I told you, I'm your friend.
Friends are always there for each other.
Terriermon!
I guess without the virus,
Kokomon couldn't heal himself anymore.
The battle was too much for him.
Don't be sad, Willis.
One thing you have to learn about Digimon, they never really die.
Thanks for coming back to New York with me. I'm gonna miss you guys.
-I think we'll see each other again.
-I sure hope so.
We're getting used to being part of a team.
Right, Terriermon?
Yeah.
One last thing. 'Bye.
Hey, what did I tell you about kissing Kari?
She's my girl.
What do you mean "your" girl?
Nothing, just guy talk.
Hi, Mom, I'm on the island.
I'm waiting for the ferry and I'll be home.
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. It was a great trip.
I met a lot of new friends.
I had a couple of fights, but I'll tell you later.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Does anyone besides me smell a DigiEgg?
Kokomon!
Like I said, Willis learned about teamwork the hard way.
He also found out that Davis was right.
Digimon never really die.
Their information just gets reconfigured.
Only sometimes they come back singing a different tune.
He's tone-deaf.
Shouldn't be much farther to the cabin, Betty.
Gee, I like this mountain road.
Yes. The scenery certainly is lovely to look at.
If you like scenery.
Pull up here, why don't you, and I'll check the map.
- Make sure we're not lost.
- Yeah.
Seriously, Paul, I do wish this was a vacation.
You could use a break from all this scientist work.
It's almost as if you've been doing too much science.
Too much science?
Is that possible?
Betty, you know what this meteor could mean to science.
If we find it, and it's real, it could mean a lot.
It could mean actual advances in the field of science.
No, I know. I'm used to it, I guess.
You might say I'm a scientist's wife.
There's a lot in what you say, Betty.
In many ways, it's hard to be a scientist's wife, the wife of a scientist.
And yet, in other ways, it's good.
Really good.
You always know the right thing to say, Dr. Paul Armstrong.
There's a farmer up ahead there.
Why don't we ask him directions.
Excuse me. Can you tell us the way to the old Taylor place?
Sure thing, mister.
Stay on this road here.
Past Dead Man's Curve, you'll come to a fence...
...called the Devil's Fence.
From there, go on foot...
...till you come to a valley known as the Cathedral of Lost Soap.
Smack in the center is what they call Forgetful Milkman's Quadrangle.
Stay right on the
Path of Staring Skulls...
...and you come to a place called Death Clearing.
Cabin's right there. Can't miss it.
Boy, that doesn't sound too inviting.
Well, lot of folks superstitious in these parts...
...what with the legend of Cadavra Cave and all.
Next you'll be telling us there's monsters.
Quiet day.
I certainly hope someone needs a forest ranger here sometime.
Hello. I'm Dr. Roger Fleming, and I seem to have lost my way.
I'm Ranger Brad, and that's what I'm here for.
You can call me Ranger Brad.
Most folks do.
Yes. Ranger Brad.
Of course. I like that.
Do you think you could tell me the way to Cadavra Cave?
Cadavra Cave?
Why do you wanna go there?
Ranger Brad, do I tell you all your ranger business?
No, I guess not. Keep going on this trail about a mile.
You can't miss it.
Thank you, Ranger Brad.
You've been very helpful.
Anytime.
Oh, say.
You don't believe those legends about the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, do you?
Ranger Brad, I'm a scientist.
I don't believe in anything.
Nice fellow.
Paul, is it much farther?
My legs are already starting to feel like two heavy, slow things.
Soon I won't feel like I have legs anymore, they're already so tired.
Shouldn't be too much farther, Betty.
And then you can rest and I can do science.
What was that about being a scientist's wife?
Look. They've got the right idea.
This looks like the cabin, all right.
Looks okay from the outside.
But what's the inside like, I wonder.
I think the front's around here.
Oh, Paul, it's everything
I dreamed it'd be.
Is it? Gee, that's wonderful, honey.
What is it, darling?
Oh, I don't know.
As a scientist, I just wish I could appreciate more things, like...
...cabins, bicycles.
I know. You're too wrapped up in your work.
That's why you need to get away from this silly old meteor.
Get away from it? I feel like
I haven't even got near it yet.
This silly old meteor, as you call it, could be made of atmosphereum.
Do you know what that could mean for mankind?
Oh, tell you what, Betty, once my meteor studying is done...
...what say you and I take some time off...
...take the boat out on the lake, just the two of us?
- Oh, Paul, do you really mean it?
- Scientist's honor.
Wait a minute.
We don't have a boat.
- Oh, you.
- I want you to know...
...if we did have a boat, you'd be the first person I'd take out on it, kitten.
Dinner was delicious, honey.
Keep cooking like that and I won't be able to move, let alone do science.
That'd suit me fine, Mr. Meteor.
Ouch, that hurt. Tomorrow, what say you and I go searching...
...for our rocky, glowing, radioactive friend from space together?
Paul Armstrong, I do believe there's hope for you yet.
Shake on it?
Why shake when we can touch other things? Like lips.
Oh, Paul, could that be your meteor?
My meteor's already landed, honey.
That'd be scientifically impossible.
Right. Who ever heard of a meteor going back to space?
There must be another meteor altogether.
I wonder.
I also wonder.
Now, see here. What's got my cows all-fired riled?
It's okay, Bossy, I'm here now.
There, there, Bossy. There, there.
No. No. You're not Bossy.
You're not Bossy.
Well, time to find a meteor.
Looks like a perfect day for hunting space rocks, wouldn't you say, Betty?
Oh, Paul, I'm frightened.
What is it, darling?
What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't know.
Nothing I can put my finger on.
Not something I can see or touch or feel...
...but something I can't quite see or touch or feel...
...or put my finger on.
- Oh, well. Shall we find that meteor?
- Yes, of course.
According to my map, Cadavra Cave should be around here somewhere.
Any readings, as you call them?
Nothing yet.
According to my calculations...
...the meteor must have crashed right around here.
And that machine, or whatever it is, will tell you where?
Yes, it's tuned to detect atmosphereum...
...which is what I'm convinced the meteor was made of.
Incredible.
Either that's a reading or my teeth chattering.
We've picked up something that's not teeth. That's strange.
I hope it doesn't mean one of us ate atmosphereum.
This is serious. The readings are getting stronger, but we're not moving.
But something else is moving, and it's moving right for us.
Whatever it is, it's gone now.
You all right?
I think so.
Whatever was watching us seemed pretty big.
Worse than that, Betty.
Whatever it was, it's lousy with atmosphereum.
This is it. This has to be it.
Cadavra Cave.
It's you, isn't it? It's really you.
At last, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
And this little find, this pile of old bones, as some would call it...
...will make me, Dr. Roger Fleming...
...the most powerful man in the world.
It is safe, she who is my wife.
You may come out now.
Are you certain, Kro-bar, my husband?
This world is strange to us, even different.
Yes, it is different, this Earth, as it is called.
But then, are we of the planet Marva, as we call our planet...
...not also strange and different to this planet and its people also?
You think the Earth people think we are strange, you think?
It is strange how the ways of people on different planets differ, is it not?
Marva. Earth. Marva. Earth.
I see what you mean.
Oh, well. Come.
Let us ready the preparations.
I'll get the things we need to repair our ship...
...which is broken, in the crash on this alien planet that we had.
You know, it's funny...
...but in a strange way,
I could feel almost at home here.
- Oh, well.
- Kro-bar. Kro-bar!
The Mutant. It's gone.
But how can this be?
Was not the Mutant cage sealed?
Oh, yes, I swear it was, my husband.
And the Mutant lock was secured.
Maybe the special bars on the
Mutant cage got bent in the crash.
Oh, this is fine. Fine. Now we must not only repair our ship...
...we must find our Mutant, which we were to return to our planet, Marva.
Or who knows how many untold millions will die by its hand.
If only it did have hands, my woman.
If only it did have hands.
Oh, why isn't it working?
Why are you not coming to life, my Skeleton? Why?
Have I wronged you in some way?
You're against me, aren't you?
Of course you are.
All skeletons are against me.
They always have been.
Even when I was a child,
I was hated by skeletons.
Stop your blubbering, mortal fool.
Who is it? Who are you?
Show yourself.
Who do you think it is, idiot?
It is I, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
- Then you are alive!
- That is how stupid you are.
Only my skeleton brain lives. The rest of me is still just lifeless bone.
But there is a way to bring me completely back to life.
What is it? You have but to say it,
O Skeleton, and I will do it.
There is a radioactive element known as atmosphereum.
- You must find this and bring it to me.
- I will.
I'll find atmosphereum and bring it to you.
That's what I just suggested.
When I am brought to life...
...together, you and I will rule the world together.
But how? How will I find it?
That is for you to know.
That's not my problem. I sleep now.
No. No, tell me where it is.
Skeleton? Skeleton?
Where? Where can
I find this atmosphereum?
That's it, Paul. You've found it.
Yes. This meteor will be the world's greatest source of atmosphereum.
Look at it glow.
It's almost lulling, in a way.
Careful, don't fall in love with that stuff.
That atmosphereum can do some mighty powerful things.
Can I believe the luck?
Atmosphereum under my very nose.
If it were a woman, it could kiss me.
Hold on, my Skeleton.
For soon you shall have life.
Sweet life.
Is it so hopeless, my Kro-bar?
Lattis, I fear our power source...
...the power that runs this ship, is gone.
Without it, I fear we have no hope of ever seeing Marva, our planet, again.
Then we must find the power source.
Yes. We must hope that this planet, this Earth...
...contains that rarest of all radioactive elements: Atmosphereum.
Oh, well. Meantime,
I will hunt for the Mutant...
...with this transmutatron.
I only hope it didn't kill already while it roamed last night.
Leave me now.
Our Mutant must be around here somewhere.
When I find it, our transmutatron will change it to a more harmless creature.
That might be the Mutant now.
With this atmosphereum, Betty, mankind can benefit in many ways...
...many of them good.
- I know.
Kro-bar! Kro-bar!
What is it? You need not yell, because of my proximity.
I yell not from the volume required by great distance, but from excitement.
- Two Earth people...
- There are many Earth people.
Speak specifically. What's special about these two that warrants interest?
- Surely nothing.
- These two, as you call them...
...have atmosphereum.
I hope the owners don't mind their dishes holding a radioactive meteor.
Don't eat the meteor by mistake, whatever you do.
Seriously, we'll clean the dishes before we go.
- Oh, Paul, it's so exciting.
- I know.
I've got to get that meteor.
But how? How?
There must be a way inside that cabin.
Think. Think.
Cabin. Cabin. Cabin.
What's that?
Good work, Lattis.
The human whereabouter has led us right to where the humans are.
Evidently, these beings like primitive, almost rustic structures.
How foolish they are.
Aliens, from outer space.
Careful, my love, for we must seem to like such things now...
...like this foolish structure and all things human.
I catch on, my Kro-bar.
Almost as if we were pretending.
Pretending. I like the way you put things, my queen.
Mysterious, and yet still perfectly understandable.
Oh, well, we waste time on amusement. On with the pretending.
Thanks to the transmutatron, we will look exactly like the human beings.
How strange these beings be.
This neck restrainer is most uncomfortable...
...and what function must it serve?
- I don't know, my husband.
I am strangely drawn to this inverted cloth funnel...
...and its wonderful softness.
Careful, Lattis. You may grow to like being human.
My husband would joke with me.
Come. Go.
The atmosphereum awaits.
We cannot take the transmutatron in with us. It would be difficult to explain.
We'll leave it here in case the Mutant comes, so we can render it harmless.
What are they, Kro-bar?
A series of small buildings leading up to the main one.
And what are we to do?
Step on them until we are high enough to enter.
Well, darling, have you made science history yet?
If you keep distracting me, I'll never change the course of mankind.
Well, maybe we can do that without atmosphereum.
- Who can that be?
- Someone who's an interrupter.
This appears to be an entrance of some sort.
Then why isn't it opening, my love?
- Oh, I'm scared.
- This is insane.
This makes no sense, I tell you.
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?
Calm, Lattis. There must be some explanation. There has to be.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Why doesn't this entrance open?
They'll know.
They'll know everything now.
What can we do? What can we do to make this entrance open?
- Hello.
- Hello.
There is a way in. I knew it.
Can we help you?
- You would help us?
- I don't understand.
Oh, you must be the Taylors.
Of course.
These are the people that rented us the cabin.
- They said they might stop up.
- How are you? I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
This is my wife, Betty.
We didn't catch your first names.
Our first names are the names that were given us first, obviously.
Well, what shall we call you?
Oh, our Earth names.
I am Tergasso...
...and this is...
- I am Bammon.
Tergasso, Bammon, won't you come in?
- Yes, we have been desiring that.
- Finally we go in.
Won't you make yourselves comfortable?
I'm not sure. How would one go about finding that out?
- Please, please, be seated.
- Fold yourself in the middle.
Can we get you anything?
A drink, perhaps?
Yes, liquid, please.
A man who gets right to the point.
I like that.
How about four Scotch and sodas?
My, that's a lovely dress, Tergasso.
Yes. Yes, I, too, thought this.
I almost felt it somehow.
That is what I told Kro-bar.
Who's Kro-bar?
- Is he the designer?
- Yes. Yes, Kro-bar is the designer.
Well, you're going to have to tell me where their store is.
My wife does not like to talk about a store.
We are just like you, really,
I assure you.
Yes, I also appreciate your soft cloth funnel, Betty.
Four drinks, coming up.
Here's to one heck of a beautiful cabin.
- Tergasso certainly was thirsty.
- Who?
I'll seem suspicious if I come alone.
I know.
Those forest animals standing right there have given me an idea.
I watched the aliens work this thing.
Maybe if I make myself a date,
I won't seem so alone.
I never thought I'd have a date with an animal.
Relax, my pet. I am your friend.
More than a friend, I suppose, since I created you.
But I must give you a name.
To us, you and I, you shall be Animala.
I find that name appropriate somehow.
But to the others, to those inferior to you and I, you shall be...
...Pammy.
So, Bammon, what do you do?
Do? I can do anything.
I have no restrictions.
That's the spirit.
I'm the same way with science.
I like my dress so very much.
That's what I can do.
This drink is very refreshing.
Thank you, Paul and Betty.
Oh, not at all.
I have an overwhelming desire to participate...
...in the purchasing of many cloth funnels...
...some I can't even spare the expense for.
Is that so very wrong?
Oh, shopping. Yes. No. No, not at all.
Shopping isn't wrong at all...
...especially for a woman.
Sometimes I wish it were.
Right, Bammon?
I wouldn't know about that, Paul.
Shopping can be loads of fun.
With a little restraint, of course.
Gee, thanks, honey.
Obviously there is much humor in what you say.
In Paul's line of work, he can use a good laugh.
It can be so deadly boring sometimes.
Even I admit that.
Well, as long as everything is perfectly normal.
I certainly am a normal Earth woman.
Isn't that right, my little space comet?
Stop that! My love.
My wife sometimes forgets she is not a space alien.
Won't you please be seated, my dear?
Won't you please be seated, my dear?
May I say you look lovely this evening?
In English, my dear.
Thank you so very much.
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Yes, please.
No, no, no.
Drink like I showed you.
Tip, tip, tip.
And again. Tip, tip, tip.
There.
- Very well-done, my dear.
- Very well-done, my dear.
Yes, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss my work...
...Bam... Bannon... Bam... Bammon.
Oh, that is unfortunate, Paul.
I like work very much.
I'm very interested in it.
That's a very healthy attitude, Bam.
If more Americans thought like that...
...a lot more work would sure get done.
- Do you like to cook, Tergasso?
- I...
I don't really know.
- I'll get it. This is a day for visitors.
- I wouldn't know, Paul.
Good evening.
My name is Rudolph Yaber, and this is my wife, Pammy Yaber.
Our car broke down, and I fear, I'm afraid, we're dreadfully lost, I'm afraid.
- Isn't that right, my dear?
- Always agree.
Come in. We've plenty of room.
You're welcome to stay the night.
I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong and this is Bammon Taylor.
Hello.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm Betty Armstrong and this is Tergasso Taylor.
- Hello.
- Won't you join us for dinner?
My charming wife and I would be delighted.
Thank you.
After the eating is done,
I must look for the atmosphereum.
How do we know their eating customs?
Do exactly as they do, Lattis, and we cannot fail to convince them.
Tip, tip, tip.
Tip, tip, tip.
This meal looks quite delightful, Betty.
Oh, it's just something
I threw together, that's all.
Well, shall we dig in?
Everyone's so hungry.
I think somebody ate too fast.
No. No, my Pammy is very attuned to the ways of nature.
She must have pretty good hearing.
Let's go see what it is. Just the men go. You ladies stay here.
Bammon, will you join us?
Unless there's something we should know about.
No. You know everything.
I will go also.
I hope it's nothing too dangerous.
Careful. It could be a mutant.
Sorry, folks, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Ranger Brad.
Thank goodness it's only a forest ranger, honey.
Hi, I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
The meteor specialist?
Say, this is an honor.
Oh, hello, Dr. Fleming.
I see we meet again.
- Dr. Fleming?
- Oh, just an old nickname of mine.
I'm really Rudolph Yaber.
And this is my wife, Pammy.
She's lost her purse again.
We'll find it later, sweetheart.
All right?
Crumbs.
- Please, won't you have a seat?
- I don't mind sitting sometimes.
Now.
Say, I didn't know anyone was staying at the old Taylor place.
Yes, we are.
Oh, and here's the Taylors, right here.
The Taylors? I recall they were older folks.
We are a younger version.
Say, I didn't know the Taylors had any kids. That's swell.
I don't wanna frighten you folks...
...but a farmer nearby was horribly mutilated.
I thought I should tell other folks, like yourselves...
...so that maybe, just maybe, you wouldn't be horribly mutilated too.
Well, I've certainly never been horribly mutilated, but I don't wanna start now.
This certainly throws a damper on the evening.
I didn't mean to throw a damper.
Believe me, that's the last thing I'd like to throw.
I don't wanna throw anything at all, but when folks are mutilated...
...I feel it's my job to tell others.
We take our horrible mutilations seriously up in these parts.
I'm sure you do.
Honey, the ranger's just doing his job.
Of course he is.
I'm sorry, Ranger Brad.
I guess all this talk of horrible mutilation has me on edge.
That's all right, Dr. Armstrong.
This horrible mutilation has a whole lot of people on a whole lot of edges.
Well, if there's no more talk for us now, I guess I'll be on my way.
I'll see you to the door.
Tell me, ranger, any idea what might've caused...
...this horrible mutilation, as you call it?
Oh, probably nothing to worry about.
Could be a bear, I suppose.
Can a bear do that?
I mean, horribly mutilate?
Dr. Armstrong...
...in my time,
I guess I've seen bears...
...do some things that even a bear wouldn't do.
Well, good night.
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Yaber.
Mutilate. Mutant.
I wonder.
Oh, well.
Oh, well. Better get home.
Say, I must be crazy, walking out in these woods alone at night...
...with a horrible mutilation practically around the corner.
Oh, well.
What a night.
Glad I don't believe in things.
What's that?
This is crazy.
Things like this just don't happen.
Noises?
Noises in the woods?
Stay away.
Stay away!
What's that?
What's that?
No. No!
Goodness.
- What in heaven's name was that?
- Sounded like an Earth scream.
It's too late. There's nothing you can do for him now.
I might be just a test-tube-tipping lab jockey...
...who's looked at too many shiny rocks for far too long...
...but something tells me you know more about this than you're letting on.
No, Paul Armstrong. I know only what my ears tell me.
- And what my eyes see me.
- Now, wait a second.
Surely you don't believe those legends about the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
Surely those are old wives' tales.
And believe me,
I've known plenty of old wives.
Seriously, Bammon, is that what you're suggesting? A living skeleton?
Did I say that? Did I say anything about a skeleton?
No one mentioned a skeleton.
Why, we don't even know about skeletons.
My husband spoke not of skeletons but of another, more different thing...
...which he was speaking of.
Which he and I know and you do not.
Animala.
Animala.
Skeleton. Skeleton.
Animala.
You must find the atmosphereum.
Stop it. Stop it!
What are you doing?
She can't help you.
You must find the atmosphereum.
Amish terrarium.
Must find Amish terrarium.
I don't understand. Why does she need an Amish terrarium?
Don't the Amish live in open air, like us?
Of course, Betty. It's absurd.
Putting the Amish in glass cases would be inhumane.
Surely Pammy doesn't realize what she's saying.
Obey me! Obey me or I'll...
You fool. You skinny, bony jackass!
Stop it or you'll spoil everything!
I will get the...
Amish terrarium myself.
I cannot wait so long.
She. She will help me,
the housewifely one.
Hi, Betty.
It's I, the Skeleton.
Fetch the meteor, Betty.
Fetch the meteor.
The Betty one looks drowsy.
Now is the time...
...to exert Marvan mind-power on her.
- Very well.
I must go to bed and make some coffee now.
Darling, what are you saying?
I don't think I understand.
How can you make coffee if you're in bed?
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.
I must make the Skeleton meatier using a crowbar covered in lettuce.
Darling, please, you're not making any sense.
Betty.
Betty, what are you doing?
What I should've done a long time ago, Paul.
- What are you saying?
- Leave her, Paul.
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.
Sleepwalker? She hasn't even gone to bed yet, Rudolph. Betty.
Betty, you little fool, where are you bringing that to?
Betty.
Betty!
Where...?
Where am I?
What happened?
It's all right, Betty. You were just doing some very stupid things.
It's all over now. Don't move or try to do anything.
All right if I breathe?
- Seriously, Paul. What came over me?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
It was...
...so strange.
All I know is I had an overwhelming desire to take the meteor.
Anything else?
Just vague things.
Strange.
A skull was smiling at me.
And something alien.
Like another brain...
...in my own head.
That doesn't make any sense.
Brains, head...
First of all, skulls don't smile, they're dead.
And it's more of a grin, really.
Believe me, I know. As a scientist,
I've looked plenty of skulls...
...in the socket in my time.
Not a pretty sight.
- Oh, Paul, what can it mean?
- I don't know.
But as a precaution,
I'm putting that meteor...
...in a drawer where even you can't find it.
- Oh, Paul...
- I'm sorry, Betty.
But until you can explain to me what you mean by "brains" and "head"...
...even you can't be trusted.
Not until you're yourself again, kitten.
The only one I want in that pretty little head of yours is me.
- Oh, Paul.
- Now, never mind "Oh, Paul."
It's gonna be all right. You'll see.
Oh, Paul.
Don't think I don't know who you are.
Pray, do not seek to tell us what we do and do not think.
You are different from the other humans.
More disgusting, I think.
If "disgusting" means smart and ambitious on your planet...
...I would agree wholeheartedly.
I would hardly expect aliens such as yourselves...
...to have a full grasp of the English language.
Aliens? Us?
Is this one of your Earth jokes?
See? See?
You should not have said
"Earth jokes."
Don't you see how that gave us away?
Very well, clever brain, you have found us out.
- What do you intend to do?
- Do?
Do?
Absolutely nothing.
Nothing?
It seems we are working to a similar purpose, you and I.
And that purpose is...
...atmosphereum.
So you know.
Yes. For, you see,
I also need this atmosphereum...
...for my very own reasons.
Then surely there is enough for both of us.
That's what I'm thinking.
We shall share the atmosphereum.
If you help us and we help you...
Why, of course.
We'll be helping each other.
Almost like an alliance.
You could say that.
As if we were actually working together.
Atmosphereum for me...
...atmosphereum for you.
Some for you and some for us.
Each of us would have it.
We will "split it," I suppose your Earth slang would say.
Very good, Tergasso.
You learn our ways quickly.
This way, neither of us will lack for atmosphereum.
- Of course.
- You two catch on quickly.
I can see I've chosen my partners wisely.
Yes. Yes, we would be partners, wouldn't we?
Partners who share.
"Partners who share." I like that.
I like the way aliens think.
You Earth fools are not so lacking...
...in the "thinking and then being triumphant" area also.
Not at all. In fact, I would say you rather excel in it.
How do we get the meteor?
Well, I see the brainy types are up bright and early this morning.
They say that's the best time to look at little, glowing rocks.
What the...?
Sorry, I must've been really involved in my scientific work for a minute.
I guess that's what they mean...
...when they say scientists have rocks in their heads.
Thanks to science, we're finally starting to understand atmosphereum.
Did you know there's enough atmosphereum in one teaspoon...
...to go to the moon and back six times?
Moon, teaspoons. That's all gibberish to me, I'm afraid.
As long as I don't have to go to the kitchen six times...
...to tell you breakfast is ready.
- Okay.
Speaking of early risers, where have our unexpected guests gotten off to?
- They certainly are odd ducks.
- You know, I don't know.
Something about hiking or exploring or something.
Oh, well.
Well, just as long as they don't hike too far and fall off a cliff.
- That would be a hike.
- You said it.
Now, let's see what happens when I add water to it.
Good, old-fashioned H2O, I call it.
Oh, hello, Pammy.
I didn't see you come in.
How come you're not out hiking with the others?
I don't have answers, Paul.
Paul.
You've probably seen plenty of woods.
- You seem like the outdoor type.
- Always agree.
You can watch me experiment, if you promise to be quiet.
Be quiet.
Well, I don't mean stop breathing...
...but don't exactly do a big dance number, either.
Now, that's almost exactly the kind of thing I was saying you shouldn't do.
Seriously, Pammy, I don't know if I can do science with you dancing like that.
Please stop.
Quit it, Pammy, quit it.
Don't make me bring my wife in here. She can be a real...
Animala. Dance with Animala.
Rock dance.
Do the rock dance.
All right, Mr. Shiny Rocks, breakfast.
Paul?
That's funny.
Paul.
Paul.
Now, where could he have gone?
Not another meteor.
Paul.
Rock dance, Pauly, do the rock dance. Oh, yeah.
Paul?
Paul.
Paul.
Where are you, for goodness' sakes?
Come, Animala. That's my pet.
Is she not special, this one?
She is truly special, this Earth woman.
Or should I say animal?
It's hard to decide.
Yes, it is. Since she's made from forest animals.
She must teach me this dance, but later. Now there is much to be done.
That's good, Animala, my pet.
Stop him right there.
Now take the box and give it to me.
Excellent. Let the sharing begin.
- The Mutant! It must have Betty.
- No matter.
There are more important things to settle.
Now, Skeleton!
Freeze where you are,
Lattis and Kro-bar.
Not moving very fast now, are you, my interplanetary friends?
- So this is your idea of sharing.
- It's not like Marvan sharing at all.
This must be Earth sharing.
You'll find much of Earth sharing works this way.
It's really more like
I'm sharing with myself.
If I could only reach you, we'd share pain.
Sorry, I'd love to stay, but I have a skeleton to bring to life.
That would be me.
And I cannot spare the atmosphereum.
Animala?
Animala, come. Come, Animala.
What are you doing?
Anyone get the number of the rocket that clobbered me?
Speaking of rockets!
Holy moly!
There's no time to explain now, Paul.
The Mutant has Betty.
Please, get these ropes off me.
Take them off now!
- There are no ropes.
- My wife panics.
These ropes are mental.
I think it's a skeleton or something.
That's crazy. Skeletons can't mentally hold anyone.
I sleep now.
Gee, I guess they can.
Would someone mind telling me what the heck's going on around here?
The Mutant's got Betty.
We're aliens.
Slow down. I'm a scientist, and that was still fast.
We had a mutant. It got loose.
It has Betty.
Hey, one at a time.
I'm gonna get whiplash here.
Now, suppose you start at the beginning...
...and tell me what happened before I get a headache.
We are from the planet Marva.
We crashed here.
Planet? Marva? You're gonna have to do a lot better than that...
...if you want my help.
Just suppose you take a deep breath, relax and tell me all about it.
The universe is a very large place.
Soon, very soon, we'll be...
...at Cadavra Cave, my love.
Then you'll see.
Your eyes will behold the wonder of the Skeleton.
Skeleton.
And so you can well understand the need for urgency.
I certainly can.
No wonder you were excited.
But there's one thing
I don't understand...
...and that's why you tried to take the meteor.
I'm certain there's enough atmosphereum...
...to power your ship and still have enough left for me to do science with.
You mean you would share the atmosphereum with us?
Kro-bar. This water on my cheeks.
I have never felt it before.
Oh, what a strange and wondrous thing it is, surely.
I, too, am feeling this new sensation of Earth weeping.
- Something very alien to Marva.
- Oh, yes.
We gave up weeping eons ago.
Kro-bar, maybe this is one advance even science couldn't make for you.
The advance of emotional expression.
Though it isn't considered very manly.
There'll be time enough for weeping later.
Right now your mate is...
Betty!
Skeleton? Hello, my Skeleton.
I brought you back a present.
It's a rock. It glows.
Hello, Skeleton.
Who wakes the
Lost Skeleton of Cadavra?
Oh, it's you. The stupid one.
Oh, you'll like me better now.
A whole lot better.
Shut up. Stop that giggling.
It makes me uncomfortable.
We have much work to be done.
Hello, Animala.
What happened to me?
Betty. Betty, it's all right now.
It's... It's me, Paul.
Dr. Paul Armstrong, your husband.
Oh, Paul.
There, there. It's all right now.
You're among friends now.
Alien friends.
Aliens?
- My God! Where am I?
- It's all right, Betty.
- You're just in a spaceship now.
- Yes, Betty, it's just like your house.
Only, it travels through space.
Please, Betty, try and remember what happened. I know it's painful.
Oh, it was horrible.
Horrible.
Betty. Betty, it's all right now.
Calm yourself.
Please, Mrs. Armstrong, there are delicate instruments aboard.
L... I remember...
...it came out of nowhere.
It was huge. It had...
It was so ugly.
I must've fainted, and the next thing I know...
...it was carrying me.
Like I was a child.
A small child.
And it looked at me...
...with those eyes, those ugly eyes...
...and they looked deep into me.
Deeper than any human ever has...
...with a kind of understanding that frightened me to my very soul.
Gosh, Betty. Almost sounds like you like the Mutant.
Like a mutant?
Can anyone like a mutant?
- I wonder.
- The Mutant is strange.
We keep it merely as a pet to us.
I have never looked in its eyes.
- Have you?
- No.
Paul, what happened to you?
I went looking.
I don't know.
All I remember was...
...Pammy... No.
She was really Animala.
Part woman...
...part four different forest animals.
And she can dance.
Oh, how she can dance.
Like I've never seen a woman dance before.
Well, we've certainly had quite a morning, haven't we?
We certainly have.
Do it. Do it.
Interesting, Paul.
So you would be a meteorologist?
No, Kro-bar, believe it or not...
...a meteorologist is actually another name for a weatherman.
I study meteors, so I'm actually a meteographer.
A lot of people don't know that.
Are you enjoying the cranberroids, Betty?
You know, I am.
And I can't get over how similar they are to something we have.
Only, we call them cranberries.
Cranberries.
Yes. It is interesting, the differences and similarities we have, is it not?
Why, on our home planet, Marva...
...we have a custom of actually eating outside...
...if weather is pleasant and acceptable.
Why, we have that.
We call it a picnic.
"Picnic." How delightful.
We call it cooty-lana.
Cooty-lana. That's fun to say.
Many things on Marva are fun to say, Paul.
This space wine is delicious.
Heavenly bouquet.
Is it like our Earth wine?
Made out of grapes, Lattis?
Grapes? Oh, surely no, Betty.
Grapes on Marva are far too sacred to step on, on Marva.
We make our wine from cherries, which we call linbooba.
Cherry wine, what a delight.
And do your people love to get intoxicated, as our people love to do?
No, Betty, we gave up getting drunk eons of your years ago.
You know, this talking that we're doing...
...is very helpful in getting to know your people and mine.
Why, as we observed you from afar, we thought of you...
...as little more than pleasant, entertaining monkeys.
So dirty and foul.
You have taught us a lot...
...Paul and Betty Armstrong.
And you us.
There is one more thing we would be taught now...
...and that's how to get the atmosphereum back...
...so that my planet might benefit...
...and your ship might return you home.
You have a device, do you not?
A detector of atmosphereum?
The atmosphereum detector, of course.
And unless I miss my guess...
...Kro-bar, alien being of the planet Marva...
...is about to suggest that we use that very device...
...to track the meteor that Rudolph Yaber stole.
Well, I didn't know...
...you were all mind readers on the planet Earth.
Remember, we may come across the Mutant.
As I told you, it is also rich in atmosphereum.
I know. I'm hoping the radiation we find...
...is on something not moving.
Like a rock.
Yes, indeed.
- Lattis, I just have to ask you.
- Yes, Betty?
After meals on Marva, who cleans up?
- The men or the women?
- Cleans up?
Why, Betty, on Marva, there is no cleaning up...
...because there's never a mess.
We gave up messes eons ago.
Think of it.
A world without messes.
No ground-in dirt.
No ugly grease stains.
No burned pans or hard-to-reach corners.
Lattis, Marva sounds like such a wonderful place.
Excellent.
You have done well, my pigeons.
Already, I feel the life returning to my tired and aching bones.
I can feel it. I'm sitting.
I'm sitting up.
Do you know how long it's been since I sat up?
- Pigeons.
- I am yours to command...
...O Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
I have risen!
Something...
Something's coming.
- The Mutant!
- Fire. Fire, Kro-bar.
- Make it harmless.
- Something's wrong.
It's jammed.
I think dirt got into it.
No, Paul! No! Paul!
No! No!
Paul! Paul!
I wonder why it changed its mind.
Oh, well. Paul! Paul, you crazy, stupid, wonderful man...
...why did you do it?
- L...
I don't know, Betty.
I should stick to science...
...and leave battling alien mutants to the experts.
I'm sorry about the transmutatron, my Earth friend.
I'll take a look at it and see if I can fix it in the shop...
...so that another of us doesn't almost die.
You two better go back to the cabin so Paul can rest.
I have a bottle of transmutatron cleaner in the ship.
Come, Lattis.
Kro-bar...
...be careful.
I'm an alien, Paul, remember?
Look at it go.
What a skeleton.
Paul, please try and rest...
...that scientific mind and body for once.
Rest? How can I rest...
...when the two best alien friends a guy ever had may be in danger?
Paul, those two came over 1000 miles.
They can take care of a little problem like a mutant.
Nothing's going to happen to Lattis.
She promised to show me some space recipes.
Oh, that reminds me. My tapioca.
What orders do you have, my bony wonder?
Shut up.
Very well.
Follow me.
Climb down these rocks like I do.
Paul, you're not well enough.
You hardly touched your pudding.
If I'm wrong, I'll buy you enough pudding to go to the moon.
I sense Lattis and Kro-bar are in great danger.
Say hello to your new master...
...the Skeleton.
It may be dangerous.
Don't tag along.
I'm tagging, Paul.
- I can't stop a woman from tagging.
- No one ever has.
Listen.
It isn't possible.
Dance. Dance!
You can't make aliens dance.
This is just wrong.
You don't know what you're tampering with.
And you don't know the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
But you will. You will.
Enough.
Yes, my skull.
Bring the female to me.
It's horrible. Horrible.
I can't watch this... This dancing.
And I cannot not watch it.
May God have mercy on us all.
You! You shall become...
...the bride of the Lost Skeleton!
No!
Fiend!
What was that?
Let the dancing resume.
You swine!
So anyway.
After Kro-bar is dead,
Lattis will be free to marry...
...the king of cartilage himself.
Betty, I've got an...
I've got an idea.
It means finding the Mutant with the transmutatron.
But it also means danger.
Real danger, kitten.
Are you game?
I can't force you.
Well...
...if I wanted to have a safe life...
...I wouldn't have married a man who studies rocks.
And you know, the way I figure...
...if it will stop my new alien best friend...
...from being a widow and married to a skeleton...
...well, just count me in,
Mr. Scientist.
That's my little meteorite.
Come on.
I guess we both have rocks in our heads.
I think he's sleeping.
How can you tell that, Roger?
I don't know.
Hey.
Hey, Skeleton?
Skeleton?
Stop it.
Stop it, I say!
If he wakes, it'll be your fault.
But it'll be you he yells at.
It's always you.
He hates you, Roger.
All right, Animala, just go see to the wedding plans.
Prepare the alien to be the Skeleton's bride.
- How do I do that?
- Just do it!
Once this starts ticking, we're in business.
- That's where I come in.
- It's your show then.
- Hopefully I'll get a curtain call.
- I hope you're around to enjoy it.
Let the Skeleton wedding begin.
Behold, the skeletal bride herself.
The alien himself will present the bride.
- Such irony.
- No, you can't make me.
I won't present the bride.
I won't present the bride.
You will, and you'll like it.
I won't like it. I won't like it.
I won't like it.
Mind if I crash?
Sorry if I'm not on the guest list.
Seize her.
Hold her!
It's a day for wedding crashers.
I never got an invitation!
You two shall pay dearly for ruining my special day...
...with your lives!
Master, my bony master, what shall we do?
Skeleton?
Lost Skeleton, no!
- Why me?
- I always hated you.
Stupid Skeleton.
Stupid Skeleton!
You cannot strangle me.
How can you strangle that which does not breathe?
I hate you. I hate you!
Bony idiot.
Foolish Mutant, you have spoiled my plans.
Now you must pay.
No. No. I cannot lose.
I cannot.
Obey me, Mutant.
- Obey the Lost Skeleton.
- He cannot, Skeleton.
Mutants are basically dumb brutes.
They don't have the mental capacity.
I will... I will return.
No. No.
No!
It's strange, Paul...
...so very strange. L...
I don't think it ever meant to kill.
It just didn't know not to.
Look, Kro-bar's changing Animala back into four animals.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, forest animals.
- Bye, animals.
- Bye.
Bye, animals.
A part of me is gonna miss Animala.
Not the part that's coming home with me, I hope.
Kro-bar, will you come with me and remove our meteor...
...from the Skeleton?
- Gladly, Paul.
You know, it's funny, but when the kind of understanding...
...that you and I have over a little piece of rock...
...spreads throughout the universe, then and only then...
...will there be understanding amongst all peoples, alien and alike...
...in all kinds of places at the same time.
THE TIME MACHINE
Aren't you
Forgetting something?
I know. It's something to do with
The third differential coefficient.
- Not that, Tonight,
- What?
Emma?
- What time is it?
- Almost 5:00,
Oh, God.
My proposal for utilizing
Solar power, rejected,
My concepts for harnessing
Micro-energy waves, rejected,
The dean suggests that I focus on
Something that might actually help mankind,
Like his study on the benefits
Of tobacco consumption,
Alex, the problem is
Your ideas are a bit too... radical,
The problem is with
The faculty. They're dinosaurs.
They're already extinct; they just don't know it.
They'll be discovered by some future archaeologist,
And he won't know what to make of them.
Their dim little eyes,
Devoid of any curiosity--
Alex, it's your first year
As associate professor.
You might want to play things
A little more conservatively.
You sound just like my father.
Look at them, Philby. All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.
Do you want your students
To turn out like that?
I want my students prepared
For the realities of the world
They're about to greet.
Well, I don't. I want them to run along
This street and knock off every bowler they see.
Mrs. Watch it!
Oh, huzzah, the master's home.
- Did you get it?
- Hello, Mr. Philby.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.
You're looking in the pink.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering
Up and down these stairs like a wee lad.
- Don't torture me. Did you get it?
- I got it.
- Good. Let me see.
- But don't you think for one moment...
I'm going to let you go out
In that filthy jacket.
Now, go in there and change.
And you've got another letter
From that annoying little man.
Well, go ahead,
Switch it on,
- It'll help people keep
Their teeth well into their 40s,
- You might think about having that cleaned.
- Oh, who has the time?
- How did you know with Molly?
- Know what?
- You were meant to be together.
- She made the best
Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Don't you have a single
Romantic bone in your body?
No. I'm all bowler hat.
Why do you waste your time
On that crack pot?
Because he has some
Very interesting ideas.
A professor at Columbia should not be
Corresponding with a crazy German bookkeeper.
He's a patent clerk,
Not a bookkeeper.
I think Mr. Einstein deserves
All the support I can give him.
I wonder if we'll ever
Go too far?
- With what?
- With this.
With all of this.
No such thing.
All right. How do I look?
Practically decent. Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.
She's a fine girl. She's done
Wonderful things for you.
Don't worry. You still have that
Alluring smell of chalk.
Oh, got to hurry.
Now, that's more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.
Well, you better hope so. If Emma
Turns me down, you'll be next.
- Oh, I'm already swooning.
All right. Wish me luck.
Thank you.
Fresh flowers. Fresh flowers.
- Have some flowers, sir.
- Not tonight, thanks.
No. I promised her flowers.
Spectacular.
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing's always breaking down.
- Do you need a lift?
-Yes, yes.
- How do you keep
The water temperature stable?
- There's a cantilevered gasket...
- on the fuel regulator--
Oh, God. Uh--
Much obliged.
I'm always forgetting the damn brake.
Hop in. I'll give you a perambulation
Before it breaks down again.
Oh, uh, I'm afraid
I have a prior engagement.
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.
Certainly.
- Get a horse!
Yes.
Alexander?
- Oh! Whoa.
- You're late, Professor.
- I got here as soon as I could.
Well, they say it's all the rage in Paris. But I just picked it up--
- Five dollars at Macy's.
Silly, isn't it?
- Very silly. I like it.
Well, where are they?
- What?
- The flowers.
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-- Well, I was distracted.
Well, there's something new.
- Uh, Emma, I need to talk to you.
-Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
-Yes.
Professor, you're shivering. I hope you're not coming down with something.
Well, I'm afraid I am.
I'm not sleeping very well, and even
When I'm awake, I'm not much use.
I can't eat or think
Or do much of any thing anymore.
And the worst part is,
I don't know that I'll ever be well.
I think there's only one remedy,
And that's for you to marry me...
- And spend the rest
Of your life with me.
Oh, Emma, I know it's right.
I know we're meant to be together.
It's the only thing in my entire life
I've never had to think about.
Oh, Alex.
Uh-Uh, wait.
I have something for you.
You know,
The moment is rather dying here.
I-I know.
Hold on. Oh.
- I know it's not a diamond.
- A moonstone.
Well, it's your birthstone.
I thought--
You thought right.
I just might cry,
I couldn't help but overhear.
Two fine young people starting out
On the road of life.
- I wish you the very best.
- Well, thank you.
- And as much as I hate to do this--
Moved as I am by your...
Protestations of love--
I'll need your money now.
- Sir?
- And your jewelry too.
I guess we could cal this your first little bump
On the road to marital bliss.
- I don't understand--
- Don't make a scene. There's no cause for that.
-Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?
Did you hear me, lad?
Uh, all right, all right.
Here. That's everything.
And your watch.
And the gloves.
- And the ring.
- No.
I'm afraid so, darling.
- And maybe he'll
Buy you a diamond now.
- Please, please. Not that.
Don't!
Why did you do that?
It's only a ring.
Emma?
Emma?
Oh!
- What?
Oh. Oh, sir,
Mr. Philby's here.
- Here?
- Yes, sir, He insisted on coming--
- Tell him to go away, I'm busy,
- I won't go away, Alex.
My God.
What's happened to you?
I've been--
I've been working.
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.
I care more about my life.
And yours.
I came by the house every day
After the funeral...
And every week
And every other month.
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?
- It hurt me, Alex... very much.
- Then why are you here now?
- There are some things I have to
Say you may not like hearing--
- I know. I know.
You're concerned. I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
But really...
I need you to go.
- I won't leave. Not with
You hiding down here.
- I'm not hiding.
Alex, will you please
Stand still and look at me!
It wasn't your fault.
No. It wasn't my fault.
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for picking up the ring from the jeweler.
Or the jeweler for making it.
Or the poor bastard who tore
The stone from the earth.
Maybe I should blame you
For introducing me to Emma
In the first place. Yes.
Alexander, nothing will
Ever change what happened.
No, you're wrong,
Because I will change it.
David, I appreciate
Your concern. I do.
But I ask you to have faith in me.
Well, I-I want to have
Faith in you, Alex, but--
What-- What are--
What are you doing here?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you come by for dinner
In a week, and I'll show you?
- Why don't you come home
With me now? Molly--
- Did you not hear me, David?
I can't leave
When I'm so close.
All right. We'll continue
This conversation in a week.
In a week, we'll never even
Have had this conversation.
Ah. Thank you, my good man.
You're early.
That's a first.
I wanted to see you.
Well, where are they?
- What?
- The flowers.
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?
You never cease to surprise me.
Emma, I need to talk to you.
- Shall we walk through the park?
- No!
No,
No. Let's go into the city.
- Alex, what is it?
- Nothing. Let's just hurry.
Running along is all very well for you.
You're not wearing a corset.
-Bleecker Street, and be quick about it.
Now you're all gallant.
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
You're not coming down with something.
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm wonderful. I'm walking down
The street with you again.
But we took a walk
Three days ago.
Well, not like this.
Never like this.
- Heavens, look at that car.
- Oh, I've seen it.
Now I know you're ill. You're passing up
The chance to explore some new gadget.
- It's only a machine.
- Alexander, tell me what's going on.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
No.
Emma, listen to me.
I need to leave you now, but I want you to go straight home and stay there.
I promise you I'll come by sometime later tonight,
And I won't make any sense.
I'll be all upset that you didn't meet
Me in the park, but you must trust me.
Everything will be all right.
Just know how much I love you,
How much I'll always love you.
All right.
But first, where are my flowers?
- Flowers it is.
Wait right there.
Don't move.
- Oh, can I help you, sir?
- Yes, a dozen roses. White.
- No, no. Red.
- Look out!
- Easy. Easy.
I'm looking for
Professor Hartdegen.
Alex, I'm--
I'm so sorry.
- This was not supposed to happen.
- Of course not.
- I know there's nothing I can say.
- We were out of the park, Philby.
We were safe.
Why can't I change it?
I could come back
A thousand times.
See her die a thousand ways.
I don't--
I don't understand.
I can't find the answer here.
Not here.
Not now.
The future is now.

- Alright,
Attention, everyone,
Class 23, could we gather, please?
Our next stop is Antiquities.
Please make sure that your micro scans
Are charged for download.

Tommy, if you do that again,
I will re-sequence your D.N.A.,
So help me! Now, march.
March, March,
Two by two, please, look lively,
Welcome to Vox System,
How may I help you?
I didn't see you there.
I always seem to have that effect.
How may I help you, sir?
- What is that thing?
- That is my photonic memory core,
Or P.M.C.,
As we say in the trade.
Over here, sir.
What are you?
I'm the Fifth Avenue
Public Library information
Unit, Vox registration NY-114.
How may I help you?
- A stereopticon of some sort.
- Stereopticon? Oh, no, sir,
I am a third-generation,
Fusion-powered photonic,
With verbal and visual link capabilities
Connected to every database...
On the planet,
Photonic?
A compendium of all human knowledge.
- Oh.
- Area of inquiry?
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Ah, accessing physics.
Mechanical engineering.
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.
Temporal causality,
Temporal paradox.
- Time travel?
- Yes.
Accessing science fiction.
No, no. Practical application.
My question is why can't
One change the past?
Because one cannot travel into the past.
- What-What if one could?
- One can not.
Excuse me, this is something
You should trust me on.
Accessing the writings
Of Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells,
Harlan Elison,
Alexander Hartdegen--
- Tel me about him.
- Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903,
American scientist
Given to eccentric postulation.
Found writings include treatise
On the creation of a time machine.
- Tel me about the time machine.
- Time Machine was written by H.G. Wells in 1894.
It was a motion picture by
George Pal and a stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber--
- That's not what I mean.
- Would you like to hear
Selections from the score?
- No.
- There's a place called tomorrow
A place of joy
Not of sorrow
Can't you see
It's a place for you and--
Thank you.
That's quite enough.
Will there be anything else?
Uh, no. No, I think I'll have better
Luck in a few hundred years.
Live long and prosper.
Sir, where is your designated evacuation center?
Sir, you are subject
To arrest under martial law--
Please put your hands out,
Palms together.
You will be held in detention until your
Evacuation center clears you for transport.
- Wait, wait!
-Just take it easy.
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait. How did this happen?
The moon. Come on.
Move it.
- That's impossible, what happened?
- You been living under a rock?
Yes, I've been living
Under a rock. Now, tell me.
The demolitions for the lunar colonies
Screwed up the orbit, okay?
The moon's breaking up.
All right? Come on.
- Hey! Forget him! Come on!
Emma?
Shh!
Hello?
Hello.
- Don't be afraid.
Oh, wait.
Don't-- Don't go.
Wait. I just want to talk to you.
- Hello.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.
- Do you know my words?
- Yes.
The lex,
The stone language.
The stone language? But do you
Understand me? Do you understand me?
We all learn it
When we're young,
They tor'jen,
Forget. They forget it.
- But I teach,
- What is he saying?
- They're trying to decide if we
Should throw you in the river.
Tel me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?
Well, actually, I'm from here.
Uh, just not from now.
You see, I built a machine that allows
Me to travel through time.
I'm from the past.
Oh.
I told them you hit your head...
And you are a wandering idiot.
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the moor,
- The night.
- Oh. I'll come with you.
- Eloi?
- What are your people named?
Well, I-I guess
You'd call us New Yorkers.
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?
Until you talk to them.
- Tell me about your village.
- It's a very busy place.
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.
Little black round things
On their heads.
- What do you do there?
- Well, I was a teacher like Mara.
- And I make things,
- Me also,
A sess'quin'tan?
Mara, der'enjen'wen len?
Sess'quin'tan,
Steps of rope.
Oh, a rope ladder.
We can make one.
I will teach you.
Will you tell me more lon'el
On the next day?
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.
Why don't you take care
Of this for me tonight?
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He's always been questioning.
Our parents were firm,
But it is his way.
- Where are your parents?
- They've gone from this place.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were right,
Philby. I did go too far.
Sit with me.
Mara, why do you pull the boats up at night?
Afraid they'll be stolen?
Stolen?
I do not know that word.
Well, are you afraid that
Someone will take them?
- It is just more safe this way.
- Oh.
- You must do things to be safe
Where you come from?
- Of course,
Or when you come from.
Ah, so I'm not just
A wandering idiot.
Col'mar,
Maybe we could
Find some tomorrow.
Flowers?
Alexander, Alexander,
Ah! Morlock!
- Is he all right?
- He had a dream.
Oh. So did I.
I was moving
Through a jungle--
And you saw a shape
Ahead of you.
Well, a face that... called my name.
We all have that dream.
- All of you?
- Yes. Now go back asleep.
You're still not well,
What does that mean,
"Morlock"?
A child's dream.
No more.
Go back asleep,
We keep these stones
In many places,
This is the room where my parents
Taught me for the first time.
Why do you learn this language if you don't use it?
It's a tradition we hand down.
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.
"One generation passed away,
And another comes.
But the earth abided forever."
Why have you come here?
Why have you traveled
Through time?
To have a question answered.
Question?
Yes. Why can't I change the past?
Why would you want to?
You've lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
- Mara, why are there
No older people here?
- What do you mean?
Older people, your parents' age
Or grandparents' age.
They've gone from this place.
You mean, they're dead?
Yes.
All of them?
How is that possible?
There are things
Better left not said.
We don't dwell
On the past, Alexander.
- We do something else.
- What?
We remember them...
With these,
Alexander!
Alexander.
- Are you coming to work now?
Come with me--
- No.
Alexander's not well enough.
We're going to see his machine.
- Now?
- Stay with Toren.
- Go the next day, tomorrow.
- I need to see that it's all right.
- This way.
Will you tell me more about
N-New York tonight?
I will.
Oh, good.
It seems fine.
We had quite a ride together.
- It's ready?
- Appears so.
Will you use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Well, I-- I guess I could.
Uh...
It seems so long ago.
No. You should go.
And I need to ask,
Will you take Kalen with you?
- Why?
- Alexander, take him away,
Back to your time. Will you?
- Mara, why?
- Please. You don't know.
- Take him away from here.
Kalen!
Mara, what's going on?
They're early!
We must get Kalen!
Kalen!
Kalen! Kalen!
Mara!
- Kalen!
- No, stay here.
Stay in the group!
Run!
Mara!
Mara!
Where did they take them?
- We have to follow them.
We have to find them.
- We do not. Col'quin tor,
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi'tas, our life here.
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor'tasal'mor,
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.
- This is the world.
- Why don't you fight back?
Fight back. Why not?
Those who farquil'pax...
Fight--
Are taken first.
- Kalen, do you know
Where they're taken?
- No.
- Do they ever come back?
- No.
- Has anyone ever followed them?
- I don't know.
- Well, what about the Morlocks?
There must be a leader.
- We're not supposed to talk.
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.
Sometimes we need to
Accept what's happening to us
Even if we don't want to.
And other times we have to fight,
Even if we're afraid.
Now, it's difficult
To understand, I know.
Believe me, I know.
Now, they're afraid,
And I'm asking you not to be.
So will you tell me what you know?
We can save her.
Please.
When they go,
We're not supposed to talk about it.
- But we all know the place.
- What place?
Where the ghosts are.
Here it is.
Welcome to VOX system,
How may I help you?
- It's all right.
- How may I serve you?
What can I get you?
Oh, let's see.
Um, Henry James.
Oh, no. Yes?
No, no, no, Too depressing, Hemingway,
Perhaps? No, Too sweaty,
Plato, Proust, Pinter,
Poe, Pound?
No. Complete Works of Martha Stewart?
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.
- Right up your alley, I would think,
- Photonic, right?
Or what's left of one,
What's left of all of them?
I am the last, and "these fragments
I have shored against my ruins."
T.S. Eliot.
You wouldn't know him yet,
But he is so depressing, yet so divine.
Oh, I'm sorry. The lending library is temporarily out of service.
Not to worry. I have them all right here-- every page of every volume.
Can you tell me
What's happening here?
Well, my sources are
No longer fully annotated,
And my information is somewhat
Anecdotal, but I believe
What was once one race... is now two.
One above
And one below.
Two distinct species
That have evolved.
- And how do those below survive?
- That is the real question, isn't it?
- I don't believe it.
- Well,
If you don't like the answers,
You should avoid asking the questions.
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past,
No ambition for the future,
- So lucky.
- Why would you say something like that?
Can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?
I remember a six-year-old girl
Who asked me about dinosaurs
800,000 years ago.
I remember the last book
I recommended: Look Homeward,
Angel, by Thomas Wolfe.
And yes,
I even remember you,
Time travel:
Practical application.
How do you know about the Morlocks if you can't leave this place?
There was one Eloi who managed to escape, He told me everything,
We spent years together,
Just talking.
The conversation's a little spotty now,
But I do remember.
-It's good to have a friend.
-Then you can help us find the Morlocks,
Find Mara.
And if the truth is so horrible,
And will haunt your dreams for all time?
Well, I think I'm used to that.
My friend said he came from the east,
From the jungle.
- will you describe it?
- I don't have to.
Just follow the breathing.
In the dream, we're moving toward it,
But I think it was meant to keep us away,
- I might just go in by myself.
- No.
Mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt. Now, I'll find her,
But I need you to go back
To the village and light a fire
So we can find our way home.
- All right? Will you do that for me?
- I lost your pocket watch.
They took it from my room.
I'm sorry.
Why would they take it?
Oh. Stupid.
[ Grunting ]
Mara?
Mara?
Mara.
Mara?
Come a little closer.
I don't bite.
Do I surprise you?
- A little. Yes.
- Hmm.
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky,
The Earth could no longer
Sustain the species.
Some managed to stay above,
The rest of us
Escaped underground,
Then centuries later,
When we tried to reemerge
Into the sun again, we couldn't,
So we bred ourselves
Into castes.
Some to be our eyes and ears.
- Some to be our muscles and sinews.
- You mean you're hunters.
Yes. Bred to be predators,
But bred also to be controlled.
You see,
My caste concentrated...
On expanding
Our cerebral abilities.
- You control their thoughts.
- Not just theirs.
The Eloi.
So it's not enough that you hunt
Them down like animals.
- That's their role here.
- To be your food?
Yes.
And for those who are suitable,
To be breeding vessels...
For our other colonies.
You see,
I'm just one of many,
I don't understand how you can sit there
And speak so coldly about this.
Have you not considered the human
Cost of-- of what it is you're doing?
We all pay a price...
Alexander.
Don't worry.
You're safe.
I control them.
Without that control,
They would
Exhaust the food supply... in a matter of months.
Food supply?
They're human beings!
Who are you...
To question 800,000 years...
Of evolution?
-This is-- This is a perversion
Of every natural law.
And what is time travel
But your pathetic attempt to
Control the world around you,
-your futile effort to have
A question answered?
Do you think I don't know you,
Alexander?
I can look
Inside your memories,
Your nightmares,
Your dreams.
You're a man haunted by
Those two most terrible words:
What if?
Look at you!
- And along ponytail--
- Daddy!
- Who's that? Is it Daddy?
- Daddy!
- Long ponytail,
And we're still having lots of fun,
- Right, Right.
Da-da! Daddy.
You built your time machine
Because of Emma's death.
If she had lived,
It would never have existed.
So how could you use your machine
To go back to save her?
You are
The inescapable result...
Of your tragedy,
Just as I...
Am the inescapable result...
Of you.
You have your answer.
Now go.
I believe you have something
That belongs to me.
- We all have our time machines,
Don't we?
Those that take us back
Are memories...
And those that
Carry us forward...
Are dreams.
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Huh?
- What if?
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.
Come on.
Wait. Wait here.
Go.
- Hurry!
Huh?
Alexander!
I'm sorry
You lost your machine.
Oh, it's all right.
It was only a machine.
"The congregation rose and stared...
"While the three dead boys
Came marching up the aisle:
"Tom in their lead,
Joe next,
"And Huck,
A ruin of drooping rags,
- "sneaking sheepishly in the rear.
"They had hid in an unused gallery,
Listening to their own funeral sermon.
Aunt Poly, Mary and the Harpers
Threw themselves upon them--"
This is the place.
So it is.
- But there's nothing here.
- Well, it was different then.
My laboratory was all around here.
The kitchen was up there
Where that tree is.
Not that Mrs. Watchit
Ever let me go in there.
I don't know
What to tell you, sir.
He's been gone
This whole week.
And you've no idea
Where he went?
- No, sir.
- This would be my green house,
There was a garden outside.
Gren 'tormar'tas?
Yes.
- I'm glad.
- Sir?
I'm glad he's gone.
Maybe he's finally found someplace
Where he can be happy.
- This was my home.
- His home.
Long ago.
You know, Molly and I were talking
About engaging a housekeeper,
Someone to live with us
And help take care of Jamie.
Would you be interested?
- Perhaps just until the master returns.
- Of course.
- But there'd be some changes made.
I run a tight house.
Oh, I have no doubt of that. I'll call
By in the morning, and we'll arrange it.
- Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
- Good night, Mr. Philby.
- Godspeed, my fine lad.
Godspeed.
Long ago, when the pyramids were still young, -
- Egyptian kings played a game of great and terrible power.
They did battle with magic and monsters for riches and glory.
From these Shadow Games erupted a war -
- that threatened to destroy the world, -
- until a brave and powerful pharaoh locked the dark magic away, -
- imprisoning it for all eternity within the mystical Millennium Items.
But even eternity doesn't last forever.
It was never to happen, and for 5000 years it never did.
The secret of the Millennium Puzzle remain safely beyond reach.
Within the imponderable conundrum of it's intricate design.
For a boy named Yugi, the mystery of the Millennium Puzzle -
- remains just that.
The solution, if one exists, eludes him as it did those that came before him.
But this time, fate has played a hand in bringing the puzzle -
- and this person together.
It was never to happen.
And for 5000 years it never did.
But while the desert does it's best to conceal -
- that which should remain burried, -
- it eventually yielded it's most ancient and terrible secrets.
We found it. The lost tomb of Anubis.
Professor, what do you make of this? It's amazing.
What possessed them to put the sarcophagus in chains?
Hey, all right!
Maybe this one next.
Yeah! One to go.
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.
Now what have we here?
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised when he sees I've figured -
- this puzzle out all by myself.
The last piece.
This is it.
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.
What's going on?
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.
This tomb is cursed.
Hey! What is this?
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!
Return to the dark realm from whence you came!
It was never to happen but after 5000 years it did.
And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.
In the three short years since he started playing Duel Monsters -
- Yugi Moto has risen to international stardom, -
- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.
But what makes this young man such a talented duelist?
Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -
- powerful God Cards he's assembled in his deck?
Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven his dueling powers time and again.
He has reigned victorious in the most prestigious tournaments, -
- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.
And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -
- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -
- around this little high school pipsqueak.
Yugi says his success is due to his grandfather's coaching -
- and to his belief in the heart of the cards.
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.
But other say it is the three Egyptian God Cards -
- that make Yugi virtually unbeatable.
And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -
- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?
You've got one.
And this time things are gonna end differently, you pompous windbag.
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.
Make all the smug pronouncements you like, but know this:
There's got to be a way to beat your God Cards.
And I won't stop until I find it.
Now I activate the Magic Card -
- Polymerization.
This allows me to fuse my three dragons together, -
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
And that's just for starters.
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles my dragon's attack points:
Megamorph.
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful than any monster on the field.
There is more to power than just attack points.
And just what is that supposed to mean?
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess powers far beyond meer monsters.
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -
- I can bestow upon the third, infinite strength.
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is the strongest monster in play.
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him what true power is all about.
Attack with Fist of Fury!
No.
My dragon.
- No!
- System overload!
The simulation is malfunctioning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was certain that our calculations -
- were correct this time, sir.
If you just give us one more chance, sir.
So you can fail again? Sorry.
Please, sir. We're close to postulating a winning strategem.
Well if I were you I'd start postulating myself a new job.
You've had more than enough time to find a way to beat -
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But as usual I have to do it myself.
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.
There's gotta be some way to defeat Yugi's God Cards.
And I think I know were to start looking.
The God Cards?
What a horrible nightmare.
That's it, no more white wine spritzers before bedtime for me.
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -
- but I can still see that something terrible is about to unfold.
About time the museum got a descent display of Egyptian artifacts.
Hey, that looks just like a Millennium Item.
This I gotta see.
This is flight command.
Initiating Duel Dome launch convertion. Over.
Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -
- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.
We show Mr. Kaiba now approaching primary flight deck.
Begin complete systems check at once.
- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.
- Navigation sensors.
- Check.
- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.
Blue-Eyes White Jet, you are clear for take-off.
Activating main thrust rockets.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.
Red wine spritzer, sir.
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.
You and I have never been friends, so let's not start pretending that we are.
Oh, my. Sounds like someone's need a hug.
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it, there is something I need.
Listen. I've come to your little fantasy island -
- in search of a card powerful enough to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.
And you believe I'd might have this all-powerful God-smiting Card because?
Because you created the game, Pegasus.
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy, but I'm retired now.
The only things I create these days are places like this for the fishies to enjoy.
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -
- and would have never let them out of your sweaty little hands, -
- unless you also created a way to beat them.
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess.
I may have one card that could help, but you can't have it.
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -
- but I don't think you deserve it.
True I may not see as well as I once did.
But to be honest, it doesn't take a magic eye -
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has trounced your sorry behind again and again.
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.
Well since I'm such a disappointment, you should have no trouble -
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?
Because if you'll put up the card I need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -
- just for a chance to trounce little Yugi?
My, my, my, seems you're even more desperate than I thought.
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.
Kaiba, my dear and devious friend, let the games begin.
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.
But I haven't seen this many people running from school since they served -
- meat loaf surprise last year.
- What in the...
- Let me see.
Wonder who these guys are all waiting for.
It's him.
Told you he's alot smaller than on tv.
Me first. Let me at him.
Please just give me one shot at those God Cards.
Get out of my way! If anyone gets the God Cards, it's me.
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?
Life on the top, Téa. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.
So they all want a piece of him, and those God Cards.
Téa, try to sneak Yugi around the back, while we hold them off.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.
- On three.
- Quick, after them.
Forget about those nobodies.
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?
I said you're nobody.
Yeah, that's right. And everybody knows it too.
Well just everybody who's anybody, that is.
Listen up. Nobody but nobody calls me a nobody, -
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.
The Master of the Gods, not the Master of the Clods.
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -
- by doing top-contender, and I think I know one.
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.
So if you wanna get to the King of Games -
- you'll have to go through me, the Godfather of Games, capiche.
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.
Won't take long. Let's do this.
Okay, ladies first.
Funny. Take this!
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.
Hi, there.
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.
Say ah!
What the...
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in order to summon Maju Garzett.
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you to say it, not spray it? Some menace.
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.
Which means all the monsters you got out on the field are destroyed, pal.
Lightning Sword.
Ah, nuts!
Maybe now, you'll have the proper respect for Joey -
- the Godfather of Games.
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.
We're gonna get ya.
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.
Quick! Yugi, this way.
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.
Some place where we will be save from that Duel Monsters mob.
Some place they'd never look.
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?
Is this the latest in duel arena technology, or what?
This place is an outdated joke.
But then so are you, so I suppose it fits.
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.
Look, enough small talk.
Let's duel!
I'll start things off.
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.
A world of chaos. A world of absolute mayhem.
That's right. A world of Toons.
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually still using that idiotic Toon World card.
Well, this is gonna be even easier than I thought.
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.
And this for later.
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.
I summon X-Head Cannon.
I'll throw two cards face down.
For later.
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?
No wait that I now play this.
Card of Sanctity.
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us each to draw until we both -
- have six cards in our hand.
Just what I needed.And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?
I know what it means. Now you can summon your strongest monsters to the field -
- more easily.
Please, what do you take me for, some kind of a rookie?
You're not quite that good, Kaiba-boy.
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.
But I won't be using her just yet.
First I'll attack with the Gemini Elves.
And I think I'll have them target... -
- you.
Cartoons are so violent these days.
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.
When they deal damage to a player, that player loses a card from his hand.
Aren't my Toons simply magnificent, Kaiba-boy?
Oh, don't look so sour.
Think of it this way, at least it will be them stopping you little quest to the top and not -
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.
I guess it's true that when you get old, the mind is the first thing to go, because -
- you forgot all about my face down cards.
And now it's gonna cost you.
Attack Guidance Armor.
This trap's like a magnet that redirects your own attack right back at you.
No, you wouldn't.
Oh, yes I would. And I will.
Guidance Armor, attach to the Toon Gemini Elves.
But they were just innocent Toons.
You'll pay for that.
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.
And play Ultimate Offering.
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -
- this first monster will be quite a powerful one.
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile.
Well, compared to the next Toon, that is.
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.
Sure, I'll have to give up another 500 of my life ponts, -
- but then, you know what they say, Kaiba-boy:
You have to spend life points to take life points.
Of course, you know all about that.
Yugi's been taking your life points for what, going on three years now?
Oh, I'm sorry to keep bringing that up.
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.
Now by discarding one card from my hand, -
- I can remove any monster from the game.
I see.
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -
- but I guess this is goodbye.
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't be getting off that easily, -
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
Head from my hand.
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.
What? But X-Head Cannon is your own monster.
What are you scheming?
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.
It removes one more monster from the game -
- and I'm using it on my Y-Dragon Head.
Why are you removing your own monsters?
And now, I summon -
- Z-Metal Tank.
That makes no sense, unless...
Unless I still have one more card to play, Pegasus.
And it so happens I do.
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.
It's well worth half my life points to bring back all my monsters.
And nice trick to know when you wanna summon more than one monster in a turn.
And as you're well aware, these aren't just any monsters, Pegasus.
They combine.
Together they create the ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need to blast any card I want out of the duel.
If you still say you're gonna win, then it's time to change your tune.
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!
Use Cannon Firestorm.
That's all folks.
Now let's see which you've got to beat the Egyptian Gods.
Looks like you had two cards up your sleeve.
What do you mean, two cards?
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.
Nice try, you snake.
The museum is the last place those demented duelists would think to look for you.
Hope you're right.
Hey, it's some kind of an Egyptian exhibit.
Look, Téa.
That blue pyramid, there.
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.
Let's go check it out.
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
If we stay here I'm gonna blow chunks.
Okay, I get the point, Téa.
You're not a mummy fan.
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?
Oh, well it looks like great minds think alike.
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.
This says, it's called the Pyramid of Light.
In all my years of egyptology, I've never come across this relic before.
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror who tried to bring about the end of the world.
Well I guess it's pretty safe to say his plan didn't work, right?
Legends say a brave pharaoh destroyed him using -
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.
The same pharaoh who many believed possessed your Millennium Puzzle.
Come, I'll show you.
See? There is the knife.
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.
"The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -"
"- unless blinded by events predetermined."
"Thus light and shadows both be killed."
From the light comes the dark.
Téa? Would you read me the story about the bunny?
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion talking and forget all about it.
'Cause right now we got bigger problems.
Like where King Tut's freaky cousin went.
The mummy's body's been stolen.
And that's not all. He napped that pyramid thing too.
Grandpa. Stay here.
I have a feeling Kaiba's in danger. I have to warn him.
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.
I'll call you.
What hit me?
Probably whatever broke into the museum.
No. This is terrible.
Yeah, they took the mummy and the Pyramid of Light.
This is one crime those crooks is gonna regret.
According to the legend, Anubis found that he would one day return from the dead.
What's going on?
- You don't really think that...
- Téa, I don't know what to think.
Let's just hope that legend is just a legend.
Stop the car!
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.
And he says that it's real important that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.
All I know is that Seto hasn't been acting like himself lately.
I think he's gonna totally lose it.
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.
Or, like you helped. Then again you duel worse than my mom.
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.
Check it out. What's Kaiba's limo doing at Yugi's place?
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.
My brother's waiting for you on the top floor.
I got it. Thanks.
Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.
Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.
This is want he wants.
But it is too much of a coincident that Kaiba would send for us -
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.
And I'm pretty sure it has something to do with that Anubis guy.
It seams like you had some kind of battle with him 5000 years ago.
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my days as the pharaoh are clouded, -
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.
I sure wish we knew more about what happened back in your past.
All that matters is that we face the future together.
And I wouldn't have it any other way. Are you ready partner?
Ready.
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Kaiba's car is outside so Yugi must be here.
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?
My brother is about to duel him.
Welcome.
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.
'Cause this time things are gonna be different.
Initiating duel simulation.
Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.
I hope you've brought your Egyptian God Cards.
Otherwise, this duel isn't gonna be any fun at all.
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.
Spare me the fairy tales.
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.
If you think you sense something dangerous, you're absolutely right, -
- because it's me and my deck, and in this Duel Monsters match -
- you're about to lose big-time.
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.
If you say so.
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.
Now what'd you say we get down to business, already?
Something tells me that this duel is not a good idea.
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself for once and listen to what I'm telling you?
You're in no position to be making demands.
So shut up and duel.
And may the best duelist win.
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.
You've been taking credit for being the best duelist for way too long.
And to tell you the truth I'm sick of it.
By the time this duel is over, you'll be exposed to the world as a total fraud.
Let's duel!
I'll start.
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in defence mode. Try and get past him.
Very well, I shall.
I play Queen's Knight.
And now, say goodbye to your monster.
Queen's Knight, attack!
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -
- which allows you to play a new beast in it's place.
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would he let Kaiba play a monster -
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?
And you're being so helpful, because why?
Because by doing so I also get to summon a new monster.
King's Knight.
And these two knights are in play I can -
- automatically summon my Jack's Knight.
And next I place one card face down.
Make your move.
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.
And then nothing in your deck will make a difference. Your move, Yugi.
An Egyptian God Card.
I sacrifice my three knights to bring forth my ultimate creature.
Behold the Egyptian God Card:
Slifer the Sky Dragon.
Your monster is completely defenceless against the devine power of Slifer.
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!
Had enough?
Not only am I not afraid of your God Cards -
- but I'm gonna force you to summon all three of them at once.
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -
- you have to bring out every monster in your deck that falls into -
- the same category as the one that's on the field already.
Very well. Then I play two more God Cards.
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.
It's no mistake.
My entire strategy was to draw out your three Egyptian God Cards, -
- so I can be the first duelist to crush all of them at once.
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.
So the Pyramid of Light is more than just an ancient artifact.
It's also a card.
Now pyramid, activate!
Looks like your so called unstoppable monsters have been stopped.
Impossible.
See for yourself.
Wow, check it out.
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?
He actually did it.
Yugi. What's this?
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.
This weird stuff always happens when Yugi duels.
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.
What's going on?
This is crazy.
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.
That blue beam is the same color of the Pyramid of Light from the museum -
- and I bet it's no coincidence.
What ever is going on in there, one thing's for sure: It can't be good.
Yugi, where are you?
Kaiba, do you have any idea what you've just done?
Well, let's see. I think I have just beaten you.
Hey, wait a sec. This place looks kinda familiar.
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.
I've gotta find it so we can reconnect.
I'm pretty sure that one of these rooms belongs to him.
Question is, which one? There must be a million doorways in this place.
Oh, man I feel as bad as you look, Joey.
Tristan. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats.
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?
Pharaoh, are you here?
Pharaoh?
Nothing.
Pharaoh!
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your faith in the Gods and they let you down.
If I were you now is a good time to start praying for mercy.
Because from here on out, I'm planning to take you apart piece by painful piece.
So let the torture continue with this:
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.
Your face down card is destroyed.
And if you like that, then you're gonna love this:
Peten the Dark Clown.
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.
And to top it off I'll place this face down on the field.
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew you'd make that move, -
- which is why my face down card is Deck Destruction Virus.
You set off this cribleling trap when you destroyed my Dark Clown, -
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect ten random cards from your deck -
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.
No.
I hate to be the bearer of even more bad news, -
- but when you destroyed my Peten the Dark Clown, -
- you activated his special ability, allowing me to summon another -
- Dark Clown to take his place.
I summon Des Feral Imp.
And next I'll activate the magical Card of Demise.
It let's me draw five new cards from my deck.
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and activate White Dragon Ritual -
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.
When I lose my life points I'm losing my actual life energy.
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.
Take a good look.
It's the monster that's been the bane of your dueling existence ever since -
- our first match. And now he's back.
But he's not alone.
Any last requests?
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!
Where did he go?
Hey, hold on!
This isn't his room.
Pharaoh. Oh, no.
Who's there?
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?
Hi.
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?
Woaw, it looks like an earthquake hit this place.
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?
He's in there and so is my brother.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Looks like that artifact we saw back at the museum, only this one's super-sized.
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?
Anubis once tried to destroy the world using the power of the Pyramid of Light.
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.
All of this insanity started when my brother played a card that -
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -
- from 5000 years ago.
And if the myth is true then Anubis is using it to finish was he started in the past.
This is crazy. We gotta get them out of there.
I don't know what dark powers are at work here -
- but I can't let them go unchecked.
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -
- and I'll boost her strength with Mage Power.
It may cost me 800 life points, -
- but my Valkyria now gains 500 attack and defence points
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.
1000 additional attack points make my Valkyria -
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.
- A trap.
- Very observant.
Now your attack is diverted.
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -
- it infects ten more cards in your deck.
I've lost half the cards in my deck already.
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -
- who just hates to say goodbye.
And next... -
- I'm gonna summon up your worst nightmare.
Because if you couldn't defeat one Blue-Eyes... -
- there's no way you'll defeat three, -
- especially when combined as the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
If you think he's scary now, just wait till he attacks. In fact don't wait.
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.
Look at the world's best duelist now.
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?
Yugi, what the heck is going on?
We've been drawn into the Millennium Puzzle -
- and that thing up there is somehow responsible.
Then what's that, down there?
That blue one looks like the Pyramid of Light I saw at the museum.
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.
Fighting pyramides and creepy floating eyes. Wonderful.
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?
Maybe.
I think this all has to do with an ancient Egyptian sorceror.
I knew it was gonna be something insane.
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.
Centuries ago he tried to destroy the world and I'm starting to believe -
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?
The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Thus light and shadows both be killed.
Doesn't look like the duel's going too well for your friend the pharaoh.
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -
- we can outrun them.
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it only gets worse from here.
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.
No. That Pyramid of Light has created a deadly Shadow Game.
I know you sense it we must stop now.
The only thing I sense is your fear. Not that I blame you.
But I came here to win and stopping's not an option.
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel, when clearly I should have been champion.
For all the times I'd had to listen to your preach about the heart of the cards.
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.
Next I reveal my face down card, Sage's Stone.
When Dark Magician Girl is on the field and Sage's Stone is played, -
- it allows me to automatically summon Dark Magician.
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.
For now I sacrifice both magicians -
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.
And with his rise to power comes your Blue-Eyes far from grace.
Because for everyone of my sorceror's fallen comrades in the graveyard -
- your dragon loses 500 points.
And right now there have been three magicians laid down to rest, -
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's power decreases by 1500 points.
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.
Now, will you stop this madness?
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.
No, I'll have no monsters on the field to defend my life points.
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!
You may have destroyed my clown, but you forgot about -
- Deck Virus Trap Card.
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out.
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic mystic's powers are so mighty, -
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards, like your Deck Virus and destroy it.
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.
- What?
- That's right.
You see I have an even more powerful monster, compliments of Pegasus.
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
Could it be? A card I'd never seen before?
And for every dragon in my graveyard -
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains an additional 300 attack points.
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -
- for at punishing grand total of 4500 points.
But don't forget, due to my sorceres' powers, -
- your new dragon's attack points decrease by 1500.
I don't think so. Thanks to my dragon's Shining Diffusion.
What, your points didn't decrease.
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -
- or Monster Effect Cards can be used against him.
Just face it, Yugi, your days as a champion duelist are over.
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast you back to the minor leagues -
- where you belong.
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.
How do you like it? The pain, the sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.
Now it's your turn.
You're sure this is the way to that mummy guy?
Yeah, every hallway looks the same.
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.
Check it out. It's some kind of energy stream.
Maybe if we follow this thing, it'll lead us to Anubis.
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.
It's putting out energy waves that are making my pacemaker go haywire.
Up here!
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?
Pegasus, what are you doing here?
How about we start with a thank you, you little ingrate?
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me when in fact this is all been arranged by an -
- evil lord who tried to take over the world five millennia ago and is now back -
- to finish the job. I looked it up.
Now, this Anubis has created the ultimate Shadow Game -
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.
And Yugi and Kaiba are right in the middle of it.
We just gotta find a way to help them.
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.
Foolish mortals there is nothing you can do to stop my rebirth.
I have infiltrated the realm of the pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.
We won't stand here while you suck the life out of others to save yourself.
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.
Yeah, because just in case you haven't noticed, we've got you outnumbered.
This place is crawling with stiffs.
What do you want, anyway?
Behold the future since you won't live to see it for yourself.
Soon my beasts of destruction shall annihilate all traces of life on Earth.
And I will finally complete that which I started millennia ago.
It is by your very hand that this devastation will occur, mortal.
For when you released the pharaoh, you released me as well.
What's he mean?
This is between me and him.
Listen, you guys need to find a way outta this place and save yourselves.
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?
There was a prophecy my grandpa read to me in the museum.
And I think it may have something to do with this. I just don't know what.
Yugi, that's crazy.
Just go guys.
Wait there's no way we're leaving you, we're team.
We've been through everything together and there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.
- That's right.
- But...
The last thing I wanna do is put my best friends in danger.
What are you doing? Téa, please, get down from there.
My friends need me. I just know it.
Foolish girl.
Téa, come back in here at once.
I've got to help my friends.
- She's falling.
- Grab her.
I'm coming, guys!
- Téa.
- How did you find us?
Are you kidding me? Remember the friendship symbol we drew?
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -
- bond never will.
- Right.
We're all with you. And we're always be with you.
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.
- Yeah.
- Right.
You see? There's nothing out there that's more powerful than our friendship.
Téa is right. I can feel it. All we have to do is stick together.
Hey, stick it together, is what we do best.
We'll never leave your side.
- Téa.
- Your pathetic little bond -
- is nothing against my power.
Soon my soul will be fully restored and your world shrouded in darkness.
Yet, you fools prate along about togetherness?
- Then so be it.
- Téa!
- Téa!
- What's out!
What? I can do that.
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.
Take this.
That wasn't suppose to happen.
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.
Neither do kicks to the head.
Let's try this.
These carcasses won't quit.
How do you destroy what's already dead?
It's no use. They just keep coming.
How the mighty has fallen.
Lying there on the ground like a dog waiting to be put out of it's misery.
Get up, get up so I can knock you back down.
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.
But believe me, I cannot let you win this duel.
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.
You know I think you're the one who doesn't have clue what this match is really about.
It's about pay back.
And this card will see to that.
But first let's deal with your so-called Big Shield Gardna.
Do you think it's big enough to block the power of -
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.
I told you when we started this duel -
- that this time things were gonna be different, Yugi.
You may have beaten me in the past, -
- but now there's nothing you can do to stop me from having my revenge.
You're finished.
Not yet. I'm not.
I activate Pot of Greed which let's me draw two cards.
Now I summon Watapon in defense mode.
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -
- I can summon another monster to the field.
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.
So let me see if I've got this right, now.
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.
Well, then it's your funeral.
First the Card of Demise I played before sends this dragon to the graveyard.
And I know you know what that means, don't you?
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has more destructive power than ever before.
Kaiba, please listen to me.
All I wanna hear from you is your anguished cry of defeat.
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.
People are getting hurt, lives are in danger.
And this Pyramid of Light you've created is source of it all.
There's a dark power in our midst and you can't deny it.
With every life point lost, we both become weaker. I know you can feel it.
We must stop. Before it's too late.
Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi now with my Shining Dragon -
- and destroy the rest of his life points.
No, I should stick to my original strategy -
- and defeat Yugi with his very own Egyptian God Cards.
I'm afraid that for you it's already too late, Yugi.
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this we still have time to stop this madness.
All we have to do is end this duel.
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate your final special ability.
No, you're playing with forces you can't possibly understand.
Finish him. Finish him, now!
No, I wanted a perfect victory, and with this card I can -
- use Yugi's own most powerful monsters against him.
I use Shining Nova.
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes into a blast so strong it -
- destroys itself plus anything I choose.
And the card that will feel the wrath of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -
- is the Pyramid of Light.
No, I need the pyramid to destroy the pharaoh.
What am I saying? I must destroy it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.
Your reign as the King of Games is over.
That title will be mine as will all three of your Egyptian God Cards.
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon sacrifice yourself -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
This I cannot allow.
What? The Pyramid of Light wasn't destroyed?
The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.
Hey, what is this? Show yourself, whoever you are.
I have been here the whole time, mortal, whispering in your ear.
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.
Kaiba. Look out!
Kaiba. No!
You have served me well, little worm, -
- but you have outlived your usefulness.
So it's been you behind this whole duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.
The Egyptian Lord of the Dead, Anubis.
I am pleased that you remember me after all these years, my pharaoh.
It will make my ultimate vengence all the more sweeter.
You will fall and my reign of destruction shall begin.
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -
- have already fallen, trapped within your puzzle.
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.
You're wrong. I can still sense their presence.
And I will fight to defend them.
No matter what happens, I will not let your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.
All I need due is defeat you in this duel.
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.
The magic of the Shadow Games that you locked away centuries ago -
- will once again be unleashed into the world.
And I shall finally take my rightful place, as the pharaoh of this realm.
With the Pyramid of Light at my command -
- there's nothing you can do to stop me.
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.
Reverse of Reverse.
Search your deck from now until doomsday.
And you still won't find anything to stand against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that for you doomsday is today.
Now watch as your last line of defense is ripped to shreds before your eyes.
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.
My Celtic Guardian. No.
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -
- half of that monster's attack points are taken away -
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon you will be the relic burried away.
Soon worms will feast on your flesh, just as they did on mine.
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.
That's all I have left.
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.
That eye up there seems to be his power source.
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Predetermined events is just another way of saying fate.
The prophecy means the eye can be blinded by fate.
Heads up, you freak!
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.
If I'm right I gotta find that Dagger of Fate.
Yugi, please hurry!
It's empty. Please be in here somewhere. Yes.
Here it is.
Let's just hope that fate is on our side.
Come on!
No!
A weakness in the Pyramid's power.
I activate Double Spell.
By discarding one card from my hand, I can select a new one -
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.
And I know just the card I want.
Monster Reborn.
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
And I have a hunch this time, your pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.
Go, Shining Nova.
Use all your power to finish what you started before -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
Impossible.
And with that I'll end my turn, now that the Pyramid of Light is gone.
Your opponent tried and failed to destroy the pyramid with that dragon.
You alone couldn't make such a difference.
You're quite right that I could not have done it all alone.
You may have destroyed the card, pharaoh, -
- but not the Pyramid of Light around my neck. Behold its power.
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.
Thenien the Great Sphinx.
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.
Hey look. Tell me that attack meter is broke.
Say hello, Thenien.
5000 years ago, I never had the chance -
- to summon Thenien to our battle.
So I think it'd be best if we made up for lost time -
- and finally had a proper introduction.
Thenien, meet the pharaoh, and pharaoh meet your doom.
We don't have anything that can beat that sphinx.
Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct about what Kaiba was planning.
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -
- and I still have one face down card to play.
Reverse of Reverse, -
- which allows me to use the last card played by Kaiba:
Return from the Different Dimension.
When Kaiba spoke of dealing me the perfect defeat, -
- he meant wiping me out with my own Egyptian Gods.
Allow me to introduce Obelisk the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.
My Egyptian Gods, combine now! For infinite power.
Now go, Titan Firestorm!
No.
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!
Yeah!
- You did it.
- We did it.
Kaiba. Are you all right?
Let me help you.
I can take care of myself.
What the...?
Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.
Now let see how well you play this game, when the monsters are real.
- Monsters?
- For real?
It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.
Nothing in your decks of cards can save you now.
It appears you are one card short, pharaoh.
Yeah, but I'm not.
Attack! Gilford the Lightning and Gearfried the Iron Knight.
Begone!
You have no concept of my powers and now the end begins.
We're pancakes.
Not yet.
These Toon Monsters won't last long.
We have to get out of here, while we still have the chance.
Yugi, I know you'll take this creep down.
Yes, you would, 'cause we will be with you all the way.
- Always.
- Always.
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.
How can we beat a real monster?
How? With a real monster.
- Yugi.
- What's this?
The one card that can beat him.
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!
If the monsters are real, so are all their powers -
- including this dragon's ability to destroy any monster.
Destroy Anubis!
Wow, check it out.
No!
He's not coming back again, right?
We should take a closer look at that prophecy to see what it foretells for the future.
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.
No one could return after suffering a defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.
Oh, please, spare me all your bull about friendship, will ya?
If it wasn't for that freak crashing the party we both know that -
- the winner of todays duel would have been me.
So enjoy your last days of being champion. Why you still can.
I gotta say it's nice to have the old Kaiba back.
Yeah? Well this conversation's over. We'll duel again.
Wait up!
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all the damage you did to the Duel Dome.
'Cause I don't think his insurance is gonna cover this.
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.
And unless he changes he won't have best friends like this.
What Kaiba doesn't get is that victory means nothing, -
- unless you can share it with the people you love.
'Cause then...
You're really a winner.
You can say that again.
SUBTITLES BY
Lightkeeper
NARRATOR:
For some, time passes slowly.
An hour can seem an eternity.
For others, there's never enough.
For the Tucks, it didn't exist.
Time is like a wheel... turning and turning, never stopping and the woods are the center, the hub of the wheel.
It began the first week of summer a strange and breathless time, when accident, or fate bring lives together when people are led to do things they've never done before.
On this summer's day, not so very long ago the wheel set lives in motion in mysterious ways.
It set Mae Tuck out in her wagon for the village of Treegap to meet her two sons as she did once every ten years.
(music box playing wistful melody)
Ma!
Miles!
Jesse!
Oh...!
Oh, I missed you.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.
I missed you, Jesse.
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.
Oh, look at you.
I got something.
Here, look.
The Eiffel Tower.
Would you look at that.
Got it in Paris, France.
Oh, Mom, you've never seen anything
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.
How are you, old friend?
Your favorite... chocolates.
Oh, I've died and gone to Heaven.
Oh, Jesse.
(gasps):
Miles...
Miles.
Give your mother a hug.
Ten years.
You're as cozy as barbed wire.
I have you back.
WOMAN:
Winifred!
Winifred!
Yes, Mother?
I need a new name.
One that's not all worn out from being called so much.
Come inside this instant.
You're getting filthy!
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.
"You must suffer to be beautiful."
So say the French.
The French are crazy.
(piano music continues playing)
NARRATOR:
For Winnie Foster one thing was true: the heat of summer was not nearly as stifling as the formality of her life.
With every passing day the feeling grew stronger.
She was coming closer to the end of something and moving towards the beginning of something new.
- (groans)
- (music stops)
Change was in the air.
It was only a question of when.
Wait for me in the car.
I won't be a minute.
In the car, Mrs. Foster.
BOY 1:
Throw it home! Throw it home!
BOY 2:
Come on, throw it home!
- Go!
- Run to me!
Yay!
No, no, no, no, no.
Too large for tea cakes.
None of these will do.
I prefer petit fours.
BOY (laughing):
What kind of a funny hat is that?
Well, look'ee here.
If it's not Miss Moneybags in her fancy car.
What's the matter?
Don't want to get your feet dirty?
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.
Not much call for such treats out here.
Well, I could just make them up for you, special.
GIRL:
Winnie Foster?
You've got to be kidding!
BOY:
Wow!
GIRL:
Winnie, run!
Run, Winnie, run!
Throw it! Throw it!
BOY 2:
Throw it home! Come on!
Slide, Winnie, slide!
Winifred!
JESSE:
Oh, and they had their arms crossed and you see, the lines were perfectly square.
Come here, come here.
I want to teach you. Come on.
Oh, all the way from France.
How about that?
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.
Look it.
Oh! Aah, he shot me!
Oh, I'm dead!
MAE:
Oh, oh, my!
- (Jesse groaning)
- Oh, my!
Oh, you'll have to see this one.
Miles, look at this!
Oh... let's see.
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.
I want to show you.
All right.
Good to have you home, son.
I'm glad to see you.
And the family together.
But don't get used to it.
War's coming, I hear.
I'm joining up.
I'm going to fight the Huns.
Get as far away from this place as I can.
Oh, you think that'll solve things, do you?
You haven't had enough killing for two lifetimes?
Somebody's on to us.
I know it.
There's a man who's been following us and we've lost him several times, but... he keeps coming back.
I think he knows something.
This man...
Jesse...
- (laughter)
- Whoo!
We're being tracked.
Oh, Miles, we lost him.
Don't go spoiling everything.
Yeah, we lost him, Jess... but he keeps coming back.
It was only a matter of time before someone found us.
The world is closing in.
Entire forest is almost gone.
All except this little wood.
I saw tire marks down on the lower wash... a few weeks ago.
There'll be more.
I don't want anyone going to town.
Not for anything, and that's that.
Tuck.
You see any strangers in the woods getting too close you know what to do.
No exceptions.
Our time here is almost done.
I can feel it.
MAN:
You'll never catch one that way.
Do you know about catching fireflies?
Afraid not, never tried.
I prefer... bigger game.
Though I suspect the strategy is much the same.
Strategy?
One must never announce one's presence to the prey.
One must become part of the scenery... invisible... almost disappear.
And be patient until the exact, right moment arrives... (grunts)
Take a prisoner.
For you?
No, thank you.
You're quite right.
A girl of your age should find... trapping suitors more interesting than trapping insects, anyway.
Far easier, I might add.
Have you lived here long?
Forever. Why?
I'm... looking for some old friends who live hereabouts.
Thought you might help me find them.
My father practically built Treegap.
He knows everyone.
Perhaps he can help you.
Perhaps.
I quite like talking to you.
MRS. FOSTER:
Winifred?
Winifred, who are you talking to out there?
I don't know.
He hasn't told me his name.
Good evening, madam.
Please forgive my intrusion.
This young lady tells me you've lived here forever.
I thought you might know of a certain family goes by the name of...
I hardly know everyone, nor do I want to.
And I don't stand outside discussing such a thing with... strangers.
Then I beg your pardon.
Good evening, young lady.
Madam.
This is why I worry about you, Winifred.
You don't have the sense not to talk to a man like that.
MRS. FOSTER:
A proper education gains one entré into society.
MR. FOSTER:
Your mother and I have given this a great deal of thought.
Middlehouse Academy for Girls in Pensford, has an excellent reputation.
Middlehouse?
But that's a terrible place, everyone says so.
It's like a jail.
Nonsense.
Girls emerge from there as refined young ladies well-versed in etiquette and manners, both of which you are sorely lacking.
But I don't want to be one of those girls.
Which is precisely why you must go.
I cannot let your unbridled nature ruin your chances for a respectable future.
Winifred... I'm sorry... but we have to do what's best for you.
I won't do it.
I'm not like those girls.
I won't go!
Winifred!
I won't go!
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated.
But what her parents didn't understand was she only wanted to step just outside her fence... so she did.
What in these quiet woods should be so forbidden?
Winnie had always sensed a mystery waiting for her there.
It was a place so entirely different from what she knew so far away from her tight, pruned world.
Ah!
Ah...
How long have you been standing there?
Not long at all.
I was only walking past, and I...
Well, you shouldn't... be in these parts of the woods.
It's best you turn around and go home.
Well, go on, now, get!
Excuse me, but I own these woods, and...
I'll go on and get when I want to.
You own these woods?
Yes, I do.
What's your name?
Winifred.
Winnie... Foster.
A Foster?
Well, I'll be.
Is that a fact?
Well... Winnie Foster, like I was saying you need to turn around and go home.
It just so happens that I was on my way home before you made your rude suggestion and I would be happy to continue on my way if I only knew which way to go.
In other words, you're lost?
I'll point you home.
I'd be much obliged.
But I want a drink first.
Wait... no!
No!
What?
You don't want that water.
Uh, it's poisoned.
I saw you drink some.
Well, now I'm feeling sick.
You don't look ill.
I'm dry as dust.
I said, leave it alone!
Let go of me! My father will have you arrested!
You're not going to go and tell him, now, are you?
Hey! Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
Where you going so fast, Miss?
Miles, wait!
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.
- No exceptions.
- Help!
You can't do this.
Stop! Let go!
We can't.
Miles!
Miss Foster!
Miss Foster!
Miss Foster!
Where are you?!
Ho.
We're stopping here.
- Not a word out of you, hear me?
- (yells)
Miles!
- What are you doing?
- No!
Let the poor girl go.
There's no reason to be frightened, young lady.
I caught her at the spring with Jesse.
She's a Foster.
Oh, Lord.
It's finally happened.
I want to go home, please.
I want to go home.
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.
We're not bad people.
We'll take you home just as soon as we can.
I promise.
Miles, go find your father.
He's across the lake.
He'll know what to do with her.
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix that mouth of his.
(music box plays wistful melody)
I've heard that.
Have you?
It's, it's my little music box.
I found it in the forest one day.
Just waiting for me, I expect.
I've had it a long, long time.
Oh!
I put my baby boys to bed with it every night.
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.
I'm sure my boys didn't mean you any harm.
Then why did they bring me here this way?
Why am I here?
You have every right to be upset.
And I know your family must be... worried sick about you.
Where's the child?
MAE:
She's no child... Angus.
(whispering):
Does she know?
Why do you think
I brought her...?
Yeah, but now she knows about us, thanks to you.
Shh! Shh!
She's a Foster, she only knows...
Know what?
Miss Foster, this is my husband, Angus Tuck.
Angus, meet Miss Foster.
Hello, Miss Foster.
She's the most important event that's taken place in this house in 80 years.
You hungry?
MAE:
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.
Yeah.
Jesse, pass your mother a plate, please?
JESSE:
Mmm, where's the fish?
Oh, they weren't biting for some reason.
(chuckles):
'Cause Pa can't fish?
Don't matter. There's plenty.
I catch fish.
If there's no fish, there's no fish if you keep scaring the fish away.
Mmm, this looks good.
MAE:
Oh! Isn't this nice?
Everybody sitting down together and having Miss Foster here.
It's just like having a party.
My father will come looking for me.
Your father... will cut down the entire forest the way things are changing around here.
Make himself a very rich man.
Oh, now, let's not ruin a perfectly good meal with a lot of talk.
My father has plenty of money.
He'll pay.
Anything you want.
We don't want your father's money, Miss Foster.
Then let me go home.
We will.
We'll let you go home... just like I promised.
Directly.
We'll need to be able to trust her first before we're sending her back to her folks.
Trust her? We can't trust her.
Or any normal people.
She'll turn on us in a second.
No, she won't.
You're a fool.
You don't even realize what you've done here.
Him.
It's him.
Robert!
I expect you to find her, Henry.
That's your job.
I've already wired her description down the main line.
They'll keep a lookout and we'll get up a search party come morning.
My wife is certain that this man wearing a yellow suit has something to do with Winifred's disappearance.
And Miss Foster says so based on...?
Her instincts.
Hmm.
Well, maybe you better step in here, Mr. Foster.
Am I whom you're looking for?
I do believe I fit the description.
My wife said she saw you talking to my daughter.
Yes, I did.
She's a charming girl, full of fire.
Perhaps too much.
She's gone, is she?
Looks like she... ran away.
Did she now?
Somehow I'm not surprised.
My daughter did not... run away.
And I'm not interested in what surprises you, sir.
I want to know if you know anything of her whereabouts.
No, Mr. Foster.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I do not.
I am quite coincidentally here in search of someone myself.
I'm seeking a family that used to live in these environs.
I thought the constable could help me locate them, but ironically, Mr. Foster your daughter thought you could help.
Name of Tuck.
Long lost relatives.
I-I can't help you.
Nor I you.
At least not now.
However, I'd be happy to search your woods for you, Mr. Foster.
I'm rather talented at finding people.
I just might meet with success.
Good evening, Constable.
Find out what happened to her, Henry.
Please.
She's our only child.
Angus made that cradle.
Brought it all the way from Scotland.
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.
There you go.
The breeze off the lake will keep you cool all night.
The boys sleep up in the loft when they're home so you'll have your privacy.
Oh, that corset looks painful.
May I help you off with it?
Oh, honestly, I can't understand why women torture themselves this way.
It's no way to live.
Do you have a daughter?
A granddaughter.
And a grandson.
Anna and Beau.
Oh, Miles loved them so.
What happened?
They died.
Their mother, too.
I'm afraid the good parts of Miles died along with them.
You'll have to forgive what's left of him.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's... it's the way things are, Miss Foster.
Can I call you Winnie?
MAE:
Do you have brothers and sisters?
WINIFRED:
No, it's only me.
My mother...
(conversation continues indistinctly)
MAE:
There.
WINNIE:
So where do they go?
Oh, they go different places, do different things.
Miles can do carpentry and he's good with his hands.
Jesse, now, he seems to have settled himself.
Of course, then, he's... he's young yet.
Well...
I hope you will be comfortable here.
It's a good feeling having another woman here.
Try and get some sleep now.
(church bells toll in distance)
MAN:
Hello?
Have you lost your way, friend?
Not hardly, Reverend.
I'm looking for a family name... Tuck.
Are you familiar with it?
Tuck. Tuck?
I'm afraid I can't help you.
There are no Tucks in this cemetery that I know of.
No, I wouldn't think so.
Ha!
Or in any other.
Tell me, Reverend you who have attended so many deathbeds... what is it people most desire as they face the end of their lives?
More time?
Well, I suppose.
Exactly.
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.
Imagine what they'd give for all eternity.
Sir, I don't quite understand what...
You will.
Reverend, are you prepared to die right now, this instant?
If it's God's will.
What if it is my will?
What if you could be eternal?
Right now, this instant?
Without having to face the uncertainty of death?
Hmm?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
No muss, no fuss.
Invincible to disease.
Never having to suffer the stench and rot of old age.
Forever young.
You speak blasphemy, sir.
Fluently.
Good night, Reverend.
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?
Not anymore.
Good.
Hey.
Listen.
How would you like to see the Eiffel Tower?
What?
Someday.
No, now.
While the day is still ours.
Get those dogs over there.
Yes, sir.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.
Give it to the dog handlers.
Start in the north end.
Let's split up when we get to the lake.
We'll find her.
I know we will.
Winifred!
Miss Foster!
Winnie!
Winifred Foster!
Miss Foster!
Winifred!
Over here!
I found something!
There it is.
This is the Eiffel Tower?
The one in Paris, it's pretty tall.
Mine's two feet higher.
Here.
Come on.
Have you really seen the real one in Paris?
Yes, I have.
And climbed 1,652 stairs to the top.
Much easier than this.
Yes.
You doing all right?
I think so.
You're doing great.
Here.
If I went to the Eiffel Tower
I would take one of those elevators.
Not with me.
You'd take off your shoes and walk up every single solitary step.
How old are you?
Do you really want to know?
Yes.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Let's just call it 17.
There's my Paris.
The view from the Eiffel Tower can't be better than this.
I've seen a lot of views, and this is one of the best.
(piano playing classical music)
Come on.
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was beginning to lose track of time.
Had she been there a day, a week, a month?
It seemed to Winnie that the Tucks lived in a way the rest of the world had forgotten.
They were never in a hurry and did things the slow way.
For the first time
Winnie felt free to explore, to ask questions, to play.
Me?
I'm going to see the world.
Every speck of it.
Heck, I may even find some new continents or something.
I mean, I've been to a lot of places but the world is huge!
Jesse Tuck, what-what are you doing?
What does it look like?
Woo-hoo!
Woo! Ah, whoo.
Come on!
I can't!
Why?
You're not afraid of a little cold water, are you?
No.
Are you afraid of me?
No.
Well, what then?
I can't swim.
You're joshing me.
I wish I were.
So, you're afraid you'll drown, right?
Swallow too much water, sink to the bottom and die.
Thank you for putting it so vividly.
And, yes, considering I'd sink like a rock drowning is a fair concern.
Well, I guess I'm just going to have to enjoy this all by myself.
Hmm...
Hmm!
Ah, Jesse!
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Come here, come here, come here.
I've got you, I've got you.
I've got you, relax.
Relax against me.
You all right?
I think so.
Whoo!
You did it!
I did it!
Ah, it feels wonderful.
I'm weightless.
That's 'cause we're carrying you, see?
The water and me.
We're both carrying you.
You like the feeling?
I love it.
Jesse, don't let go!
It's okay, it's okay.
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.
I'm never going to let you go.
You know, I don't like being laughed at by a cheat.
Now "cheat" is a nasty word, sir.
I much prefer "card sharp."
You are looking for trouble, aren't you, mister?
Yes, sir, I sure am.
Going outside!
Come on!
Perhaps next time...
Come on!
He can't hurt me!
Whoo!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, citizen.
You hear that?
Tuck says it's the most melancholy sound in all of nature.
Listen.
Just listen.
They're playing for you.
Whoo! Yeah!
I wish this moment could last forever.
Forever?
You want to spend forever with me, Winnie?
I do.
You know, we could see the world together.
We could do everything together.
Have a million moments like this one that... never, never stop.
There's a part about us you don't know... the part I've sworn not to tell you.
The secret?
The reason you don't want anyone to find out about you?
I knew it.
You're... you're bank robbers or grifters.
You are the first human
I've ever met
I wanted to know the truth.
Jesse Tuck, you're the first human I've ever met that I've ever wanted to... to...
...to do that.
Winnie, listen.
Remember the giant oak tree at the center of the wood where we met?
The little spring bubbling up you saw me drink from?
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?
Well... it's the honest truth.
I'm going to live forever.
I'm never going to change.
The same with Miles and Tuck and Mae.
Something happened to us.
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17 until the end of the world.
It's the spring, Winnie.
The water, something's wrong with it.
It stops you right where you are.
If you had a drink of it today, you'd stay just like you are.
Don't you wish he'd told you... before you kissed him?
Did he tell you immortality isn't all the preachers crack it up to be?
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.
Oh, now... you want her to hear it, Jesse boy.
She's the first person you want to tell the truth to.
You just don't want me to have what you lost.
WINNIE:
Stop this...
...both of you and tell me the truth.
I want to know.
We all had a drink...
...except for the cat... that's important.
The water tasted like...
Heaven.
Floated over your tongue like a cloud.
Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk, to mark where we'd been.
We moved on west, looking for a place to settle down.
Put up a house for Mae and Tuck and a little shed for Jesse and me.
That was the first time we figured there was something... peculiar.
Jesse fell 30 feet, landed right on his neck.
He was up on his feet again before Mae could work up a good cry.
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.
That's not all.
Not by a long shot.
Things began to happen.
Some brushpoppers mistook
- Mae's horse for a deer.
- (gunshots)
Thing is, the bullets didn't kill him.
Barely even left a mark.
Then Tuck got bitten by a rattlesnake, and you know what?
He didn't die...
...but the cat did of old age.
And Miles got married.
Daddy!
(whispering):
Beau.
Little Anna.
Tuck figured it early on.
It's the spring.
We all drank from it, even the horse.
Had to be... the source of our changelessness.
I begged her to come back... for me and find the spring and drink from it.
The children, too.
It was our only hope to be together.
She made up her mind
I'd sold my soul to the Devil...
...and she left me.
She took my babies with her.
Everyone... pulled away after that.
There was talk of witchcraft... black magic.
I went looking for wars to fight... and I saw brave men die at Vera Cruz... and then Gettysburg... thousands, in the blink of an eye...
(voice breaking):
...but not me.
I couldn't die...
...like little Anna.
The influenza took her before she's 15.
And Beau.
He'd be almost 80 now if he were still alive.
And my sweet...
...my sweet young bride.
She died in an insane asylum...
...old and alone.
(crying):
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.
Winnie Foster, you're the only other person in the world who knows about us.
We'll have to have a talk.
Pa.
Come on.
(whispering):
Look around you.
It's teeming life.
It's flowers and trees and frogs.
It's... it's all part of the wheel.
It's always changing; it's always growing like you, Winnie.
Your life is never the same.
You were once a child.
Now, you are about to become a woman.
One day, you'll grow up and you'll do something important.
You'll have children, maybe, and then one day you'll go out... just like the flame of a candle.
You'll make way for new life.
That's a certainty.
That's the natural way of things.
And then, there's us.
What we Tucks have, you can't call it living.
We just... are.
We're like rocks, stuck at the side of a stream.
Listen to me.
Winnie, you know a dangerous secret.
If people find out about the spring they'll trample all over each other to get to that water.
There's one thing I've learned about people.
Many will do anything, anything not to die and they'll do anything to keep from living their life.
Do you want to stay stuck as you are right now, forever?
I've just got to make you understand.
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?
No.
No human does... but i-it's part of the wheel... the same as being born.
You can't have living without dying.
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.
Be afraid of the unlived life.
Your tea, sir.
She's with them now.
I came directly here, knowing how tormented you must be.
We-we just want her back safely.
Course you do.
Dreadful business, kidnapping.
Fortunate I was witness.
I'm perhaps the only person... who knows where to find her.
Just what is your game, sir?
What is my game?
You detect in me a playful mood?
"Playful" is not the word I had in mind.
What I have in mind is a simple, clear-cut trade.
You see,
I very much like your woods not for their timber, mind you but for their natural assets.
Wh-What is it you want?
You want your daughter.
I want your woods.
You're involved in this, aren't you?
If you have touched my daughter...!
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.
Kidnapping is not amongst them.
These are rough people, the ones who took her.
No telling what they might do.
Unless we do what you say.
Give the man whatever he wants.
Done and done.
Nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
You're an intelligent, reasonable man, Mr. Foster.
I'm seldom wrong as a judge of character.
Have your friendly constable on hand to make the appropriate arrests.
Your terrible ordeal is as good as over.
I'll get there before you.
We have to move quickly.
They were packing to leave.
ROBERT:
What kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be?
HENRY:
There is evil in the world,
Mr. Foster.
There aren't fences high enough to keep it out.
ROBERT:
Bring your men directly to my house.
I'm going with you.
It isn't fair, Tuck.
No, it isn't... but when has life ever been fair?
How am I going to take you home when I can't make my feet move from this spot?
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it... just to spend one more night with you.
Forgive me for interrupting such a tender moment.
Hello, Winifred.
Everyone's been so worried about you.
I'm relieved to find you so well.
You know this man?
I met him once.
Hello, Mr. Tuck.
You have no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you.
You're the man who's been following my boys.
Been expecting you.
Yes, and here I am.
Tell me, is it a relief... to finally be discovered?
Over a century of hiding out must have taken its toll on you.
Who are you?
And how do you know so much about us?
I first heard about your family from my grandmother.
She knew a woman in a mental facility who used to... rant and ramble about a family who never grew old and never died.
This woman, she used to call out a name.
What was it, now?
Anna.
Crazy old woman.
Kept on talking about a music box.
It seems the melody had a calming effect on her children.
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?
You have no right... to come to our home... and bring us such pain.
There, good mother.
I mean no harm.
Tell us, sir.
What is it you want?
Well, you see, the Fosters have given me these woods in exchange for bringing young Winifred back home to them.
I have the papers, all signed and legal.
Gives me the rights to the forest and everything in it.
Don't be alarmed.
I'll let you stay here... on my land if you prove cooperative.
Cooperative?
I want you to take me to the spring.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.
It's immediately clear to me that the water's powers have been wasted on... unimaginative people like you.
I intend to make this fountain of youth, as the simpletons would call it available to those who deserve it... for a price, of course.
You'll die of old age before I'll take you.
Is that so?
Then, perhaps Winifred will!
JESSE:
No!
Jesse!
(whispering):
Yes!
Bravo!
Come now, Winifred.
I'm feeling thirsty.
Show me where the spring is.
Perhaps I'll let you have a drink.
After all...
...then we can spend... eternity together.
- (yelps)
- (screams)
Winnie, Winnie, come here.
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.
Pa.
There they are!
Winnie Foster!
MAN:
I see her!
I got her!
Circle around to the right!
Watch the water!
Go!
Don't let anyone get away!
Jesse, come on.
ROBERT:
Winnie!
MAN:
Block that trail!
It's my father.
MAN:
Keep them alive!
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!
Let's go!
Wait...
Get on.
MAN:
Behind the house, men!
He's setting the house on fire!
Winnie!
You're all right.
You're all right.
We found you. You're safe.
You're safe now.
Everything's all right.
Winnie.
Hyah!
NARRATOR:
The hall clock chimed the hour.
Outside, the wind was still.
Everything, it seemed, was waiting.
ROBERT:
We just want to understand what happened.
Winnie... try, please.
They didn't kidnap me.
I was with them because I wanted to be.
- (fan snaps)
- She doesn't know what she's saying.
The Tucks were kind to me.
They're my friends.
ROBERT:
If they didn't kidnap you, why on earth did that woman club that man over the head with a shotgun?
Because Mae Tuck was protecting me.
MAN:
Doesn't matter anyway.
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.
I didn't much like the man but that won't stop that poor woman from hanging.
Miss is an eyewitness.
She'll have to testify.
Oh, my God.
I figured you might want this.
Doesn't exist, far as I'm concerned.
I sure am sorry about all this.
Good day.
Thank you, Henry.
(whispering):
Winnie.
Jesse!
Oh, it's you.
I was afraid
I would never see you again.
I need you to help me.
I need you to help us.
Mae can't go to the gallows.
She won't die.
She can't die.
They're going to find out our secret.
We have to get them out.
WINNIE:
Help me!
Please, help me!
Somebody, help me!
Please, someone help!
Please! Help!
All right.
Help me, please!
All right!
Help!
PI... Please!
Help me! You have to stop them!
They're after me!
Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?
The people who kidnapped me!
They're going to take me away again!
My parents couldn't stop them!
They're right outside!
You have to stop them, please!
Help!
They'll kill me if they find me!
Please, they're going to kill me, please!
Stay right there!
I'll handle this.
Hurry!
Help!
Come out and meet your doom!
Hell is upon you!
Stop right there!
You're under arrest!
Come on, we have to hurry.
The boys are outside.
Stay back, now!
I'll shoot!
My dear, sweet Winnie.
What I wouldn't do to keep you.
I wish you were ours... for Jesse.
For all of us.
(crying):
You have to hurry and get away from here.
JESSE:
Winnie...
Winnie, come with me.
There's nothing for you here.
We can be together forever.
If she comes with us, they'll hunt us down.
They'll never stop looking.
Tuck is right.
If I go with you it'll be too dangerous for all of you.
I can't go without you.
You have to.
Go back to the spring.
Drink from it.
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.
Will you?
I have to show you the Eiffel Tower, don't I?
1,652 steps to the top.
Winnie... until we're together again... wake up with the dawn.
I will.
We got to go... before it's too late.
Winnie Foster...
I will love you till the day I die!
DOCTOR (whispering):
She's going fast but you can have a couple of minutes with her.
How are you?
MAN:
"...and to Almighty God
"we commend the soul of our sister
"and we commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."
(pastor continuing indistinctly)
"...Resurrection into eternal life
"through our Lord Jesus Christ;
"at whose coming in glorious
Majesty to judge the World
"the Earth and the Sea shall give up their Dead;
"and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him
"shall be changed, and made like unto his own glorious Body;
"according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself."
Mother?
I was just wondering what it is about these woods you love so much.
Mother, are you all right?
I'm going to miss her, too.
Oh...
Every time I look at you, you're different.
I'm losing you, too.
I'm right here.
Forgive me, Winnie.
I just wanted to keep you my little girl forever.
JESSE (echoing):
Go back to the spring.
When it's safe,
I'll come back for you.
ANGUS:
What we Tucks have, you can't call it living.
We just... are.
We're like rocks stuck at the side of a stream.
NARRATOR:
The first weeks of summer were long over.
There was a feeling that the wheel was turning again...
...slowly now, but soon to go faster.
Winnie and her family left Treegap to see the world.
She wasn't certain what herjourney might bring but this much she knew... it would be something of her own choosing.
For some, time passes slowly.
An hour can seem an eternity.
For others, there's never enough.
For Jesse Tuck, it didn't exist.
Tuck said it to Winnie the summer she turned 15:
Do not fear death, but rather the unlived life.
You don't have to live forever.
You just have to live.
And she did.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
Morgan!
Bo? Bo?
Bo, where's Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
What's happening?
The dogs were barking... woke us up.
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah. Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn't treat animals.
Well, he'll know what to do.
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there,
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad's gonna burn these again.
It's contaminated.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated.
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don't think he'll mind.
Houdini?
Bo, don't run.
What's wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at where it's bent over, Father.
It's not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.
It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo's place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don't think so, Father.
They're more edgy, you know, and alert.
It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me
"Father."
What's wrong?
I don't hear my children.
He fell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini's sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight.
What's the matter?
There's a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She never answers me either.
What?
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.
It's time for an ass-whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen... we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.
What?
Well, it won't be convincing.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I'm not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of three...
- All right.
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!
We're gonna beat your ass, bitch!
We're gonna tear your head off!
I'm losing my mind!
It's time for an ass-whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie.
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.
It only works one way, but that'll do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station.
Stop! It's hideous!
Get it off!
I-I know what to do.
Hey, Bo... turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.
Doy-da!
You're too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what's wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it.
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's kind of odd?
A little.
I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
I-I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls who could run like that.
I don't know, Merrill.
I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women's high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these
Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is.
An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one's seen her since.
And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, where's the remote?
I don't know, baby.
Why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian
Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
I don't think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.
It's just,
I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast.
And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was... he was just toying with us.
There's only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show's on every station.
Every station?
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This new resurgence is wholly different.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries.
There are only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real.
Extraterrestrials.
What in God's name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That's how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can't think straight.
I'm... I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and... and try to think clear.
And after that, I'll...
I might make some calls.
But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes.
Your... your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That's good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
Graham.
The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India.
It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky...
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Be back for pizza in 15.
It's just a bunch of crock.
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far...
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it's not "Father" anymore.
In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor,
Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... I am not a reverend anymore.
I haven't been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world...
I'm just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I've got it figured.
You do?
I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can't tell what they look like
'cause they're staying in the shadows... covert like.
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.
And that's the giveaway.
I see.
It's called "probing."
It's a military procedure.
You send out a reconnaissance group... very small... to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn't used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall... set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It's still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o-on the wall.
You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya?
Five.
Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don't know about.
He has the minor-league strikeout record.
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It's contaminated.
Carl, there's something wrong with our water.
Your water's fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick.
Is that right?
## Don't give me that so-so-soda ##
## That same old cola ##
## I wanna pop ##
- ## Pop, pop I wanna... Shasta ##
- I'll take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly..."shits" and..."bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It's a curse.
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Who is he?
What is it?
It's Bo's baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie.
What if it's catching a signal from them?
It's not.
But it wasn't working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives.
They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It's a scam.
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again.
It's just static, Morgan, all right.
Turn it up. See.
It's a code.
Why can't they get girlfriends?
Can I see that, please?
It's noise.
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I'm getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
That's right.
Let me see it.
Stop!
See, this is why we're not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I'm letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal.
Don't let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car.
Come here.
Stop!
There's two of them talking.
Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe.
You're wasting your time here!
I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You're not going to get famous!
Okay.
Let's turn on the TV.
It first appeared
52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.
They were not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
What you're seeing is real.
It's unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That's true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn't 50-50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney.
She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize
I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she threw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
I may never have recovered.
I'm a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted?
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said,
"Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
We are all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure...
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
It's a game, isn't it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
They're gone, but they're not really gone.
We just can't see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing it all morning.
The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird. His... his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion.
They're still there, hovering.
Some people think there's more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There's a theory about the c... the crop circles.
They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense.
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don't know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book...
- Bimbu?
- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason... they're hostile.
They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house, doesn't it?
Same windows.
That's weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something.
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
Hello?!
I'm going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house... no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy's house.
Why?
I think he just called here.
You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why? You have one of your feelings again?
Is it bad?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I don't want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
When I knew it was inside the house...
I couldn't think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming,
Father.
You're welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don't.
Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction.
If I'd have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I guess if this is the end of the world,
I'm screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh... Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water.
I don't think they like water.
Can't be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I've done to you.
I made you question your faith.
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.
All right.
And don't open my pantry, Father.
I found one of them in there and locked him in.
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
What you're about to see may disturb you.
Move, children!
Vámanos!
Oh!
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don't throw your life away, son.
Oh! Ah!
Oh!
Their skin changes colors.
That's why we couldn't see them that night.
Tell me something, Morgan.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics... hand-to-hand combat.
They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
It's ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What's two?
They win.
I'm sorry, what... what book is this?
Is this really happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water.
Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made-up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house.
I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we'll be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.
We don't know anything yet.
We'll be safe here anyway.
I don't want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That's got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can't change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3-2.
We're going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.
They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They're gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They're hostile.
It's like "War of the Worlds."
Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I'm going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don't worry.
You won't let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
There's too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don't have enough boards.
We'll board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
In the family room.
What about Isabel?
We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I'll make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We'll just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we're talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What's the matter with everyone? Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We're not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren't saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That's fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
Understood?
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!
All right, since you're all not gonna eat.
I'm gonna try some of everything.
It's happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel."
And they said, "We've never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can't smile.
You smiled.
Let's go down now.
We forgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
Dad...
Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They're on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.
You look just how I dreamed."
The attic door.
Let's go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They'll read our minds.
You're scaring your sister.
I'm already scared.
Merrill.
I'm looking!
They'll know our secret thoughts.
I'm not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
Dad!
Where's Bo?
I'm okay.
What's happening out there?
I can't even imagine.
I hope they're doing better than we are.
We don't even have helmets.
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
They're distracting us.
From what?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
They'll find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
There's a coal chute in here.
I can feel air.
Me too!
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
We don't have his medicine.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
We'll slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It'll pass.
It'll pass.
Don't do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The fear is feeding him.
Don't be afraid of what's happening.
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don't have to be afraid.
It's about to pass.
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.
Here comes the air.
Don't be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together. The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We're the same.
We're the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean... pinned?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won't be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out
'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake.
And that won't be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife?
Yes, it is.
People think they came here to take over the planet.
That's bull.
I don't think that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet.
This is a raid.
They came here for us, to harvest us.
We're lucky as hell they're leaving here.
They're leaving?
That's what they're saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they're leaving.
They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't.
One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything
I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay? I'm serious.
Okay.
He's been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now...
I know.
We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
It's good enough for me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
- People are celebrating.
- They're doing this on TV.
There's a great sense of relief.
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life,
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with a lot of questions.
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression on every face.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It's okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He'll always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham...
I'm here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... there are no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That's why he had asthma.
It can't be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D-Daddy...
Don't touch him.
Graham...
Don't... don't.
Dad?
What happened?
Did someone save me?
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
(Riddick)
They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep.
All but the primitive side,
the animal side.
No wonder I'm still awake.
Transporting me with civilians.
Sounded like 40, 40-plus.
Heard an Arab voice,
some hoodoo holy man,
probably on his way to New Mecca.
But what route?
What route?
Smelled a woman. 
Sweat, boots, tool belt, leather.
Prospector type.
Free settlers.
And they only take the back roads.
And here's my real problem.
Mr. Johns,
the blue-eyed devil.
Plannin' on taking me back to slam,
only this time he picked a ghost lane.
[clanking]
A long time between stops.
A long time for something to go wrong.
[alarm beeping]
[grunting]
[alarm beeping rapidly]
[groans]
Why did I fall on you?
He's dead.
The captain's dead.
I was looking right at him.
The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out, so... so gravity was not supposed to kick in for another 19.
Why'd I fall at all?
Did you hear what I said?
The captain's dead.
[electricity buzzing]
[computer beeping]
1550 millibars... dropping 20mb per minute.
Shit! We're hemorrhaging air.
Something took a swipe at us.
Come on. Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane.
Just show me all those stars.
Come on!
Those big, bright...
[alarm beeping]
What?
This is an emergency dispatch from merchant vessel
Hunter Gratzner en route to the Tangier system with 40 commercial passengers onboard.
We have been knocked out of our shipping lane
and are currently entering the atmosphere
of a planetary body in this position:
X- 38-stroke-5,
Y- 95-stroke-8, Z-21...
[rumbling]
Fry, where the hell's our comms?
[gasps]
(electronic voice)
Rate of descent beyond known limits.
Rate of descent beyond...
They trained you for this,
Fry, right?
(computer)
Deploy lower air brakes now.
Deploy lower air brakes...
(electronic voice)
Center of gravity too far aft.
Recommend purging ballast now.
What the...
Was that a purge, Fry?
Too heavy in the ass.
I can't get my fucking nose down.
(Owens)
Crisis program selected number 2 of this system
because it shows at least some oxygen.
Maximum terrain 220 meters over mean surface, largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits.
[clanging]
Fry, what the hell are you doing?
I gotta drop more load.
[beeping]
Look, I tried everything else.
I still got no horizon.
Better try everything twice,
'cause we don't just flush out...
Look, If you know something I don't, get up here and take the chair.
Listen, company says we are responsible for every single one of those people, Fry.
What, we both die out of sheer fucking nobility?
Don't you touch that handle, Fry!
[beeping]
[grunting]
[clanging]
I'm not gonna die for them.
(electronic voice)
Air-lock doors not secure.
Owens!
[alarm beeping]
70 seconds, Fry.
You still have 70 seconds to level this beast out.
Shit. Shit!
Pull him up.
Air lock doors not secure.
Air-lock doors not secure.
Air-lock doors...
[glass shattering]
What the fuck is happening up there?
[explosion]
[man chattering]
[woman yelling]
[people coughing]
Yeah, I-Imam?
Zeke?
[both grunting]
Somebody's gonna get hurt one of these days.
It ain't gonna be me.
[grunting]
Here, Shazza.
So I guess something went wrong.
I'm sorry.
Get it out of me!
[panting]
Don't touch it!
Don't... Don't you touch that handle!
Get it out of him!
No, no, no, it's too close to his heart.
There's some Anestaphine in the med-lock in the back of the cabin.
[groaning]
Not anymore, there's not.
Get out of here, everyone.
[moaning]
Get out of here.
Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar...
[praying in Arabic]
That'll teach me for flying coach.
Interesting.
Is anyone else having difficulties breathing?
Yeah, I feel one lung short.
All of us.
I feel like I just ran or something.
There was talk of a scouting party looking for other people, but then we saw this.
What the bloody hell happened?
It could have been a meteor storm.
Might have been a rogue comet.
I don't know.
Well, I, for one, am thoroughly grateful.
This beast wasn't made to land like this, but I think you did well.
Actually, the only reason we're alive is because of her.
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Thanks very much.
Yeah, thanks for saving our dicks.
No, really.
Thanks awfully.
Well done.
He just escaped from a maximum prison.
So do we just keep him locked up forever?
Well, that would be my choice.
[whispering]
Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.
The whole bloody container's upside down.
It's all topsy-turvy.
[sighing]
Well, thank God it's not a total loss.
Booze?
This is what you have to drink?
I'm gonna need a receipt for that, for all of these.
This is my personal stuff.
Mmm-hmm.
I don't suppose this will help you at all.
Unfortunately it is not permitted, especially while on hajj.
You do realize there's no water, don't you?
All deserts have water.
It only waits to be found.
I hope you're right.
All the more for me then.
[grunting]
[panting]
Motherfucker.
What the hell are these?
Maratha war picks from northern India.
Very rare.
And this?
That's a hunting blow-dart pipe from northern
Papua New Guinea.
That's very, very rare since the tribe is now extinct.
They couldn't hunt shit with these things, would be my guess.
What's the point anyway?
If the man is gone, he's gone.
Why should he bother us?
Maybe to take what you got.
Maybe to work your nerves.
Or maybe to just come back and skull-fuck you in your sleep.
He sounds like a charmer.
For you.
Let's just get...
Here we go.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Imam, if we're looking for water, we should leave soon, before nightfall, while it's cooler.
Ali.
Excuse me.
I think you should see this.
3 suns?
Bloody hell.
So much for your nightfall.
So much for my cocktail hour.
We take this as a good sign.
A path, direction from Allah.
Blue sun, blue water.
Ever wondered why I'm an atheist?
It's a bit of a bad sign.
That's Riddick's direction.
I thought you found his restraints over there, towards sunset.
Right. Which means he went towards sunrise.
Zeke.
Fully loaded clip.
Safety's on.
One shot if you spot him, ok?
Don't tell me you're going, too.
Yeah.
What happens if
Mr. Riddick spots us first?
[laughing]
There'll be no shots.
[Imam chanting in Arabic]
Allahu Akbar...
Quiet!
Shh, shh, shh.
[crackling]
[Hassan shouting]
7 stones to keep the devil at bay.
You're on a trip to New Mecca, right?
Once in every lifetime, should there be a great hajj.
A great pilgrimage.
To get to know Allah better?
Yes, but to know yourself, as well.
Yeah.
We are all on the same hajj now.
[gasps]
[gun clicking]
Sorry.
So did you see anything?
No Riddick.
Trees, and trees mean water.
You comfy up there?
It's amazing how you can do without necessities of life, provided you have the little luxuries.
Just keep your bloody eyes open.
I don't want that dog sneaking up on my bloody ass.
Yes, well, you dig the graves.
I'll hold the fort, old boy.
[gasps]
Christ!
He could probably get you right here, right under the jaw and you'd never even hear him coming,
'cause that's how good
Riddick is.
Tell me something, did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you?
[men speaking Arabic]
It's a communal graveyard, perhaps like the elephants of Earth.
[man speaking Arabic]
He asks what could have killed so many great things.
Is this whole planet dead?
Drink?
Probably shouldn't do this.
It dehydrates you even more.
You're probably right.
Mmm.
You know, you could have stayed back at the ship.
Probably should've.
If we don't find water, you know what happens.
I wanted to get away.
I've never seen a captain so ready to leave her ship.
I think we should keep moving.
What did Owens mean about not touching the handle?
It's just between you and me,
Carolyn. I promise.
I'm not your captain.
During the landing, when things were at their worst,
Owens was at his best.
He's the one that stopped the docking pilot from dumping the main cabin.
The passengers.
And the docking pilot being?
I guess I'm a little more glad to be here than I thought.
[gun clicking]
Hassan. Suleiman.
Captain.
[speaking Arabic]
[whirring]
[man chattering in Arabic]
Is there anyone here?
[rattling]
There was water here.
Lights?
Lights on?
Ok.
[speaking Arabic]
They are saying
God is great.
Allahu Akbar. Yes.
This is the source of the water.
No darkness.
No lights because no darkness.
[whooping]
Hello, Mecca!
[clanging]
Tell me that was you just now.
What are you going on about?
He's been right here helping me.
Back of the ship.
That noise.
You trying to tell me that was someone else?
[inaudible]
No!
[gasps]
Oh, my God.
I thought I was the only one who got out of the crash alive.
[gun firing]
Christ!
It was just somebody else.
It was just somebody else from the crash!
Crikey. I thought it was him.
I thought it was Riddick.
No juice.
It looks like it's been laid up for years.
We might be able to adapt it to...
Shut up.
Sorry. I thought
I heard something.
Like what?
Gunshots.
[grunting]
[panting]
[gun firing]
[Zeke screaming]
[gun firing]
Zeke!
[panting]
[grunting]
Piece of shit!
What did you do to Zeke?
What did you do to him?
Just kill him.
Just somebody goddamn kill him before he...
So where's the body?
Well, do you want to tell me about the sounds?
Look, you told Johns you heard something.
That's fine.
You don't want to talk to me, that's your choice, but just so you know... there's a debate right now as to whether we should leave you here to die.
You mean the whispers?
What whispers?
The ones telling me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine.
4th lumbar down, the abdominal aorta.
It's a metallic taste, human blood.
Copperish.
If you cut it with peppermint schnapps, it goes away...
Do you want to shock me with the truth now?
All you people are so scared of me.
Most days, I'd take that as a compliment.
But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Show me your eyes, Riddick.
You'd have to come a lot closer for that.
Closer.
Where the hell can I get eyes like that?
You gotta kill a few people.
Ok, I can do it.
Then you gotta get sent to a slam, where they tell you you'll never see daylight again.
You dig up a doctor and you pay him
20 menthol Kools to do a surgical shine job on your eyeballs.
So you can see who's sneaking up on you in the dark?
Exactly.
Leave!
Leave.
Cute kid.
Did I kill a few people?
Sure.
Did I kill Zeke?
No.
You got the wrong killer.
He's not in the hole.
We looked.
Look deeper.
Let me tell you what I think happened.
I think he went off on the guy, buried him in the hills.
Now he's got you believing there's something there.
Well, let's just be sure.
Look, murders aside,
Riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame.
He loves to jaw-jack and loves to make you feel afraid, because that's all he has.
You're playing right into it.
Why try to explain this to you?
You're a cop. For God's sake, we've got to find his body.
Hey! I'll go.
Look, no one is going.
Stay here.
Look, being ballsy with your life doesn't change what came before.
It's stupid.
What, do you think
I'm trying to prove something?
Well, are you?
They're hollow.
[grunting]
[yells]
[screaming]
I'm in here!
I'm in here. I'm inside!
I thought
I heard something.
Please, can you hear me?
[Fry yelling]
Help me.
Give me your goddamn hand.
I heard you, Fry.
I heard you first.
Come on.
Fry, are you ok?
What's down there?
What is it?
Did you find Zeke?
You're all right.
Fry, are you ok?
Ok.
Fuck!
That was so fucking stupid.
I don't know what the fuck is in there, but whatever it is, it got Zeke and it nearly got me!
[yelling]
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
Watch it. Watch your head.
Finally found something worse than me, huh?
So here's the deal.
You work without chains, without bit, and without shivs.
You do what I say, when I say it.
For what?
The honor of going back to some asshole of a cell?
Fuck you.
The truth is
I'm tired of chasing you.
Are you saying you'd cut me loose?
I'm thinking you could have died in the crash.
My recommendation: Do me.
Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wanna-be ass.
Ok.
Ghost me, mother-fucker.
That's what I'd do to you.
I want you to remember this moment.
The way it could have gone and didn't.
Here.
Take it easy.
Fuck you!
Do we have a deal?
I want you to remember this moment.
Just one?
For now.
So, click your fingers, and he's one of us now?
I didn't say that, but at least this way,
I don't have to worry about y'all, uh, falling asleep and not waking up.
So, can I talk to him now?
No.
Blast.
Paris P. Ogilvie.
Antiquities dealer, entrepreneur.
Richard B. Riddick.
Escaped convict, murderer.
That's... That's a particularly good Shiraz.
It's... It's a lovely drop.
It's... It's very expensive.
By all means, please help yourself.
I mean, normally I can appreciate antiques.
But this, this is something else.
It'll work.
It's nothing we can't repair, so long as the electrical adapts.
Well, it's not a star-jumper.
It doesn't need to be.
Take a 2-seater like this back up to the Sol-Track shipping lanes.
Stick out her thumb, bound to get picked up.
Ain't that right, captain?
Can I have a little help here?
I got it.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do me a favor.
Check these containers out and, uh, see what we can patch these wings up with.
All right?
[squeaking]
[chuckling]
Mine!
Insha Allah!
All right, all right.
My turn.
Are you all right?
[speaking Arabic]
Ok.
[whirring]
[beeping]
And we are getting there.
So we've got enough power for a sys-check, but we'll still need more cells.
How many are we talking about?
Um.
Let's see, we got a 90-gig draw.
The other ship takes 20-gig cells.
That would be 5.
5 total to launch.
35 kilos each, huh?
Fuck.
Well, that's pretty heavy.
Well, you know that old sand cat out there?
Mmm-hmm.
I might be able to get it going.
Yeah. Do it if you can, but if you need a hand...
Where did Riddick go?
Let's go.
[rattling]
[Johns whistling]
You're missing the party.
Come on, boy.
[gasps]
You're missing the party.
Come on.
Oh, man.
[whirring]
[Imam speaking Arabic]
All praises be Allah, for His many blessings to us.
What?
It's the winner of the look-alike contest.
[beeping]
Who were these people anyway, miners?
I don't know.
Looks like geologists.
You know, an advance team, moves around from rock to rock.
Nice of them to leave so much stuff here.
Why'd they leave their ship?
[whirring]
It's not a ship, it's a skiff.
And it's disposable, really.
It's more like an emergency life raft, right?
Yeah, they probably had a big drop ship take them off planet.
These people didn't leave.
Come on.
Whoever got Zeke got them.
They're all dead.
You don't really think they left with their clothes on the hooks, photos on the shelves.
Maybe they had weight limits.
You don't know.
I know you don't prep your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
He's fucking right.
Watch your mouth.
He's just saying what we're all thinking.
So what happened?
Where are they?
Has anyone seen the little one? Ali?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
[screeching]
[yelling]
Ali.
Come on.
[screaming]
[gasping]
[panting]
[gun firing]
Ali.
Slowly.
Jack, wait. Wait!
Ali.
Ali.
Ali.
[gasps]
Ali?
[yells]
[creatures screeching]
Imam?
Imam?
[speaking Arabic]
Other buildings weren't secure, so they ran here.
Heaviest doors.
Thought they'd be safe inside, but they forgot to lock the cellar.
Here.
What, it's broken?
No. There's still a few hits.
Actually, you asshole,
I'm trying to say that I'm sorry.
Ok, let's board this place up and get the hell out of here.
Whatever the fuck those things were, they seem to stick to darkness.
So, if we stick to daylight, we should be all right, ok?
Let's go.
22 years ago.
What?
These coring samples are dated.
Last one's 22 years ago this month.
Is there something special about that, Carolyn?
I don't know.
There could be.
An eclipse.
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
So we gotta get the power cells.
I've still gotta check on the hull and patch the wings.
Wait on the power cells.
What? Wait for what?
Until it's too dark to get back?
We don't know when it'll happen.
Let's not get overexcited.
Just get the fucking cells here, Johns.
What... What is the discussion?
Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped.
He can pilot?
He hijacked a prison transport, made a hell of a good run before I tracked his ass down.
Ok, ok, maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe we can use him to help us navigate or something.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot.
Look, you told me we could trust him.
You said that we had a deal, Johns.
Now, you may have noticed that chains don't work on this guy.
Now the only way you people are truly safe is if he believes he's going free.
Let's just say he stops believing...
You mean if he realizes that we're going to royally fuck him over.
I want you to listen to me for a second.
If we bring the cells up at the last possible minute when the wings are ready and we're ready to launch...
He hasn't harmed any of us.
He hasn't even lied to us.
Let's just stick to the deal.
He's a killer.
The law says he has to do his bid.
There's nothing
I can do about that.
You hear me?
You're dancing on razor blades here.
I'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship or slash another pilot's throat.
Not on my watch.
[groaning]
Bad sign.
Shaking like that in this heat.
I thought
I said no shivs... shivs.
This?
This is just a personal grooming appliance.
Thanking you.
Looks like we're a few shy.
Power cells.
They're coming.
It's strange, not doing a run-up on the main drive yet.
Unless...
Unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I got the quick and ugly version.
Now you're worried about a repeat of history.
It has entered our minds.
I asked what you thought.
You scare me, Riddick.
That's what you want to hear, isn't it?
Now can I just get back to work?
I've been meaning to catch up with you alone, unrestrained.
Do you think...
You think Johns is a do-right man?
You think I can trust him to cut me loose?
Why? What did you hear?
Well, guess if it were trickeration, he'd just "X" me out, huh?
He'd kill me.
Then again,
I am worth twice as much alive.
Oh, you didn't know that?
Your Johns ain't a cop.
He's got that nickel-slick badge and that blue uniform, but he's just a merc.
And I'm just a payday.
That's why he won't kill me, see?
The creed is greed.
Don't waste my time.
We're not gonna turn on each other, no matter how hard you try.
[clicking]
I don't know truly what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn.
But I do know once the dying starts, this little psycho-fuck family of ours is gonna rip itself apart.
Ever wonder why
Johns shakes like that?
Ask him.
Ask why your crew pal had to scream so painfully before he died.
So who are you, really?
You're not a cop, are you?
I never said I was a cop.
No, you didn't.
And you never said you were a hype, either.
You have caffeine in the morning,
I have a little morphine.
So what?
You got 2 mornings every day.
Wow, you were born lucky.
It's not a problem unless...
No, it becomes a problem when you let
Owens die like that.
We have enough drugs here to knock out a fucking mule team.
Owens was already dead.
His brain just hadn't caught on to the facts.
Is there anything else
I should know about you, Johns?
You know, I...
I'm letting you roll the dice on our lives.
It is not unreasonable...
Do you feel that?
That's my first run-in with Riddick.
He went for the sweet spot and missed.
They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there, Carolyn, and I can feel it pressing against the cord.
So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve endings is my business.
It's just that you could've done something, and you didn't.
Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first. Right, Carolyn?
Captain! Captain!
[speaking Arabic]
I'm not your fucking captain.
What are my eyes seeing?
If we need anything from the crash ship,
I suggest we kick on.
That sand cat's solar.
Where's Riddick?
Leave him.
He wouldn't wait for us.
Thought we'd lost you.
Johns!
[grunting]
Hey! Where are you going?
I'm just gonna get a couple things.
I'll only be a few minutes.
You wouldn't leave without me, would you?
[chattering]
[muttering]
Shit.
[wind howling]
[creature wailing]
How many are there?
Beautiful.
Allah.
People, just a suggestion.
Perhaps you should flee!
Let's go!
Come on, run!
Shit!
Come on!
[creatures screeching]
Get in!
Get down!
[grunts]
No.
Stay there! Stay down, Shazza!
Just stay down.
Come back here!
[gasping]
Shazza, stay down!
[screaming]
Please, I really think we should go inside.
We have to be inside to be able to close the door.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go.
[creatures wailing]
[rumbling]
What is it, Riddick?
What is it now?
Like I said, it ain't me you gotta worry about.
She should've stayed down.
If she only would have stayed down, she'd be ok.
She wouldn't have died.
You remember the boneyard?
These just might be the fuckers that killed every living thing on this planet.
What are we gonna do now?
Are these the only lights we have? Is this everything?
There's a cutting torch on the floor here somewhere.
I just can't find it.
Quiet, please, everyone.
[creatures wailing]
Why do they do that, make that sound?
Perhaps it's the way they see with sound reflecting back...
[rattling]
Could be a breach in the hull.
I don't know.
Come on, Johns.
You got the big gauge.
I'd rather piss glass.
Why don't you go fucking check?
I'm not staying here anymore.
Where you going?
Hey! Hey!
Paris!
Paris!
Sit him down.
You don't know what's out there.
I know what's in here.
[grunting]
[speaking Arabic]
Hurry!
Now we're trapped in a much smaller space. I hate this!
[yelling]
[gun firing]
[grunting]
[gasps]
Extremely bad timing.
Just don't run.
Riddick?
Don't stop burning.
Take this.
Take that.
Ok.
Hassan.
Where is Hassan?
[screeching]
[yells]
[gun firing]
[screaming]
Is it alive?
[sizzling]
It's like the light is scalding it.
It hurts them.
Light actually hurts them.
[gasping]
[creatures squealing]
Hassan.
We'll burn a candle for him later.
Come on, let's get out of here.
So we got one cutting torch, we got 2 hand lights.
There's gotta be something we can rip out of the crash ship.
Spirits.
Anything over 45 proof burns rather well.
How many bottles you got?
I don't know. Maybe 10.
Ok, Johns, you got some flares.
So, maybe we've got enough light.
Enough for fucking what?
We stick to the plan.
We get the 4 cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Look, I hate to ruin a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand cat is solar.
It won't run at night.
So we carry the cells.
We drag them, whatever it takes.
You mean tonight, with all those things still out there?
All right, how long can this last?
A few hours? A day, tops?
I have the impression from the model.
The 2 planets were moving as one, and there would be a lasting darkness.
Mmm. These suns gotta come up sometime.
And if these creatures are phobic about light, then we just sit tight, and we let the sun come up.
I'm sure somebody else said that locked inside that coring room.
We need to think about everybody now, especially the kid.
How scared will he be in the dark?
Don't use him like that.
Like what?
As a smoke screen.
You deal with your own fear.
Why don't you shut your fucking mouth for 2 seconds and let me come up with a plan that doesn't involve mass suicide.
[creatures wailing]
I'm waiting.
How much you weigh, Johns?
What's it matter, Carolyn?
How much?
Around 79 kilos.
'Cause you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat.
That's why you can't think...
Is that fucking right?
Where are you going?
This solves nothing.
Ok.
They're afraid of our light.
That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
And you are sure you can get us there, even in the dark?
No, I can't.
But he can.
[whispering]
Stay close.
Ok, wait. Wait!
Riddick.
Looks clear.
[screeching]
You said "clear."
I said it looks clear.
What's it look like now?
Looks clear.
I'll be running about 10 paces ahead.
I want light on my back, but not my eyes.
And check your cuts.
These bad boys know our blood now.
Are we actually going to do this?
We stay together, we keep the light burning.
That's all we gotta do to live through this thing.
Are you ready, Johns?
Yeah.
Look, we're just wasting light here.
You give him the cells and the ship and he'll leave you all out there to die.
He'll leave all of you.
I don't get it, Johns.
What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing?
Is there anything at all besides your next spike?
Stay close.
Wait.
Jack!
[screeching]
[chattering]
[grunts]
Jack.
[gasps]
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.
Paris, get back here!
Are you all right?
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.
[creature hissing]
[gasps]
I was supposed to die in France.
I never even saw France.
[creatures screeching]
Well, it's good to see you're ok.
Do I even wanna know?
Are we getting close?
Can we pick up the pace?
[speaking Arabic]
Wanna tell me what the hell's going on?
We crossed our own tracks.
Why have we circled?
Are we lost?
Listen.
Do you even know where we are?
Listen!
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
I think we should go now.
Oh, I don't know about that.
That's death row up there.
Especially with the girl bleeding.
What?
What are you talking about?
She's not cut.
Not her.
Her.
You've gotta be kidding me.
I... I just thought it'd be better if people took me for a guy.
I thought they'd leave me alone instead of always messing with me.
[sobs]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Are you really bleeding?
You could've left me at the ship, Fry.
That's why I didn't say anything sooner.
They've been nose-open for her ever since we left.
In case you haven't noticed, they go off blood.
Look, this is not gonna work.
We're gonna have to go back.
What'd you say?
You're the one who got us out here in the first place.
I was wrong. I admit it.
Ok, can we just get back to the ship?
I don't know, Carolyn.
Nice breeze, wide-open space.
I'm starting to enjoy my fucking self.
What, are you high again?
Just listen to yourself,
Johns.
No, no, you're right, Carolyn.
What's to be afraid of?
My life is a steaming pile of meaningless shit anyhow, so I say mush on.
The canyon's only a couple hundred meters, after that it's skiff city.
So why don't you butch up, stuff a cork in this fucking kid, and let's go.
She is the captain.
We should listen to her.
Listen to her?
When she was so willing to sacrifice us all.
What's he talking about?
This does not help us.
During the crash, she tried to blow the passenger cabin, kill us in our sleep.
Shut your mouth.
We are fucking disposable.
We're just walking ghosts to you.
Shut your fucking blowhole!
Fine. Fine!
You've made your point.
We'll all be scared.
Oh, Carolyn, how much do you weigh now?
The verdict's in.
The light moves forward.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Just realize that?
6 of us left.
If we can make it through the canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a feat, huh?
Not if I'm the one.
What if you're one of 5?
I'm listening.
What are they doing up there?
They're talking about the canyon, I suppose.
How to get us through.
Battlefield doctors decide who lives and dies, it's called triage.
You kept calling it murder when I did it.
Either way,
I figure it's something you can grab onto.
Sacrifice play.
Hack up a body, leave it at the start of the canyon like a bucket of bait.
Trawl with it.
We got extra cable on the sled.
We drag the body
40, 50 feet behind us.
Nice embellishment.
Well, I don't wanna feed 'em.
I just wanna keep 'em off our scent.
So, which one caught your eye?
No, no, don't look.
Christ. What the hell's wrong with you?
Imam, slow down.
Just a little more space between us and them.
All right, enough of this shit.
You do the girl, and I'll keep the others off your back.
It's not too big a job for you, is it?
I'm just wondering if we don't need a bigger piece of bait.
Like who?
Leave the sled!
Let's move!
[gun firing]
Let's go! Let's go!
[both grunting]
[creature hissing]
One rule.
Stay in the light.
[both grunting]
Remember that moment.
[groaning]
You should've never taken the chains off, Johns.
You were one brave fuck before.
You were really bad-ass.
The chains.
The gauge.
The badge.
I told you to ghost me.
[creatures wailing]
[grunting]
[gun clicking]
[yelling]
[crunching]
[screams]
Back to the ship, huh?
Just huddle together until the lights burn out.
Get away from us.
Till you can't see what's eating you.
That the big plan?
Where's Johns?
Which half?
We're gonna lose everybody out here.
We should've stayed at the ship.
He died fast.
If we have any choice about it, that's the way we should all go out.
Don't you cry for Johns.
Don't you dare.
Blind spot.
Shall we pray together?
I have already prayed with the others.
It is painless.
It's pointless.
Because you do not believe in God does not mean
God does not believe in you.
Think someone can spend half of their life in a slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe?
Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and not believe?
You got it all wrong, holy man.
I absolutely believe in God.
And I absolutely hate the fucker.
He is with us, nonetheless.
2 of your boys are already dead.
How much faith do you have left, Father?
I only see one way.
That way.
It's the only way off this rock.
Just keep the girl between you.
What about the cells?
I'll take those.
Move.
Are you sure you can keep up?
Move!
[creatures squealing]
[gasps]
Do not look up!
Do not look up!
They're killing each other.
Move! Keep moving!
Keep moving!
[yelling]
[shouting in Arabic]
[screeching]
Riddick! Wait!
Riddick!
[yelling]
[screaming]
Get off her!
Get off her!
[yelling]
It's ok.
[grunting]
[creatures squealing]
He did not know who he was fucking with.
[creatures wailing]
Pull him up.
Come on.
Pull him up.
Stand up.
Get up. Come on.
Oh, no.
[Riddick laughing]
So, where the hell's your God now?
[groaning]
Riddick!
Are we close?
Just tell me that the settlement is right there.
We can't make it.
[yelling in Arabic]
[creature hissing]
Hide here! Now!
Why is he still out there?
He's not coming back, is he?
[scratching]
[creature wailing]
[whirring]
That's the last
I could find.
[thudding]
Strong survival instinct.
I admire that in a woman.
I promised them that we would go back with more light.
Did you?
Hmm.
What, are you afraid?
[laughing]
Me, afraid?
Come on, Riddick.
There's gotta be some part of you that wants to rejoin the human race.
Truthfully,
I wouldn't know how.
Well, then just give me more light for them.
I'll go back by myself.
Ok.
There you go.
Please just come with me.
I got a better idea.
Come with me.
You're fucking with me,
I know you are.
You know I am?
You don't know anything about me.
I will leave you here.
Step inside.
I can't.
Sure you can.
I can't.
Here, I'll make it easy on you.
Take my hand.
Come on.
Come on.
[crying]
Look, no one's gonna blame you.
Save yourself, Carolyn.
Come on.
Come on.
That's it.
That's it.
Good girl.
[creature wailing]
[screaming]
You listen to me!
I am the captain of this ship and I am not leaving anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means...
[grunting]
Get that thing off my neck.
Shut up!
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
You didn't answer me.
Yes, I would, Riddick.
I would.
I would die for them.
How interesting.
[thudding]
Never had a doubt.
Anyone not ready for this?
There is my God,
Mr. Riddick.
[screeching]
[wailing]
[screeching]
Don't stop. Don't stop!
Come on! Move! Move!
You know the way!
On board!
Come on! Get on!
[wailing]
Carolyn.
Come.
Now.
[Riddick yelling]
Wait.
Riddick.
Riddick.
[gasps]
[panting]
Ok, hold onto me.
Hold onto me.
We're gonna get out of here.
I got you. Come on.
Come on, Riddick!
Get up! Get up!
Get up!
I said I'd die for them, not you.
Let's move.
Come on. Come on.
All right.
[gasps]
Not for me.
Not for me!
With so much prayer to make up for,
I scarcely know where to begin.
I know where I'd start.
Riddick, what are you doing?
[clanging]
Can we just get the hell out of here now?
We can't leave
[gasps] without saying good night.
[creatures screeching]
A lot of questions, whoever we run into.
Could even be a merc ship.
So, what the hell do we tell them about you?
Tell 'em Riddick's dead.
He died somewhere on that planet.
They're ready.
Three photographers, $250 each.
- I thought it was 400 each.
- Kid, areyou in or out?
I'm in.
Here to thebridge, winnertakeall.
Ifthe copsgetyou, you're onyourown.
Right here, man.
Look out!
Beautiful!
Kid, smile.
Give me room, will ya?
Shit!
You almost got me killed, asshole.
You son ofa bitch!
Grab hold.
Oh, shit.
- Marcus Ridley, how the hell areyou?
- I'm good.
- How long haveyou been back, bro?
- Three weeks. Spent it with my kids.
-I miss them when I'm over there.
-I'll bet. Why don'tyou bring 'em back?
Looks likeyou can afford it.
Look at all these baubles.
So what happening, man? What's goin' on? Still tryin' to kill yourself?
- Something like that.
- What happened to playing pro?
I thoughtyou got picked for the minors last fall.
Yeah, well, that didn't quite work out.
You know,
Coach wanted me to play D.
- Whatyou do? Hit him?
- I should've.
-Wastin' your life.
-I just haven't gotten the break I need.
You know, NHL tryouts are in three months.
John, the breakyou need is right here.
They'll coveryour travel, giveyou a 5K bonusjust for showin' up.
And ifyou make the team-- pow.
Ah, come on, Rid.
That's a circus, not a sport.
- It's a pretty sunset though.
- It's the mines.
- What is?
- The dust makes the sunset red.
Look. Come on.
We both know cash is king.
I last two moreyears,
I have enough to retire... support my family for life.
They love Americans there, especially baby-faced, boy-next-door types.
It'll bejust like high school.
You run; I block.
Besides, it's where even a dufus-assed white boy likeyou can get laid.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
I appreciate the offer, but I should stick around, you know?
- This is myyear to make pro.
- I tried. Good luckwith that.
My flight leaves at 9 p.m. tonight, in caseyou changeyour mind.
- Thanks for savin' my ass today.
- Anytime.
In another unit, yeah.
They're out back.

Okay! Thirty seconds to go!''
I don't understand a word you're sayin' to me, sweetheart.
But maybe ifyou say it louder,
I won't understand you even better!
I get it. Your nipples get hard at the very sight ofme, right?
A new bio on the kid.
Now he's a rodeo champion.
Rollerball
Cue the chant.
Jonathan.Jonathan.
...Lone Star, Texas.
The Lone Star state--
Hailing from the wide-open plains ofTexas... a former rodeo champion and the first-round draft pick... by the prestigious National Hockey
League back in the States.
Considered the next Wayne Gretzky... he turneddownaking's ransom from the NHL toplayhere... inarealman's league.
- Holy shit.
- Thesurebetforrookie oftheyear... who kills his stubble each morning with a Wilkinson Sword Tri-flex.
Hereheis, your veryownJonathan Cross.
Please, please, my friends.
Sit down. Have a seat.
You are his boy. Looks like Alexi's got some hot investors.
- Vodka!
- Vodka!
- Thereyou go. Enjoy.
- You gotyour armadillo on?
Jesus, you're an idiot. Serg!
You wanna be a paraplegic?
You have any idea what those guys out there can do toyour spine?
- Gotta catch me first, Rid.
- Right.
- It's your face.
- Yes, Mother.
At least do it up.
Stubborn bastard.
Okay, Toba. Big roar now.
Let's hear it. Let's go.
- Great roar, Toba!
- You hang tight up there, okay?
- You too,Jonathan.
- All right.
Hi, I'm the new guy--
All right. Listen up, thugs.
We got our butts kicked last game... but the headhunter's not goin' down again.
- Areyou? I didn't hear an answer!
- No!
Let's give 'em something to think about in case we see 'em in the play-offs.
That means teamwork, so no more cowboy, hot-dog dog shit.
Can't we all just get along,
Dutch?
Aurora's right.
''No more cowboy, hot-dog dog shit.''
When the Red Horsemen went to the Golden Horde last month... they came backwith their tails between their legs.
Nowthe Horde comes to Horsemen town.
The wordis ''rematch''... andthe Horsemen hopeit's spelled ''payback. ''
A team must go around the track twice... maintaining possession ofthe rollerball... before they can score.
It's really that simple, as simple... as using a Lifestyle female condom before sex.
The ball must be held at all times.
Playergearmaybe only used to dislodge theball... orpreventascore.
A teamgainingpossession mustfirstdo therabbithole-- that's thatkillertunnel above eachbench-- thenmake one circuit through enemyterritory... andthen they're eligible toscore.
All you really have to know is there's only one way to score... and that's when a player takes one ofthe balls... wingsitatone oftheirongoals hardenough tosetoffthepyro.
Therestoftherules are Russianandcomplicated, andwe--

Put the label out.
Yes!
We are the hottest sports-entertainment start-up in the world, bar none.
We have to pay a couple ofthe headliners, but the rest get bollocks.
We can get them to fight for peanuts.
Whoa, it's about to get interesting!
Yeah!Goodmove forDenekin!

I will not allow this game to become corrupted... like so many things in this part ofthe world.
The integrity ofthe game must be maintained... for the people, to keep their heroes alive.
And to keep them gambling, ofcourse.
Go, go!
Michael The Assassin - Russian Federation
Areyou crazy? Areyou insane? What are you doing mixing it up with that guy?
He's doped up. Big deal.
It could be PCP, for all you know.
That dude doesn't feel anything.
Stay the hell away from him.
Payback? How many ofyou will last through the season with management...
- there watching this sissy performance?
- That woman.
- So go out there and score.
- Come on. Let's stay focused.
We have a lead. All we have to do is keep up the pressure.
Tell cowboy to pass the ball once in a while.
- They're keying on him.
- She's right.
Maybe ifshe'd get up in the air, somebodywould pass her the ball.
Enough! We have a game to play.
- On three: One, two, three! Get some!
- Get some!
- She's wide-open!
- Come on! Throw it!
He bogarts it!
Cross keeps the ball!
- Come on,Jon!
- I'm on it! Go! Move!

Guys, wait!
Hold on. Hereyou go.
Toba, you're fine.
And don't screw up.

What thehellis wrong with the officials?
I mean, the band can sure smell it.
The audience can feel it coming.

My mother's a pediatrician.
Yes, it's true.
The plane leaves at 8:00 a.m.
That's 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
Be there, be on it or be history.
We will seeyou in the morning.
Hi, I'm the new guy--
My friends, they call me ''Rabbit.''
Really?
What was that?
I think it's something about her only batting for the home team.
Management told me you gotta wear the hat from now on.
- Yeah, like hell I do.
- No, I'm serious.
- Management's gonna tell us what to do?
- You got me.
You wear the hat.
You wear the hat.
I told you this is the promised land.
Last one to the club buys.
- You get off!. Asshole!
- Come on!
I'll kickyour ass, Rid.
Shit. Goddamn.
Yeah.
- You guys are nuts!
- I told you! The promised land.
Yes, sir.
Listen. Please take extra-special care ofthis car, okay?
- Yes.
- Thankyou.
-You ready for Ridley's Great Adventure?
-Yeah. Let's go play ball.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- Howdy, y'all.
- That's great.
I love this country.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Honeys at 4:00. Yes, ladies.
- Sir Ridley's in the house.
- American ''Horses,'' right?
Absolutely.
And hung like one.
-We don't speak much.
-The way I dig it. You don't speak much.
- ''The way I dig it''?
- You ever tried to get laid?
- Katya, how areyou?
- Look.
- My number. I got my number on.
- She's official. She's got her number.
Congratulations.
It looks beautiful.
What's the matter, Rid? You don't like the idea ofa number on your face?
You guessed it.
And now we will all get big bonuses, thanks toyou Uncle Sammys.
ToJonathan and to Ridley.
Thankyou very much.
- This toast should be to Toba.
- To Toba.
Come here. Come here.
To Toba.
Why doyou show me disrespect? You work
24 hours in the mines, it pays nothing.
I broughtyou in here, and you try to pay.
All right, my gypsy brother.
Have a drink.
A little wound tonight, Denny?
What happened could have happened to any ofus.
It'sjust--
It's very bad shit, man.
It's a rough game.
That's whywe get paid.
You make a hundred times what I do.
What's up, Denny?
- What ifit wasn't an accident?
- What areyou talking about?
Show him.
- The chin strap's been cut.
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it in the trainer's office.
- Look at this.
She says the gambling syndicates probably put them up to it... or something like that.
- Will you shut up a little bit?
- We need to go tell Petrovich.
No. We'll deal with this on the track, ourselves.
Toba was almost killed out there,
Rid. He's the owner.
- I wouldn't bother him with it.
- Fine, Captain.
I'll go. Enjoy the party.
No move. Me be back soon.
Tonight was the best game.
Real cowboy shit, huh?
Tonight was the best game.
Real cowboy shit, huh?
- Is he available?
- Ofcourse, foryou.
Mickey, gentlemen, please.
My stallion.
My homie.
Let me introduce my friend. This is
John Buckley from the U.S. Network.
- Enzo Molinari, Canale Cinque.
- Pleasure to meetyou.
And Yuri Kotlev, owner ofthe Horde.
Be careful,Jonathan.
I think he's very angrywith you.
Yuri!
Derek Cannon, an investor from Montana.
- One ofthose places, you know.
- How doyou do, son? Nice to meetyou.
- Big money. Big money.
- Could I talk toyou for a minute?
Yes, ofcourse.
Please, this way.
What can I do foryou?
I think the chin strap's been cut.
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
You're right.
It doesn't matter.
Ifthat fat swine was behind this,
I will get the owners to take his team.
- May I keep this?
- What areyou gonna do?
I'll take care ofit.
I swear on my mother's grave.
A nice boy, yes?
He's the angriest man in the game.
Hejust doesn't know ityet.
- Borges, you still back there?
- Discreetly.
And how is Mr.Jonathan tonight?
You play good?
How come it always feels like we got the freeways to ourselves?
We are not a rich country, sir.
Yeah. No shit. So why does everybody bet their ass on the rollerball?
We call it the Atlantic City syndrome.
Watch whatyou're saying.
My apology,Jonathan.
Our problem, notyour problem.
That's no worry, Borges.
You guys be good tonight.
-Jonathan.
- Don't waitup.
You thinkwe could do this in a bed sometime?
You know, with sheets and stuff?
We've been through this.
It should be our secret.
How could I forget?
''It could be used against us!''
Against me. You're untouchable.
Come on, Aurora.
You don't need to hide all the time.
- I don't.
- Yes, you do. You live in the dark.
- Your face isn't as bad as you think.
- I know that.
Yeah. That's whyyou always turn your left side to people.
I don't always turn.
Toba's helmet was cut.
I took it to Petrovich.
- And you think that does some good?
- He seemed pretty upset about it.
I think he'll take it to the Horde owner.
You are so naive.
- They knew.
- They knew what?
One ofthe TV guys put me onto this.
Let's see ifI can call it up.
Here. Look.
That's Toba getting hit.
- It's caught clearly on five cameras.
- So theywere following the action.
But let me back the feeds up five seconds.
Now look.
One camera follows the action... and four cameras follow a simpleminded boy at the other end ofthe track.
Theywere called and told to get on him... fifteen seconds before it happened.
The Horde did not make that happen,
Jonathan, not on their own.
This TV guy.
You know where to find him?
- What's going on?
- Demonstration.
It is the headquarters for the mines. Hang on.
What doyou want me to do?
- Get out ofthe car. Get out.
- What's going on?
-Just trust me. Get out. Hurry.
- Aurora, what's--
Quick,Jonathan.
Come over here.
Hurry.Jonathan.
-Jonathan, get in here. Get in here.
- What the hell's goin' on?
Get in here.
That's my goddamn car!
That is notyour car.
It belongs to Petrovich.
He'll have another one foryou by tomorrow. Come on.
Goddamn. This is unbelievable.
Jonathan, don'tyou know they can trackyou with these things? Come on.
- What's with thisplace?
- The state housing authority... sold offthe apartments, then theywent out ofbusiness.
- So what?
- They never sold offthe hallways.
- There is no one to take care ofthem.
- No shit.
Sergei?
Don't kill him!
Let me guess.
This isn'tyour friend Sergei, is it?
- Sergei's gone.
- Ofcourse he is.
I suppose we can't call the police about it either, right?
Let's get out ofhere.
He may be the police.
You almost missed the flight.
Good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?
- Yeah.
- And it was a long night, huh?
It was, yeah. I partied, the usual thing, with the team.
We found your car.
Areyou all right?
Yeah, yeah.
I just had a little accident.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Serokin, did you follow me last night?
Just found your car, that's all.
Wouldn't wantyou to be without.
So there was a goon in the apartment, and the guy booked out in a hurry.
There might have been a thousand reasons why. He might've been lying to Aurora.
Let's say they are screwing with the game.
- Then?
- Yeah? Then what?
Then nothing. Status quo.
We play, we win.
And ifit gets too sick, we walk.
Come on, guys.
I've got meetings.
- Can't I just take a cab to the hotel?
- When the circus came to town... did they let the elephants take a cab to the hotel?
You're the elephant.
Get in the car, son.
One, two, tres, cuatro.
Itisanhonorandapleasure tobe broadcasting toyou this evening... with a crowd pushing 50,000... in this beautiful desert city on the shores ofthe blue-- blue--
-Jeez, this outfit's got a lot ofmoney.
-What is that?
I'd say it's a good time in a can.
Beep, beep.
Come on! Come on! Come on in here and getyour ass kicked!
Come on! I loveyou.
Tahli, what channel did you say you gave us in your territory?
Tahli, what channel did you say you gave us in your territory?
- 1 09. I see.
1 -frigging-0-9.
They do origami on channel six ofyour silly hair ball network!
You ungrateful cretin!
I will kill you myself!.
I will disappearyourwhole family!
You wanna do business with us, we are on channels one through five.
Got it?
You got that?
Goddamn mouse.
- Goal, yes, goal.
- The Red Horsemen are rolling over--
Stop!
Stop!
What? Areyou from Omaha or something?
It was only a matter oftime... before one these creeps realized that their take would go up... as soon as they got a little blood on the track.
What? Doyou think they sit around struggling with the morality ofit?
- They're gonna kill somebody.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
Come on. I make more in a season than I would ten years doin' people's taxes.
They're not gonna let anything happen to us. They need us.
Sojust closeyour eyes and take the money, okay?
Sergei, the TV guy?
They found him at the border, his throat cut, his mouth sewn shut.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
What's going on?
Well, you see, you hit the pod ramp andjump, and I cross under and go.
And then you shot in the free throw, and then you did the 440.
So I wasn't sure, but I thinkyou scored the touchdown.
- Got it?
- Absolutely.
I scored a touchdown and I win.
Gotya. Gotya.
We'll beat 'em!
- This MongolBlue Team is on fire...
- We'll beat them! andinsane!
They're latheredup likeaSiberian wolfpack... readyto tearthe Reds limb from limb.
You're not wearing your spine protector, right?
That's right.
With over a quarter left to play, it's the Horsemen--
I see.
- You should make some arrangements.
- Alexi, I'm on--
I don't want problems!
I want solutions.
It's in the works.
We got ourselves a motorcycle race here!
Whoa!Aurorajustgothammered!
Thatson ofabitch hasgot tobe eightfeet tall.
Here's your bike, little lady.
Hope I didn't bend it.
- Do I wish you spoke English.
- I speak itjust fine, asshole!
Bail out!
Easy, fellas.
Come on, get him out.
We're out ofhere.
Ridley, my man.
- How areyou?
- I feel like Freddy Krueger.
- How is he, Doctor?
- I'm good. I'm good.
- He should be resting.
- I feel fine. I can play.
- You sure about that?
- I feel fine.
- Areyou up to it?
- It was, after all,just an accident.
You don't know how glad I am to hearyou say that.
All right, that's it.
Come on, let's go. Out.
You promised me you'd stop this.
Dear God, your tone.
How have I denied you?
I have madeyou a rich man, an international star.
I created a sport thatyou could thrive in.
I have given you total freedom to do as you please and even a satellite TV... and asked for one thing: your trust.
So will both my studs be at practice tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.
Horsemen, number one.
Watch them. Ifthey take a shit,
I want to know what it smells like.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't move.
Close the doors.
It's cold as hell.
Please, the door.
Hey, the door!
Come on. Come on, Denny.
- What about our passports?
- Katya trashed it.
- She couldn't get them.
- She's afraid.
- I think they have something on her.
- We have to wing it, then.
Get the cash from my place?
You apartment was being watched all the time.
The players put this together.
Thanks, Den.
- Thank them.
- I don't know what to say.
Here, look.
The nearest border is Russia.
You have two crossings here at the Russian border-- here and here.
One is by the river. Ifyou leave now, from hereyou can make it by morning.
-I thoughtyou two were coming with us--
-He has family here. I have my mother.
And ifyou don't want them to disappear or have an accident--
You can never really leave.
Aurora, wait a minute.
Areyou gonna be okay--
You stop.
Beforeyou say something even more stupid.
Get the light over there on the wall.
There's no way I'm gonna die in this shithole ofa country. No way.
We left the rest ofthe team, Rid.
How many times areyou gonna have to getyour head handed toyou... beforeyou stop picking fights with people who are too big?
This isn't some college coach you canjust flick off.
These are dangerous people, man.
Look,Jon, she's safe.
She's safe.
Nobody knew aboutyou two.
Shit. We have company.
Looks like they brought the whole Russian cavalry, Rid.
Great. We're being chased by our own bodyguards.
Here they come, Rid.
They're on your bumper.
The fender.
Squeeze them!
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!
Come on, you son ofa bitch!
- That ain't gonna work twice.
- They're still coming on us.
- Remember Squeak Harris?
- Ofcourse I remember.
Remember how he died?
- Change with me.
- Now, listen, Rid--
Oh, shit!
- Let's rock and roll!
- One, two, three!
God!
Goddamn it, this road isn't even paved!
Listen, I haven't seen lights in about an hour.
Why don't we back it offa little?
How fast are we going, anyway?
I don't know.
It's in klicks.
How fast is it in klicks, then?
That's not so bad.
Ridley, that's in miles per hour!
- So what?
- ''So what?''
You're going 1 20 miles per hour on a Hog on a dirt road!
It's not an off-road bike, Rid!
Ten klicks to the border.
Chill.
Yeah, that ten klicks is gonna be a long walk... ifone ofthese tires goes out.
Oh, shit.
Ridley, we've got lights!
Don't look!
Watch the road!
- Looks like they're gaining on us.
- What?
Yeah, they're definitely gaining on us, Ridley, and fast!
- What the hell could they be driving?
- My limit's 1 50, man.
Faster! What in the world are they driving?
Shit!
Come on, baby!
Who said this isn't an off-road bike?
I've got news foryou, Rid.
They've got an off-road airplane.
- There it is.
- That's it? That's the border?
What doyou want, a Stuckies and a casino? Hang on.
We can make it.
It won't work. Not double.
Then you go.
Don't get saintly on me, Ridley.
- I gotyou into this! You go!
- Your kids! Go home!
Ridley, I'll be fine.
I promise.
Get to the American consulate on the other side.
They'll have me on a plane first thing in the morning.
- Go! Get out ofhere! Go!
- You better make it.
Closeyour eyes and take the money.
God forgive me.
Wait. Let's see ifhe makes it.
Come on.
Magnificent.
Let's go.
Make sureyou tip the border guards well.
Did you--
Did you really think I could letyou pull a stunt like that... even ifI wanted to, in front ofthem?
How could you do that to me?
How could you be so... thoughtless?
All right.
We start again.
I'll giveyou a bonus of$1 00,000,
U.S., payable however.
You play through the championship.
Play till the goddamn cable deal closes... then you may go whereyou wish.
I'll even giveyou a retirement game.
Go fuckyourself.
Throw that sack ofshit out ofhere!
Get rid ofhim!
What are we going to do with you, eh?
In the old regime, Petrovich was above the official rank in Spetnaz... before the age of30.
KGB colonels used to cross the street when the saw him come.
Now they all line up to grovel in the dust.
Would you like a drink ofwater?
You obviously don't care anything foryourself... but haveyou thought about the girl?
Oh, dear boy, you don't imagine you have any secrets, doyou?
Why doyou think she's still alive?
Because Petrovich needs you.
He'll giveyoujust about anything you want, including her life... ifyou playyour cards right.
You have an opportunity here.
You might call it the opportunity ofa lifetime.
You see Yevgeny over there, so full ofhimselfnow?
He used to work in the post office.
I introduced him to the proper financing... and now he owns the mines.
Yeah, making a fortune.
He keeps the miners in line.
Good business. Good business.
You might wonderwhy
I'm not in it myself.
I don't need to own the mines.
Doyou know why?
Because I own the man who owns the mines.
All he has, I have.
Same with the supermarkets... the TV station, locomotive plant.
I don't need a political position... because I own the men who do.
We learn to separate ourselves from humanity... likeyou,Jonathan, separateyourselffrom your teammates.
You can keepyour 1 00K.
But I do like the view from up here.
No, I want more.
I want ownership-- part ofthe media rights... the gambling revenues, the works.
Jonathan, areyou fooling with me?
Come on, Alexi, we both want the same thing here, don't we?
Good. Very good.
Let Serokin takeyou back home.
You've got a big night ahead ofyou.
What?
Aurora's kind ofbugging me.
You know, getting way too serious.
I hate that too. Women.
Yeah.
I want her out ofmy life.
Do me a favor and trade her.
No problem.
People disappear all the time.
No, trade her, Alexi.
Just trade her. I like the lady.
I don't want her disappeared.
I just want her gone, okay?
All right.
I'll do that.
Playwell tonight.
Playwell.
Gave me a lot ofshit about wanting to become a partner.
Just cover to get the girl out.
Did you give him that?
I thought it was too subtle for him.
So, the first chance he gets, he'll bolt.
Shit! I'm this close to a North American cable deal!
Well, Maybe there is one thing we can do to turn this to a profit.
You did promise him a retirement game, after all.
Sanjay, you are a rat, butyou are my rat, and I loveyou.
Go ahead.
Trade the girl.
Trade the girl to the Horde.
But we're playing them tonight.
He wants her gone.
Life is full oflittle disappointments.
Make sure they get a number on her.
We heard you were in a rock-climbing accident.
Areyou all right?
Yeah.
You know me.
I'm hard to hurt.
Where's Ridley?
You guys are always together.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Ladiesandgentlemen, this is whatit'sallabout-- one hard-fought struggle for all the marbles.
And the Red Horsemen--
There is unbelievable tension in thisarena.
Thereare fourteams in the quarterfinals... but without thehelp ofMarcus Ridley... who was crippled by a sudden attack ofmalaria... whichhe contractedin the tropics onanarchaeologicaldig.
Malaria?
Ifthey'll buy it,
I'll sell it.
- Ridley's not sick, is he?
- Don't get in this. Stay out ofit.
- You shouldn't go out there.
- I've got to.
That's how I got him to send
Aurora away. He made it real clear.
- Where are they sending her?
- What do I care... just as long as it's away from here?
What makes you think you can trust him?
I don't have a choice.
You can't help me, Denny.
It's quite simple.
The Golden Horde, however, seem tohave severaltransfers from otherteams--
Hey, little lady,
I see they got a number on you.
Nice. Very nice.
Yeah! Yeah!
Get the goddamn camera out ofmy face, asswipe!
And now, for all ofyou out there, a surprise is on the way.
Despite earlierreports ofarock-climbingaccident... he's comingback.
Despite thepleadingofhis trainers andthe threats ofhis doctors... he's comingback.
He's comingback forthelove ofthegame.
He's comingback foryouandforme.
Thegreatestrollerballer whohas everlived... yourvery ownJonathan--
Cross!
Look. Bravo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?
Last minute rule changes.
You understand that?
They give this message toyou.
''Playwell, and she will be on the Horde team playing tonight.''
Ladiesandgentlemen, aspecialannouncement.
Asyouallknow, at thelast owners'meeting in Odessa... certain rule changes were proposed and adopted.
In the finaleliminationround... normal rules and penalties are to be suspended.
What are they doing?
Thegame willbeplayedwith no fouls calledandnopenalties.
What is this shit?
There's no such rules--
They're going to kill someone.
No penalties.
This is gonna be interesting.
He tattooed her face.
- What areyou gonna do?
- Play the goddamn game, I guess.
You ever see thugs like that on the bench before?
This will make us, my friend.
This will make us.
Doyou have the pictures and the resumes on the replacements?
Ladiesandgentlemen, what we'vegothere... isJonathanandUglich... in a no-holds-barred cockfight.
Say hello to Mr. Denekin!
Crosssnagsit.
Nobogarting this time.
Hepassesit to Katya, whoscores!
Boy, this crowd sure appreciates Denekin... thelocalboy whomadegood.
As a matter offact, there's a lot offriends in the audience... includinghis entireshift from themine.
Goldseems tohave an extraplayeron the track.

Get out ofthis!
They're going to kill you!
Aurora, get offthe track.
Go on, girl.
Holy shit, he's wearing a spine protector.
He knew. He knew.
Here'syourgrudgematch!

Shit!
Cross turnsitaround!

Uglich's dead meat!
You see?
The show isjust getting started.
That's about the hardest hit
I've ever seen!
I got the Asian flu.
Come on, baby! Yeah!
What the hell are they doing?
Yeah!
This may be getting out ofhand.
Maybe we should call the whole thing off.
The Redcoach is trying to calla time-out... trying togetherplayers outofthegame.
Come in!
We wantyou to come in!
She should go kill herself.
No, goddamn it, she's right.
Get offthe track.
Is anybody gonna stop this?
- We should cut the feed.
- No, leave it.
Get offthe track, Katya.
Denekin, get out ofthis.
Dumb cowboy.
You don't have to do this.
The man wants a show, Rid.
I guess we'll have to give him one.
Punk!
Get back out there!
Cut the satellite feed.
I said cut it.
No more ofthis. Enough!
Don'tyou see?
They're killing him... for the ratings!
- That's not in the script!
- Hey, sit down!
Open your eyes, fool.
The world's about to blow up.
Didn'tyou hear me? Sit down.
Screwyou.
You don't control us anymore.
Listen to them.
I'd better go and sort this out.
Do it.
Do it!
Holy shit!
Go, go.
Bravo.
Jolly good show and all that.
I wonderwhat he was looking for.
These probably.
Well, youngJonathan... you've done marvelouslywell.
But one ofthe basic rules in this sort ofthing... is thatyou must never kill a tyrant... unless you've made an arrangement with his successor.
You do see what I mean, don'tyou?
Yeah.
It means I'm not doneyet.
This gamemaybe over.
Hey, it's me.
It's me.
You may have started yourself a revolution.
Get some ofthese shotgun pellets removed.
- Nah, he missed me.
- Not entirely, he didn't.
- What are they doing?
- You stood up one ofthe monsters... that run their lives, and they sawyou do it.
- Where are we headed?
- To a doctor, to start with.
And then ifyou're able...
I thought I might takeyou home to my bed.
In spite of all the warnings, she was smoking in bed and fell a sleep.
Bad move!
And the fire begins.
It's show time!
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'm here to saveyou!
Keep those people back!
This is an emergency!
Don't you dare die on me!
Breathe, damn it, breathe!
She's gonna make it!
She's gonna make it!
What the--
Oh, damn!
Though it may be hard to believe that a single biology professor... making in excess of$1 7,500 a year... could manage to find time to gradeyour first biology research papers, I did.
As you can see, there was a shocking statistical anomaly.
Pretty much all ofyou got A's.
You deserve to congratulateyourselves.
I got a good feeling about this group.
And I think that the parade ofA's will continue to the end ofthe semester.
So much for the bell curve, right?
Bell curves suck!
Mr. Kane?
Dr. Kane, seems to be a mistake here.
My brother and I each got a C-minus on our reports.
C-minus. Me too.
Allow me to share something with the entire class.
As I was grading papers, I came across two gems, both entitled "Cells Are Bad."
And both withjust one paragraph... which I unfortunately committed to memory.
"Cells are bad.
My uncle lives in a cell.
It's ten foot by twelve.
And he has to read the same boring magazine every day.
The end."
You're talking about our papers, aren't you, Dr. Kane?
Yes, I am.
Although my standards are not where they used to be...
I still could not bring myself to put an A on top ofthose beauties.
Hopeyou understand.
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.
Let's get back to work at the Periodic
Table which is not, as some suppose--
A meteor? Where?
Route 89-A.
Yeah, I got it.
Rest assured I will be there.
Okay. Bye.
How's it look, Professor?
It's tight.
Really tight, Nadine, but not too tight.
You just don't have the points.
I'm sorry.
Don't take it too hard. Geology's a tougher subject than people think.
Areyou sure?
Couldn'tyou check again?
I really need this credit to get into nursing school.
Nursing school?
Wouldn'tyou be more comfortable where people's lives weren't dependent on you?
Actually, what I reallywant to be is Miss Arizona.
But my consultant says nursing school will really impress thejudges.
- Makes me look like I help people.
- Ready for lunch?
Or haveyou already eaten?
I was concluding a teacher-student conference with Nadine, Ira.
Harry, your dedication toyourjob is an inspiration to us all.
Regrettably, I have a prior lunch engagement with Professor Kane.
We'll talk aboutyour extra credit later, okay? Cheer up.
Let me grab my stuff.
Whereyou taking me?
A meteor hit last night.
Oh, that's what that was.
As the Glen Canyon representative ofthe U.S. Geological Survey...
I have been assigned to check it out.
I'm taking you in case I actually have to do something scientific. Then we eat.
You're a representative ofthe U.S.G.S.?
Signed up over the Internet.
Wereyou on some cheerleader site and accidentally linked to the U.S.G.S.?
Something like that.
Watch it. Take it easy.
That's my baby.
Watch it. Take it easy.
That's my baby.
Thereyou go. Easy.
Come on, be careful!
Who's gonna pay me for the damage to my goddamn car?
Son, I told you we don't do that.
It's force majeure.
Force majeure, my ass!
That car's a classic '73 Buick Rivera.
Who areyou?
Harry Block, United States
Geological Survey.
This is my secretary, Ira Kane.
We're here to investigate the meteor.
Ifthat's what it is.
Ofcourse it's a damn meteor.
It almost blew up my damn car.
I'm still fuzzy on whatyou were doing here in the middle ofthe night.
With Betty Lou here.
For the thousandth time, I was practicing for my fireman's exam... which started seven minutes ago, so I'd appreciate ifyou let me go.
You and the blonde found the meteor?
Yeah, I found it.
It bounced my car 200 feet in the air. Can I go?
Bob, get him out ofhere right now.
Don't leave town.
Sheriff, is this... the point ofpenetration?
Yeah, it punched through into a cavern 80 feet down.
That's a hole.
Oh, damn it!
Next time, you're carrying this case.
You're the U.S.G.S. representative.
That responsibility comes with the badge.
Oh, my God! Look at that.
I believe we've located the target.
- Big smile, fellas.
- Cheese!
Hold it up now.
All right?
It's hot! It's really hot.
I'll hold you up.
More nightstick.
Look at thesejackasses.
At ease, gentlemen.
The Feds are here.
Feds? What Feds?
- Who letyou down here?
- Let's not get combative, Lieutenant.
The U.S.G.S. and local law enforcement have a long history ofcooperation.
We're here to get some scientific samples, ifthat's okaywith you guys.
Ah, yeah, sure.
We got all the photographic evidence we need. Carry on.
Thankyou.
Keep up the good work.
Just hit last night and it's got stuff growing on it.
Could be cave moss.
Cave moss afterjust a few hours?
That's peculiar.
Let's get a sample and get out ofhere.
It's bleeding.
It's a rock that bleeds.
Now that's really peculiar.
Let's bag it.
I don't know ifthis geological society gig is all it's cracked up to be.
Yeah, it pads out my resume, but am I growing as a person?
Am I growing as a Division Three women's volleyball coach?
Areyou gonna do those spectro tests it says to do in the guidebook?
Spectrograph. Yeah, I will do a full spectroscopic analysis.
Your resume will shine.
Good. I got to get to the game.
Let me know if you find anything.
Ira? Areyou sureyou can handle this byyour lonesome?
All right, all right.
That's impossible.
Ten base pairs.
No, that can't be.
We need this!
Come on, ladies, look alive!
Tina, when Lisa goes for the spike, you've got to cover the line.
Lisa, two hands! Two hands!
God gaveyou two goddamn hands for a reason!
Big news. The most amazing thing.
The meteor samples are teeming with one-celled organisms.
Their metabolic rates are offthe charts.
They're dividing at an incredible rate.
It's practically exponential.
Their DNA has ten base pairs.
Ten base pairs. That's good to know.
Thankyou, Ira.
The DNA ofall life on Earth has only four base pairs.
Come on, ladies!
Look alive!
Harry, these are organisms from anotherworld.
They're aliens.
Is the Nobel Prize paid in installments, or in a lump sum like the lottery?
Let's not get ahead ofourselves.
Here. My office.
I'm not getting ahead ofmyself. I'm concerned about the tax consequences.
- Why in here?
-Just wanted to be cautious.
It's our discovery.
I'm all tingly.
I'm no biologist, but how many cells do single-celled organisms have?
Ifwe're gonna be important scientists, you have to act the part.
Why don'tyou take a look?
There are multi-cellular organisms in there.
- Yes, I know.
- But theyweren't there before.
- So they snuck in.
- There was no sneaking in.
It's-- No, it's too amazing.
- What?
- It's like they're evolving.
They're growing.
They're growing into more complex organisms.
It's evolution.
Nobel, here we come.
Yeah, but it's 200 million years' worth injust a few hours.
That's fast.
You have no idea.
Get ready.
On my signal.
Go!
Recruit, wake up.
Wake up!
Go! Go, go, go!
The hose!
This thing here!
Sorry.
- Move it! Move it!
- Wayne, go!
Go, go! Come on!
Buddy, these things happen.
There's another test in six months.
Six months?
I can't wait six months!
At least you still got the pool gig at the country club, right?
Great. Thanks a lot.
Drive careful.
I got it. I got it!
I do this.
Looks like we got visitors.
Class, since this is our first field trip, please obey a few simple rules.
Dirt!
Nice footwear.
It's perfect for spelunking.
Don't touch anything.
Don't move anything. Don't even breathe unless we tell you to.
And wearyour protective gloves at all times.
- Why do we have to do this?
- Firsthand field experience.
The very meat and potatoes ofgeology.
- Will this be on the final?
- Yes!
- Officer, nice to seeyou again.
- Professor, what's up?
- We came to pick up the rock.
- Pick it up? What?
Yeah, we--
Just orders from the U.S.G.S. Theywant it under controlled conditions.
It's very technical.
Oh, technical stuff. It's technical.
Okay, go right ahead.
- We're gonna haul it out ofhere.
- Sure, go ahead.
Deke and Danny, rememberwhat we talked about, right?
You are in charge ofthe hoisting. Get the winch up to the hole. Understand?
Fellas, stop nodding andjust stare at me for a second, okay?
Focus.
You understand what I wantyou to do?
- Yeah, we gotyou.
- Yeah.
Go do it.
Ira, I'm picking up a heavy creepyvibe here.
A lot has changed.
Class, I know these look like mushrooms, but refrain from eating them.
Oh, it smells disgusting.
Nadine, sometimes science stinks.
It's the game we play, baby.
Rotten egg smell.
- Hydrogen sulfide, right?
- Yeah, and ammonia and methane.
It's like it's converting the atmosphere.
Look at all this rudimentary plant life.
It's amazing.
I don't want to get all girly, but I feel something wiggling around my toes.
The ground does seem to be moving.
Whoa!
Flatworms.
Millions!
Yuck!
Oh, God!
Barely 1 8 hours and we already have fatworms.
- Look, look!
- Hey, there they are!
- Hi, Dr. Kane.
- Hey, Dr. K.!
- Man, I almost went down!
- Awesome.
Come here, little buddy.
I'm not gonna hurtyou.
You didn't hurt it.
You killed it.
The oxygen must have killed it.
It must need its own atmosphere to live.
Yeah.
Grab a specimenjar. We'll try to scoop some atmosphere in there with them.
Yeah, right.
It took us two billion years to do what they did injust a couple ofdays.
Yeah. Those little germs are the embodiment ofthe American dream.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
Professor Block.
But I was wondering ifI'm correct in assuming that that field trip... fulfilled any ofmy missing credit requirements.
You know, Nadine, you are a very, very smart girl.
But ifyou wouldjust focus--
Professor... the little wigglyworm things are breaking.
Look.
He's not breaking. It's splitting.
It's mitosis.
That's how they reproduce.
No sex?
No time for sex.
Bummer!
Little guys are splitting again.
Put it away. Look, we call no one, tell no one. This is our secret, right?
What about the government? Isn't this the kind ofthing they get involved in?
No government.
I know those people. Absolutely not.
You do?
This is our discovery, and we have to maintain absolute control.
We have to do more research and check our findings. Document everything.
Wayne?
What's this?
That would be an all-cotton towel, sir.
I believe it's a Fieldcrest.
It's a damp towel.
Why is a damp towel on my chaise?
Okay, let me take care ofthis foryou.
You should, becauseyou're pool manager, and you know what to do about it.
What the hell?
Where did you guys come from?
You're dead now.
Whoa! What the--
Harry, when Icheckedthesamples thismorning...
Ifoundthree differentsubspecies.
These thingsare evolvingso quickly.
God knows what we'll find when we get back to the-- Whoa!
Please tell me there's an air show today.
Shit!
Can I helpyou?
Yeah. Harry Block, Ira Kane.
United States Geological Society.
We're doing some important research.
This is our site.
I'm sorry. Not anymore.
You're not on the list.
What doyou mean?
We come here all the time.
This is not a nightclub.
Why don'tyou take it somewhere else?
I know my Constitutional rights!
Harry!
Look, maybeyou can call your superior.
We can have a word with him.
I have a Harry Block and Ira Kane claiming--
Punk. What?
You got to know how to talk to the white man.
- White man gonna get his ass whupped.
- Very sensitive. Can't beyelled at.
- Did you say Kane?
- Yeah.
- The Ira Kane?
- Yeah.
I've been looking forward to this for a long time. You bastard!
Hey, hey, hey!
Get his gun!
Take it easy. They're good. Up!
You're responsible for the worst month ofmy life!
- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.
Drive straight down to the command tent.
They're expecting you.
- Go.
- Thankyou.
That's the guy that had me in diapers for over a month!
- Men, General Woodman's expecting you.
- Russell Woodman?
What an unexpected surprise.
For me too. I didn't realize we were on a hugging basis.
The same old Ira Kane.
And you must be--
Harry Block, this is General Russell
Woodman, head of U.S. Army Research.
- General.
- Harry.
You two know each other?
Ira used to work for me.
Right, Ira?
I worked with you, actually.
You used to work in army research in the Pentagon?
Yeah.
And all this time I thought you werejust a school teacher.
No. How did you find out about this?
You leave the Pentagon, you don't call me, you don't write.
We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons.
Soyou tapped my phone?
No. We're not the KGB.
Actually, we've been monitoring your computer.
His computer?
All those girls in the photos are over 1 8.
Yes, I'm sure.
- I should've figured.
- Yes.
And you should've known better than to try to keep something this big from us.
And the CDC.
Just in time. Ira, this is Allison Reed, senior researcher in epidemiology... at the CDC.
Nice underwear.
Garter belt? At a day function?
I can do it. Thankyou very much.
I'm okay. Dr. Kane.
I'd heard aboutyour recklessness, butyou are way out ofline.
Doyou realize how dangerous this situation could have become?
It's nice to meetyou too, ma'am.
No need to play the blame game, Allison.
No harm, no foul.
We're all very appreciative of Dr. Kane and Mr. Black's discovery.
Block.
Block. I'm sorry.
The confirmation ofthe existence oflife outside this planet--
Would be the greatest scientific discovery ofour time.
Yes, actually.
Yes, it would.
And you have myword thatyou'll be kept in the loop from this point forward.
You son ofa bitch.
What doyou mean, kept in the loop?
General, we are the loop.
We won't cutyou out, but we do need to take control.
We're following protocol.
You remember protocol, don'tyou?
Yeah, I got some protocol right here foryou, Russell. Come and get it.
Look, this research must continue under careful government control and scrutiny.
We secured the area.
We're constructing an air lock into the cavern and a field research facility.
So there's not a lot for the science department... ofGlen Canyon Community College to do here.
Did you catch that condescending tone when he says Glen Canyon Community--
We are following well-established federal guidelines--
Ma'am, please. Russell, don't pull this crap. We deserve to be here.
You deserve to be here?
You're lucky anybody's ever letyou near a science laboratory again, Ira.
You're a disgrace, and a dangerous one at that.
Lieutenant, show these men out.
This is horseshit.
It's not over.
You're in for a fight, Russell.
Would you stop following me, please?
Thankyou.
We're not gonna bend over and take this!
Fruit basket for Russell Woodman!
Happy holidays, General!
Cute.
Dr. Kane, areyou asking me to bar the federal government... from involvement in a discovery as significant as this?
No, no. We're asking you to make sure that the local scientists... who actually made the discovery continue to play a significant role.
They kept us out for almost two weeks.
We put our lives on the line to find these little guys, Your Majesty.
Wejust want to be there for them as they grow up.
We were the first team at the site and the initial testing was done in our lab.
The facilities at Glen Canyon Community
College are ajoke, sir.
Theyweren't ajoke when I went there, General.
Your Honor, ifthe court would allow me to depose Dr. Kane?
Depose me?
We thinkyour past is very relevant,
Dr. Kane.
These issues speak directly to his competence as a scientist.
Dr. Kane, you were a top-level researcher... at USAMRI D from '94 to '97, wereyou not?
Yes, that's correct.
And you were summarily dismissed in the summer of 1 997. Any idea why?
My services were no long required?
Uh-huh. So in your opinion... your firing had nothing to do with an experimental anthrax vaccine... you developed and gave to nearly 140,000
U.S. soldiers in May ofthatyear?
I see whereyou're going with this.
It may have been a factor. You'd have to ask theJoint Chiefs ofStaff.
I'll make a note to do that.
But for now... can you tell me what happened to the soldiers that were inoculated?
Well, none ofthem got anthrax, ifthat's whatyou're asking.
What did they get?
As with any new vaccine... there were certain side effects associated with it.
Could you be more specific?
It was a wide range ofthings.
It's very technical.
I'd hate to waste the court's time getting into it.
Humor me.
Some debilitating stomach cramps.
Severe diarrhea.
Memory loss.
Yes, go on.
Any more symptoms?
Partial facial paralysis, temporary blindness, drooling... bleeding gums, erectile dysfunction, uncontrollable fatulence.
I think that's it.
One more question.
Doyou happen to remember what the soldiers called this illness, Dr. Kane?
Yeah, they called it the Kane Madness.
Keepyour head up.
You know she wanted to giveyou some, right?
Wereyou even in that courtroom?
Getting barbecued like baby back ribs?
It's all foreplay, baby.
Oh, we've been hit.
Forget the foreplay.
Wejust got screwed.
- Empty.
- This is very, very bad.
Damn it!
I don't care who they are.
Stealing is stealing.
Perfect.
They took the rock, the samples, all the little wormy critters.
All the data's gone. TheJ PEG files, the DNA sequences. They cleaned us out.
- I'm calling the cops.
- The cops?
They are the cops!
Then what?
Let me askyou, how comeyou get to be a colonel and I'm just a private?
I was a colonel.
And you obviously served your countrywith distinction.
Consideryourselflucky. The penalty for impersonating an officer is prison.
Yeah, maybe for you, white boy.
Me, they hang.
Colonels first.
I was at it for 12 hours.
My toes were starting to hurt
I was standing so long.
Stop it.
-Just act likeyou belong.
- Don't worry, I got this.
- Pick up that butt, soldier.
- Sorry, sir.
- And tuck that shirt in.
- Yes, sir.
Get the door.
Thankyou, Private.
Don't get used to this.
Oh-oh, look at that.
Enjoyyour lunch, gentlemen.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Your girlfriend, 1 1 :00.
Darn it.
That woman's a menace.
Testing, one, two. One, two.
One, one, one, two.
This is D.J. Harry Block here, and I'm an Aquarius.
Will you stop?
I can hearyou.
Don'tyou snap at me, unless you want an angry Solid Gold dancer on your hands.
Lieutenant?
Yeah?
Who's that?
I don't know.
I don't have anything on my schedule.
Maybe it's the guys from sector 1 2 doing a nocturnal specimen run.
- You know how those guys are.
- Oh, yeah.
This place has changed.
Can you believe this?
Look at that.
Our little babies are growing up.
Three weeks, it's already like a rain forest in here.
Looks like the kitchen from my first apartment.
Harry, check that guy out.
Is it coming or going?
That treejust ate it.
Everything here seems to be food for something else.
- So stay offthe menu, huh?
- You got that right.
Ira, come here, look at these little things.
Cool. Hey, snag one.
- Snag one?
- Snag one and put him in the bucket.
I seen this movie.
The black dude dies first. You snag it.
Don't be scared. We came for a specimen, now snag one.
He's not gonna hurtyou.
He's turned the otherway.
He's eating.
Come on, my little red lobster.
Come on, my sexy little crustacean.
Come on.
Whoa!
Ira, look at that backside.
Theater in the round.
That's the kind oftrunk space you want in a late model car.
Who does that remind you of?
I have no idea whatyou're talking about.
She's been throwing it atyou enough.
- Dr. Reed?
- Bull's-eye.
Excuse me, Dr. Reed?
Did you authorize a walk-through?
Nope. Why?
You should probably take a look at something. Here.
You'd like to roast that rump.
You'd like to butter that mother.
That is an ice image.
And Iappreciate your assumption... that there is anactual sexualhumanbeing... underneathall Dr. Reed's deep-seatedneuroses.
- ButIdon't thinkso.
- What?
I thinksheis ahumorless ice queen.
Ira, that'sjusta cover.
Don'tyouknowthat?
Allsheneeds isagoodhumping.
Oh, Ira. Ira!
Harry, stop that. We got tagetapiece of the asteroid like we came for.
And cut that out.
It disturbs me.
- Ira!
- Don'tdo that behind my back.
- I'm not doing it. I'm just walking.
- Cut it out.
Let's bag that and get the hell out ofhere.
I'm readywhen you are, Colonel.
This disco suit is making me chafe.
Shoo, fy.
Hold it right there.
Dr. Reed, so nice to seeyou again.
We werejust leaving.
You're in violation ofthejudge's orders. I could haveyou arrested.
Want to talk about violations?
What about our lab?
- Got any Raid?
- What areyou talking about?
You stole our computer hard drive, samples, files. Everything.
- I didn't steal anything.
- Your buddies there cleaned us out.
Let's be honest. You've been trying to grab credit on our discovery.
All we're trying to do is take back a piece ofwhat's rightfully ours.
Credit has nothing to do with this.
I'm concerned about public safety.
- Is this true? Areyou aware ofthis?
- No.
Something's in my suit.
You're not gonna believe him. He openly admitted to hacking into our computer.
Harry, what?
There's something in my suit!
It's impossible. It's sealed!
The fy!
There's a fy in my suit!
- Don't take offyour helmet! Oxygen!
- It'll kill it.
Doyou see it?
Look, look. Doyou see it?
- No.
- No?
- You're all right. Who's the man?
- You're the man.
- No, you're the man.
- I'm the man. Okay.
Oh, God.
It's in me!
For the love ofeverything good and holy, get this goddamn thing out ofme!
You're gonna be okay.
Cut him open. Let's get this thing.
Cut me open?
There goes your Christmas gift,Judas!
It's moving down his leg.
- What do we do?
- Maybe amputate.
Whoa, don't take the leg!
Don't let 'em take my leg.
Is there anything elseyou can do?
He thinks he's an athlete.
Doctor, look.
It's heading for his testicles.
Take it! Take the leg!
Wait, wait!
It's going the otherway.
Give me some forceps. I might be able to catch it in his colon.
- How'reyou going in?
- Rectally.
- Ohh!
- I'll get the lubricant.
- No time for lubricant.
- There's always time for lubricant!
- Flip him!
- Go.
Okay, here we go.
- Try to relax.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
I'll shove this gurney upyour ass!
See ifyou relax, Ira.
- Cheek spreader.
- All right. I'm going in.
Don't clench!
You're so brave.
- A little more.
- No more!
- A little deeper.
- No deeper!
- Squeeze my hand. Squeeze it!
- Almost there.
Open up. Open up!
- Breathe. Breathe.
- I'm breathing!
- Almost there.
- You're there!
It's over, it's over.
Itjust died.
Don'tyou ever do that again!
The size ofthat thing insideyou! It was like this! You took it like a man.
You're all right. You did great.
Can I getyou anything?
Ice cream.
I'd like an ice cream, please.
- What favor?
- It doesn't matter. It's for my ass.
Man! Now I'm a Hawaiian warrior?
I'm thinking seriously about moving.
Maybe to California, start over.
Because ofthe fireman thing?
Big deal. You funked out.
You know how many times
I've funked in my life? A ton.
Hey, pool boy, you watering down the mai tais?
No, sir.
But let me fixyou something special.
'Causeyou're nothing but a big, fat monkey turd.
Excuse me?
What?
Drink's almost ready.
Hereyou go.
That should tideyou over.
Anddon'tforget, folks
That's whatyouget, folks
Formaking whoopee
Oh, damn it!
That's gonna stain.
Barry! Barry, where areyou?
I can't seeyou.
Where areyou?
I'm down here, my pet, by the water.
Somethingjust ate Barry Cartwright!
That's too bad.
I don't get it.
How does someone with your background... credentials and talent end up... likeyou?
Thankyou.
Your partner could have died.
What wereyou thinking?
I was desperate.
I've been exiled out here for 5 years, watching the world pass me by... and this amazing discovery falls into my lap.
I look at it as my ticket out ofhere.
But I don't suppose you would understand that.
No, how could I? I'm a humorless ice maiden in need ofa good humping.
- You heard that, huh?
- Loud and clear.
Don't thinkyou know so much about me. You don't.
I'm sure I don't.
Thankyou for not calling the cops.
Oh, be careful!
Stop being such a baby.
I've seen that car before.
No more bran for me.
Hey, girls.
Hey, girls.
Stop. Cut it out.
Hey, it's the meteor guy.
What's in the bag?
Your blow-up doll?
Oh, no. I got something thatyou're really gonna like.
- What happened toyou?
- Shut up.
You guys teach here?
Yeah.
I was thinking about taking some classes.
But I decided to hit thejob market early and get ajump start on things.
Can we helpyou?
Yeah. A guy got killed at my country club last night.
A real douche bag.
Thatjust doesn't make it right.
It was an animal attack.
Isn't that something?
Happened by the water hazard on the fourth green.
The lady he was banging saw the whole thing.
We chased this sucker on the fairway, and then it died in a sand trap.
Itjust died? How?
Like it was choking to death.
You know? Stopped breathing.
Anyway... it's like nothing I ever saw before and
I thoughtyou might want to look at it.
Jill, you've got some kind ofinfestation here.
You have a serious bug problem.
What?
Jill, there's something in your closet.
Open the door, Grace.
Me? It's your house.
When did you get a dog?
We don't have a damn dog.
I don't think that's a dog.
It's like a rodent.
Or a muskrat or pig.
- How the hell did it get in here?
- It doesn't look too healthy.
Well, it's frightened.
Oh, look, he can barely breathe, he's so scared.
Come on, cutie pie.
Don't be afraid.
Come on, come on.
That's a good boy.
Yes, 91 1 ?
What the hell is that thing?
Thanks.
Pick me up in an hour. No, two.
Oh, an hour and a halfwould be good.
Thanks.
Hi. Doyou have any messages for me?
Two single beds, please.
We're fighting.
Ira, I'm tired. I've had two hours sleep and I've got to take a shower.
They're spreading.
You talking about the golfcourse?
Woodman sent a team there two hours ago.
Well, it's too bad you missed the five-foot amphibian dead in my lab.
They're adapting.
We gotta shut it down.
You're overreacting.
We can handle this.
I used to be arrogant likeyou.
We're both aware ofwhat that led to.
Take me seriously, Allison.
I do takeyou seriously.
Then you gotta talk to Woodman,
'cause he won't listen to me.
We gotta kill these things while we still can.
All right. I'll discuss it with him, but I can't promiseyou anything.
Thankyou.
-Just one more thing.
- Yeah?
Doyou thinkyou could ever be attracted to me?
Bye, Ira.
It'sjust food for thought.
Yeah, she's mine.
I've been an adjunct professor for fouryears... but I'm hoping this alien brouhaha will net me an honorary doctorate.
You gonna finish that bacon?
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it.
I ordered it, didn't I?
So about the coaching girls' volleyball?
Doyou ever get to see them take showers?
Yeah, all the time.
Sometimes I showerwith them.
You're kidding, right?
- So?
- She's gonna talk to Woodman.
Ah, thank goodness.
I'm okay.
Level with me.
Is there some sort ofalien attack happening here?
We don't know.
Excuse me, could I borrowyour cream?
Hi, Denise.
Hello, Ira.
Still setting the world on fire?
Ow.
That's Ira's ex sitting with the cop.
What's with the police escort? You're not under arrest. I don't see handcuffs.
That's funny. This is my friend, Sam.
He's about to make detective.
I know Sam. We go way back.
Congratulations.
Maybeyou could look into my missing shirts. She left with some ofmy shirts.
See what I mean?
I'm not up on the law... but is it against the law when you leave somebody's house with what they own?
You wantyour shirt?
Seriously, take it.
You must be cold, right?
Areyou cold? Is that it?
Why should I get to wear the shirt when it's your shirt?
It's amazing how manywomen open their shirt to him.
I'm sure he'll letyou borrow the shirt forjust today. Right, Professor?
Wegota code 12-72 in Valley Vista.
1 2-72? That's an animal attack.
1 0-9-9 responding.
- Gotta go, babe.
- Now?
They're calling.
Wait.
Be careful.
- You'll take care ofthe check, right?
- Yeah.
I want those shirts back, Denise.
Hey, you gotta admit... this animal attack has an ominous feel to it.
Check it out?
- Check it out.
- All right!
We're under the microscope so let's be systematic and subtle in what we do.
- No cowboy stuff, okay?
- Professionals.
OfficerJohnson.
- Fellas, why areyou here?
- We heard about the animal attack.
And part ofourjob with the Health Department... is to ascertain ifthere's any health risk.
You know what? No. Not this time.
Forget about it.
- You touch it with your bare hands?
- That would be a serious no-no.
- You did? He touched it.
- That's not good.
- What do we do?
- I don't know.
Okay, why don'tyou guys come in and take a look?
I'll be checking things out around here in this vicinity.
This dog is all ass.
Ira, look at this, man.
He would have come from in here, right?
It'sjust used for storage and access under the house.
Looks like he crawled right through the dirt there.
Hey, guys.
I was conducting a parameter check... and there's something you'd better see.
You liked that thing, you're gonna love this.
What is it?
Great googa-mooga!
What'd I tell you?
They're crawling out.
They're trying to breathe in our atmosphere.
Fortunately, they haven't been able to adaptyet.
Hey, Ira, I think I know how these things got here.
How?
Well, this entire area... is a honeycomb ofcaves and old mine shafts.
Ifmemory serves, the Moenave cave system... starts a few miles from here, west ofthe golfcourse.
Runs into the foothills, continues to the Kaibab plateau and into Lake Powell.
Our cave is smack dab in the middle ofthe system.
It's all connected.
- Could you repeat that?
- I'm impressed.
Hey, beneath this calm, sexy exterior beats the heart ofa true scientist.
Whoa, guys! That one's moving.
What the hell is it doing?
It's trying to breathe.
That's like a big loogie!
Mazeltov. It's a boy.
It's oxygen tolerant.
It's fying away.
Is that a bad thing?
Only ifyou're a human being.
You know how much I hate shopping.
We need to find you something nice forThanksgiving.
I got enough clothes.
Tony, that color's great on you.
Whoa.
This might be the place.
Ever used one ofthese before?
Just 'cause I'm a school teacher, don't make me a pussy.
Ladies, a fying extraterrestrial's in the store. Can we focus?
I'm in here.Just a minute.
Just a second, please.
I said,just a second, bitch!
How'd you like me to scratch the eyes out ofyour skull?
Here, birdy-birdy-birdy.
Birdy!
All right.
IfI was a giant, nasty alien bird in a department store, where would I be?
Lingerie.
- Notyou, the bird.
- Lingerie.
Help!
You go low. I'm going high.
Got it.
We'll never find it.
I lost him!
How doyou lose a 20-foot bird in the mall?
Ira, I don't know.
What do we do now?
We've established that "ca-caw, ca-caw" and "tookie-tookie" don't work.
Right. Sorry.
What doyou say, Ira?
Pack it in?
Youare
Sobeautifultome
Step back, Harry.
I'm gonna shoot him.
Stand down.
I'm gonna kill this one myself.
Give me a chance.

- Got it!
All right! Nice shot.
I'm sorry. I swear to God
I will never shoplift again.

I'mstandingat the edge of the Valley Vistahousingcommunity... wherejust below me there are dozens ofgiant, odd-looking dead creatures.
We should stress to ourviewers that we have received no official word from--
I saw this ugly tentacle thing come out ofthe ground.
It tried to grab my private parts.
Batted it away.
Got my hand.
An atmosphere ofanxiety and confusion in the greater Glen Canyon area.
We stand outside the state capitol building... awaiting comment from the governor's office about the nature and origin... ofthese extraordinary creatures.
Governor Lewis, this way.
Whywas I not informed that we have aliens crawling over my beloved state?
I've got 400 media vultures outside my office who know more about this than I.
I ought to throw all ofyou in prison.
Not that cushy federal place with the loosejumpsuits.
State prison, with the crotch binders!
I'm sorry, but there were security breaches made by Dr. Kane and his team.
Wait a minute. No, no. Excuse me.
That's not exactly true,
General Woodman.
I believe the Governor's question was directed at me, Dr. Reed.
Put a plug in it. I'm not interested in your bureaucratic crapola.
What I reallywant to know is how bad this thing is.
It's bad, Governor.
The new ground sensors and the satellite thermal scans... indicate a potential problem.
I don't know how to read this!
What problem?
Somebody, please, take this ugly bag ofsnakes and lay them out straight.
- Allow me.
- You are--
Dr. Allison Reed.
How doyou do?
Carla, would you mind
The red markings indicate the growth ofthe alien ecosystem.
Unless we do something immediately, we will lose Glen Canyon in three days.
Great merciful Christ.
In a week, the rest ofArizona.
Then the entire Southwest.
In two months, the United States officially belongs to them.
And we are extinct.
You're shittin' me!
Come on, admit it.
You're glad to see us, huh?
I, for one, am glad to seeyou.
Call the MP's. Have them arrested.
Hey, wejust blew a giant alien bird out ofa department store.
We're covering upyour mess.
Governor, Dr. Ira Kane. I'm chairman of the science department at the college.
My associate.
Harry Phineas Block, adjunct professor ofgeology. Voted foryou.
Wayne Grey. Took some chemistry in high school.
You two gentlemen are the original discovers ofthe phenomena, correct?
Yes, they are. And they're also responsible for the mess we're in now.
- Here we go.
- What?
They broke into the contained area and breached our safety procedures.
Causing the dissemination ofalien organisms outside the secured area.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire!
- Criminal charges are in order here.
This is bullshit!
Shut up! Listen.
My state is being overrun byvicious aliens.
You're all supposed to be the experts.
I want to know right now.
How the hell areyou supposed to deal with this?
This is an outline ofthe infected area as ofthis afternoon.
Governor, my plan... is to evacuate everyone from within five miles ofthe perimeter.
Evacuation? You're talking about 10,000 people.
Yes, sir. We evacuate, make it safe... and then burn the alien menace the hell out ofthere.
With what?
With napalm.
Lots and lots ofnapalm.
Napalm? Why don'tyoujust nuke them whileyou're at it?
What about nukes?
Pull your horns in, boys.
Nobody's dropping an H-bomb on my state.
All this talk about napalm and burning things makes me very damn nervous.
It should. We don't know their reaction to such an attack on a cellular level.
Governor, it is time for a military solution. This will work.
General, sorry to interrupt.
You better take a look at this.
What?
Clear out.
What? You called me out for this?
Sir, one ofthe creatures destroyed video four.
What's going on there?
My God!
They've evolved into primates.
That's a face for radio.
They took out six and seven.
All the monitors are down.
That can't be good.
That's the elevator.
We have no personnel down there.
They breached the air lock.
The no-nose chimp?
Call for backup.
We need backup!
They're going through the elevator!
Cover the elevator!
Stay back behind me.
Get the hell offme!
I want to see this thing!
Be prepared to fire.
It's empty, sir.
The governor!
- Do something!
- Hold your fire!
You'll get somebody killed.
Nice shot.
I'll take that now.
You have my full support to do whatever you need to do, however much firepower.
You can melt the place to beaded glass ifthat's what it takes.
Just get these hell-blown creazoids out ofmy state!
Thankyou, Governor.
I'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow.
Good.
- Where haveyou two been?
- I was getting out ofthe way.
Get me out ofhere.
Science project's over.
I wantyou and your people gone.
- Soldier, escort these men out.
- Yes, sir.
Don'tyou have work to do?
You are such an asshole.
When a woman expresses anger, it's often because--
Shut up, Flemming.
Okay, I know where the car is.
Wipe my ass too?
Hey, guys?
Got room for one more?
Hell, yeah.
Who wants to be deputy director anyway?
The real money's in the private sector.
- Areyou sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.
Listen, it may not seem like much, but
I gotyour research files and samples.
So, ifwe survive this, you guys will get the credit.
Thankyou.
- It's nothing.
- No, thank-- Let me get this.
- No, I got it.
- All right.
Sorry. Excuse me.
We haven't been formally introduced yet.
I'm Wayne Grey.
- Oh, hey, I'm kinda with him.
- Oh, that's cool.
Buckle up, Allison. We're rolling.
Okay. Oh, goodness!
Facilitiesarebeingprovided foryouandyour families.
Pleasemove inan orderly fashion to thesafe zone.
They're gonna blow up the whole town.
Attention. Weneedto clearthisarea.
Foryourownsafety, evacuateimmediately.
Can you make a beer run?
- Professor Kane!
- Arizona is going down, baby!
This may not be the best time foryou boys to be drinking.
I was your first.
We discovered you in that cave.
You were scared and alone.
It was just you, me and Harry in the beginning. Those were good times.
Why don't you level with me?
You can trust me.
Talk to me.
Just tell me the secret.
Tell me the answer.
Tell me how to kill you!
You are losing it, pal.
What is that stuff?
Some ofthe original liquid material from inside the meteor.
- Why hasn't it evolved like the rest?
- I don't know.
Maybe because it was refrigerated... was locked in an airtight case, didn't have anything to metabolize with.
But regardless, that doesn't give us any clues to--
When did you start smoking?
Not much ofa point to clean living anymore.
Whoa!
These things react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro.
Fire.
The organisms were dormant in space and then collided with Earth's atmosphere.
And bam! Heat. Fire.
That's the catalyst.
So ifa little match catalyzes this stuff, what's a ton ofnapalm gonna do?
So much for the military option.
Call that dick general.
That's a lot ofnapalm.
Yes, it is.
We're going to blow those damn creatures straight to hell.
We'll fush them out along the mine shafts... then mop up the edges as they run trying to escape the fames.
Excuse me, General.
There's an urgent call from Dr. Reed.
She says she has important information about the mission.
Really? Well, unfortunately,
I'm not available.
Anything more?
No, sir.
He blew me off.
Can you believe it?
That bastard wouldn't even take my call.
You did call him an asshole.
- Hey, Dr. K. Time to party.
- We got beer.
- I'll take one.
- Me too. I just quit smoking.
What areyou boys doing here?
We thoughtyou could use a brewski to mellow out.
Kick back and chill.
Have a beer, relax.
It's gonna helpyou with your research.
Whoa! Look at that thing!
Whoa! Can we have that when you guys are done with it?
Fellas, thankyou foryour help and the beers, but we're working.
Hold it. Hold it.
- Look at that.
- What areyou doing?
Selenium.
That could be the answer.
I'm looking at the Periodic Table on yourT-shirt and I see this pattern.
- Take offyour shirt. I'll showyou.
- Yes!
No, I don't think so.
We are a carbon based life-form.
Keep pulling, Dr. K.
We move down here, and you've found our poison: arsenic.
But the aliens are nitrogen based, right?
You make the same move down and over... and where doyou find yourself?
- Selenium.
- Selenium.
Could be as lethal to them as arsenic is to us.
And with their metabolic rates, it'll kill them fast.
Selenium. How much do we need?
Five hundred gallons could do it, should do it.
Five hundred gallons?
Um, I hate to be a buzzkill, but where are we gonna get that at 2:00 a.m.?
No problem.
Yeah, we can get that.
Head & Shoulders.
The dandruffshampoo?
Yeah, that's the stuff. The active ingredient is selenium sulfide.
How doyou know that?
You don't know anything.
Haven'tyou noticed how shiny and fake-free our hair is?
Okay, this is the best idea we got.
Let's give it a shot. Come on.
Let's do it!
Yeah! We'll get the troops together.
We're getting shampoo!
I've got the vehicle.
Good! Donalds, youjust gotyourA's.
Yes!
Almost full.
There's something I feel I should tell you, but I don't know exactly how.
Just say it. We're adults and we're all about to die a very horrible death.
So?
I would've rocked yourworld.
- You already have.
- We're full!
Battle stations! Lock and load!
- Can we continue this discussion later?
- Yes.
Let's do this!
Let's shampoo us some aliens!
Lots ofsoldiers around.
There's an abandoned mine halfa click south ofhere. We can sneak in there.
Halfa click? What areyou, in Vietnam?
Hey, I'm digging this.
Workwith me, baby.
It's over here!
It's right here!
- You okay?
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!
You sure this leads to the main cavern?
It'll lead us somewhere.
Geology's not an exact science.
Where areyou?
Where areyou, my little aliens?
Showyourself.
Warm to the touch.
Highly acidic.
We do not have time foryou to act likeyou know whatyou're doing.
- What happened to the respect?
- Woodman's going at noon. Hurry.
Very good.
- Are the troops in place?
- They're ahead ofschedule.
Excellent. We can go early.
Oh, no. What is he doing here?
Governor Lewis.
I don't see anything burning.
Where are all the explosions?
We'rejust getting underway. Didn't know you were coming to see the show.
You damn well better make it a good one, Sergeant.
That's General.
Not ifyou screw this up.
Keeping my chairwarm for me?
Thankyou.
I'll take a pair ofspy glasses and a hot chocolate.
Give me a hose.
Get up top. When I giveyou the signal, start pumping the selenium.
Got it.
Okay, we're gonna spray all around the meteor, then get out ofhere fast.
Oh, blue monkey!
Wayne, charge the line now!
- That's the napalm!
- Woodman went early!
Bad, bad, bad, bad!
Wayne, come on!
Okay, I'm out!
Oh! We gotta go!
Go! Go, go! Faster! Get up there!
- Go!
- Run foryour life!
Quite the bonfire, General Woodman.
Should've brought some wieners.
That can be arranged.
- First reports are excellent, sir.
- Very good.
Keep it together, Wayne.
Keep it together.
Oh, my God.
What's happening?
- It's coming!
- What's coming?
Get outta here!
General, look.
Hurry!
Drive!
Go! Go!
Fall back. Fall back!
What the hell is that thing?
The napalm forced an evolutionary response,just like the match.
That's evolution?
Survival ofthe fittest. Often the simplest organism is the strongest.
It's freaking out.
It's starting to have some sort ofspaz attack.
No, that's not spazzing out.
It's getting ready to divide.
Mitosis.
Wait. There's gonna be more ofthese things?
Yeah, a lot more.
Its cycle's starting over again.
It's gonna go on growing... and doubling until it takes over.
Yeah, but we were here first.
So that Head & Shoulders idea, is that still the plan orwhat?
I'm driving.
I don't care ifhe's on Air Force One.
They've got phones. I've seen them!
I don't think this is gonna wait an hour.
Hey, what's that fire truck doing out there?
Mama.
Can you believe this?
We gotta find a point ofattack.
There!
Nasty!
Allison, stop, stop.
Right here.
- Here we go!
- Get the ladder up!
Feed me the hose, Deke!
- What areyou doing?
- Going up top.
Not before me.
I've got a major score to settle.
Go, go!
We don't have much time. Hurry!
- Left!
- Left!
All right, I got it. I haven't had too much practice with this thing.
Stop! Stop!
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but it's getting bigger.
What the hell are those guys doing with that ladder?
Looks like they're getting ready to administer ajumbo enema.
We got one shot. Let's do this.
It's payback time!
Keep it in there!
What's it look like I'm doing?
It's working!
- Shit!
- Whoa!
What the hell?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Give me back my friend, you big sphincter!
She's gonna blow!
Stop kicking!
It's horrible in here!
I gotyou!
- Please. Hold me.
- I gotyou!
Don't let me go!
We gotta get outta here.
This thing's gonna blow.
You cannot imagine what I've seen in there.
Hurry up, guys!
Ira, don'tyou ever tell anyone where I've been.
Dear Lord!
Uh-oh. Time to go.
- Go!
- Go!
Whoa! We did it!
Here we go, sir.Just relax, and we'll haveyoujust as good as new.
I am happy to report that absolutely all remaining traces... ofthe alien menace have been eradicated... using the selenium shampoo formula developed right here.
Now let me introduce our civilian scientist heroes and their team.
The best that the great state ofArizona has been privileged to produce.
So, this is your moment.
You wouldn't want to miss this for anything, huh?
Firstly, I would likeyou all to meet Wayne Grey.
As oftoday, fully credentialed firefighter.
I spoke to the chief.
Oh, thanks, Governor.
Now our next hero, Professor
Harry Block, noted geologist... and the winningest coach in North Arizona's women's volleyball.
I appreciate that, Governor.
Very kind.
First ofall, let's give it up to God.
With Him, all things are possible.
Basically, wejust played tough defense, took it one alien at a time... and we were able to come away with the big W.
Thankyou.
Finally...
Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed... whose tireless efforts and research and academic findings led to the--
I think he's giving her a bit ofthe Kane Madness.
Wow! Fighting the alien menace can be tough work.
And so is keeping your hair clean, shiny and dandruff-free.
So it's a good thing that we always keep a healthy supply of--
Thankyouforthe horse.
You liked him?
Oh, it's beautiful... but l thought we were going sailing today.
You promised.
Well,that one's too old.
See, now? That'll do.
Come on!
Come on, Mr. E.
-lt's broken.
-Who says?
Mokelock.
Now, Edward,we agreed.
No more Mokelock.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelockwants me where l am.
We canfix it.
Edward.
Sing a song of sixpence.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketfull of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds.
Baked in a pie.
Rise and shine.
Mr. E is doingfine.
Did we go sailing?
Almost.
Mokelock showed up.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelockwants me where l am.
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.
Where'd he get Mokelock again?
Mother Goose.
-Henry.
-Barry.
What's the matter, Barry?
Edward's parents are here.
He needs a haircut.
He loves itwhen you visit.
My husband wonders if that's true.
He wants to place Edward in the hospital. l'm sorry, Catherine.
Mr. Baines... l've been working on this projectfor seven years. l know, Henry. l know.
Please don'ttake offense,
Dr. Kent.
Yourwork's invaluable to this company.
Butyou're not sure about me.
We've waited eighteen months for signs of progress.
There has been progress.
There's no proof, Catherine.
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines... l'm notthe one who designed the procedure. l mean, l wish l could take creditfor it, but l can't. l was chosen to do a job.
They picked me.
But if you think there's someone better... or someone who's more devoted to your son,then--
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.
What is it,then?
There's no proof, Catherine.
There's no proof the procedure works.
All you're giving me is the belief... thatyour interaction with my son... is not a... hallucination.
Shit! l better get backto work.
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.
-Thankyou.
-Thankyou, Mr. Baines.
Come, shall we? Lucien.
Lucky she worships you.
Why? Because he hates me? l wouldn't say ''hates.''
Distrusts, dislikes immensely... can't bearthe sight of.
What's the verdict?
Well,we've got another six months... and Barry had to pushforthat. l wantto reverse thefeed,
Miriam... now more than ever.
We've been through this a hundred times, Catherine. lt's too risky.
Why not?
What do we have to lose?
When l did social work, itwas always better... when we tookthe kids out of their environment.
Foster homes can be scary atfirst... but eventually they see thatthings can be different.
Edward is like that right now.
He--he's living in a world that is not healthy.
Let's show him a different place.
All right.
Let's say we do ityourway.
We reverse thefeed, and we bring Edward into your mind.
Can you imagine his shock when hefinds... that he's been thrust into this whole otherworld?
-l do it all the time.
-You're a willing participant.
You're aware of what's happening.
Edward's in a coma.
And besides,we don't know what effect itwill have on you. l mean, you're already exhausted.
-Have you been sleeping?
-Yes.
-Any more nightmares?
-No.
-No.
-Good.
Leave work here.
Don'ttake it home in this.
Hey,you.
What are you lookingfor, hmm?
Want some milk?
That'sfun. Let me try it.
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.
Edward, is thatyou?
Edward,were there seagulls being killed on the beach... while you were sailing?
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is thatyou?
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurtyou.
Edward, is thatyou?
Go to sleep.
Help!
Somebody, help me, please!
Somebody!
Help me!
Can you hear me?
Help!
Thanksforwaiting, Cole.
Teddy Lee, no problem.
Special Agent Ramsey.
-Cole.
-Morning.
Whofound her?
The surveyorforthe railroad, about 6:00 this morning.
Skidmarks appearto match the tire tracksfrom Reno.
And it looks like he scraped the rail and lost some paint. lt's on its way to the lab already.
Dumped the body overthere.
Bleach.
Anne Marie Vicksey.
She makes seven.
Jeez,this stinks.
Do they all look like dolls?
Every unfortunate soul.
What's that?
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.
The way he puts itthere?
He makes itforthem. lt makes himfeel they belong to him. ls the water always this low?
Yeah,this time of year.
Give me a coroner's report right away.
Preliminaryforensics,too. l don'twant anyone dragging their ass on this.
So, how was work?
Oh, exhausting. l have no idea,Jean.
For God's sake.
Good luckwith the monster. l love you,too. l gotta go.
-OK. Thanks. Bye.
-All right. Bye-bye.
Hot off the presses.
There's nothing new to report, gentlemen.
A match on his semen.
Water in her lungs... show high levels of chlorine and rust.
What, pray tell, is this?
They say theyfound some dog hair?
From a canine unit?
No. There was no canine unit.
And Anne Vicksey doesn't own a dog,Teddy. l wantto see this.
Whatyou got,Teddy?
Hypomelanosis.
And that means?
A complete absence of melanin.
The dog is an albino.
He'd love an animal like that.
Gentlemen... l believe an albino dog is a rare animal indeed.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You poor boy.
You're gonna be OK.
Baby, l'm so sorry.
Jesus Christ, Peter.
Thoughtyou were gonna get some sleep, clean yourself up. l did.
-They're waiting,you know.
-l'm ready.
Let's go.
We're gonna do this two ways.
Breeders of German shepherds.
Ford dealers. l wantyou to be thorough, and l also wantyou to befast.
This guy's accelerating.
He only waited six days this time.
When hefirst started, months could pass.
And that means one of two differentthings.
One, he thinks we're stupid, and we can't catch him.
Two,which is the one that l believe... he wants to be caught.
The dog hairthing is sloppy.
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey in three inches of water.
He knew thatwe'dfind her.
Now,there's one thing l knowfor certain. lf we can't stop him... he ain't gonna stop himself.
Will this be all right?
Yes, ma'am,that's great.
Thankyou very much.
She was still living at home, ma'am?
We were looking through apartments.
Butthey're not moving in together... until afterthe wedding.
Julia wants to be married.
Did she ever mention anything out of the ordinary?
For instance, somebody she was seeing mad... or somebody perhaps watching her orfollowing her?
Pardon me.
Ramsey.
What if you made a mistake?
Maybe this isn'tthe man.
Maybe Julia's safe.
There's certain things that he does... that make us pretty positive thatthis is the man.
Lastyear, l lost my husband to cancer. l wentthrough such terrible pain.
ButJulia, she was always therefor me.
What's going on, Gordon?
Riverside sherifffound a dog breeder in Woodcrest.
Three years ago, she had a buyer... for an albino shepherd pup.
Sheriff checks D.M.V.
Son of a bitch drives a '92ford pickup.
-Guess what color.
-Aquamarine.
Ramsey!
-Novak!
-Where is it?
Edison, just east of Loma Park.
S.W.A.T.'s had the house under surveillance... for abouttwenty minutes.
Carl Rudolph Stargher.
No registered weapons, no priors.
Got a licensefor his dog, though.
Named him Valentine.
You're the bad man, aren'tyou, Carl?
Mairzy doats and dozy doats
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey,too
Wouldn'tyou?
Brock,
Agent Ramsey,Agent Novak.
We got here asfast as we could. l briefed them on the way over.
Where do we stand?
Here's the situation.
We got a high-ground team on the roof... afour-man elementto the east.
We got an entry team in the van acrossfrom the house... a two man elementto the south.
Have you seen him yet?
No. There's been some movement in the kitchen.
Can'ttell what it is.
-You thinkthe girl's in there?
-We'll assume she is.
-FBl!
-Go!
Freeze, motherfucker! l gotthe dog!
-Clear.
-Clear.
They'll take him to County General.
Reid's already there.
Make sure he stays cuffed. l wanttwo men on him at all times. l don'twant anyone to treat him but Reid.
Not so much as a thermometer up his ass, understand?
She's not here.
You should come downstairs.
Mommy!
Please take care of my little baby!
Please, are you there?
Hello?
Please hear me.
Can you hear me? l need something. l need you...
Anybody here?
This is not happening to me.
This is definitely not happening.
Please help!
Have you ever heard of Whelan's infraction? lt's aform of schizophrenia. lt's very rare, and it's very severe. ln any schizophrenic... these areas would be affected... but in someone with Whelan's... they're hit hard, and they're hitfast.
Can'tyou load him up with thorazine or doxepin?
Normal psychotropics don'twork.
This thing is caused by a virus... that infects the neurological system in utero. lt lays dormant... until it's triggered by some kind of trauma.
Most likely, he's exhibited symptomsfor some time... butthe infraction, orthe breach... didn't occur until today.
The triggers can vary.
Uh, usually water-related, butthe results don'tvary.
He's notjust catatonic.
He's disappeared-- like having a dream and neverwaking up.
For how long?
Oh,forever.
Lee, l thinkwe might be missing the bigger picture here.
Now,whatever state that he happens to be in... there is a girl that is missing... and her name is Julia Hickson... and he is the only one that knows where she is.
He keeps them in this thing... for aboutforty hours.
Now, he tookJulia Hickson at 7:30 last night.
Peter,you know me. lf there were anything, anything...
What?
He provides them withfood... drinking water, and a toilet.
Now, she thinks she's been kidnapped... thatthere's a chance of survival... but it's just aform of torture.
This is a kind of ritual for him-- a cleansing before he takes them home... and turns them into a doll, a toy.
Now,this thing isfully automated... and unless wefind her by tonight... this will happen to her.
Atthe request of Mr. Cooperman... we've contacted your board of directors... and they've given their approval.
And so have Edward's parents.
Butthe decision is yours. lt's upto Catherine.
She's the one who would have toface... whatever risks there might be... so, l support whatever decision she makes.
Can l askyou something?
Please. lf he wasn't like this... if he was conscious... do you thinkthat he would tell you where she is?
There's always a chance of a confession. Yeah.
And there's things he's done that show a needfor disclosure.
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.
He wants someone to listen, to try and understand him.
Look, lfeelforthis girl, l do... but Stargher may no longer know the truth.
For severe schizophrenics... there's no discerning betweenfantasy and reality. ls it possible? lf he came to trust me,yes... but ittakes months to earn that kind of trust. ls it possible?
Daddy?
Come here... and save me! Save me! l'm daddy's girl.
His levels are tooflat.
What happened here?
We removedfourteen steel rings.
Should have left him the way he was.
He used to suspend himself, didn't he?
They're comforted by thefeeling of weightlessness... likefloating in water.
Now,this, gentlemen, is the catalyst.
The neurological connectic transfer system... not only maps the mind... it sends the signal to another party.
All you need to do is tune in... butyou do much more than tune in.
You become part of the show.
He's ready.
Why are there three stations?
For a while,we tried jointtherapy sessions-- two shrinks forthe price of one-- but Edward hated it and only talked to Catherine.
She has a gift.
Are you sure? l'm sure.
OK.
Response signal... functioning.
We implanted a touch-sensitive microchip in her hand... so if she wants to stopthe session... or if it gets too intense, she can give the signal... and we abort.
When we were ready for practical testing...
Miriam and l auditioned... some of the best child therapists in the country.
And all they did was observe and report, nothing more.
Catherine was the least experienced... but she came so highly recommended... thatwe decided,whatthe hell, we'll give her a shot... and immediately, we could tell she was different.
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.
You're an animal!
Hey,you.
Yeah,you like that, don'tyou? ls your name Carl?
You know, l know another little boy with a horse.
His name's Edward. l mean the boy, notthe horse.
What's wrong?
His victims.
Where you comefrom?
Gentlemen, she's back. l'll be rightthere.
All right. Come on, Catherine.
She's had quite a journey.
Unlike anything we've ever seen before.
-So she's made contact?
-Oh,yes.
She's gone very deep into his world.
Attimes toofar. lt's cold.
That can be dangerous.
What are you talking about?
Well, if she came to believe that Stargher's world is real... then theoretically, her mind could convince her body... that anything thatwas done to itthere... is actually done. lt's like the old wives' tale where you die in your dream... you die in real life.
Henry, could you raise the temperature in here, please?
-Dr. Kent?
-Just a moment, please.
Dr. Kent, can l come in there and speakwith you?
We have to be patient. l mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.
Let herwake up.
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?
Ourfather, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name.
Am l interrupting anything? ls it OK if l...
He knows you're here, doesn't he?
Myfriend Dr. Reid said... that it's very unusual-- schizophrenia,that is-- in a child that's this young.
They usually think it's autism.
Whatyou have to understand... is there's nothing wrong with his body.
What's paralyzed is a part of his mind. lt's so damaged by the virus... he can't even will himself to move.
You thinkyou can change that?
Do you believe there's a part of yourself... thatyou don't show anybody? l think everybody has that side of themselves.
During a session, when l'm inside... l getto see those things. lfeel them.
With Stargher, lfeltthings l neverwanttofeel again.
He's not even
Carl Stargher anymore.
He's this idealized version of himself-- a king in a very,very twisted kingdom.
The placefor him to indulge every...
You know, l don'twantto talk aboutthis in here. l could never do whatyou do-- devote myself to understanding a mind like that. l don'tthinkwe'll ever be able to understand a mind like that.
Butyou try. That's yourjob. l guess so.
You don't like whatyou do? l like it better than my old job.
Used to be an attorney. l was a prosecutor.
What happened? l had a case, um... where this little girl was molested.
And because of this one tiny piece of evidence... thatwas tainted, he walked.
Uh, Charles Gish walked away.
Nothing l could do about it.
The night after he was released...
Margaret's parents came home-- thatwas the little girl's name--
Margaret Sims.
And theyfound Charles Gish sitting in their living room.
He was watching television... and Margaret was sitting nextto him... and he had cut her open right down the middle.
The parentsfound
Margaret's heart in thefreezer.
Charlesfigured they'd probably wantto keep it.
Afterthat, l leftthe D.A... and joined the FBl.
Figured l'd justtry to catch 'em.
Till now.
You know, l started to tell you... that Stargher really isn't Stargher anymore.
Well,that's true, and it's not.
The dominant side is still this horrible thing... butthere's a positive side that--
Positive side?
Well,the way he sees himself as a child.
But isn'tthat him?
The boy Stargher made contact.
He's curious about me. lf l could reach the boy... then maybe he'd tell me aboutJulia.
Whatever happened to Charles Gish?
Old Charlie beatthe murder rap... because he was insane when he killed Margaret.
His attorney milked the jury for all they were worth.
Said that a life of sexual abuse drove him to do these things... and,you know, whateverthefuck.
All that same old bullshit.
Why is that bullshit? l believe a child can experience... a hundred times worse the abuse than what Gish wentthrough... and still grow upto be... somebody thatwould never, ever, ever hurt another living being.
And you're sure of that?
Yes, l am. l'm sure of that.
Hey,where the hell you been? l've been right here.
Well, nexttime tell me, OK? l didn'twantto disturbyou.
You looked so cute,you know?
You're all sleeping when you get that look on you.
Your colleagues wantto know whatto do with Stargher.
Tell them to prep him. l'll be rightthere.
Thankyou, Catherine.
Stargher have any pets?
You know, cats, dogs...
Yeah,you're a good boy, aren'tyou,Valentine?
That's supposed to help?
On a subconscious level,yes.
Anything thatwas special to
Stargher, gave him pleasure... should make him more accessible... more peaceful.
Peaceful?
Nice little pup.
-Mr. Novak.
-Doctor.
Thankyou.
Round two.
Hey, notfunny.
Come on, stop playing around. l'm not. lt's a power problem.
We're locked out, Catherine. l--l need you to check the circuit breaker. l wantyou to check circuits six through twelve.
Come on.
Get up.
Six through twelve. l'm already in.
What did she say?
Come here, boy.
Can you take me to Carl?
Need some help? l've got a presentforyou. lf you need me... or if youfeel like l'm around butyou can'tfind me... just...
Shine it like this.
Go ahead,take it.
You like it?
-Carl?
-What's the matter?
What?
What's wrong?
What happened over here?
Just broke all by itself.
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.
Well, hey, let's...
Let's break 'em all, how aboutthat?
You littlefucking liar! l should've drowned you like the runt of the litter.
You don't lie in my house.
This is my house!
-He's just a boy.
-Shut up!
You're not his mother!
She's notyour mother.
She left us, Carl.
Rememberthat.
See that?
Wait. Jesus Christ!
Whatthefuck is this?
Get back--Get over here!
Playing with dolls?
You littlefaggot!
God!
What are you, some kind of a woman?
-Get up!
-But, dad--
Damn it.
You want something to cry about? l'll give you something to cry about,woman!
Mama's boy! l didn't raise nofaggot!
Stopyour crying.
You wantto iron like a woman?
-Let me show you how to iron.
-No!
Help me.
See?
She was myfirst. l made such a mess.
Now what l have to do...
Why are you here?
Don't lie.
-l came to helpyou.
-You're lying.
Bitch.
Whore.
Cunt!
You sound like yourfather.
He was nothing.
He is nothing.
Who told you to say that?
Do you rememberthefirsttime he talked to you?
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming. ltwas my baptism.
Myfather, he... he pushed me under. l think l had some kind of seizure. l think l was drowning... and everybody just looked at me.
Nobody helped me. Nobody.
Except him.
Myfather... he took me home that night... and he broke three of my ribs... andfractured my jaw. l was six years old.
Whatyourfather did to you is evil.
What he did to you was wrong.
He treated you like a thing.
He was more... powerful than me.
No. No one should be treated like that. ls that right? ln whatworld do you live in?
Carl,where is Julia Hickson?
No names.
Where is she? l know you, Carl.
You wantto tell me.
Oh,you know me?
Oh,you know who l am?
Where is she?
Where's Julia?
That can't be right.
Danger pulse.
-No change.
-Christ.
What about emergency cessation?
Gradually terminate thefeed, disable the receptors-- lt could lead to massive shock... and, Henry, could you please shutthatthing off?
What's going on?
That hypothetical situation l told you about?
-lt's happening.
-Can'tyou stop it? lt's notthat simple.
Well,you stopped it before--
Yes,thatwas different.
Thatwas Edward.
With Stargher, his mind is unfamiliarterritory... and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.
Well, is there anything thatwe can do?
Whateverwe do runs the risk of making things worsefor her.
Worse. That's great.
So she's lost somewhere?
-No. No.
-No,what? l need you here.
Fucking stop! Stop!
Let me thefuck out!
Let me out!
Get me out,you sickfuck!
Fuckyou!
Let me out.
Do something.
Do something to end this. l got bugs crawling all over my body. lt gets worse.
You're completely unprepared forthis.
Ah, Dr. Kent, we've been over all this.
Yes, but l've been through the process.
She wentthrough the process, too, and it didn't matter.
You don't know him.
Be lucky.
Come on, guys.
Ready?
Peter,thefirstfew minutes... will be very disorienting.
Rememberto stay calm andfocused. lnstincts play a very important part here, so trustthem.
All right.
Peter,you've read herfile.
Hit herwith something personal.
And remember, Peter... it's not real.
Have you seen him? My boy?
My little one?
Hisfathertook himfrom me. l spit it out my hole.
Big deal. don't mean anything.
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul. ls thatyou?
You all right?
Hold me.
This isn't real.
Did daddy do a bad thing?
Don't be scared.
This isn't real.
Naughty worm. l'll kill you!
Fuckyou, motherfucker!
Catherine, wake thefuck up, now!
Mairzy doats and dozy doats
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey,too
Wouldn'tyou?
When you were in college...
Your baby brother had a car accident!
He was in a comafor six months before he died!
And l'm sorryfor saying that!
Butyou gotta wake up!
God! lt's not real.
This is not real!
This is not real!
Not real! lt's OK.
Whatthefuck happened?
Where are we?
Oh, my God. ls this where he keeps them?
No, it's OK.
Don't be scared. l will never hurtyou. l'm yourfriend.
And Peter--he's afriend,too.
Do you know where this place is?
Like on a map? l am so proud of you.
Even if Peter doesn'tfind Julia... l promise l will come back and helpyou.
-What are you doing?
-Let's go. lt's over. l know how tofind Julia. l just can't leave him here!
God damn it, Catherine, let's go!
-Carl!
-l know how tofind her.
-Let's go!
-l'll come backforyou, Carl! l promise that l'll come back!
Catherine,we gotta go now!
-That means he's back.
-How's Catherine?
Take it easy, Peter. ls she OK?
Take it easy, Peter.
Just breathe.
-ls she OK?
-Yeah, l think she is.
Can you get me out of thisfucking suit?
Yeah, Cole here.
-Cole, it's Novak.
-Yeah,what's up? l wantyou to go down to the basement... at Stargher's workplace and call me when you get down there.
They haven'tfinished building the grid yet.
Fuckthe grid!
Call me when you get down there.
-You OK, Pete?
-l'mfine.
You wantto tell me what happened in there?
You in pain?
-What happened, Peter?
-l saw her.
-Who did you see?
-l know where tofind her.
-Who?
-Julia. l saw her.
OK. Why don'tyou come and let Dr. Kent have a look atyou?
-Cole?
-Yeah,this is Cole.
Now,what am l doing down here?
That machine that he uses-- there's a hoist. l wantyou to look for a plaque... or a metal plate with some sort of logo on it.
Yeah, l got it. lt's Carver industrial equipment... in Bakersfield, California. l wantyou tofind out every goddamn thing... thatyou can aboutthat machine-- who used it,who sold it, who bought it.
Justfind out everything you can. l'll call youfrom the chopper in abouttwenty minutes.
All right, let me have a look.
Good.
The FBl has leftthe building.
What? l haven't had a chance to clear Novak!
What did you expect me to do?
There's no way l could stopthem.
Go.
-l'm OK.
-Are you sure?
Let me have a look.
-All right.
-OK.
Peter,justtalk.
What if your mind is playing tricks on you?
They shotyou full of drugs, Peter.
Who knows if whatyou saw is real?
Catherine, open this door.
-l promise...
-What are you doing? l'm gonna helpyou.
Stop.
Do notjeopardize your career.
Stop! lt's dangerous.
What are you doing?
-Miriam.
-What's she doing?
-You know what she's doing.
-For Christ's sake.
Jesus!
-She changed the codes.
-You can't get in withoutthem?
-She reversed thefeeds.
-What does that mean?
The process is intended for herto go into his mind.
But instead, she's bringing him into hers.
Stop! No more! l promised l'd come back and helpyou.
See? l always keep my promises.
Can l stay here... with you?
Oh...no, honey, l'm sorry. lt doesn'tworkthatway.
There's nothing l can do aboutthat.
Yes,there is.
When l was a little boy... lfound this bird.
He was injured and... had a broken leg or something.
Well, myfather found outthat l had it.
And l knew that he would do something horrible to it. ltwas just a matter of time.
So l took itto the sink, and l--l held it under. ltwas betterforthe bird. l saved him. l can't do that, Carl. l won't. lt doesn't matter. ltfound me. lt alwaysfinds me.
Agent Novak? Go ahead.
-Cole?
-Novak, listen to this.
The hoistwas sold to a guy named Bainbridge... who tried to build a machine works out near Delano.
Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court... and the state winds up with the land.
And guess who they hire to seal the place up.
Aw,you'refuckin' kiddin' me.
No. l'm notthe kidding type.
Carl Rudolph Stargher.
-Where's the land?
-Exit 10, off highway 99.
-We're on ourway now.
-Got it. l know where that is.
Help! Help me!
This is the area.
My world... my rules.
Help!
Do it. lt's not real.
Me got boy.
Boy me got.
There's simply no way to shield against every weaponized agent.
Instead, I can make super-immune systems... by strengthening the human cellular response.
Banner, I know where you're going.
But manipulating the immune system is dangerous and stupid.
The president's science advisors made it absolutely clear... no human subjects.
David, I have wonderful news.
I'm gonna have a baby.
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?
Let's have a little fight.
You don't scare me.
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.
Really, speaking of Cheryl, guess what...
Bruce, you're hurt!
Jack hit him with the stick, but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.
He just stood there, shaking.
It's okay.
Yeah, strange he didn't make a peep.
Any other kid would've wailed his head off.
That's Bruce. He's like that.
He's just so... bottled up.
The samples we found in your lab... they were human blood.
You've ignored protocol.
You had no right snooping around in my lab.
That's my business.
Wrong, Banner.  It's government business, and you're off the project.
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.
Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes!
Evacuate immediately!
I repeat, evacuate immediately!
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to tell you what has to be done!
David, please stop it!
No!
No! No!
Yes!
David! No!
Bruce.
Bruce, wake up, son.
Bruce. Bruce.
Another nightmare?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Hi, Mom.
Already off to college.
Gonna miss you terribly.
I'll miss you too.
Please, come here.
Look at you.
Soon to be a great scientist.
I guess.
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.
There's something inside you... so special.
Some kind of greatness.
I'm sure someday you're gonna... share it with the whole world.
But as far as I'm concerned, security oughta be...
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.
Security oughta be beefed up.  In a place like this you can't be too careful
Bruce!  Big day.
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.
I really gotta say, seeing you in that stylin' head wear...
You're implying something about my helmet?
You look like a massive nerd, even around other scientists.
Can I just ask... Were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you?
See, it protects my very important brain, Harper.
Go prep the samples.
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.
I hate them.
-Wait, I just got here.  Who do we hate?
-The review board.
We have to make a presentation on Tuesday.
And you're gonna make it with me.
You think I should?
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.
You start talking about microbes and nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate
I'm sorry.
That was rude.
Look, nobody expects this to be easy, us working together after being... so close.
We were close?
Look, if I could be more... whatever, you know...
- I'm... just...
- Don't.
It's not your fault, really.
You're just a by-product... of my inexplicable obsession with emotionally distant men.
I'll get over us.
Good for you.
Anyway, I'm just really stressed about this review.
If we don't get impressive results today, we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.
Well, then, let's go be impressive.
Harper?
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.
Are we passing inspection?
Safeties all going green.
Countdown's started.
Nanomeds released.
Four seconds.
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.
Okay, let's hit Freddie with the gamma radiation.
Gamma exposure.
Nanomeds now active.
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.
It's working.
Cell copy to disassemble ratio holding within one percent.
Imbalanced nanomed activity.
You wanna go to the review board on Monday and tell 'em... we've developed a brand-new method for exploding frogs?
Yeah, I think maybe there's a market for it.
I mean, what if there's a plague?
What have you had, Betty, like, one beer?
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know, frogs start falling from the sky, who do they come to?
We'd be world-renowned.
Make any parents proud.
I bet they would be.
They actually did want me to be a scientist.
I mean, your birth parents.
Guess we'll never know.
I don't understand why you don't want to find out about them.
They're dead.  They died before
I can remember anything.
Why do you always come back to this?
Don't know.
I guess I figure there's more to you than you like to show.
I guess there couldn't be any less
Right. So now we come full circle back to that.
Nice work, Betty.
Betty.
- Glen.
- Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
What happened to your uniform?
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.
I'm still working with your father, but...
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting out all the most interesting work, and...
Can't argue with a paycheck.
I basically run all the labs on the base now.
Oh.
Hey, you're uh... you're looking good.
You're the genetics expert.
Ah, the good old college days.
So, how's business?
What do you want?
All right, I'll cut to the chase.
I've been hearing interesting things about what you guys are doing here
Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications.
How would you like to come work for Atheon?
Get paid 10 times as much as you earn now... and own a piece of the patents.
You just have to say the word.
Two words: The door.
General?
Come in.
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for acquisition and removal to desert base
Why isn't it going through N.S.C.?
It, uh, concerns your daughter, sir.
Hi. Sorry.
Hey, what happened to Benny?  Is he not working the night shift anymore?
Benny's dead.
I'm the new guy.
Oh.
Good to meet you.
Same.
- Let's try another.
Mmm, no. Stay here.
I look tired anyway.
Yeah, but you look great.
What's the matter?
It's these dreams, Doctor.
I keep having them, and they're terrible.
Tell me about your dream.
Well, it starts... it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.
It's this image I have... from when I was maybe two years old.
Do you think it's just a dream?
No, I think it's something that happened... when I was living at a desert base with my father.
Anyhow, the dream goes on and... suddenly I'm alone.
That's terrible.
You know I'd never hurt you.
Hey there.
What's your name, darlin'?
Eh? What's your name?
Okay.
It's okay.
I gotta talk to you, Edith.
Bruce, stay here!
"C... T... G...
A... G."
Bruce.
My Bruce.
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.
What's he doing here?
You know, Dr. Krenzler, you and I have never had the chance to get to know each other properly.
Well, that's because I don't want to get to know you, properly or improperly.
So leave.
Hey, no worries.
Let me give you a little heads-up.
There is a hairsbreadth between friendly offer... and hostile takeover.
I've done my homework.  The work you're doing here is dynamite.
Think: Gls embedded with technology... that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield... in our sole possession.
That's a hell of a business.
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book... and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.
In the meantime, Bruce, you will be hearing from me.
About Glen, I, um...
There's nothing to talk about.
Okay.
I just wanted to say, don't worry about him... I'll handle it.
How?
I'm gonna call my father, ask him to exert some pressure.
Last I heard, you and your father weren't speaking.
Hmm.
Well...
I guess now I have something to talk with him about.
I think this circuit's kinda fried.
I don't know.  Maybe you anna come take a look at it
Okay, I'll be right there.
Aah!
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!
Harper, get out!
Get out!
How's Harper?
He's all right.
You saved him.
I don't think he's coming back to the lab for a while, though.
I don't understand how this is possible.
You should be dead.
They worked... the nanomeds.
I mean, I feel great.
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.
Bruce, they've killed everything else that they've come into contact with.
Are you sure the doctor checked?
The doctor gave me the full workup.
He wants to know where he can get what I'm taking.
I'm a hundred percent.
More.
What do you mean?
Remember my bad knee?
Well, now it's my good knee.
Bruce, this isn't funny.
I was watching you.
You were gonna die, and I was gonna have to watch you die.
Betty...
I'm sorry.
Really.
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?
Yeah.
You should get some rest.
And I'm fine. Really.
I've never felt better.
Your name is not Krenzler.
It's Banner.
- What?
- Your name... it's Banner.
Bruce Banner.
Bruce.
How did you get in here?
I work here now.
In the labs.
The late shift.
It keeps me close to you.
You always work so late yourself with your friend Miss Ross.
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.
You're not well.
You've had a terrible accident.
You're wondering why you're still alive.
You're thinking there's something inside.
Something different... inexplicable.
I can help you understand, if you'll let me.
If you'll... forgive me.
Look, mister, I'm sure I have nothing to forgive you for.
So perhaps you should leave now.
I'll be fine.
You must know.
You may not want to believe it, but I can see it in your eyes.
So much like your mother's.
Of course, you're my flesh and blood.
But then, you're something else too, aren't you?
My physical son, but the child of my mind too.
No.
You're lying.
My parents died when I was a small boy.
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.
The experiments, the accident... all top secret.
They put me away for 30 years.
Thirty years!
Away from you.
Away from our work.
But they couldn't keep me forever.
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.
You see, everything... your extraordinary mind... has been seeking all these years... it's been inside you.
Now we will understand it.
We will harness it.
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.
There's something you need to know about her, Bruce. Something troublesome
Let me protect you from her.
No. Get out.
- Bruce...
- Get out!
Sit!
We're gonna have to watch that temper of yours.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed
Got a message from my father.
He's coming to see me.
Your father?
When?
Lands in about an hour.
The funny thing is, he called me.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.  Sir?
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.
It's about Glen, isn't it?
He's been snooping around my lab.
Glen noticed some things, asked me to make some inquiries.
Are you here to... question me?
No.
We've turned up some surprising things.
This Krenzler you work with... you know who he really is?
How much do you actually know about him?
I think the question is, what is it that you know about him?
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right
You know,
I think I was hoping that... maybe this time you just... honestly wanted to see me again.
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?
Yes. I do want to see you.
I really wishthat I could believe you.
Everything... your extraordinary mind has been seeking... all these years, it's been inside you.
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.
Please leave a message and I'll call you right back.
Bruce, hey. Are you there?
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.
My father... It's like he suspects you of something. I don't know.
- I was so impatient, like always.
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...
I just think that they're planning something with the lab.
So, um, uh...
Call me. Okay?
Bye.
- Betty?
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!
Watch out!
Edith?
David, what's going on?
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.
My Bruce.
Bruce?
There was some sort of explosion.
They wouldn't let us into the building.
I was worried about you.
Well, I'm okay.
What happened to you last night?
I had the most vivid dream.
It was like being born.
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.
Screaming.
My heartbeat... it was, like, boom... boom... boom.
Were you at the lab?
No.
But something...
And there was that man.
The one with the dogs.
Who?
That new janitor.
He said he was my father.
I'll get it.
My father.
My, my.
So this is the young Bruce Ban...
Krenzler.
I think you left something in your lab last night.
Mitchell.
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.
I'd rather stay here.
Now, Betty.
It's okay.
I'll be fine.
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.
- What?
- Your friend in there.
There's a good chance he's caught up in some very bad business.
Unfinished business.
And I promise you, I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.
But as of right now, he is incommunicado.
And for the next few days at least, you're gonna stay away from here.
For your own good.
Okay, and that's for the new guy on the night shift, right?
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Dr. Ross.
How unexpected.
Please come in.
I'm sorry to just show up at your house like this.
Uh...
I came to ask you something that...
I really have no business asking
He told you?
He said you talked to him.
Oh.
Please sit down.
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.
But he can't remember much about it
I need to find out what happened.
So, you want to know, uh, what's wrong with him... so you can fix him?
Cure him, change him.
My father's with the military.
He seems to think he's involved in some kind of threat to national security
Mmm.
Your father. Ross.
You brought your father down upon his head?
How little you understand,
Miss Ross, and how dangerous your ignorance has become.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
My son is... unique.
That's why you can't relate to him.
And because he is unique, the world will not tolerate his existence.
Will they?
But you... you try, don't you?
Yes.
And a very beautiful woman like you, your attentions... can't be completely unwanted.
Can they?
No.
Not with eyes like yours, watching expectantly, lovingly.
But I'm afraid we're both too late to help him.
There's nothing
I can do for him... or for you.
Besides, he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me.
His choice.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.
And don't worry about the dogs.
You'll be fine.
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.
Good-bye.
He gets released, and a month later your lab is destroyed.
What a coincidence.
So you're not gonna tell me where he is, are ya?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?
- Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.
- Let's cut the crap.
I'm the guy who had your father tossed away, and a lot more like him, and I'll do the same with you if I feel so disposed. You understand?
If you had him tossed away, then why are you asking me?
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.
Don't play with me!
You were four years old when you saw it.
When I saw what?
You were right there.  How could anyone forget a thing like that?
What?
Oh, some more repressed memories.
Just tell me.
I'm sorry, son.
You're an even more screwed-up mess than I thought you'd be.
Until we get to the bottom of this, your lab has been declared a top-secret military site... and you're not gonna get a security clearance to get back into it... or any other lab that's doing anything more interesting than... trying to figure out the next generation of herbal hair gel.
One more thing.
If you ever... come within a thousand yards of my daughter again,
I'll put you away for the rest of your natural life.
Dogs!
Go! Go get her!
And let nothing stand in your way!
Go!
Hello?
Bruce?
So, they think they can just throw you away as they did me.
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?
I got a visit today.
A very unwelcome visit.
I'm afraid my hand is being forced
What did you do to me?
You so much want to know, don't you?
But I think no explanation will serve you half as well... as the experience.
In any case, I still don't quite understand it myself.
If they'd only let me work in peace...
Of course, my betters would have none of that.
So you experimented on yourself, didn't you?
And passed on to me... what?
An alteration. Genetic.
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.
But an amazing strength too.
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.
No.
You'll do no such thing.
I will isolate it and treat it myself.
I'll remove it and I'll kill it before it does any real harm.
I'll bet you and your Betty would love to destroy it.
But would you really destroy part of yourself?
I don't think so.
And as for Betty,
I'm sending her a surprise visit... from some four-legged friends of mine.
You see, I managed to culture some of your very own DNA, Bruce, and the results are tremendous.
They're unstable, but very powerful.
What about my DNA?
Let's just wait and see what Betty makes of the results, huh?
No. You're crazy.
I won't let you.
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.
Listen, my father's going after Betty...
What makes you think you can go behind my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!
You pathetic freak.
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.
I can state the obvious.
Something tells me you aren't in much of a position to be making stupid threats to anyone
- Talbot.
- Yeah?
You're making me angry.
Oh, am I?
Ohh! Oh!
I got him! Open fire!
Bruce?
He sent these dogs, didn't he?
But I killed them!
My God.
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.
But we've never seen any effect like this before.
No. Deeper.
The gamma just unleashed what was already there.
Unleashed what?
Me.
It.
It's okay.
Shh. It's okay.
What were those animals?
My father sent them.
He is my father.
He wanted me to change.
He wanted me to change into that mindless hulk.
Why would he want that?
Can you remember anything?
Is there anything from when you were changed?
It was like a dream.
About what?
Rage.
Power.
And freedom.
Hello? Sir.
- Hello.
- Dad?
Betty! Are you all right?
I'm scared.
I need your help.
Where are you?
How are you?
Okay, I guess.
I think that somehow... your anger is triggering the nanomeds.
How could it?  We designed them to respond to physical damage.
Emotional damage can manifest physically.
Like what?
Serious trauma.
Repressed memories.
Your father grilled me about something that happened to me from early childhood... that I'm supposed to remember.
He did?
It sounded bad, but... I honestly don't remember.
The thing that worries me... is... a physical wound is finite, but with emotions, what's to say it won't just go on and on... and start a chain reaction?
You know what scares me the most?
When it happens, when it comes over me... and I totally lose control,
I like it.
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.
Target down.
Target secure.
I'm going to take you someplace safe
Okay? Bruce?
Bruce?
Bruce?
Clear!
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.
We're buried out here in the middle of nowhere.
How long are you gonna keep him sedated?
For the rest of his natural life, if I have to.
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.
You can trust me to do what I think is right, not what you think you want
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.
Suppose he gets out, has one of his little mood swings... in a populated area.
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.
I'm indebted to him for that.
He also put three men in a hospital, and Talbot's barely walking!
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.
He is his father's son, every last molecule of him.
He says he doesn't know his father but he's workin'in the same exact goddamn field his father did.
So either he's lyin'... or it's somethin' worse, and he's...
What?
Predestined to follow in his father's footsteps?
I was gonna say "damned."
Of course you were.
But I'm a scientist.
As a scientist, I believe we can figure this out and he can be helped.
I know you do.
Look, whether you know or care,
I've got a lot of pride in what you've done.
But this is too big for you.
Look, I know the government thinks they have a weapon on their hands.
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.
They can probe and prod all they want, and in the meanwhile, just let me try to help him.
Nobody knows him better than I do
What did David Banner do to him?
Cover left!
Clear left.
Cover right!
What's happening here?
My hand.
You see, the strength of my son's DNA... combined with nanomed reconstruction...
You see, I can partake with the essences of all things.
Gonna have to ask you to... put your hands up, pal, okay?
Nice and easy.
Do you really believe... that I am separate from you?
Whoa!
Where am I?
You're home.
It's hard to believe we used to live here.
I must have seen you or known you.
If only I could remember.
This is my old house, isn't it?
Let's go.
Please try.
What is it?
Nothing.
Really?
Damn it.
Okay, Betty... what do you want to know?
What was in that room?
What are you afraid that I'll see?
See? There's nothing.
It's empty.
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?
NSA has decided to turn over study of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.
But you're head of the base.
I thought you were in charge.
But I don't set policy, and I still take orders.
I can't believe Talbot would go around me like this!
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people that want in on this.
And money to be made... lots of it.
You know the worst part about all this?
When I had David Banner locked up and sent that kid away,
I didn't give that boy a second thought; he was just collateral damage.
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?
What can I do?
You can go home now.
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye, but I've already been informed... that for now all further contact is out of the question.
Right.
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?
What do you want?
That's a good question.
See, I need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals.
You know, so you can turn a little green for me again... and I can carve off a piece of the real you, analyze it, patent it, make a fortune.
Do you mind?
I'll never let you.
I'm not sure you've got much of a choice.
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?
After all, you've only got me to play with now that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley
You're lying.
You know, for me this is a win-win situation.
You turn green, and all these guys come in and kill you... and I perform the autopsy.
You don't...
And I mop the floor with you... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck.
Bad science, maybe... but personally gratifying.
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.
Never.
You know, consciously you may control it, but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.
All right, let's jump-start those brain waves.
Bruce.
- My dear Miss Ross.
Welcome back.
There are two guards right outside.
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.
What do you want?
It's over for me now.
I know that.
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.
That's why I've come to you... to ask you if you could persuade your father, as a man, as a father himself, that if I turn myself in now, peacefully... and before he puts me away forever, that he would let me see my son... for one last time.
Could you do that for me?
It's out of my father's hands now.
I understand.
He's a puppet now.
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.
You should blame yourself for what you've done to your son.
And what have I done to my son, Miss Ross?
Nothing. I tried to improve on the limits in myself.
Myself! Not him!
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!
It's the only path to the truth... that give men the power to go beyond God's boundaries!
You know what's beyond your boundaries? Other people.
All you've given Bruce is fear.
Fear of life.
Fear?
Perhaps, Miss Ross.
And loneliness too.
Yes... I feel them both.
But I have lived... completely once.
I was so much in love, and she so much wanted a baby.
My baby.
I could tell from the moment she conceived... that it wasn't a son
I had given her... but something else.
A monster, maybe.
I should have put a stop to it right then, but I was curious and that was my downfall.
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,
I began to imagine the horror of it, and my curiosity was replaced... with compassion.
But they took away my chance to cure him.
Your father threw me out.
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well... every moment, every sensation... walking into the house, the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand.
I knew I was doing a father's work, fulfilling a father's mercy.
David, please stop it! No!
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!
But then she surprised me.
- No! No!
David, no!
It was as if... she and the knife... merged.
No!
You cannot imagine... the unbearable finality of it.
And in that one moment...
I took everything that was dear to me... and transformed it into nothing more... than a memory.
Bingo! That must be some jumbo nightmare he just had.
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.
Sir, negative on drill penetration.
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!
-Should I neutralize?
-No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on
- All right, put him to sleep.
It's not stopping him!
Ready room, send in our containment team.
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.
I must have a sample of him.
Sir!
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.
Deploy containment foam.
Talbot, talk to me.
Under control, General. I'll let you know if we need you.
Unacceptable.  Unseat your asses down here immediately.
I want a full-court evacuation now.
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.
-Didn't you hear what the general said?
-I said lockdown!
Clear! I need a sample of him!
Take it easy there, buddy.
This might give you a bit of a sting here, Bruce.
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.
Clear!
Lockdown the entire facility immediately
Target's still moving towards blue level
- Evacuate the main hall.
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.
Set firing lines left and right!
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.
Data's on backup power supply.
Incoming!
-Shut down all power to the main hall
-Sir?
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!
Clear back! Clear back!
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.
Let's have it, General.
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting a National Command Authority override.
Angry Man is unsecure.
I need everything we have at my disposal in order to stop his movement.
You're expecting civilian casualties, General?
Not if I can help it, ma'am.
Consider it done.  Keep us posted.
Contact Goodman Control.
Patch data to the assets.
Contact H.Q.
Have them initiate an immediate evacuation... in vicinity of grid coordinates
Confirm that the area has been cleared.
Confirm area cleared.
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.
I want this target stopped in his tracks.
Jesus.
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR respond to our 20 ASAP.
We're okay, but, damn it, get him off us before he tears us apart!
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?
Watch it, Tango Flight.
Break left! Break left!
Tango Three, pull back and set up for a Hellfire shot.
Hold your fire till we draw him off.
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.
Engage at will.
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.
Holy shit! He's got my missile!
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!
Give me a head count.
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.
Our kite's busted up, but we're okay.
Tango Flight, do you have eyes on the target?
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.
Damn!
I've got it.
It appears he's heading home.
Launch fast movers.
Have them intercept and engage.
Hello?
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way... and probably right for you.
How far from the base are you?
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.
I think I can come back around for a gun attack.
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!
Okay, you've got him now. Take him on a ride to the top of the world.
Let's see what the thin air will do for him.
Initiating afterburner.
I'm passing flight level 600.
This is out of my envelope.
Hang in there, Legend.
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.
He'll lose consciousness before you.
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!
Puny human.
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.
Let's not take any chances.
You are cleared to fire on target, Legend.
- Dad?
- Betty?
We don't have a choice.
I have to destroy him.
But you can't.  You will only fuel his rage, and you will make him stronger
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.
Then let me go to him.
Please.
Just give him a chance to calm down
This area has been declared restricted airspace.
All aircraft are ordered to clear the airspace immediately.
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.
Repeat, waiting your orders to engage.
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.
All units, hold your fire.
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have direct orders to hold your fire.
I repeat, hold your fire.
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.
Go go, go, go, go, go!
Hold your fire until my command!
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.
You found me.
You weren't that hard to find.
Yes, I was.
Let's take a walk.
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base... until we get the final word from C-3 on how to dispose of him.
In the meantime, ifhe does anything but sit there in that chair, we're gonna turn on the juice and he'll be incinerated immediately.
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.
If we deploy the electromagnetic array, there should be no collateral damage.
Here they come!
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.
But one way or another, we're gonna have to prepare for the worst.
I should have killed you.
And I should have killed you.
I wish you had.
I saw her last night.
Saw her face.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
She smiled at me.
She reached down and kissed my cheek
I can almost remember a smell.
Almost like desert flowers.
Her favorite perfume.
It's my mother, and I don't even know her name.
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.
Go ahead and cry.
Cry. Crying will do you good.
Don't touch me!
Maybe once you were my father, but you're not now and you never will be.
Oh, is that so?
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.
I came here to see my son.
My real son.
The one inside of you.
You're nothing but a superficial shell, a husk of flimsy consciousness... ready to be torn off at a moment's notice.
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.
For me.
My cells can transform too, absorb enormous amounts of energy.
But, unlike you, they're unstable.
Son, I need your strength.
I gave you life.
Now you must give it back to me!
Only a million times more radiant, more powerful!
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?
Stop what?
Think about all those men out there in their uniforms... barking and swallowing orders, inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe!
Think of all the harm they've done!
To you! To me!
To humanity!
And know this... that we can make them... and their flags and their anthems and their governments... disappear in a flash!
You in me.
I'd rather die.
Oh, that's your answer?
Then indeed you shall die... and be reborn... a hero... of the kind that walked the earth... long before the pale religions of civilization... infected humanity's soul!
Go!
Stop your bawling, you weak little speck of human trash.
All right... I'll go!
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.
- Hit it again!
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some kind of counter-electromagnetic field.
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!
Move, move, move!
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.
Call up the task force.
Yes!
That's right. Keep fighting.
The more you fight, the more of you I take.
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there.
But simultaneous radiological activity.
They're absorbing all the ambient energy.
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.
Struggle no more... and give me all of your power.
You think you can live with it? Take it!
Take it all!
Oh, yes! Yes!
Take it back!
It's not stopping!
Take it back!
Gentlemen... release.
Gamma charge away.
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.
Look, Betty... you and I... well, we both know that Bruce couldn't have survived that blast.
But... well, you know...
- What is it?
- Well, you know.
The usual loonies.  Seein' things.
Only now everything's green.
Right.
Look, uh... if by some chance he did survive... and he should try to contact you, try to get in touch, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
No... I wouldn't.
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.
I mean, my phones are bugged, my computer's tapped.
I'm under surveillance.
I'll tell you, though, that if he were alive,
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to... because... as much as I miss him,
I... I... loved him.
I, um...
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Betty.
I am so sorry.
I know you are.
Si.
Let's take a walk.

Stare at this for a while, you ugly bastard.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking the specimen.
No. I haven't prepped the chamber.
I don't want him frozen.
I want him soft.
We've already discussed this.
I had to go over your head.
I'm moving him to our Scranton Facility.
You can't risk taking him through open country.
This isn't open for discussion.
His unique ability to regenerate
Iost and damaged tissue.
It just cries out for more research.
You'll risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes.
Yes.
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine.
-Sergeant?
-Everything's under control, ma'am.
-Dr. Wimmer, please.
-He's no longer your problem.
Can we get that rag off him?
What the hell?
Oh, my God!
Get out of here.
What happened?
I'm sorry.
Cryogenic breach.
Emergency lock-down.
Oh, God, no!
No.
Kay-Em?
No viruses, no bacteria.
No toxins. It's clean.
-It's still cold.
-Wow.
What is that?
It's like a big kind kind of frozen storage thing?
Probably a cryostasis unit.
I'd guess early Port series.
Quadroport 11.
Manufactured in 2010.
Precise historic records are inconsistent.
Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?
Open it up.
-What the hell is that?
-Humanoid.
Organic composition is unclear.
What's on his face?
Some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit?
It's a hockey mask.
Very good, Tsunaron.
-What's a hockey mask?
-Facial armor
Used in a sport outlawed in 2024.
Amazing.
Absolute museum-quality.
Are you paying attention,
Azrael?
Yeah.
Well, don't touch anything.
Guys.
We got another body here.
Kay-Em?
She's pertectly preserved.
Cell Crystallization is at 25 percent.
25 percent?
Suggest nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction.
Wait... Wait a minute, are you...
...are you saying that...
-...we can bring her back to life?
-Yes.
But she is deteriorating.
Opening the door has compromised her hibernation.
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.
Copy that, ready in five.
Not five, now.
What the...?
Look out!
55 cc's of etherene. You'll be fine.
Fine? I'm missing my arm!
Oh, you're so pretty.
-Are the doors secure?
-Locked and blocked.
Beautiful.
Lift off in three, two...
Yeah!
I love this part.
-What'd you find?
-You won't believe it.
Get the sarge on the horn.
Division four just entered the occupied zone.
-Casualties?
-Minimal.
How'd we get this screwed-up gig?
I didn't join the corps to be a babysitter.
-Brodski,
-Sarge, we found a viable.
Say again?
We found two bodies in deep cryostasis.
Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female.
Female?
Yeah.
Crutch, do you copy?
Crutch, do you read me?
Wake the hell up.
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.
Power up the lab.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
-What does she look like?
-She's cute.
Yeah.
And single.
I'm so lonely.
We need to get her to the lab.
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'll find out, sergeant.
-You won't bring him back, will you?
-No, it's impossible.
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.
Hi, hand.
-Any idea how long she's been down?
-4.55 centuries.
Must've been one hell of a wake-up call.
-I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?
Kinsa.
-You guys always find the cool shit.
-Where's Waylander?
He's in lab one, charging the bed now.
Find Stoney and Adrienne and get to lab two.
Once we're in the clear, I'd like to check your circuits.
-I'll bet you would.
-It isn't like that.
I need you in lab two.
-You found something?
-Two viables.
-In what condition?
-Pertect. We're attempting reanimation.
-What can I do?
-You, Stoney and Kinsa...
-They'll slow me down.
- Just walk them through it, okay?
Run a structural scan and log them in.
-I'll check back later.
-Fine.
-Okay, where are we?
-Board's all green. The N-2's ready.
Begin stabilizing
-cell fractures.
-Yes, professor.
I need a scan. Glycerol levels, cerebral profusion...
-...the works.
-I live to serve.
-Let's see what we have here.
Decrystalization of the membranes is at 32 percent.
-Somebody get her clothes off.
-I got it!
I got it.
Honestly.
Where's her diffusion barriers?
Seventeen and stable.
Here we go.
Stay still or you'll get an elbow where elbow where your wrist should be.
Specimen 4420 found in sector 39-30 L on Earth prime.
Subject discovered in cryosuspension.
-How's it going?
-Good. What's up?
-Where do you want this?
-On the specimen table.
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.
Initiating scan.
Smart and sexy.
Professor.
Take a look at this guy's scan.
Amazing.
How'd he function with that small brain?
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.
He's a big boy.
I bet he's hung like a mammoth.
Get out of here and come back when you're focused.
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.
-Thanks, Adrienne.
-Thanks.
Don't mention it.
See what you can salvage from the optic cortex.
-Then move on.
-My pleasure, professor.
Ready phase two.
Bring on the ants.
That's it.
Come to mama.
Temperature, 96.2.
Cool. It's working.
98.6 and holding.
Cell reconstruction is complete.
Internal defib in three... two, one.
Easy. Easy.
Vital signs are normal and strong.
No shit.
Easy.
Easy.
Did ya get him?
Where is he?
Tell me you got him.
Got who?
No one's here.
You're safe with us.
There was a leak in the cryo-unit and...
Was he contained?
It was contained.
But when the cryo-unit ruptured, you didn't escape it.
It put you into stasis.
For how long?
The year is 2455.
Now, I know this is a huge shock... but you'll be safe here.
You're aboard Grendel, a class-four, catamaran transport ship.
We're on our way back home and... you'll be just fine.
That's over 400 years.
Secure line. Perez, Dieter.
Solaris Research Station.
Connect.
Lowe. You bastard.
We've hit the mother lode.
Do you know what time it is?
I don't care.
We've got a goldmine.
A box of DVDs is not a goldmine.
I've told you, I can't move them.
Look at the file.
Two 400-year-old frozen specimens.
One well-preserved...
One well-preserved, the other one, are you ready for this? Up and walking around.
400 years old and walking around.
Yeah. 455 years, to be exact.
Who cares? Who gives a shit?
People. They'll pay huge money to see her.
Let me ask you a question.
Is this the first person you've reanimated?
Of course not.
How many people are out there today... walking around thawed out and looking good?
-Hundreds.
-Thousands.
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.
She's nearly twice as old as anyone.
-What's the difference?
-Doctor, a hundred years ago, when reanimation was... more unpredictable... sure, maybe.
But now... it's old news.
Damn it. I need money.
Oh, I know. I know.
The other viable is marked "Voorhees."
That's not Jason Voorhees, is it?
What do you know about him?
Jason Voorhees.
He killed nearly 200 people... and simply disappeared without a trace.
Why, to the right buyer he could be worth a fortune.
I've got him frozen here on the ship.
You work out a list ofownership?
No list. He's my find.
He's mine.
What about your students?
They're students. The educational experience will be enough.
Doctor, doctor, you are one son of a bitch.
Soon to be one rich son of a bitch.
Lowe out.
Professor,
I think that... we need to talk about my midterm.
Poor baby. No wonder you wore this thing.
Harder. Harder.
-Who's been a naughty little boy?
-I have.
Harder.
-A little harder? How's that?
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.
-How's that?
Yeah!
-Daddy wants it hard?
-Yeah!
-Yeah. That's it.
-Right there?
-You like it right there?
-Yeah.
A little harder for daddy?
Come on!
-Come on!
-You pass!
What do you think?
-Do you like them?
-They're fine.
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think this is going to work.
-Why do you want those things?
-Janessa has them.
-Well, Janessa's...
-Real?
Yes.
Let's not complicate things, all right?
I like you just the way you are.
I think you're pertect.
Okay.
Help, Wayland! No!
Somebody help!
Help me! No!
No! No!
I brought you something to eat.
Soon we'll be at Earth Two.
Earth Two? What happened to Earth One?
Yeah, well, it's dead.
The oceans, the soil, either will sustain life.
Can I do anything else for you?
You want to tell me what happened?
I take it being stabbed and frozen
-wasn't part of your plan.
-I'm a...
I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research.
The subject as Jason Voorhees.
Jason Voorhees?
Notorious murderer?
We executed him for the first time in 2008.
For the first time?
We tried everything.
Electrocution, gas, firing squad.
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.
We couldn't terminate him, so we decided to contain him.
Cryogenic stasis.
Freeze him until we could figure out what to do.
Seems sensible.
I thought so.
Unfortunately some people who were too smart for their own good... felt that a creature that couldn't be killed was. too valuable to file away.
In the end, it always comes down to money.
How do you thank someone who gives you back your life?
You'll be alive for a long time.
We'll figure out something.
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.
I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine.
Guys, our star patient is back.
Tsunaron and Janessa.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I see that my clothes fit okay.
These are yours. They're great.
Thank you.
-What are those?
-These are Janessa's love children.
You see now, it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females.
And you've met
Sergeant Brodski.
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.
And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14.
Tsunaron's little love-bot.
Easy, Janessa.
Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android.
-that I have been programing.
-Amazing.
She looks so real.
I am real.
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Lab two.
Where did you get that?
From your friend, with the hockey mask.
You brought him on board?
He's in the next lab.
We're safe.
Safe?
Our scans reveal him to be very dead.
Could your scans be wrong?
Get rid of him.
He's too dangerous.
That would be irresponsible and foolhardy.
He's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved.
Much like yourself.
He is an unstoppable killing machine.
He's not dead.
Believe me.
He's definitely dead.
Show me.
I'm putting us on lock-down.
Attention, we have a hostile on board.
-Grunt team, report to weapons.
-The chick?
Repeat, we have a hostile on board.
Grunt team, report to weapons.
Everyone else, get to lab one.
-Baby, I'm not ready yet.
-Hurry up.
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.
-Sergeant.
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know, sarge.
-Damn.
Look, sergeant, we need to talk.
-Do you have all your kids yet?
-Yes.
Oh, God!
Stoney...
-Stoney's dead.
-Oh, my God.
Stoney's dead.
Kicker! I want full armor and tac.
I want nothing left of this guy by the time we reach Solaris.
Roger that.
Let's get moving!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nothing left of him?
Take your kids to lab one and stay there till you hear from me.
I just saved your ass.
Don't get cocky.
You must feel like a wuss, huh, big boy?
-Check the score. It's still 9-3.
-Yeah, but I got my groove on now.
So, what do you say next kill wins?
Lock and load, killer.
You're going down.
You are so going down.
What the hell?
-I thought this was an alien sim.
-Yeah, it is.
Pause play.
-I said, pause play.
-He's not pausing.
No kidding.
I think we need to reboot.
That does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Okay, screw this.
Game over.
What the hell?
Drop the kid!
Drop the kid! Now!
Azrael, get out of here!
-I got him! I got him!
-I got no shot!
Move!
Sergeant Brodski.
Don't leave those kids alone.
What's wrong with you?
We're near Solaris.
They have
7 fully equipped unit that can deal with this.
I say we wait and sedate him.
-I am taking this guy out.
-I need him alive.
What you need is to get out of my way.
Look, there are other considerations.
Financial considerations.
My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship.
All right, a hundred thousand.
Two hundred.
-Five.
-Five?
-Dallas not here yet?
-Nope.
Briggs, find him, bring him up to speed.
Condor, you have a BFG?
You're with me. Sven, Geko, you got the starboard pontoon.
Sarge, what do we do when we find him?
I promised the doc we'd take him alive.
Man!
So, after you blow him to hell, put one in his leg so we can say we tried.
Yeah.
-Sarge, I got Dallas.
-Where the hell is he?
He's dead.
Sarge, we got a body in bay two.
-Who is it?
-It's Azrael.
What the hell's going on?
Got a blood trail heading toward the cargo bay.
Condor, Kicker and I will take cargo.
Rest of you take portside.
I hope they know what they're doing.
These guys live for this stuff.
Sorry.
-Don't do that!
-Dude.
-What?
-You scream like a girl.
-Screw you.
-You wish.
Lou, is that you?
I swear, you mess with an engineer... you'll wake up with a waste hose in your bunk.
Asshole.
What the hell?
Crutch, get down now!
-What the hell's going on here?
-Crutch, out now!
You wrecked my stuff, man.
We nailed him.
He must be here.
Condor, airborne.
Briggs.
Where the hell's Sven?
Condor, anything topside?
Negative, sarge.
No sign ofhim.
This won't work.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Everything's under control.
Condor, report.
Sven, report.
Condor, report.
Report!
Damn!
Sarge, we found Condor.
What's his condition?
He's screwed.
Let's smoke this fucker.
God!
Sarge...
Sven's dead.
Jesus.!
-You have got to get them out of there.
-They know what they're doing.
Oh, man!
Geko. Geko.
I got him!
I got him!
Yes, yes.
See, they got him.
Don't take your eyes off him.
I'm on my way.
Take your time.
He ain't going nowhere.
Briggs... get out of here.
Kicker. Briggs.
Where are you, damn it?
He's all alone in there.
It'll take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
Such a waste.
I told him to stay calm.
To wait until we got to Solaris and then we could take care of this... monster.
I said,
"Don't go in unprepared."
Brodski was just too proud.
Who locked the damn door?
Somebody wants to tell me what is going on?
Grunts are dead.
-Which ones?
-All of them.
Oh, man!
Lou, how long till we reach Solaris?
I'm taking us out of hyperdrive now.
Kids and their goddamn field trips, you know?
Just bring a psycho on board.
I know I'll get blamed for this shit.
Solaris to Grendel, we have you on approach. Stand by for docking number.
Grendel to Solaris, we need military and medical at the gate.
We got a big problem here.
Real goat fuck.
Grendel, what's your problem?
What's your problem?
Look... we'll be all right.
He's trapped in the cargo bay.
We're locked in here.
Can the Solaris grunts kill him?
Absolutely.
I've been in constant contact with Solaris.
Sixty highly trained professionals are standing by to get us off this ship.
Solaris to Grendel, pull up.
Abort docking.
You're coming in too fast.
Grendel...
What now?
-Warning. Prepare for impact.
-Hang on!
What's going on?
What the hell's going on?
Everyone okay?
What just happened?
-Waylander.
-Yeah.
We overshot it. We'll turn around and go back.
Hang on.
Oh, my God!
Solaris is gone.
Gone?
-It can't be gone.
-Look. It's gone.
What are we going to do?
Lou.
What sort of damage we looking at?
I'm sending out a distress beacon.
-Lou?
-Guys...
We've lost our entire port pontoon.
-The internal pressure is stable.
-The main...
-thrusters are offline.
-Life support?
We should be okay for a while.
-But he's out there.
-We'll be fine.
We're in a high-volume traffic lane.
Another ship'll come by.
We'll be safe here.
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Maybe he gave up.
You really think so?
I don't think he's out there.
Why don't you just stick your head out and have a peek?
Oh, my God! Go! Go!
Janessa, go!
Move it, move it, move it!
Come on!
Let's go!
Where's professor Lowe?
Hi.
Look... do you know how valuable you are?
I mean, fame, money.
With my help, you're going to have it all.
I know people.
I have connections!
Together we can make a fortune.
We can.
Oh, shit!
You want your machete back.
Shit, it's yours, take it.
Just remember who saved it for you.
Guys, it's okay! He just wanted his machete back!
I'm going to go back to my room because Stoney's meeting me there.
All right, look. How do we get off this ship?
I don't know.
Could you beam us off or something?
"Beam us off?"
The shuttle.
The shuttle.
What about it, Crutch?
Yeah, I can do prelaunch from the bridge.
Good. The rest of us'll head to the shuttle.
We'll start...
I'm with you, Crutch.
-You know how to use that thing?
-Yep.
Like riding a bike. Once you learn, you never forget.
Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold. Meet you at the shuttle bay.
-See you there.
-See there.
What's a bike?
We've enough fire power to level a moon.
Let's pack up and head for the shuttle.
So, you think we'll make it?
The statistical probability of survival is 12 percent.
Twelve percent? Can't you come up with better odds?
-No.
-Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!
Preparation for launch may be a simple procedure, but getting there alive?
It is a problem.
You telling me that there's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds?
Statistical probability of survival just went up to... fifty-three percent.
Want to go for a hundred?
He's here.
Quiet.
But if he's in here, he'll kill us...
Quiet!
One more sound, and I'll snap your neck myself.
Got it?
She's good with people.
Did you see that?
-What?
-I think someone's alive over there.
We don't have time for this.
-Which way is the shuttle bay?
-Straight through.
Go. I'll meet you there.
Just... don't wreck my pants.
Come on, girl.
We're going home.
Ah, Lou!
Jesus, that's twisted.
Course, I've seen worse.
Okay, let's get to work.
Brodski?
Okay...
We'll get you out of here.
Oh, God!
I'll go get help, and I'll be back.
Give me your vest.
-Bastard.
-Hey...
Lucky you weren't alive during the Microsoft conflict.
We were beating each other with our own severed limbs.
That's nice.
Okay.
Let's get us home.
Kinsa, are you there?
Yes, ma'am.
Crutch?
Prepare for fuel transfers.
Cells six and seven bypass.
Hydraulic lifters.
Pressurized and dampened.
-It's Brodski, he's alive.
-No shit.
I can't move him. Are Way and Crutch back?
-No, they're still on the bridge.
-I need help.
Hey, guys.
Brodski's still alive but Rowan can't move him by herself.
Go. I can handle it from here.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Watch your back.
Crutch, how are we doing for time?
With a giant shitload of good luck...
...we might be ready to go.
Good.
Rowan.
-Where's Brodski?
-He was here.
I don't get it.
And I am going home.
Lowe!
Shit!
I got company here, people!
Let's go.
Kinsa, open the door.
Open the damn door!
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?
Kinsa won't open the door.
She's lost it... and it's a really bad time for this!
Janessa, gently.
Give me the com.
Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.
No.
It's all over, honey.
We can go home.
All you need to do is open the door.
No.
Oh, shit. Come on, guys.
Guys!
Jesus Christ!
Open the goddamn door!
No! The fuel lines are still attached!
Kinsa!
Now what?
I...
Now, basically, we die.
Bullshit!
Okay, new plan.
You hold him and I'll run.
Hey, slappy!
Got a little something for you.
Oh, wow!
Gave her an upload.
Afraid I'll have to hurt you now.
Kay-Em!
That...
That didn't go so well.
Got you!
Yeah.
Hey!
Giddy up!
I had it under control, but thanks.
My pleasure.
Yeah.
-You did it.
-Kay-Em.
Who's your mama?
All right.
How you doing there, Brodski?
-I'm all right.
-Come on, let's get you patched up.
What a mess.
Lab two.
Tsunaron, is he gonna make it?
Absolutely. He's at 80 percent already.
This guy is strong.
What the hell?
Way?
Trouble. The collision has compromised the hull.
She's bleeding out.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
Over.
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
-Yes!
Tiamat, this is Grendel, we read you. Can you hear us?
That's affirmative.
We are reading your distress beacon.
-Are you in need of assistance?
-That's very affirmative, Tiamat.
How soon can you get here?
Our situation is extremely critical.
We're four parsecs away,
Grendel.
ETA, 45 minutes.
We don't have that much time.
Tiamat, this is Grendel.
We'll have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes.
Do you copy?
We copy you, Grendel?
Advise how you'd like us to proceed.
We'll take them down with us.
Tiamat... if you can't get here in 30 minutes, there's no point.
What?! Are you high?! Tiamat, this is Grendel.
You just ignore that last idiot.
You get your ass out here, okay?
You come here and you save us.
Why can't we just go over here?
It's no good. The pontoon goes, it'll take the bridge with it.
Not if we disconnect these walkways.
You can't just disconnect them.
We could blow it up.
There's macrocharge in the weapons
This could work.
We're going to try something.
If you're game, maintain your current course and speed... and hopefully we'll see you when you get here.
Copy.
See you in 45 minutes.
-Good luck, Grendel.
-Thanks.
Let's blow the walkways.
Come on.
Let's set the charges.
Who's got the remote?
-Right here.
-We'll meet up in walkway "B."
Go.
-All set.
-Good to go.
Hold together, baby.
Impossible.
-He's dead.
-I'd say he got better.
-He's been modified.
-Oh, you think?
Can you take him?
I can try.
You guys might want to run.
Kay-Em!
No!
Waylander!
Brodski, get in here, now!
Come on, guys!
Come on!
What the hell is going on?
Jason Voorhees is what's going on.
-Blow the charges!
-Waylander's got the trigger!
Hey...
Asshole.
I think she's holding.
I think we're finally okay.
I'd clap if I could.
Tiamat to Grendel...
Come in, Grendel.
We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking.
You ready to get off that boat?
Yeah.
Let's go home.
Holy shit!
We got to go! Now!
No!
Janessa!
Janessa!
Don't let go!
Grab her hand!
Janessa!
Reach out!
Reach for it!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, this sucks on so many levels!
Janessa!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Janessa!
Shit, he's still coming!
-Oh, shit!
-Come on.
Go!
-Which way?
-This way! This way!
Tiamat, we're at the evac door.
So am l, Grendel.
Lifeline secured.
Initiate collar pressurization.
Tiamat, open the outer doors.
Damn!
-What now?
-Let's get that bolt open.
I've got this.
Let me try an override.
Shit! Oh, shit!
Come on, come on.
Our exterior motor's got no power.
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.
-What's EVA?
-It's a space walk.
If he can jump the lines, we can reroute them.
Hopefully, that door'll open before this blows up.
-Sounds like a good plan.
-Tiamat, this is Grendel.
Our escape hatch is jammed. We're going EVA to try to patch it up.
You'd better get a move on.
I'm in the maintenance hatch.
We read you.
Opening outer doors.
Those hatches won't keep him that much longer.
We need to buy more time.
You're the expert on him, right?
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.
I'm at the control panels.
Rowan, are you there?
Yes.
I'll divert the main power supply and send it to you.
Gotcha.
See the bright blue diode?
Connect it to the terminal.
Was that you or me?
That was another part of your hull, Grendel.
You are running out of time.
Just a few more minutes.
We can disengage and come around again.
Negative.
Just another minute.
We'll stand by as long as we can.
-You ready, Kay?
-I was built ready, baby.
Initiate.
It's working.
He's buying it.
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, "Whoops"?
Nothing.
Not nothing.
You don't just say "oops."
I think he saw me.
Oh, man!
If you've got something brilliant, now'sthe time to do it.
I got something.
I got something.
Prepare variations using data file
Crystal Lake, 1980.
Kay?
Here goes nothing.
Initiate.
-You want a beer?
-Or want to smoke some pot?
Or we can have premarital sex.
We love premarital sex.
Try it now, Rowan.
Here we go.
You piece of crap!
He's done with the campers.
He's good!
Too good.
He's coming back.
Try it again.
It's engaged!
The door's engaged!
Brodski, you are the man!
Will we see you sometime soon?
I'm on my way.
Brodski, where are you?!
Grendel, we can't keep pressure lock.
We'll disengage in forty seconds.
Kay-Em.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
-Clear!
-No!
No, wait!
Disconnect.
He's coming this way.
You've got to be kidding me.
Brodski!
He's gone.
I can't believe it.
Tsun?
Kay-Em. Are you okay?
I'll be back on my feet.
As soon as I have some.
I'll get right on it.
It's beautiful.
-Look at that.
-A shooting star.
Make a wish.
It landed in the lake.
Let's go check it out.

This is great. Look at this.
And Drucker's office called.
Guess what?
They canceled.
No. We're going to be tested for drugs and alcohol.
So? Oh, this is cool.
We're going to be tested?
Not you guys. Just us pilots.
Look at this. The new remote came in.
Out goes the old one.
Get rid of it! Adam, this is Tripp. lt's his first time with us.

You're born, you live and you die.
She has to learn about it.
But not on yourbirthday, l appreciate that.

All righty. Here we go.
These RePets come back, you can't tell the difference. Trust me.
-l had it done.
-Bullshit. l'm serious!
Sadie, my cat...she's a RePet.
You had her cloned?
Well, she fell out of my condo window.
-You did well.
-Thank you.
How long are you to keep me?
Till 7. Why?
Maybe l should check out RePet.
Good morning.
Are you gentlemen the owners?
Yep, that's us.
Excellent. Larry Stern, l'm with Mr. Drucker's advance team. l've got a contract here. You'll find it pretty standard except for....
-Who was flying that one?
-Me, with the remote control.
We can fly four of these between the two of us now.
-Amazing.
-You here for the blood test?
No. My technician is set up in your office.
These forms are standard except what? lt has a nondisclosure clause.
During the flight...
...you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.
Anything from big mergers...
...to inside information on his sports teams.
We have a legal obligation to protect that stuff.
This guy think he's the president?
He considers her to be the world's second most important person.
That's big stuff.
All for a day of snowboarding?
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, l was screaming.
She's kidding. Don't worry about it. lt doesn't hurt.
Press your thumb here.
-Right here?
-Just like that.
-All done.
-Didn't feel a thing.
Now your vision.
Place your chin here.
Right here?
Do you blood-test all your pilots?
Pilots, drivers, security, assistants.
Basically, anyone who comes in contact with Mr. Drucker. l press here?
And here.
Perfect, both of you.
After this, l'm going to town to test a chef and two waiters.
The pink copy of the charter contract is yours. l'll take the rest.
-Here we go.
-Have a nice flight, gentlemen. l can take Drucker. That way, you'll have time to get Oliver cloned. l'm not getting the dog cloned. l'm just gonna check it out. l know, but once you see it, you'll say yes.
Deep down inside, you're a softy.
They specifically asked for Adam by name. l know. l also know that the bodyguards can't tell the difference.
They never got our names.
That's true.
Adam, l know l screw around a lot, but when it comes to flying...
...you know l'm serious. l could do it.
Go enjoy your birthday. lf you want to be me, try to act a little bit more manly.
Chest out. Stomach in.
There you are.
All right.
-All clear.
-l want the Speaker of the House.
Don't mention my name at all. l'm Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.
Adam's the name and flying's the game.
Pete Hume says you know the mountains like nobody else.
That's probably true for everyone except my partner. l'm looking forward to it.
-We all set?
-We've stationed our people--
-Don't need the details.
-Yes, sir.
Your snowboard's behind your seat.
Dave, look, we gave a lot of money to his campaign...
...not to mention what l pay your law firm, so l'm counting on you.
Get me the Speaker.
Good.
Sally, who's next? Okay, put him on.
Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?
Hey, buddy, wake up.
Wake up.
We're here. Woodland Mall. l was asleep.
Welcome to Woodland Mall,
Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you,
Food court, ground level,
Megaplex theater, 15th level,
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.
Stop the cloning.
God doesn't want you to go in there.
Then God shouldn't have killed my dog.
Atheist.
We can clone your four-legged loved one in a few hours,
How can we do it? lt begins with growing ''blanks'',,, ,,,animal drones stripped of characteristic DNA,,, ,,,in embryonic tanks at the RePet factory, ln stage two, yourpet's DNA,,, ,,,is extracted from a lock of fur ora drop ofblood,,, ,,,then infused on a cellularlevel into the blank, ln the final stage, using RePet's cerebral syncording process,,, ,,,all yourpets thoughts, memories and instincts,,, ,,,are transplanted via the optic nerve,
Still can't make up your mind, huh?
You lost a dog, right?
Yes, my daughter's.
What a heartbreak.
-What did you say was his name again?
-Oliver.
Oliver's in luck...
...because we're having a special this week, 20 percent off.
-When did Oliver die?
-This morning.
Perfect.
We can do a post-mortem syncording...
...but act fast because there's a 1 2-hour window on deceased brains. l have a problem with the whole idea.
Suppose the clones have no soul or they're dangerous?
Clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets.
Plus...
...they're insured. lf it's so safe...
...then why is it against the law to clone humans?
Because the human brain is too complicated to syncord.
You remember the experiment they did?
That's why it didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.
But with pets, it's a totally proven technology.
Your RePet Oliver will be exactly the same dog.
He'll know the tricks you taught him...
...where the bones are buried--
He won't even know he's a clone.
And did l mention...
...they're insured. l don't care about insurance. l care if l can trust my daughter with an animal with sharp teeth.
We can make him smaller.
With softer teeth.
You can?
We can even color-coordinate him to match your decorating scheme.
Sim-Pals, the best friend money can buy,
Let me think about that.
--who's fun to be with,
Treatyourkids--
Look, l might be back.
You'll be back.
Your daughter will think you're the best.
-My sister has two and loves them.
-Good.
Come, let's fix the collar.
There you are.
-lt's amazing how real this is.
-l know.
My daughter will be so excited.
Come, let's go home.
You have called Hank Morgan,
Hi, l'm not here, so leave a message,
Hank, it's me again.
What happened to you? l waited at
Kelly's for half an hour. lt's now...
-...five past 7.
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname? l'm heading home now. lf you get this message--
Let's be friends,
What's yourname?
Can't you see l'm talking? Quiet.
--head to my house with flowers and a good excuse, or Natalie will kill you. l can sing songs,
Would you like to sing with me?
Excuse me, do you know how to turn this off?
My niece has one.
Say, ''Go to sleep, Cindy.''
-Go to sleep, Cindy.
-Would you like to sing,,,,
Go to sleep.
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.
Good night.
Clara, sweetie, honey.
Oliver was very sick and he had to be put down.
Clara, sweetie, honey. Oliver had to go to heaven.
''Why, Daddy?''
Well, you see, because...
...it's because, uh....
Shit, Oliver! Why'd you have to die?
Oliver?
Natalie.
One...
...two, three!
That's amazing. Look at this cake!
Oh, my God.
Adam Gibson?
Who are you?
We have a situation.
Come with us, please.
What the hell is going on?
Cooperate and everything will be fine.
Fine? Someone's in my house, eating my birthday cake and it's not me!
We know. There's been a 6th Day violation. A human was cloned.
-That human was you.
-We can help.
-Then get him out!
-But you'll have to come with us. l don't know who the hell you people are...
-...but l'm going in my house.
-Right.
Oops, Cindy fell down,
Get the doll.
Not here. l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname? l can play games,
Shit.
Wiley, no! Hold your fire!
That way! Go!
Vincent, go! l have a boo-boo,
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Thanks for the suggestion!
Don't even blink.
Oh, God. Someone stole the minivan.
No, they stole my Cadillac.
Oh, no.
Car chase. Cool.
-Who are you?
-l was hired to kill you.
That's all l know. l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,
What's yourname?
Secure child-seat restraint,
Let's be friends,
-Where is this guy?
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,
Let's be friends,
What's yourname?
Will you be my mommy? l don't want to be your mommy!
-Shut up!
-What?
Somebody do something about that doll! l have a boo-boo,
This is crazy. Why does anyone want to kill me?
He got home first.
You saw him, he didn't see you.
You're screwed.
He's going to live your boring life and never be the wiser.
Your wife and kid see you two together, they'll be killed.
Goddamn it, Wiley!
Son of a bitch.
Stupid!
Blow out his tires this time!
Shit!
That was spectacular.
Son of a bitch.
Hold my belt.
Okay.
You got me?
Little more.
Get some people to look for this guy!
Pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies and get them to the lab. l'm Dr, Griffin Weir, Welcome to the new Weir Organ Transplant Facility,
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,
Doctor, protesters claim that cloning human organs,,, ,,,will lead to cloning whole humans,
That's not only illegal, we're years from the technology to do it.
A human was cloned over 1 0 years ago.
And we know the outcome of that bizarre experiment. lf you recall, the Supreme Court ordered the clone be destroyed...
...and l think that was the humane thing to do. lt led to laws against human cloning...
...and set back the course of legitimate research by years.
Mr. Drucker! You gave--
This is Dr. Weir's night, okay? ls it true you want to get the 6th Day laws repealed?
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine, not politics.
Mr. Drucker, the protesters claim you run RePet at a loss...
...to soften people up to human cloning.
You know, we shouldn't forget that not long ago...
...there were almost no more fish left in the ocean...
...and half the world's population faced the threat of hunger.
Cloning technology turned that around.
Extremists won't admit they'd rather people went hungry...
...than eat cloned fish, so they yell about human cloning.
Do you think human cloning laws should be changed?
Suppose a 1 0-year-old boy is in the hospital, dying of liver cancer.
Thanks to Dr. Weir's work...
...we can save that boy. ln the next bed lies another 1 0-year-old boy...
...whose parents love him just as much...
...only he has an inoperable brain tumor.
You cannot clone a brain.
The only way to save him would be to clone the whole person.
How do you tell that boy's parents that we can save the first boy...
...but the research that would have saved their son wasn't done...
...because of a law passed by frightened politicians a decade ago?
So, what does that mean?
Enjoy the party.
-Looks like you needed rescuing.
-Yes, l did. Thank you.
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!
Hey, boss!
Johnny. How's my star quarterback? l'd say l felt like a million bucks, but l'd hate to take a pay cut.
Don't remind me, all right?
That was one nasty hit you took last week.
Be careful. We don't want you getting killed.
Katherine? Are you all right? l'm just feeling like l don't quite belong.
But l'm fine. Really.
No, you're not.
Should l call Dr. Stevens?
No, no, no. l just overdid it, that's all. l'll get a car to take you home.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much for coming. Champagne?
-That was quite a speech.
-You heard that?
Sorry l got carried away.
Your words meant a great deal to me.
As it happens, l have a son with an inoperable tumor of the brain.
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry, sir. lt must have been in my subconscious, knowing you were here.
No, no, it's all right.
Gave me a lot to think about. lt gave me a different view of the subject.
Mr. Speaker...
...could l offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs? l was 0 when Billy was born. l didn't know if l wanted another kid so late.
But now l love him so damn much. lf there were something we could do for Billy... ,,,only it was highly illegal,,,
...would you consider it?
Of course l would.
That's the same hypothetical--
No, no. Don't answer so fast.
You'd face a minimum sentence of
40 years if it ever came out.
But he'd be cured?
He'd be exactly the same.
Perfect health,
Never even have to know.
But if the secret came out,,,
...with the law now... ,,,he'd be put to sleep like a rabid dog,
He'd be destroyed, like a horse with a broken leg.
And ifit never came out?
Or if the laws were changed one day?
Billy wouldn't have anything to worry about. l beg you. l beg you.
Go to my house and pick up my wife and daughter. lf l go there, they'll kill them both.
You made a different report an hour ago.
No, l didn't.
According to this, you did.
That must have been the clone.
Look, l know it sounds crazy. l can hardly believe it myself.
-Was your car stolen or not?
-Yes.
-So you did report it?
-No, l took it.
You stole your own car? l'm a court-appointed virtual attorney. You don't have to answer. ls my client being charged with auto theft? l didn't steal it! lt's mine!
He claims it was filed by his clone. l see. Loading virtual psychiatrist.
Mr. Gibson, what seems to be the trouble?
Go through it now with him?
You're avoiding talking about your parents. lmagine: Two turtles are walking through the desert--
Shut up!
What?
-Are you going to help me or not?
-Of course we are.
Medical alert transmitted,
Awaiting data,
Wait in here. l'll come get you as soon as we have news.
Clones.
He saw himself at his house tonight.
Which was our mistake, not his.
Excuse me.
He's at precinct seven.
Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along? l'll need them both.
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
Piece of shit Wiley. l'm gonna kill him. Where is he?
He's still cooking.
Son of a bitch. l look like crap.
Do you have any idea how much my hair treatments cost?
How much does Gibson know?
That he's been cloned and we'll kill anyone who sees them together.
What's that? What?
Does Drucker know you're talking about killing innocent people?
Relax. lt's just a threat.
Of course, we'd never actually do it.
Try to have a good night.
You do your hair. l'll take Wiley and Vincent. l've got to pierce my damn ears again.
Officials blame the latest strike by majorleague players,,, ,,,entering its 4th year and a lack,,, ,,,of fan identification with teams in the Series for the dismal ratings,
Shit.
Oh, no.
Now what? lt feels tight all across here...
...where the tires ran over me.
You were run over by two cars and your chest was crushed.
Exactly. l mean, no wonder, right? lt's in your mind.
Completely crushed.
As in dead.
As in you have a totally new chest now.
Then why is it hard to breathe?
Tell you what.
Why don't you just stay out here?
Relax.
The fresh air will do you good.
State and government officials in Washington, D,C,,, ,,,are openly dismissive of the Microsoftproposal,
This amounts to an attempt by
Microsoft to buy a state of the Union,
Nothing in our Constitution orhistory,,, ,,,offers the remotest legal theory,,, ,,,by which a corporation can, in effect, own a state,
But if he goes off his medication, the paranoid delusions come back.
Very sad. Because at other times, he seems almost rational.
Gibson!
Gibson!
-You're dead.
-No.
You're dead.
Try to stay dead this time.
Hank, it's me again,
What happened to you? l waited forhalfan hourat Kelly's, lt's now five past 7, l'm heading home, okay?
He's fine. He's okay.
He's our associate.
Gibson must have knocked him out.
Knocked him out?
He looks dead to me, doc.
No. Pulse is strong.
He'll be up and around in no time.
We'll get him to the hospital.
Easy.
Let us know if you find Gibson.
Honey, l'm home.
Darling, where are you?
Hi, sugar.
Hello, my love.
Have you been working out?
-You look so good.
-Thank you. l recorded your sports programs.
Maybe we can watch them together. l'd like that.
Or should l just take this off now?
No. Hold your horses.
Oh, Hank, l think it's so sexy when you go right to the chair. l know you do.
You're gonna have to zip me up, sweetheart.
Careful with the merchandise.
Hold on, please!
-Have they been here?
-Who?
Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer? l'm sorry l missed the party, but...
...all of a sudden it's 1 1 :00 and l wound up at Kelly's.
-You missed my party?
-Not on purpose. lt was sort of weird. l feel terrible. l don't know what happened.
You feel terrible? l lost my wife, my daughter and my life tonight.
--special dance.
Hank, listen. l need your help.
Not now, cupcake!
What going on? l don't understand.
That's a real gun.
What, what's going--?
Jesus! What are you gonna do?
Kill my cat?
What the hell is going on? lf you weren't at my party, then you didn't see him.
Who's ''him''?
Jesus H. Christ. l said get your dog cloned, not yourself.
What are you going to do?
Take my life back.
You're going to kill him?
Why not? He's not real.
Plus, there's no law against it.
You're not serious. l'm dead serious.
But look at him.
He looks just like you.
Technically, this could be committing suicide.
But he's not me.
He's not even human.
Wait a second. How do l know he's not you and you're not him?
Look at him.
He's even a shitty carpenter.
-Let me see your chin.
-My chin?
-You cut yourself shaving.
-Here.
Okay, it's there. You're you. l couldn't do it.
Over here. l have a little something for you.
-ls Clara asleep?
-Yes, she is.
He's grabbing her ass. l like how cigars make you feel.
Daddy?
What are you doing out here? l had a bad dream. l'll take you back to bed. Come on.
-Fireman.
-Fireman, right.
Wait here.
Cigar, sir? l can't wait.
-How do you like it?
-This is so good.
Want to try some?
No. Smoking's illegal, and l'm a mother-- All right.
Sweetheart, l'm sorry about the RePet. lt's all right.
Dad?
Did Oliver die? ls he a RePet?
Why do you say that?
You locked him outside. l did? Oh, l'm so sorry. l haven't been myself lately.
All right. You go to sleep now.
Close your eyes.
When was the last time we did it in the back of the car?
We should smoke cigars more often.
Mr. Gibson?
-Who are you?
-Millennium Security. Sorry to--
You got any l.D.?
Of course.
Sorry l was a little jumpy but we had a break-in earlier.
We know.
Your car was found in the river.
They find the bastard that stole it?
Relax. He's a friend of mine.
Sorry about this.
Nice 'do.
He's here to help me fix the garage.
Heel!
Now what?
Go see.
Sorry, but he's a RePet.
He was a good watchdog. Now he lets my car get stolen and barks. l hate clones.
Well, we'll keep an eye on your property. l'll sleep better knowing you're around.
Try to have a good night.
-Good night.
-Take it easy.
Hide.
Stop it, Oliver.
Stop it.
Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.
Good Oliver. That was a bad idea.
-Let's get out of here.
-We can't leave them with that thing.
Those were the guys trying to kill me. lt's dangerous for Natalie and Clara if l hang around.
Darling, you're still awake. l wanted to wait up for you.
Thank you.
And l wanted to spend time with these flowers. lt took me 1 7 generations to get this right. lf you had told me, l could have-- l know. Engineered it in half an hour. l'm not in that much of a hurry,
Griffin.
Want to get a cup of tea, then go upstairs?
Yeah.
That's a good idea. Let's do that. lt's okay.
Stay calm.
Stay very, very calm.
What a night.
That was the longest night in my life.
Hello, Adam. l'm a one-man Virtual Girl...
...but if you insert the installation disk....
-What was that?
-Nothing. l felt fingers going for my zipper.
That's disgusting.
That's disgusting? l had to look away when you and Natalie were--
The.... You want a beer?
You saw the clone do something with Natalie.
They did nothing.
-That's not what l would have done.
-What would you have done? l would have....
Nothing.
Well, that's what they did.
You know...nothing.
Shit. ln the goddamn minivan. ln the minivan.
You know what tobacco does to people.
He smoked my stogie too?
The bastard.
That son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch smoked your stogie.
She couldn't tell it wasn't me? lt didn't look like it. l mean, she seemed...
...happy.
You have no idea what it felt like seeing her with him. l should have just killed him. lt could have been worse.
At least she's not cheating on you.
Don't move!
Tripp! l'm not after you.
Back away.
Back away.
Why did you do that?
Don't do anything stupid, now.
That's as far as you go. ls that you, Hank?
Hank!
Hey, Adam. ls Hank sleeping on the floor again?
That's so cute.
On the sixth day, God created man.
On the sixth day....
On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the sixth day.
Why did you kill my friend?
Hank Morgan was an abomination to God.
He was a clone.
He was no clone.
The real Hank Morgan died this afternoon. l killed him.
So l could...
...so l could kill Drucker.
Drucker isn't dead. lt would be all over the news.
Open your eyes.
Drucker's a clone.
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
Dr. Weir cloned your friend.
Dr. Weir cloned you.
They found us.
Shoot me in the head.
-What--
-We have people at Weir's lab! l know who they are.
They scan my brain, they'll be killed.
Shoot me.
God forgive me.
Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?

Of course. l never miss your recitals. l love you.
You're the greatest, Dad,
Unless herpseudomonas infection clears up,,,
...l'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
What about her DNA scan?
Came up with cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis?
Which is impossible, considering it's a childhood disease...
...and she would have been dead
30 years ago.
We're running the scan again.
No, l'll do it at the clinic. lf you could give us a moment, please.
Darling. Sweetheart.
We're having you transferred to my clinic.
No. l'd like to stay here. l can help you at the clinic. lf you stay here, there's nothing l can do. l know, dear. l'll die.
Yes.
Katherine, please.
Listen to me.
Katherine died  years ago.
The feelings l have aren't mine.
They're hers.
Katherine, listen.
Don't do this. l need you so much. l need you. l'm not afraid, Griffin. l want to die.
My time has already passed.

We're in the business oflife,
Welcome to the new home of the
Weir Organ Transplant Facility,,, ,,,here at Replacement Technologies,
Excuse me, sir. l've got to check that.
Sure. Help yourself.
But...
...you might want to use these.
What's in here?
Lower intestines for Dr. Weir.
He's doing a study on the flesh-eating virus.
You can open it.
Just try not to breathe.
That's okay.
You're cleared.
Thanks.
What about herDNA scan?
Came up with cystic fibrosis,
Which is impossible considering it's a childhood disease--
--dead 30 years ago,
So we're running a new scan,
No, l'll do it at the clinic,
We've had 5 extra years since you cloned me, l treasure that,
-Katherine, please,
-No,
Please, l'm not afraid. l want to die.
My time has already passed.
Can l help you?
No. l just dropped my pen. l'm all thumbs today.
Thank you.
Will you cut that out? lt's driving me crazy.
Excuse me, but l nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts. lt's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.
You'd know better about that?
Yes, he would. lt was your old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?
-l got killed twice in two hours.
-Knock it off. We've all been killed.
You know what really bothers me?
That l've never even seen a white light.
Never seen angels. Nothing.
Give me a break. l have you logged in.
What? When?
Twenty minutes ago.
You've entered a restricted area.
Son of a bitch has got my thumb.
Deactivate Talia, put out a security alert...
...and seal off Drucker's office, now!
Let's go!
Shit.
Can l help you?
Yeah.
You can stick your thumb on that.
-Thank God.
-What? More fundamentalists?
No. Adam Gibson.
We think he's in the building.
Why wasn't he taken care of already?
There are four of you and one of him!
Two of him, but you see what l mean.
He has a wife and kid, right?
Get them. We may need the leverage. lt costs me $1 .2 million each time l clone you people.
Try to be worth the money.
They'll kill you for seeing this.
They're doing their best already.
Where's Dr. Weir?
His lab's over there.
Dr. Weir.
Dr. Weir. l know about the intruder.
Your office called.
Everything's under control. lt's not under control.
You had me cloned.
Yes.
Well, you cloned the wrong man.
How did you do it? You had to have my-- What do you call it?
Your syncording. We had it.
Give it to me. l want my life back.
Here. lt's your syncording.
How did you get this?
-l haven't been--
-Here.
The vision test. lt didn't test vision. lt took your syncording.
An exact picture of your mind.
And it took sample of DNA. With those we can clone a person in 2 hours.
We had you so we could act quickly when we were told you were killed.
Told l was killed?
Please don't drink and drive,
Gibson family schedule,
Clara's recital at school,
This is Michael Drucker's.
A syncording contains everything in a person's memory...
...and this is what Drucker saw and heard just before he died.
You don't become a rich man without making enemies...
...so we back up his mind religiously.
-You own the Roadrunners, right?
-Among other things,
-You a fan?
-l'm a fan ofboth those teams, l'll have to getyou some tickets,
-Promise, right?
-Sure, l'll do it right now,
Sally, remind me to get
Roadrunner tickets forAdam Gibson,
He's mypilot today,
On the sixth day, God created man, l'm about to get on my snowboard--
Hey, he's got a gun!
Shit, lt's a fundamentalist,
Hejust shot them both,
Call Marshall, You hearme?
Sally? Oh, shit,
No, you don't have to-- Sally!
Help!
An anti-cloning fundamentalist killed everyone on board. lt should have been me.
We thought it was you.
Drucker even mentioned your name.
So, we used your DNA and syncording to clone you.
To resurrect him, we had to cover it up.
Keep talking.
We cloned everyone. We realized you switched places too late.
Access denied, lnvalid thumbprint,
-They're trying to kill me.
-There are two Adam Gibsons.
That's proof humans are being cloned...
...which makes you very dangerous to Drucker.
-Accessing security,
-Tell me why l'm a threat.
Drucker was killed 3 years ago.
We cloned him then...
-...and we cloned him yesterday.
-So? lf that came out, he'd be destroyed in every way.
A clone has no rights,
A clone can't own anything,
Drucker would lose all this...
...because Drucker would be...
...legally dead.
Look at all the cameras you got in this place.
You can't find one guy?
There. There.
We don't need where he's been.
We need to find where he is.
Let's go. Hit the alarm.
-What's up?
-What area's so sensitive...
...we don't allow cameras?
Drucker will do anything--
Anything to destroy the evidence.
And you're the evidence.
This is evidence too.
Move! Clear the way!
Let's go.
-l have to go to the bathroom.
-Okay, Clara.
Anyone else need to go?
Why do you think l'm telling you?
Because l can do nothing to stop them.
-There he is!
-Zone Six. Engineering.
Move! Clear the way!
Or what they'll do to your family.
My family?
Drucker has to kill one of you. lf he can't kill you, he'll kill the other.
They could get killed in the process.
Get out!
Destination ''Get out'' not understood,
Morgan Randall Elementary School! l'm very sorry, sir.
Daddy!
She's supposed to be up there now, right?
This is the....
That's odd. l'm gonna go check and make sure everything's okay.
-Excuse me.
-Of course.
Clara?
Oh, my God.
Mommy!
Mommy, l'm scared. l'm here. l got you.
Could you help us?
What are you doing?
This is the only thing keeping the dogs...
...from tearing her apart.
So be quiet and come with us.
Let's go!
-Daddy!
-Adam!
Natalie!
You have reached 911 emergency,
-Your call is important to us,
-l know.
Your ''yes'' or ''no'' answers,,, ,,,will help us in directing police services to assistyou,
-Are you reporting a felony?
-Yes.
-Thank you forreporting a felony,
-Come on. ls the felony in progress now?
Yes!
Thank you, ls there a danger ofbodily harm to you or others?
Yes!
Are suspects orinjured victims,,,,
Forget about talking to the police. l tried that already.
Who the hell are you? l know this sounds insane, but...
...l'm Adam Gibson.
We don't have time for you to be shocked. They have Natalie and Clara.
-l need your help to get my family.
-They're my family.
That's for sleeping with my wife...
...in the damn minivan.
Yourreport has been canceled atyourrequest,
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies, lt's him. l believe you have something of mine.
No, l have everything ofyours, l have the syncording thatproves you're a clone, l have everything of yours:
Your family in the palm of my hand.
-Shall we trade?
-You read my mind,
Just the highlights.
All right, l'll bring the disk,,, ,,,to the Double X Charter office at 10;00 tonight,
Be there with my family,
Did you have to hit me that hard? l had to stop you from talking to the police.
That's a good one.
That should do it.
What are you doing?
Testing it. l don't think you have enough aluminum.
Are you kidding? That's the same amount l used in the Rain Forest War.
You shouldn't be talking.
The mess you left trying to fix your garage....
-You saw me working in the garage?
-Saw you? l nearly shot you.
Let's try it.
-Cool.
-Cool.
You better be miles away when this goes off. l'm worried about getting inside to find Natalie and Clara. l'll take my chances getting out.
Griffin.
Here.
-What are you doing?
-Yours. Yours.
Griffin, what's the matter?
My wife, Katherine, is dead.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Griffin, l don't know-- l'm so sorry.
Don't start with ''sorry'' with me.
Don't start!
Don't start with ''sorry''! l know about the congenital defects you've been imbedding...
...into the clone DNA.
There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix and the others.
But, Michael, why my wife? Why?
You're right, Griffin. lt's a security protocol l implemented. l knew you wouldn't understand.
What should l understand?
The only thing l understand is that...
...you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!
Calm down.
Someone made a mistake.
This wasn't meant to hurt her. lt didn't hurt her. lt killed her.
Suppose we clone a senator who agrees to support us, then doesn't.
Or Johnny Phoenix wants more money.
Shorter life spans gives us leverage.
What's the point?
The point is, if they betray us they're dead. lf they stay on the team, we clone them again.
Exactly what we'll do with Katherine. l'm sure she's being cloned now.
No, she's not.
-No.
-She's--
Griffin, it was a mistake. lf you're concerned about her DNA, go through it yourself.
Obviously there's no charge for the cloning.
No charge. Thank you very much.
What you don't understand is, she doesn't want to be cloned.
So, do it anYWay.
Do it anYWay. l see.
Let me explain something to you. l loved my wife very much.
So much so, l promised l'd never bring her back again.
And l won't.
And if l can't bring her back, l'll never bring back anyone, ever.
That's how much l loved her.
So, it's over, it's finished...
...and l quit.
Well, l can't let you quit. l've looked the other way too often. l've justified too much, so...
...l'm finished. lt's over.
-Know what l'm going to do for you?
-What are you going to do for me? l'm going to give you...
...the greatest gift you can imagine.
-A gift?
-l'm gonna save your life. l'm gonna save Katherine's life. l'm gonna save our friendship.
And l'm gonna save your marriage.
What are you talking about? l'm gonna kill you now...
...and l'm going to clone you using your latest syncording.
Then l'll clone Katherine using her last syncording.
You understand?
Do you see what l'm doing for you?
You'll be together, neither of you will remember you promised not to clone her.
Or that she even died.
Obviously you won't remember this conversation.
You're welcome.
All right, now show me my family,
Bastards. l knew it.
Yoursyncording isn't here, lt was being flown by remote.
Both of you, get back here now.
Come on.
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here. l'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker. lt's my charter contract.
Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker, but we'll stay alert.
What time are you taking off?
Take off? l didn't order--
Yourpilot's on his way to reception,
Now you listen to me.
Seal the building,
Full security alert,
Find this pilot,
He is armed and dangerous,
And get Wiley and some men up to my office now,
Freeze the elevators. Shut down level 2 and 3 parking garages.
-Zone 6, engineering corridor.
-There. Sector 3.
He's headed right towards you, Dan.
Turn around!
Don't try it.
Get people up the stairwell!
Teams 3 and 4, close off on him!
Let's go!
-He shot out a power box.
-He's trashing the whole system.
We got him trapped.
West stairwell between 1 3 and 14.
Let's go!
Cover the stairwell doors!
Fire in front of him!
Okay!
You did pretty good!
Fooled us at the airport!
Managed to turn this place into shambles!
You're the greatest, Dad!
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.
And, of course, we do have your family!
All right.
Go get him.
Well, well.
-Adam Gibson.
-l wish l could say, ''the one and only.''
Looks like we both went back on our word.
-You'll find we have more in common--
-Where's my family?
Right to business.
An admirable trait.
There they are. All safe and sound.
For the moment.
Your syncording is not on him...
...it's not in his whisper craft. l knew you'd double-cross me, so l gave it to my clone.
Anything happens to me or my family...
...the next time you see it will be at your murder trial.
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.
Tell me what?
Adam, Adam, Adam.
He's not the clone.
You are.
Ask yourself something.
You remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard? l need to check your vision,
Place your chin here,
Changing places with your friend?
Buddy, wake up, We're here,
Woodland Mall,
The salesman at RePet thought it was...
...odd you came in twice.
Asked the same questions...
...twice.
Still can't make up yourmind, huh?
You lost a dog, right?
Let me see your chin,
You cutyourselfshaving,
Your shaving cut?
Easily reproduced.
So is the scar from your old war wound. l know who l am. l know you do.
Talia?
How many times have you been cloned? l've lost count.
There's one way to tell.
Show him. lt's the only way to track what generation a clone is.
See? Four dots means...
...she's been cloned four times.
Come on.
Let's take a look at yours.
Take a look in the mirror.
Let's find out if you are who you think you are.
Just under your left eye.
Kind of takes the fun out of being alive, doesn't it?
So, you see...
...your family isn't really your family.
They're his.
And you, my friend, are in exactly the same boat as all of us. lf Adam Gibson gets that syncording to the authorities...
...we'll all be destroyed. lf you really love your wife and kid...
...you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
We'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
You'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
We'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him.
They'll never know you're the clone.
That, or lose them forever.
Adam, l'm not making this offer because l have to. l can get everything from your memories.
The fact is, l'd like you to understand...
...you'd be serving a higher purpose. ln two years, three tops, l'll control enough votes to get the laws changed.
Then we won't have to lose our best people. Our Mozarts...
...our Martin Luther Kings.
We will finally be able to conquer death.
We will finally be able to conquer death.
And who gets to decide...
...who lives and who dies?
You?
You have a better idea?
Yeah.
What about God?
You're one of those. l suppose you think science is inherently evil.
No, l don't think science is inherently evil.
But l think you are. lf you believe God created man in His own image...
...you believe He gave man power to understand evolution...
...to exploit science, to manipulate the genetic code.
To do exactly what l'm doing. l'm just taking over where God left off. lf you really believe that, then you should clone yourself...
...while you're still alive.
Why's that? So l can understand your unique perspective?
No. So you can go fuck yourself.
Now you'll tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!
You won't find it in my head. l told him to hide it so l wouldn't know where it is.
-We'll see about that.
-Yeah, we will.
Let's go. Get in here.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Fine! Have it your way!
That didn't hurt so bad.
Asshole.
Let's go back a few minutes.
Here's Drucker's syncording,
There's the other one.
Keep this, lfl'm not back in an hour, you know what to do,
Don't worry, lfanything happens to you ormy family,,,
...l'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch.
You got the location?
The airport. l was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.
Let's go.
Betrayed by your own mind.
Wait! Wait!
What?
They staged that scene for us.
The other one sat behind him so we couldn't see him.
The bastard faked his own syncording.
One hid and this one avoided looking at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.
You mean the other one's here too?
Yes, that's correct.
Now put out another alert.
This one is the diversion!
He smashes the cameras, gets captured...
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in and takes his wife and kid. ldiot!
Natalie, Clara.
-Oh, my God. What's going on?
-Daddy?
Don't worry, sir.
Get him up. l'm scared, Dad.
What's going on?
-This isn't because of the cigar?
-No. l'll explain to you later.
Don't worry. He's not going anYWhere.
We'll get him.
Wait.
Talia, you go. You two stay here.
Have them block all the exits.
Henderson...
...seal off the tank area, levels 6 and 7. l'm trying. Give me a minute.
And get us some power up here.
Don't move. My daughter is right inside that door. l don't want to expose her to any graphic violence.
She already gets enough of that from the media.
Put your weapons down.
Nice and easy. Good.
Now, when you go inside...
...you say....
Have a nice flight, little girl.
They're friends of Daddy's.
All right, let's go.
We'll have a little midnight flight with Daddy and Mommy.
There we are.
All right?
There you go, sir.
Wiley.
Go.
Wiley, just wait one second.
Not again.
And don't bring him back.
Stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach.
God. l'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.
But what better place, right?
Henderson? Where's my power?
Coming on-line now, sir.
Get all exits blocked, All exits!
Shit.
Go start warming up a blank.
Do a fresh syncording. l want my mind up-to-the-minute.
Here it is. This is a fresh one.
This will be a complete syncording. ls that Talia?
Go help her.
We'll find them.
-What have you got?
-Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.
Okay, go. Take the back walk.
No.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Take her to your mother's...
...and stay there until l come.
Come with us, Daddy. l have to help a friend, okay? Bye. l love you.
Wiley, you shot me!
Oh, right. That was you. l've got to get dressed.
You're not even going to wait...
...until l die?
Would you?
Come on.
Get it off.
You got blood on the jacket.
Jesus Christ.
What?
What?
What?
Look...
...we can make a deal. l didn't do anything to you. lt was all him.
Listen to me. l can rebuild all this in a very short time. l can still save you, Adam.
Save me?
We put defects in the clone DNA to give them short life spans.
Want to know what you'll die of?
How long you've got to live?
We can go right upstairs and look it up.
We all have to die someday.
We don't have to die. l'm offering you the chance to live forever. Never aging.
Perfect in every way.
Perfect? Like you?
Look.
Here is your ''perfection.''
Oh, God.
There's no need to panic. l can fix this.
You won't fix anything. lt's over. lt's finished. lt's finished.
When l said you should screw yourself...
...l didn't mean for you to take it literally.
Go after him.
Get him.
Check the roof!
You! Up top!
Come on!
-Can you fly this?
-Better than you can.
Good. Because your shooting sucks.
Let's get out of here.
Shit.
Come on!
Try to climb over me!
Come on! Hurry up!
Come on!
Shit!
You know, l keep wondering...
...am l really human?
Do l have a soul?
Well, your DNA scan came back normal, didn't it?
Yeah. Zero defects.
Just like a RePet commercial. lf you're not human, they would have mentioned it.
All right, enough philosophy. l better get going. l've got 3 weeks at sea to figure it out.
Hurry if you want to see Clara.
Thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family.
Now, wait.
This is your family too.
You were willing to die to save them.
Think about that while you're at sea...
...wondering if you're really human or not.
Because if that's not being human...
...l don't know what is.
Thanks.
Hello, everybody.
-Look what l brought.
-A kitty!
Oh, Sadie. l thought that...
...Hank's cat was a--
She is.
But you hate RePets.
Well, l changed my mind.
You old softie.
Can we keep her?
-Please?
-Of course.
That's why l brought her home.
Put her down.
Good.
Thank you so much.
Once upon a time.
There was a young Thumb Thumb
named Juni.
Juni was shy and had no self-confidence.
Until one day evil Thumb Thumbs
kidnapped his spy Thumb Thumb parents.
It was up to Juni and his sister. Carmen.
To save Mom and Dad.
And save them they did.
Juni became a hero.
The best Thumb Thumb agent ever seen.
But one day Juni was betrayed.
He could not forgive the Thumb Thumbs
for using him.
So he left Thumb village.
Vowing never to return.
No one ever really
saw much of Juni after that.
No one lived happily ever after.
The end.
Wasn't that a marvelous story, children?
Today's feature presentation will also be in three dimensions.
But for now, take off your glasses.
You won't need them for about... ooh, 15 minutes or so.
At that point, the movie becomes 3-D!
Don't worry. You'll know when to put your glasses on.
When one of the main characters puts his on, you do the same.
Now, if your eyes get tired during the 3-D section of the movie, take off your glasses, rush out to the concession stand, purchase an extra large popcorn, an extra large soda, come back to your seat, put your glasses back on and voilà!
You just spent $35!
Keep those glasses off until it's time.
And enjoy the show!
Agua. As in water.
Cute. But I wasn't here for cute.
I was here 'cause I'd gotten
a call for my regular fee.
$ 4.99
I'm an ex-secret agent.
My name is Juni Cortez.
And I'm a private detective.
A P.I.
A private eye.
A gumshoe.
I know why the water from your park is missing.
- Pray tell.
- It's winter.
They shut down the park during the winter.
Who's "they"?
The people who really own this park.
Times are tough.
But a guy's gotta do what he's gotta do.
From saving cats in trees...
...to finding lost toys.
To helping people...
Hold on.
Yeah?
The OSS is looking for me?
Look, I'm no longer an agent.
I can't help you.
Whatever it is, it's your problem.
Leave me alone!
I'd been burned by the agency.
The OSS.
So I left.
No going back.
I handle my own assignments now.
Smaller in scale.
I was saving up for something big.
I was standing in line
to buy my copy of the biggest
Virtual-reality game in history.
It goes online at midnight.
Pretty exciting. I suppose.
Game Over.
The biggest video game
to ever be created. Period.
This is a worldwide event.
The game was created by someone
known only as the Toymaker.
Who was once again
unavailable for interviews.
But there's gotta be some things
more important than games.
Oh. And did we mention
the surprises the Toymaker has in store
for those of you that complete level five?
Untold riches. Toys. And prizes
beyond your wildest dreams.
Hey, no cutting in line, freak.
I wasn't cutting.
I was standing right here!
End of the line!
Needless to say.
Things have been pretty lame
since I left the OSS.
Aah!
Things were about to get worse.
Dear Juni.
I was doing some work
and thought you might like these.
Miniaturized sharks.
Remember. They're still man-eaters. So
don't be poking your fingers in the bowl.
Take care. If you guys
ever need anything. I'll be there.
Romero.
Ralph, write a thank-you note back to Romero.
Behave, you guys.
No fighting.
- Whatcha doin'?
- Hi, Gerti.
I'm just doing nothing... again.
- What's that?
- Mexican chocolate.
- Where's your mom and dad?
- On an assignment.
It was my idea not to be part of the family business.
They're all on missions.
Your sister, too, huh?
I haven't seen Carmen since Christmas... last year.
You should join back up.
The OSS could really use you.
- Yeah. Use me.
- Not what I meant.
Don't hold on to the past, Juni.
Look at me.
9 years old and nowhere to go but up.
The only tribe worth belonging to is the one that you're born into.
Yeah, your family.
It's good to take care of your family.
But remember one thing.
Everyone's your family.
That makes no sense.
Hello, Juni.
Mr. President.
Oh, you can call me Devlin.
Weren't you already running the country when you were head of the OSS?
I was running the country.
But since the OSS is a secret organization, no one knew it.
I wanted the world to know that I was in charge.
So I became president of the United States.
It all depends upon your preference.
Reality or perception.
Perception works for me.
Well, I'm into reality.
And the reality is, nothing you can say will make me rejoin the OSS.
That is why you called, isn't it?
The OSS needs you to return.
I'm retired.
Well, who's living in perception now?
The fact is there is no retirement.
Once an agent, always an agent.
It's time for you to be a big boy and reinstate.
With all due respect, sir, no.
Then hold on to your seat, because here's the reality:
Your sister's missing.
Taking Agent Cortez to Games and Theory.
That's ex-Agent Cortez.
You know, that one's defective.
Something's wrong with the shape.
See if we can take that one back.
Oh, man.
We're on.
We're on!
Hello, Juni.
Donnagon. Been a good boy lately?
Yes.
Very, very good.
Mrs. Giggles must have straightened you out.
- I certainly did.
- Hello, Francesca.
Yeah, she worked me over pretty good, actually.
- Aah.
- Darling, behave.
What do you know about a video game called Game Over?
I know that just about every kid in the world is gonna sign on and play it.
Not if we can help it.
The game is a trap.
Once plugged into the game, parents won't even be able to get their children's attention.
What else is new?
This is different.
Once you get through the game, your mind belongs to the Toymaker.
The inventor of the game.
He wants to enslave the world's youth with mind control.
You control the youth, you control the future of the world.
She's an ingenious hacker, your sister.
We sent her inside to shut down the game.
But... she disappeared.
How can she disappear inside a game?
She didn't physically.
Actually, she's right here in the building.
Carmen! Carmen!
She can't hear you.
Her mind's still in the game.
She got as far as level four, then nothing.
Why would she even go in there without any backup?
Because her first and only choice wouldn't answer our calls.
So she decided to go alone.
Now, you go in.
Find your sister.
Help her shut down the game in 12 hours, or it's game over for everyone.
Are you with us?
OK.
Then let's go.
So I have to shut down the game but not release the Toymaker?
Exactly. It would be catastrophic if he escaped.
The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning him in cyberspace all these years.
- What made you do that?
- Who knows? It was years ago.
Now, you'll have to start on level one like everyone else.
Find your sister on level four.
Then proceed to level five.
- Which is unwinnable.
- Level five is unwinnable?
Level five is where you shut down the game.
If the game is not shut down, you'll stay trapped with everyone else when the Toymaker takes over the world.
Put on these glasses, and you'll enter the world of the game.
You're being sent into a zero-gravity chamber alongside Carmen.
That should give you a competitive edge.
When you're in the game, things will feel real.
Are they real?
Good luck, Juni.
Find Carmen. Shut down the game.
And whatever you do, don't let the Toymaker out.
Ugh!
Computer-generated.
Low-res!
Carmen.
Carmen. Can you hear me?
It's Juni. Your brother.
Ugh!
Pogo Toads!
Ugh! Ugh!
Aah!
Ugh!
Ha!
Ugh!
Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!
Sorry!
I thought you were a toad.
New player, huh?
Yeah.
New player.
Well, here's a lesson you won't soon forget.
Aah!
How is he?
His brain waves are normal.
But how is he?
Oh. He fell.
Stand up.
You fell three stories.
Aah. I survived?
Not exactly.
That is your life count.
After taking heavy damage. You lose a life.
What happens when I hit zero?
Game over.
When you run out of life. You lose.
No replays. No restarts.
What happened to my 12 hours?
I only have four now.
Time flies when you're playing games.
This is crazy.
Better hurry.
Ugh!
Aah!
So who are you?
I'm Juni Cortez, ex-secret agent of the OSS.
I need to get to level five.
But I only have a few hours before the Toymaker takes over the world.
- Level five?
- Level five is unwinnable.
I understand that.
But I have to save the world.
Rez, this person thinks he's level-five material.
So I hear.
You guys must be beta testers.
One of the first allowed to roam free these coveted digital hills, my friend.
How can I offer service?
I'm Rez.
Hi, Rez.
Now, about saving the world.
If anyone's gonna get to the great prize at level five, it's gonna be one of us.
Whatever.
I want cheat codes.
Back-door entrances.
Shortcuts. Anything.
I can pay you with bonus packs.
Implementation of any form of hack code or cheat boost will trigger an immediate game over and permanent evac from the game.
It's in your tech manual.
You have to play the game by the rules or not at all.
All right.
How do I get to level two as quickly as possible?
Lives are at stake. Please.
See that target? Hit it.
You'll bounce straight to the moon.
Yeah. I'd suggest a running start.
Level two is on the dark side of the moon.
The way to get there is by hitting that target and bouncing to it.
Not a lot of realism in these games, is there?
Won't be seeing him anymore.
Let's go.
Less competition, the better.
Aah!
Aah! Ugh!
Wow!
Aah!
Oh, great.
A message from the OSS.
Do you accept?
Mm-hm.
OK, Juni, we can no longer be of assistance.
What assistance?
You do get one additional lifeline, which you can choose to use now or later.
Now!
Give it to me now.
You get to bring in any one person from the outside to help you on your journey.
Call up the family files.
Assertive. Athletic.

Knows karate.
Wait a minute.
Go back to Grandpa.
Pros: Superior intellect.
Cons: Physically disabled.
He's been paralyzed from the waist down for 30 years.
His energy force would have doubled back again, making his arms, his heart, his brain twice as strong as a normal person.
- What are you thinking. Sir?
- I choose Grandpa.
Selected. One moment.
That was fast. Sort of.
Grandpa!
Juni!
Where am I?
In a video game run by a madman called the Toymaker.
The Toymaker is here?
You know him?
I've been hunting him down for 30 years, Juni.
- You shouldn't have brought me here.
- I needed your help.
We have to find Carmen and shut down the game.
What is that?
It's a power-up of some kind.
Mega Legs.
Give it to me.
Grandpa?
You can walk.
No, Juni.
Oh, I can do more than that.
Wow.
Hmm.
Grandpa?
Hmm.
Where are you going?
Don't wait for me, Juni.
I'll catch up with you.
But we have to find...
Carmen.
Valentin, my old friend.
You think you'll catch me this time, don't you?
Well... you will.
Oh, you will.
Everything falls into place.
Everything falls.
Wow.
A courageous new contestant.
Welcome to the Robocon.
I need to get to level two.
Well, you came to the wrong place.
This is the Arena of Misfortune.
To get to level two, you're gonna have to battle a Mech.
How do I do that?
I'll explain it to you when you get up there.
Hey, there.
Just go out there in your Battle Mech and fight.
Wait a minute.
Who am I fighting?
Her.
Don't get too trashed and I win bonus points.
Right foot, left foot.
Right foot. Oh!
Oh! How do you work this thing?
Ooh.
- Ooh.
OK. I want a good. Clean robo fight.
There will be no kidney punches.
No rabbit punches.
No eye gouging or ear biting.
Unless. Of course. You can't help yourself.
Hi.
I'm Juni.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. He didn't mean it.
Really, really.
No. No, no, no!
Please, no!
Oh!
Ugh!
Hi. I'm Demetra.
Aah!
Help.
Oh! That's gotta hurt.
I'm the winner!
Yeah!
Whoo! Yes!
Well, well, well.
For a kid that doesn't know how to fight, you sure know how to fight.
Congratulations.
And keep the suit.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
So, let's go over this again, shall we?
So there's no mistake.
So there's no gross error.
So there's no lack of communication amongst us.
What I want, what we want...
What do we want?
Our time on this planet is over.
It belongs now to our youth.
Not if we control their minds!
We could start the world over again and cure it of its diseases.
We could begin anew.
Forget what we could do!
It's what we should do!
Am I doing the right thing?
It's not about the right thing.
It's about the smart thing.
Ah.
We won't escape this place otherwise.
I speak for all of us when I say, "We want out!"
Hmm.
The end justifies the means.
You have the children's attention.
The question is, what are you teaching them?
Who are you people?
We are you.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I forget the extent of my programming powers from time to time.
For a moment, I actually believed that you existed.
Goodbye.
Out, out, out.
Out, out.
This childish game will soon be over.
And then the real game will begin.
Hmm.
Will you look at this?
Hold on to your joysticks, boys.
I think we got him.
You're the Guy.
I'm the who?
The Guy.
The guy from the poster.
That guy.
No. Wait a minute.
I'm only looking for my sister.
She's somewhere on level four.
Then I'm heading out through level five.
So you can win the game?
I guess that's one way of putting it.
You see, according to the tech manual, if we find the Guy... the Guy... he'll lead us through the unwinnable level.
Just 'cause he made it out of Robocon in one piece doesn't mean he's the Guy.
He's the first I've seen to make it out with the power suit.
Man, give me a break.
This wimp's a phony.
There's only one way to find out.
Mega Race.
The fastest, most dangerous race in the game world.
- Come on.
- No. Wait.
I already told you I'm not the Guy.
- Go.
- OK.
The race will begin shortly.
Claim your vehicle.
You got to be kidding.
This race will tell us if you're the Guy.
If you are, you can hang with us.
But if you're a phony, Arnold will crush you.
Aah!
I'm not the Guy.
How many times do I have to say it?
There are
no rules in this race.
Except win at any cost.
All right!
We'll try to help you out... as much as we can.
The race will begin... now.
One. Two. Three. Go!
Hmm?
- Easy as pie.
- Juni, push the red button.
The one that says "Do not push"?
Yeah. Push it.
It's a turbo boost.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Aah!
Hey, Rez, give me a hand!
Hey, how about a foot?
Aah! Aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
My turn, sucker.
Aah!
You're supposed to be winning the race, Juni.
Grandpa!
What is this?
Whoa!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Nngh!
Oh!
The glove!
Grab the glove.
The glove!
Ugh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ugh!
Whoa.
Uh-oh.
Aah!
Grab another bike, Juni!
Final stretch!
Five... four...
three... Two... one.
Winner by a hubcap. Juni Cortez!
- I thought you were him.
- I knew it.
I guess you are.
So, I hear you're the Guy.
I am definitely the Guy.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
- So now what, Guy?
- I have to go talk to my grandfather.
To who?
I mean I must confer with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo.
Yeah. OK, cool.
Congratulations. You won the race.
But now they think I'm some important guy who's going to win for them.
For our purposes, that's very good.
They can lead us to level four more quickly, so you can find your sister, so we can shut down the game and make things right.
And so that I can find... the Toymaker.
We're not supposed to get near the Toymaker.
So say the rules of the OSS, which I'm not following.
He might escape.
We can't risk that.
Oh, no, Juni.
I don't plan on letting him go anywhere.
Guy!
We'll talk about this later.
OK. Here it is.
I'm not supposed to lead you to level five.
You're supposed to lead me there.
So you mean we work together?
The wizard said if we all work together, we all win.
With my strength.
My brains.
My cool.
My intuition.
OK. So you're the Guy.
We're all counting on you.
But if you fail us or if you're not who you say you are, this life counter will hit zero faster than you can say "oops."
Deal.
First I got to find my sister.
So level four, people.
Move!
Come on, Grandpa.
He's doing good, huh?
Huh?
Yeah, he's doing great, and that's the problem.
Why?
They've awoken the Programmerz.
What?
- Pull him out of there now.
- Too late.
All right. This is cool.
We'll get there in no time.
What is this?
Wait a minute.
The Programmerz.
Who are these Programmerz?
The brainiacs who wrote the book for the game.
So, they work for the Toymaker, huh?
Programmerz are the reason you found us on level one.
They caught Francis cheating during the Mega Race.
They'll bounce us back to level one again if they catch us.
Level one? I don't have time for that.
Spread out.
Don't split up! It never works!
If we just stick together...
All right, Grandpa.
I guess it's just you and me.
Hello?
Grandpa?
- Psst!
- Aah!
Can you at least try and act like you're the Guy?
You know my secret?
I've seen the real Guy, and you're not him.
Why are Programmerz chasing us?
Someone's got a game cheat.
What's this?
A map to the game.
This is illegal.
You want to find your sister or not?
Give me the map.
- OK.
- Wow.
We're in Machine City.
If we cut across here, we'll be able to reach level four.
Where Carmen is.
Right.
Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain, we'll be right at the door of the unwinnable level.
Shortcuts. This is good.
This is very good.
Game cheats.
That's against the rules.
We're gonna have to bounce you back to level one.
- Aah!
- You can't scare us. He's the Guy.
Grandpa!
Listen to that, Edog.
The Guy is calling his grandpa.
I'm so scared.
Come and get me, Gramps.
What's he gonna do, drool on us?
Why are you picking on my grandson?
Why?
They got Logos and Edog, the leaders.
You are Programmerz?
Let's see what you really look like, huh?
Very unimpressive.
Computer nerds.
Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?
Grandpa... uh, Wizard, put them down!
He's good.
The boy warrior is very, very good.
But he's got to keep going.
We run the risk of discouraging him if the next levels are too challenging.
But only by seeking challenges can we hope to find the best in ourselves.
Can we help him?
No! It's against the rules of the game!
This isn't a game.
It's life!
I don't mind talking to myself.
But when you guys start to cut me out of the conversation, that's when it gets a little strange.
That's it.
More life is what we need.
We'll grant the boy a gift.
The gift of life.
Don't worry, Guy.
From here on out, I'll protect you.
Are you all right, Guy?
Hey. He found a life pack.
A what?
That's rare.
I've never seen one up close before.
What do I do?
Crush it in your hands.
You'll gain life.
How much?
All depends.
I got extra life, Demetra.
Congratulations.
You'll need it the most.
I want you to take it.
Juni, I can't.
Does he know what that's worth?
Of course he does.
I owed you from the Robot Arena.
Also, I don't want anything to happen to you.
Thank you.
You have now entered level three.
I wish my family could see this amazing place.
What are you doing in the game, Arnold?
Well, actually, I got in on a beta tester's visa.
I'm here for the great prize behind level five.
It'll save my family from poverty.
But what waits for us in level five?
I mean, is it all true?
Untold riches?
Arnold, you should know that when we reach the end of the game...
No. Don't tell me.
I want it to be a surprise.
- I'm sure it will be.
Attention. Gamers!
Stand on the red line.
Choose your best player.
The Guy.
The Guy's the best.
Choose your strongest player.
That'd be Arnold.
Survival of the fittest.
Face your opponent.
Wait a minute.
I'm not fighting Arnold.
I don't want to crush Juni.
The winner shall proceed
with the others to level four.
The loser shall be given
an immediate game over
and will be evacuated
permanently from the game.
Arnold, I have to save my sister.
I'm sorry, Juni.
But I have my own family to think about.
I can't beat you, Arnold.
I know.
Fight!
Aah!
Not that I'm rooting for anyone in particular, but that was a really cool move.
Aah!
Nice knowing you, Juni.
Arnold, please!
- Unh!
What's going on?
You've been tagged.
What do you mean, I've been tagged?
Someone has switched places with you.
Not me, Guy.
Demetra, what are you doing?
You have to find your sister, Juni.
Don't! Don't do it!
Demetra, no!
Fight!
- No!
- Aah!
Demetra. Game over!
I never even got her e-mail address.
Don't fall in love with a game, Juni.
Let's get out of here.
Sorry, Juni.
My family.
You are causing so much pain.
And only I can stop you.
For I know why you do these things...
Toymaker.
Bring it on.
Find me, and the world will truly pay the price.
Here in my cyberprison
I was forced to create.
Now I will destroy.
Release the girl.
Put her back in the game.
But, sir...
Oh, you have a better solution, don't you?
Of course you do. You all do.
So tell me.
What is the real answer?
- I'm so curious.
- Revenge.
- Healing.
- Destruction!
- Love.
- Hate.
Uh-huh.
Well, once again, you're all correct.
And once again, you're all incorrect.
On with the game.
You are now entering level four.
Level four? Wait a minute.
Carmen's on this level.
I'll use telepathy.
We might be close enough that it'll work.
Carmen. Can you hear me?
What?
This game plays tricks.
Tell me something
only Carmen would say.
My feet stink.
You sound close.
I am.
I see you brought Grandpa into the game.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Juni!
The Toymaker's the guy who put Grandpa in the wheelchair
30 years ago.
Exactly.
If Grandpa tries to take revenge, the Toymaker will break free.
He's that powerful.
Then we have to convince Grandpa that revenge is not the way to solve it.
OK, Guy. We found your pal.
Now, where are we going, exactly?
Where's level five?
First of all, you don't ask the questions around here.
I do. Second of all...
- We're going to Lava Mountain.
- We are?
Beyond that is the passage to level five.
I don't think so.
Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert.
We're following the Guy.
You know, Juni, we don't need these guys following us.
Not where we're going.
I promised them they could tag along.
Look, this is how I know where to go.
Trust me.
Lava Mountain.
Why is it that every video game has lava in it?
Technically, that's not true.
There's no lava in Halo.
And in Metroid, it's molten magma.
Can't touch the lava, or it's game over.
But I have six lives left.
Doesn't matter.
You fall in, you lose.
The game's getting tougher, guys.
This is impossible.
What do you think, Grandpa?
Difficult.
Let's go another way.
Follow me, boys.
This doesn't make any sense.
I give them a map.
I give them the girl.
What more do they want?
Can't I just lead them to the door?
Impossible, sir.
The way the game's A.I. Works is...
I know. I know.
Can I just talk to myself at least?
You are talking to yourself.
I am you.
Well, then, you, me, shut up.
So be it.
Am I insane?
Completely.
They're going the wrong way.
I have to drive them to level five.
Send in the Tinker Toys.
Finding another path.
Now, this is good thinking.
She's good.
We should listen to her more often.
- Stay off my side.
- OK.
What is this?
Tinker Toys!
Wait! What's worse, lava or Tinker Toys?
Definitely Tinker Toys.
Carmen, what do we do?
Whoa!
Ugh!
Uh-oh!
Whoo-hoo!
Rip that wave, Juni.
What are they doing?
They're straying from the path.
The Toymaker must be pushing them towards his lair.
But why?
What could he gain from...
Check if there's a connection between the grandfather and the Toymaker.
Hurry, people!
It's coming on-screen.
Comrades turned enemies.
Grandpa's gonna break the Toymaker out of the game.
Stop them.
Stir the lava. Bigger waves.
Lava monsters. Anything.
We have to create obstacles for them.
Come on!
We have to drown them.
They'll get a game over and be evacuated from the game.
We can't risk letting the Toymaker out.
Do it.
This is new.
Juni!
Carmen!
Francis!
Arnold!
Grandpa!
Me.
Aah!
Where are they?
They fell in.
I know, but they should have gotten a game over.
They should be back here, actually.
Hmm.
Huh?
The lava. It's cold.
This way. Juni. This way.
We found a door to the next level.
Come on.
I thought I was a goner.
I saw all my points flashing away before my eyes.
All I could hear was my father saying, "You blew it, Arnold."
"No untold riches for you."
Uhh!
Where's Grandpa?
I don't know. But he was here.
Isn't this a piece of his armor?
Carmen, it's a passage.
Help me open it.
Red flag, Rez.
We have to talk about the Guy.
Highly sensitive.
What about him?
I've been rereading my tech manual.
It speaks of a deceiver within the game, who will mislead you down a path where no one will survive.
I think Juni's the deceiver.
What do you suggest?
We'll have to get rid of him or risk losing the game.
What about his sister?
Her too.
- How much time do we have left?
- Five minutes.
What happens in five minutes?
This place gets flooded with players from around the world.
Oh, great. Competition.
The Toymaker will take over their minds.
That's why we have to shut down the game.
- Sh, Carmen!
- What is she talking about?
You didn't tell them yet, did you?
I was getting around to it.
Deceivers.
What about the other side of level five?
There is no other side.
You'll be imprisoned in the game.
Game over.
We're not letting you shut down this game.
You're gonna see how fast that counter can count backwards.
You have to go through me first, game boy.
Now, listen to me.
I'm the Guy.
Stop saying you're the Guy.
We all know that you're not the Guy.
He's not the Guy.
I am.
And you are?
I'm the Guy.
The real Guy.
And I say we go in, beat this unwinnable level, and get to the other side, where untold riches and a bounty fit for 10 kings awaits us.
I knew it.
Now, he's definitely the Guy.
But it's unwinnable.
Nothing is unwinnable if we join together and battle as one.
We play on each other's strengths and help cover each other's weaknesses.
We can accomplish anything.
And we will accomplish everything.
But first let's go whip this unwinnable level and show it who's boss.
Are you with me?
Yeah!
Stand aside.
Cake.
Aah! Aah!
Oh!
Oh, my.
Oops.
Guy!
OK. You're the Guy again.
Get us through this, Juni.
But I...
Demetra!
Juni, quickly!
I found the switch to shut down the game.
I also found the exit portal.
We can all get out of here right now.
How did you survive?
There was a glitch in the game.
I don't know.
Juni, who is this?
This is Demetra, my girlf...
My friend.
No, she's my...
I'm his girlfriend.
Who are you?
I'm his sister.
She gave me the map.
The map that got us here.
Juni, she's not real.
What are you talking about?
I've been helping Juni win the game.
What have you been doing?
Playing prisoner. That's what.
She set you up, Juni.
She set us all up.
I... Juni, she's lying.
She's been the Toymaker's prisoner.
She could be brainwashed, for all we know.
Do you want to win this game or not?
She's the reason this level's unwinnable.
She's the deceiver.
Why?
I'm sorry, Juni.
But it's in my programming.
Congratulations!
You've made it to the end
of the game! You won!
Untold riches for all of you!
And your prize
is you get to stay... here.
Welcome to the game.
Juni, this way.
This is the way out.
All of you, quickly!
Wait!
We have to shut down the game.
I already did.
The switch is right there.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes.
Go. Quickly, quickly.
Run, Grandpa!
Go. I'll hold it open.
Go now!
Demetra.
I can't hold it open forever, Juni.
We made it.
Here's our e-mail addresses.
Just in case.
Terrific.
You're awesome, Grandpa.
The way you took on those Tinker Toys.
You're the coolest.
Thanks for everything, Guy.
It was real. Sort of.
- Thanks a lot, Guy.
What's wrong?
You don't want to leave, do you?
How can I go back, Juni?
In here, I can walk.
I can run.
And you look at me like I'm some kind of superhero.
You are.
Out there in the real world, to me.
You are.
All right, Juni.
I shall go back if... if you promise me that even though I'll be in a wheelchair, that you will look at me no differently than you are now.
Because on the inside, Juni, on the inside, I feel like this.
I promise, Grandpa.
Time to go.
Coming through.
Coming through, please.
Those video games are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?
Agent Cortez, we'll take it from here.
My grandson will handle this.
Don't touch.
This is Corinthian leather.
OK.
So tell me again how you shut off the game.
I don't know if we shut it down, exactly.
We hit a switch, and it seemed to work.
Oh, it worked.
The game's down.
We just need to make sure we did this correctly.
Actually, Grandpa hit the switch.
Cortez, are these the boys that were in the game with you?
We tracked them through their e-mail addresses.
Yeah, that's them.
They wouldn't know anything about...
Hey, wait a second.
What happened to Francis the Brain,
Arnold the Strong, and Mr. Cool?
Well, in the real world, I'm not that smart.
I'm not strong.
I'm not cool.
Reality check.
So who are you out here in the real world?
Special Agent Cortez, we need you.
Whoa.
I'm just Juni Cortez.
Let's have it, Grandpa.
What switch did you hit exactly?
There were two switches side by side.
One switch shuts down the game.
But the other releases the Toymaker.
Who was the idiot who designed that?
Did you free the Toymaker by accident?
Oh, I freed the Toymaker.
But it was no accident.
Do you want to stop the game?
Then you must defeat the Toymaker.
It's the only way.
You crazy old man!
Do you know what you've done?
Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything.
Will you trust me?
You of all people?
A message from the president.
Oh, what does he want?
I'm coming back to settle the score.
For imprisoning me.
For using me.
Devlin set us up?
It's not Devlin.
All I wanted to do was right the wrongs.
Start over a new world.
A new chance.
Where everyone would get
a second chance!
But no.
So now I'm taking this
to the next level!
Seismic activity off the map!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Earthquake!
Tornado!
Hurricane!
Carmen, let's go!
Everybody, relax!
Quick! Put your glasses on.
It's the only way you can see what's really happening.
The game has entered the real world.
There's only one thing to do in a situation like this.
What?
Call in the family.
Calling all Cortezes.
This is it. This is it.
This is it.
The moment we've been waiting for.
Yes.
Nobody move. Nobody move!
Nobody touch the brain.
The fifth brain.
This is a historic moment.
Probably the...
Probably the most important...
No.
This is the most important moment of my life.
No one can disturb me now.
I must activate the brain.
Now.
- Mr. Cortez?
- Eh?
Your children called.
Some sort of emergency.
Well, I'm their uncle.
Dad, you need these to see.
Glasses, quick!
Incoming.
This won't be easy.
Let's kick some metal.
What about all the other ones?
We need more help.
Our family isn't big enough.
Remember one thing.
Everyone's your family.
Calling... everyone.
We're here to save the day.
Floop and Minion!
Robot children!
Take 'em down!
Dinky Winks!
Somebody ring the Dinkster?
Whoa!
You're gonna make a nice addition to my theme park.
Game over for you, pal.
Game over!
Somebody call in a loon?
Sorry, Romero, this is the only pair we had left.
They're a little broken.
They're perfect.
Charge, Sporky!
Brand him, Daddy.
Thanks, Little Dink.
- Unh!
- Unh!
Gary Giggles?
- Yeah?
- Carmen Cortez.
I need your help right away.
I'm there.
I'm here.
Give me a hand.
Whoa.
- Unh!
- Thanks.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thank you, Gerti.
There's still one more.
That's impossible.
Someone has to go up there.
And shut it down manually.
It's the only way.
But who?
I'm ready.
It must be done.
Grandpa, no!
Let him go.
Your grandfather has to do this.
Thank you for freeing me,
Valentin, but it's too late.
Nothing can stop me. Not even you.
That's true. Only you can do that.
You double-crossed us.
The agency, your fellow agents, and me.
Your mistake cost me my legs.
Well, a mistake like that could only push someone further into the dark.
And it has.
Look at you now.
I gave you back your legs in the game.
I did that for you.
Let me tell you all the things
I've missed in my life because of the accident you caused.
I can't walk on the beach with my wife.
I missed my daughter's birth.
And wedding.
Shall I continue?
Grandpa.
Don't.
Now let me tell you all the good things that came of it.
Humility.
Spirituality.
Understanding.
You've been living in fear of me all these years.
But I've only been searching for you so I could tell you that I forgive you.
I've only dreamed I would hear you say something like that.
Now the question is, can you forgive yourself?
It's never too late, Sebastian.
Take your time.
Take your time to decide.
We have about 10 seconds.
Game... over.
Juni, get out of there!
Grandpa!
So, wait a minute.
Who won?
It's not whether you win or lose.
It's how you play the game.
To family.
To family.
- To family.
- To family.
- To family.
- To family.
- To family.
- To family.
To family.
To family.
- To family.
- To family.
To family.
- Family.
- Familia.
- To family.
- To family.
To family.
And break!
## The time has come
## Once and for all
## You met your match
## You will fall
## This little game we play
is gonna break us down
## Only one of us can wear the crown
## It's not as easy as you thought it'd be
## When it's down to you versus me
## I play rough
## I don't need to try
## You like to play mean
## But the score never lies
## Game over
## Game over
## Game over
## For now
- Like Valentin.
- Like Valentin.
Val. More like that? Valentin.
Hey, how you doin', Valentin?
Hey, I know.
All right. Here we go.
Settle, please.
Yo, Valentin!
What are you doin' in space?
You...
OK.
Oh!
Take 'em down!
OK. Fists. Good.
What else is new?
This is different.
Once you get through the game, your mind belongs to the Toymaker.
Aah!
Let's do it again right away.
I'm coming back to settle the score.
For imprisoning me.
For using me.
That might be the end of my career right there.
## Game over
## Game over
## Game over
## For now
## Winning the game's
## The only rule allowed
## No more good luck
## Or cheers from the crowd
## When the game began
you never thought you'd lose
## But your time is up
## I play to bruise
## Look around. In fact.
You've lost your team
## You tried your best.
But you ran out of steam
## I play rough
## I don't need to try
## You like to play mean
## But the score never lies
## You're all out of wishes
## Kiss your dreams goodbye
## The end's the same
## It's not whether you win or lose
## It's how you play the game
## Game over

## Is that all you got?
## Come on
## Unh-unh
## Bring it on
## Game over
## Game over
## Game over

## Game over...
## I'm trying to figure out
the rules. I don't lose
## I'm tested. I've already seen
some bad dudes
## Do what's in your nature.
Don't let 'em break you
## Plan to win if they're
raising the stakes up
## Now. You can take
a few bumps and bruises
## I'm confident. I'm telling you.
You will not lose this
## Life force is dwindling.
You're barely alive
## Time to let go of the wheel
and let your heart drive
## Just let your heart drive

## Come on. Come on
## Just let your heart drive
## Just let your heart drive
## That's right. That's right
## Just let your heart drive

Dad, he's imitating me.
- Do that again.
- Dad, he's imitating me.
He sounds just like you, honey.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
That's better.
Thank you, dear.
That's better.
Thank you, dear.
How long have you known?
Since forever.
Mom made me swear not to mention it.
So why are you mentioning it?
'Cause she also told me never to swear, so now we're even.
How's that for even?
You're on your own.
Hey, wait!
I warned you!

~Grupo Utopia~ www.grupoutopia.cjb.net
NARRATOR: This is a story of the past... and the future.
We will come to the future, but first, the past.
NARRATOR:
Here we have the Earl of Warwick.
We can see by his petulantly arched brow... that he is not en route to a good deed.
WITCH: Mmm.
Obey!
Enchanted...
Do you wish to live, old witch?
You have committed grave crimes against God and your king, have you not?
- Have mercy, my lord.
- Silence.
The Frenchman Count Thibault of Malfete... shall wed Lady Rosalind, the daughter of our king.
I desire that woman.
Hmm.
I alone am fit to take her hand.
WITCH: And her castle, lands, the riches that are her dowry.
Thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous, old hag.
Tomorrow night... the king shall feast the arrival of the count.
I want the count dead before the feast is over.
EARL: A small fortune in gold... awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding.
Not so fast.
How shall I know thy magic is sufficient to the task?
WITCH:
Does thou find proof enough in this?
EARL: Aah!
That will do!
Take it, witch!
Was that proof enough, my lord?
Come to the king's castle tomorrow night... and carry out my plan.
If you fail... you will be burned.
Ohh!
NARRATOR:
Our hero, of course, knew none of this.
He was safely in his entourage... traveling, he thought, to his wedding.
Here he is... the Count of Malfete.
He is also a duke, a baron, and a lord.
A nobleman, plagued by only those small things... which inconvenience a knight... the permanent presence of his sisters... his mother and father... and, as all knights must endure... an idiot servant, Andre... whose smell made people faint... a considerable achievement... among a population who never bathed.
FATHER: Down, peasant!
NARRATOR: The duke, or Thibault... as his subjects were not allowed to call him... was joyous.
The long-awaited day of his marriage had come at last.
WOMAN: What have we got here?
Another lot of bloody royal bastards?
MAN: Must be that French duke come to marry the king's daughter.
Mind the forest!
There be dragons who'll make dinner from your bones in there!
NARRATOR:
Andre loved and protected his master.
Master! Master!
The forest... it is haunted!
NARRATOR: Thibault responded.
ANDRE: Thank you, master.
NARRATOR: With every step... he came closer to the castle of his beloved.
He hoped he would be with her soon... for rare was the journey in which Thibault... did not have to stop and rescue someone.
NARRATOR: This was no exception...
For like his ancestors... he lived by an ancient family rule...
ANDRE: A woman in distress!
NARRATOR: The only one he knew.
WOMAN: Aah! Aah!
Beware, sire.
NARRATOR: Courage was more than a duty.
Courage was his creed.
Aah!
MOTHER: Andre! Join your master!
FATHER: I'm talking to you!
Go, go! Stupid peasant!
Sire! Behind you!
Ohh!
NARRATOR: Naturally...
THIBAULT: Courage is our creed!
NARRATOR: He was invincible.
NARRATOR: Except he was not invincible... against witchcraft.
For this would be his last victory... in this millennium.
MAN: Afternoon, sir.
ROSALIND: I hear a rumor... thou art marrying tomorrow, my lord.
I have heard this rumor.
I have also heard... the bride is the most beautiful in all of England.
But it is not true.
- It is not?
- No.
Am I not the most beautiful bride... in all of England?
THIBAULT: No. Wait.
The most beautiful bride... in all the world.
Wear this for me, Thibault.
Wear it against thine heart.
Thou shalt always be true.
WOMAN: Lady Rosalind.
Thou shalt not disgrace thyself... before the wedding.
ROSALIND:
I must hide and dress for the banquet.
Ooh ooh ohh!
Sire, your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow.
Silence, you impudent peasant.
Show respect to your future mistress.
ANDRE: Yes, master.
Ah! Thank you, my lord.
Quite so, Your Majesty.
When our lady drinks her wine... her eyes will fill with hellish visions.
WITCH:
The count will appear as a hideous beast.
Then my magic will compel her to kill him. Ha ha ha.
KING: My dear friends and noble guests.
Thibault, Count of
Malfete and Papincourt...
I hereby declare this castle a wedding present.
THIBAULT: Hear ye!
Your Majesty, in every way that I am able...
I will serve my beautiful lady... and do honor to thy kingdom.
Drink of my cup... and you will know my thoughts.
ROSALIND: And thou wilt know mine.
(GURGLING) Ah!
My lord?
- Ah!
- Thibault!
ROSALIND: My lord!
Ohh!
THIBAULT: Ohh!
Aah!
What is it, Thibault?
FATHER:
This is not the kind of behavior...
What is happening to you, my son?
Are you crazy? Drunk?
Count Thibault, this is no way to behave... in an English court!
Beasts from Hell!
ROSALIND: Ohh! That is my mother!
Thibault, that is my mother!
Demon!
Oh, no!
THIBAULT: No! What have I done?
It is not me. It is witchcraft!
THIBAULT: Andre, find me a wizard!
France must pay for this treachery.
THIBAULT: Find me a wizard!
PRIEST: Have pity on a poor condemned man.
ANDRE: We are here for the last rites.
ANDRE: My lord! We have to hurry.
What wizard is this?
He's English, my lord.
But his magic is very good.
Your bloody Earl of Warwick did this to me.
Indeed he did.
And he'd have me, too, if he knew that I was here.
I beg you, my sire. Let him save you.
Can you bring my lady back from the dead?
I can reanimate her corpse... but I don't think that my lord... would like the way she looks... or smells.
There is another way.
Time is like a mountain.
Riddled with tunnels.
I can open one of these tunnels for thee... and return thee to the moment before the murder.
If thy will is strong enough.
Don't you think this priest has had enough time?
Hurry up, Father.
GUARD: Unlock this door! Now!
Drink this potion, my lord... and thou shalt descend into the Mountain of Time.
Ohh! It smells awful.
You should not drink that.
What if you become a frog, or goat's feet?
You are right.
Drink first, bastard.
THIBAULT:
And if you die, I will avenge your death.
GUARD: What are you doing in there?
GUARD: Open this door!
Open this door!
It tastes like the shit of the pork.
And he should know.
Ohh.
Per Horus et per Ra...
WIZARD: Et per Salem... invictus...
Ducere!
I forgot the grouse eggs.
Oh, it's a disaster.
I've lost them in the corridors of Time.
GUARD: Open this door! Open this door!
BOY: Wow. Cool!
GIRL: This is cool.
This is pretty cool, yeah. Look at them!
TEACHER: Shh.
See the peasant sleeping on the floor?
In those days, people didn't think... that peasants deserved any better than that... and they were considered the property of their masters.
Now, the boss of this peasant is the knight.
TEACHER: See how beautiful the knight's clothing is?
Miss Rodett, that one is hot, and it just snorted!
(CHUCKLES) Now, Tammy, that's impossible... because they're just mannequins... and mannequins don't snort.
TAMMY: Well, that one just did.
No, because they're not real.
They're just like... dolls.
TEACHER: Ah! Oh, shit!
What are you doing in my chamber?
Aah!
ANDRE: Your chamber... has been cleaved in half, my lord.
This is not the castle!
THIBAULT: What?
ANDRE: Oh, look at this, my sire!
It is Satanic!
Ohh.
THIBAULT:
This is Hell, and we are condemned souls.
Come. We shall find the prince of this netherworld... and beg his mercy.
ANDRE: Wait for me, my lord!
Dr. Brady, come quick.
GUARD: Two guys with swords and armor...
Miller, you're always overreacting.
BRADY: Now, relax.
There's absolutely no need to...
MILLER: Police are on their way.
Peasant, please.
Show me the way out of this prince castle!
Yes!
- Pee-yoo!
- Out this way.
- They stink!
- Have a nice day.
- Bye. Good luck.
- Wait!
Peasant! Wait! Stop!
THIBAULT: What is this? The Gates of Hell!
ANDRE: Look at its eyes of fire!
ANDRE: Dragon! It's a red dragon!
THIBAULT: Attack!
What the hell are you doing?
ANDRE: Take that, beast!
ANDRE: We have killed it!
THIBAULT:
Ah, yes. It is no longer breathing.
God is punishing us for practicing the Black Arts.
Let us pray for forgiveness.
Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins.
ANDRE:
We are so, so, so, so, so... so sorry.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Dr. Brady?
Ah, Julia. This is Julia Malfete... who heads up the Medieval Art department.
She donated the famous
12th century castle exhibit.
Julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men.
That stuff right there is the result of the body search.
The big guy had the gold coins... the sword, the shield, and that ring.
The little guy had the salt pork... the sausage, the dagger... a molar.
And that box... which he probably stole.
Not from us.
JULIA: Most thieves take valuable things.
They usually don't bring them.
This is a Gothic pixis... the kind of design they were making in Canterbury... at the end of the 12th century.
It has emeralds and rubies.
BRADY: Why did the two men sleep here?
They could've booked a suite at the Ritz.
So, you said that you got these out of their pockets?
OFFICER: That's right.
Except the sausage.
- (FLIES BUZZING)
- Hmm. Mm-hmm.
JULIA: This stamp ring is fantastic.
My family's coat of arms.
Sergeant, can I meet these thieves?
ANDRE: Master, I'm hungry.
My tummy rumbles like a beast.
How can you think of food after such tragedy?
Yes.
What I would not give to see once more my precious...
ANDRE: My lord! Look, she's alive!
THIBAULT: Rosalind. My fair Rosalind.
My bride. My ravishing flower.
Mistress! My mistress!
What are you doing?
THIBAULT: It is a miracle. A miracle.
Do I know you?
Do you not recognize me, my lady?
I am the Count of
Malfete and Papincourt... the Duke of Anjou.
I am your faithful Thibault.
You're who?
And I am Andre le Pate, valet of the count.
Please, forgive me for what I did to you... my dear Rosalind.
My name isn't Rosalind. It's Julia.
No! You are my Rosalind.
The lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day.
I carry it over my heart.
Please, my love, see for yourself.
You see?
It is the color of wheat on a summer's day.
The color of candlelight.
THIBAULT: It is your own.
BRADY: Stop this!
- That's enough!
- Rosalind!
You'll be safer outside!
THIBAULT:
Do not leave me! Do not be afraid!
- BRADY: You don't want to see this.
- (YELLING AND FIGHTING)
THIBAULT: Courage is our creed!
Courage is our creed!
Wait, stop! I know this man!
"Courage is our creed."
JULIA: That's our family motto.
This man is my cousin.
It's in here.
You see, I thought he was dead.
He disappeared when a storm... capsized his yacht during the Admiral's Cup.
They never recovered his body... so, of course, declared him dead.
He was a very distant
French cousin of mine... but as the last living Malfete,
I inherited his estate.
OFFICER: If he's your cousin, what do you want me to do with him?
ANDRE: Sire...
Why does Lady Rosalind call herself Julia... and allow us to be beaten and chained?
Peasant... this is not our time.
THIBAULT:
The wizard did not send us into the past.
He sent us into the next millennium.
We are thirty generations removed from Malfete.
Julia is not my beloved.
She's my descendant.
Descendant?
Amber, it's Julia.
Could you get me Hunter? It's important.
AMBER: That rabbit of yours is on the phone again.
HUNTER: Hey, bunny. What's up?
JULIA: Thibault Malfete just showed up at the museum.
HUNTER: Thibault Malfete?
That's impossible.
Isn't he supposed to be...
- I know.
- Are you sure it's him?
He looks exactly like his photos.
JULIA: Hunter, he quoted the family motto.
Does he know yet that we're selling his entire estate?
JULIA:
Well, it's hard to say what he knows.
He's a little strange.
Hunter, this is terrible.
I mean, it's wonderful that he's alive... but it's terrible that we started to sell the estate.
Oh, God, I feel awful.
HUNTER:
The English courts declared him dead.
We're well within our legal rights.
How were we supposed to know he was still alive?
Has he mentioned anything about money?
JULIA: Money?
How can you worry about money at a time like this?
No, I'm just worrying about you.
You don't handle surprises well.
Where is your cousin now?
He and this friend of his are downstairs with security.
Why don't we bring them home with us tonight?
He's family after all.
We want to be hospitable.
You're wonderful.
I'll pick you all up in about five minutes.
Love ya. Bye, bunny.
Bye, big bear.
Oh, my God.
Thibault Malfete's still alive.
This is a disaster.
Blah, blah, blah.
You're pouting.
I hate it when you call her bunny.
You, my dear, are so much hotter than a bunny.
My God, look at yourself.
You're a tigress.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Aah!
THIBAULT: Lady Julia, there has been a terrible mistake.
I'm so sorry. We thought you were dead.
Dead? No, the wizard was a fool, but not a killer.
THIBAULT: He only sent us the wrong way.
Excuse me?
We fell into the Mountain of Time.
Wow.
THIBAULT:
I must return to my time to prevent... a great tragedy to our family.
THIBAULT: I ask for your assistance.
I'll do whatever I can.
(SIRENS, HORNS,
AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT)
Ohh!
- Awful.
- Ohh.
Whoa!
ANDRE: We must not go out!
What... what are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, we have to wait outside.
Hunter can't park here.
We have to wait for him.
Oh, my God.
Bloody coward.
JULIA: We have to...
Those boys are lost.
I must go and retrieve them.
Ah!
Aah!
This is England?
- No...
- Meat!
This is Chicago.
Meat, meat, meat!
This is the United States.
ANDRE: Meat!
The last I remember was in Sussex, England... in my castle chambers.
You don't remember anything since then?
No.
Do you think maybe you've suffered... some sort of memory loss from the accident?
Yes! After I drank the potion,
I remember nothing.
- Onions?
- All of them!
All right. You like to eat hot dogs, huh?
I like to eat every kind of dog.
VENDER: Now, what are you doing?
- Aargh!
- Leave the dogs!
JULIA: No, no, no. Stop it!
Please, stop.
I'm sorry, I'm so very sorry.
JULIA: He's French.
Yeah. Very.
Hi, honey.
The situation's much worse than I thought.
What are you talking about?
Bonjour.
Holy shit.
JULIA: Hunter, this is Thibault Malfete.
Thibault, this is my fiancé, Hunter.
HUNTER: Pleased to meet you.
- Are you noble?
- No. Sorry.
But I can certainly tell that you are.
JULIA:
And this is Andre, Thibault's assistant.
Hello, big nose.
THIBAULT: Run behind the chariot, peasant.
Yes, master!
JULIA: He can't run behind the car.
- THIBAULT: He cannot ride. He's not noble.
- JULIA: Yes, but he has to ride in the car.
- He's very fast.
- We're taking the freeway.
- You can run 70 miles an hour?
- I have good boots.
JULIA:
No. You must sit in the car, please.
- I am fast.
- I'm sure you are.
I'd love to see you run sometime.
- Obey.
- Yes, my lord.
Do you want some dog?
Too fast.
Are you OK, Mr. Pate?
THIBAULT: Ohh. Too fast!
Honey, could you slow down just a little bit?
HUNTER: I'm going 22 miles an hour.
Yes, I know. Could you try going 21?
DRIVER: Hey, what's the matter with you?
You don't know how to drive?
HUNTER: Go.
What?
It's gonna be fine.
Oh, dear. (CLEARS THROAT)
HUNTER: Get in and open the door.
Let's go inside.
Hi, sweetie. Hello, Churchill.
Hello. Come here. Give Mom a high-five.
All right. That's my boy.
Let's go.
ANGELIQUE: Like the hat.
WOMAN: Angelique! I need you now!
Come here, peasant.
- Come now!
- OK, I'm coming.
WOMAN: Hurry up.
THIBAULT: Ahh.
THIBAULT: How did you do that?
THIBAULT: Night.
(CHUCKLES) Day.
THIBAULT: Night. Day!
I do not have this invention in my castle.
JULIA: You don't have power?
I have the power to judge and condemn to death... any villain on my land.
Oh. Really?
Hunter will be so jealous.
I'm gonna get you two something to drink.
Make Hunter one of his power-dude smoothie things.
I'd offer you one... but nobody seems to like them but him.
Andre, could you please stop that?
I'm just starting to feel like I'm in a disco.
THIBAULT: My dear lady... you said you would offer me your assistance.
JULIA:
Oh, yes. Anything. What do you need?
I need to find a wizard.
ANDRE: Aah! Sorry, master. Sorry!
- Sorry!
- Idiot!
Apologize to the lady!
Oops.
ANDRE: Sorry, master. I ask for mercy.
Forgive him, milady.
JULIA: It's OK. The floor needed to be cleaned anyway.
So, you were saying something about what... should we say a wizard?
I need to go back into the tunnels of Time.
Of course.
I need to just understand what has happened to you.
Now, your yacht went down in a storm?
No. You must listen.
I am from the time of Thibault VI... and I have come to the future.
OK. Tunnels of Time. Wizards. Thibault VI.
JULIA: Oops!
Are you OK?
Yes, lady.
THIBAULT: Lovely flower,
I see you do not believe me.
It is a pity, but please... try.
ANDRE: Oh.
Yes. Of course I'll try.
ANDRE: She's green.
I never really did like the taste of this.
Oh, my God. What happened?
JULIA: Nothing.
I'm eating this very good meat... with vegetables in a fine sauce.
I will shit easy tomorrow.
JULIA: It's jet lag.
All right, I'm sure you would like to wash your hands and whatever else.
Why don't you come with me?
All right. Here you go.
Just gonna take this.
Julia! Can I talk to you for a moment, please?
Don't be bashful with the soap.
What is it, master? A throne?
THIBAULT: It could be.
HUNTER: They're crazy!
JULIA:
They have been through a terrible ordeal.
They have amnesia.
Amnesia? They're wacked!
They're completely retarded.
They're... Woo! You know?
- Clean water.
- Ha ha!
The long towel has a good fragrance.
Thibault is my cousin, Hunter.
He's my family.
Yeah? I'm not so sure.
He doesn't strike me as being particularly noble.
Julia, come down here! It's an emergency.
- Very good fountain.
- Yes.
Your French relatives are bathing in the toilet.
Oh, my God.
Toothbrushes.
I'll just leave them right here.
JULIA: I'll be right back.
JULIA: I'm going to take a shower... then go tackle that kitchen.
HUNTER:
Hurry. Our dinner reservation's at 8:00.
JULIA: Oh! Where are we going?
Latour.
Isn't that just a little formal for our guests?
First you tell me your cousin's nobility then you get mad at me when I suggest... that just maybe, he's not.
Now you're upset because I pick the best restaurant in town.
You make it impossible for me to do the right thing.
No. You're right. Latour's gonna be great.
Thank you, big bear.
- I'll be in the shower.
- All right.
ANDRE: Ah. Very good flavor.
This is not wine, ignorant peasant.
THIBAULT: It is oil for the bath.
Mmm. Very good perfume.
ANDRE: Very creamy.
THIBAULT: Bathe, servant.
No, my sire. I have taken a bath at Christmas.
- Bathe!
- No, no!
I'm afraid! I don't want to catch cold and die!
THIBAULT: Be silent, peasant!
Ahh.
Do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for Andre?
HUNTER: Do you realize the bath you just took cost over $2,000?
That's American dollars.
Is that a lot?
HUNTER: Yes, it is.
Then I will repay you with one of my swans.
HUNTER: Oh, well. That sounds fair.
THIBAULT:
My family tree. So many descendants.
- Hello?
- Mr. Cassidy, please.
Yeah. Hold on one second. Hunter?
HUNTER: Yeah, bunny?
Honey, it's your office.
Do you want to take it?
- I'll take it upstairs.
- Oh, OK.
AMBER: Hello? Hello?
ANDRE: Hello.
AMBER: Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
I'm Andre le Pate. I have big balls... and my ass breathes fire.
Wow. That must hurt.
- Hello.
- Hello?
HUNTER: I told you never to call me here.
Well, I forgot.
- Hello! Enter!
- Somebody there with you?
- Aah!
- Jesus!
HUNTER: Hang up the damn phone, or I'll call the police!
I think he hung up the phone.
It was Thibault's little retarded homuncular assistant.
Look, this is dangerous.
I'll call you back after Julia goes to bed, OK?
THIBAULT: Lady Julia.
You are more than a rose.
You are love's own flower.
Come on. That's ridiculous.
No, I just... This old thing,
I threw it on.
I haven't worn it in a couple of years... but I guess I should learn how to take a compliment.
Thank you.
Almost.
Thank you.
Much better.
Kissing cousins.
Ooh la la.
I don't think that I've ever seen anyone... eat a steak in two bites before.
Ah.
ANDRE: Thank you, master!
ANDRE: Be blessed!
MAN: I can assure you...
ANDRE: Thank you!
Like some more truffle sauce with that?
MAN: Excuse me, but the gentleman... can't eat off the floor.
He's not a gentleman. He's my servant... and he's not worthy of our company.
Thank you.
I'm truly sorry, sir.
Andre, would you please...
ANDRE: No, no, milady. It is not possible.
JULIA: Please.
Thibault, please, will you let him sit at the table?
For me?
I will please you, lovely one.
Obey, foolish wart.
MAN: Thank you.
HUNTER: And you were worried they wouldn't be comfortable.
Actually, the floor wasn't such a bad place for him.
Easier to hose down.
ANDRE: Cheese! Very good cheese!
HUNTER: Andre, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Andre? No, no!
- Andre, no.
- No. Bad!
HUNTER: Hey. Sit down. Eat this.
JULIA: Hunter, could you...
No. This is for dessert. All right?
WAITER: Please, sir, please.
HUNTER: I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
Just add it to the check.
All right? Thank you.
You eat this after dinner. All right?
No, it's all right. I'm terribly sorry.
Just add it to the bill. Thank you.
WAITER: All right.
Do I have something on my face?
You remind me of the daughter of a king.
Thank you.
HUNTER: On the subject of Julia's noble ancestry... you do understand why she was granted control of the estate?
Julia is a Malfete.
Everything I have is hers.
So you have no objection if she retains control?
- No.
- Wonderful.
I'm sure you'll be very pleased with our plans.
HUNTER: They're going to make us...
I mean you and Julia... very wealthy.
I am already wealthy.
I own hundreds of horses... ten chests of pepper, four hundred bags of wool... and fifty barrels of Spanish olives.
And you own me, sire.
Yes, but you have no value.
That is true.
Excuse you.
THIBAULT: Leave nothing for the devil!
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did, sweetheart.
They're not in very good health, all right?
So, just try to ignore it, if you can.
- Sire.
- What?
ANDRE: I want to make pee-pee.
- Ah! You want to pee?
- Yes.
Outside!
Outside? But, sire...
I could be eaten by the wolves.
THIBAULT: Find a torch! Idiot.
ANDRE: Find a torch.
Andre has such simple needs.
I think that's great.
Need some help, sir?
Oh, it is beautiful.
The water comes out by itself. Ha!
It is a magic fountain.
Look at this! Mmm.
It smells just like the forest.
ANDRE:
All the forest is in the small wheel.
Mmm. Smell it!
No. No, thank you.
You don't want to smell it?
Enjoy yourself.
The castle's a wreck.
HUNTER:
So I'm helping her divide the estate up... into more manageable, profitable chunks.
We're selling the art and various high-end pieces... through an outlet here.
Essentially, I'm protecting her.
I see that as my role.
And the land?
I decided we should sell that, too.
THIBAULT: It is not for you to decide.
Only Lady Julia can say what will be done.
I speak for both Julia and myself.
THIBAULT:
You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete.
What are your wishes, milady?
Well, um...
I guess I'd like to think about it... a little bit more, actually.
Julia?
THIBAULT: The lady has spoken!
WOMAN: Chicken salad, now!
MAN: I want that cake. Come on now.
Don't take all night.
Greasy chicken.
HOST:
What on earth do you think you're doing?
JULIA: Hi, Andre.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to add an order... of chicken a la umbrella to your bill.
Smell the forest.
Yes, it's minty.
ANDRE: It's from the blue fountain.
JULIA: Nice. Yeah. Oh, all right.
Honey, would you like a mint?
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.
- Thibault?
- Master.
Those are good. Give me another one.
ANDRE: Yes. Very minty.
Ow!
WIZARD: Ah...
Good evening, fine sir.
WIZARD: I'm seeking Thibault of Malfete... the Duke of Anjou. The great chevalier?
THIBAULT: Andre does not need a bed.
He will be happy with some straw.
- Yes.
- We're out of straw.
My bed is soft.
ANNOUNCER:
It's time for the "Family Feud."
THIBAULT: Aah!
ANDRE: Oh! Poor little people.
They're trapped inside!
Oh!
God have mercy. What are we going to do, my sire?
Free them.
ANNOUNCER:
Chuck, Marilyn, Norma, Terry, and Linda.
Now let's start the "Family Feud"!
Bunny? You really think these guys have amnesia?
JULIA: I don't know.
ANDRE: We are coming!
So you admit they're clinically insane?
I didn't say that.
HUNTER: Oh, come on!
Where did they go, my lord?
They were inside. We could not save them.
It is tragic.
Well, we never really used this room anyway.
ANDRE: It's a pity.
Aah!
I need to find a wizard now.
Um...
Do you mind if I get some coffee first?
Hi.
Jesus Christ!
I've told you not to leave this stuff... in the middle of the driveway!
What are you trying to do?
You just about broke my goddamn neck!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Do you actually do any gardening around here... or do you just sing out of tune?
MAN: Just clean it up!
Aah!
Oh! Hey, big belly!
You dare to touch a lady?
MAN: Who the hell are you?
ANDRE: I'm Andre, and I piss on you.
Yeah, well, you get the hell out of here or I'm gonna call the cops.
Apologize to the lady.
Lady? You're calling her a...
Lady. Right.
I'm sorry.
ANDRE: Kiss her feet.
- Do what?
- Kiss her feet!
Oh, Jesus!
JULIA: Instead of a wizard...
I think what we really need to find you is a good doctor.
Wizards are the best doctors.
What in the world is that?
JULIA: What are you doing?
MAN: Call 911!
THIBAULT: What is going on here?
ANDRE: He was very rude to the lady.
Look, fool. A coat of arms.
He is a nobleman.
I did not know. (KISSING)
Stupid peasant.
- Who are these guys?
- Visitors.
THIBAULT: Do you own this woman?
She works for me.
Then I will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf.
No, please, my lord.
Not by the feet! I prefer the thumbs.
I got a meeting to catch.
THIBAULT: Rise, idiot.
I give him to you for the day.
You may beat him if you like.
Thanks, but we just met.
ANDRE:
Thank you, my great and merciful master.
Thank you, milord! Thank you!
THIBAULT:
Let us go. We have a wizard to find.
ANGELIQUE: A wizard?
- Are you French?
- Yes.
- Do you like it here?
- It is very strange.
It smells bad, and the food is too little... but the ladies are wonderful.
I wish my boss thought like that.
Boss. Ha ha. Boss. What is boss?
The guy you work for. The big guy.
I can have his bones when he's eating.
That is so disgusting.
That's so gross.
You have to figure out a way to get away from him.
He's my master. I don't want to be hung.
Hung!
You're not gonna be hung!
That's completely against the law, OK?
OK. OK!
Yay!
ANGELIQUE: Does he pay a lot of money?
ANDRE: Once every month he permits me to hunt pheasants on his lands.
So you make no money?
I have a treasure.
THIBAULT: What do you call that again?
JULIA: The "L".
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Before we get downstairs to the crowd...
I've got this for you.
Here's my phone number.
I want you to wear this just in case you get lost.
THIBAULT: I will not get lost.
THIBAULT: You can only be lost if you have no purpose... and I have purpose, which is to find a...
A wizard. Right.
JULIA: I don't even know where to start with that one.
I mean, I have never met a wizard.
I don't even think they make wizards anymore.
Oh! My purse! Wait, Thibault! Wait!
JULIA: Wait! No!
- Take the purse!
- No! No!
He's a thief. I have to cut his hand.
No, no, no!
Please, just take it.
OK. Everything's fine now.
Hang him in the public square.
- Aah!
- Silence, old woman!
You're not helping.
THIBAULT: Witch! Old witch! Wait!
I am sorry. I thought you were an old hag.
WOMAN: I've been called worse.
Thibault, why don't you come and tell her...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Ah, would you happen to know a wizard?
Can you tell me where to find a wizard?
A wizard.
Well.
THIBAULT: Peasants, which one of you can show me to a wizard?
There will be a reward.
Sir Lancelot here's looking for a wizard.
Aren't we all? Ha ha ha!
THIBAULT: I am not Lancelot.
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete...
Duke of Anjou, Baron of Orleans...
Lord of Libourne.
MAN: Yeah? Well, I'm Sid from Cicero...
Duke of Hazzard, Baron of Billiards... and Lord of Lord-knows-what... and I challenge you to a duel.
En garde!
Do not make me kill you.
En garde, I say. You watching this, honey?
THIBAULT: I should kill you for your insolence but I am too thirsty... so instead, I will quench my thirst... and yours and yours.
Drink up!
BRADY: Hey.
You're not gonna believe a word of this.
Not a word of it. Guess whose exhibit... had another visitor last night?
There was sparks flying... and all sorts of weird noises.
Then there was this poof.
BRADY: Poof.
And a green flash, and then bang, he was there.
Who was there?
- The wizard-looking dude.
- Wizard.
MITCHELL: Look.
He burnt the bedspread where he came in.
BRADY: Absolutely shocking.
Wait a minute.
This wasn't here before.
He says he's Julia's cousin.
HUNTER: I say he's a fake.
I want an answer in 24 hours.
See, tiger?
Daddy's gonna take care of this business.
You gonna be nice to me again?
HUNTER: Hello?
- Hunter, you're not gonna believe this.
- Bunny, I'm right here.
I lost Thibault because he was looking for a wizard.
And then he just freaked out...
Nobody just loses a guy dressed like a medieval knight in Chicago.
JULIA: Well, I did. Wait.
Hold on a second. Hello?
Yeah, does anybody there know the Count of whoop-de-do, the Baron of blah...
Yes, I do.
JULIA: Wonderful. Thank you.
All right, I found him. I gotta go.
- I'm so relieved.
- Love you. Bye.
(SIGHS) So he's back, huh?
Yeah. I was hoping he'd tripped on his cape... and swan-dived into the Chicago River.
- THIBAULT: Ha ha ha ha!
- (CROWD SINGING IN FRENCH)
JULIA: Thibault!
Thibault!
THIBAULT: Everybody, everybody!
This is my great, great, great, great... great-granddaughter.
Actually, grand, grand, grand, grand, grandpa and I must go.
CROWD: No!
MAN: You have to sing first!
No, I don't...
Yes. You must sing first.
(SINGING) Oui, oui, oui
Have to go, now, now, now
WOMAN: Why?
Yeah. You have to give us a good reason.
I found a wizard.
MAN: Well, bring him along!
No, we have to go.
I knew it!
I must leave you now.
MAN: Oh, no, no, no.
So long, Lancelot.
I am not Lancelot.
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete.
Of course it is that bloody English wizard.
He has followed me through time.
Great. Great. I mean, he probably... just whipped up some eye of newt potion thingie... and he waved his hands over it a few times... and said some words in Latin, and voila!
JULIA: Thibault?
I'm starting to believe you.
I'm starting to believe everything... and that is a really big leap for a 21st century girl.
I just want you to appreciate that.
OK?
Mm-hmm.
There it is.
Oh, my God.
All right. What now?
- Ohh.
- Treacherous old fool!
What is this?
WIZARD: I thought you smote her dead.
She's not my Rosalind.
I'm Julia Malfete. Hi.
Oh. Malfete!
She's a descendant!
Ah! All is not lost, my lord.
How long until your magic is ready... to return me to my rightful time?
Before the sun is set.
THIBAULT: Then let us go now and fetch my faithful servant.
Eww.
Never smelled like this before.
Ohh.
Bloody English wizards.
They cannot do anything right.
(SINGING) Woo woo
Ah, here we go
Woo woo
- I like your chariot.
- Thank you.
That's my lipstick.
Ohh, no, Andre. That's so gross.
Hurry up. Spit it out the window.
(SINGING) To business give them down and pay
(ANGELIQUE GRUNTS) One ruby.
That should do it.
Hmm.
Woo-hoo!
MAN: What is all this horrible noise?
ANGELIQUE: We would love to go shopping.
ANDRE: Oh, big swans!
Oh! Very small chariots!
ANGELIQUE: Like little Matchbox cars.
- Agh!
- Hey!
Say cheese.
Oh, ohh!
ANDRE: I love these wheel cakes.
ANGELIQUE: Ha! We call them doughnuts.
Andre, you can have as many doughnuts as you want now.
Mmm. Yes.
You can have all of this, Andre.
You could go out and get a really big house.
And you can have a swimming pool.
You can have everything, Andre.
I can only have what my master allows.
That is not true!
This is a democracy. This is America.
You are a free man.
JULIA: Thank you.
There are a lot of good things about living in this time.
You'll be OK here.
I'll make sure of it.
You are lionhearted, Julia... like the women of your lineage.
You have courage.
Lionhearted. No.
No, I don't think so.
Bunnyhearted maybe, but no.
Come outside.
THIBAULT:
You will learn to protect yourself.
What are you doing?
Look at me.
Take it like this.
Power in your arm.
- Very impressive.
- Take it.
JULIA: Power in my arm.
My arm!
I can't do it. It's too heavy.
Try again.
(SIGHS) I am getting so tired of this.
Sneaking around and lying all the time.
Hey...
Hang in there with me, babe.
We are so close.
Take me dancing.
(SINGING) Baby
MAN: Hey, watch it! Ah!
I'm sorry.
Look what you've done. Let's go, Kelly.
Come on.
Sorry about that. I'm sorry.
(SINGING) Don't panic
Sorry, ma'am.
Don't help me. My boss will kill me.
ANDRE: You're a free woman.
Tonight... we dance!
(SINGING) Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
Till the break of dawn
Hey
I dance the rumba
The salsa, the cha-cha, the limbo
The fox trot and even the tango
With ladies and girlies
With mommies and babies
And DJs gonna play this
'Cause it's on their playlist
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
The babes are all around me
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
Till the break of dawn
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
The babes are all around me
Oh, Hunter!
- Angelique.
- Where's Julia?
ANDRE: Hunter! Get your groovin'!
Yah!
Who are you?
Who is she?
- She's my sister.
- I am not!
She's very tired now, and she's gotta go home!
Sire Hunter!
Tonight was so great.
Greatest night ever in the world.
You make me feel like a lady.
But you are. A great lady.
And you are a great man.
Really?
And if you got a decent haircut... and learned not to put everything you see... in your mouth...
I think you'd be a terrific man.
Milady, thank you.
Andre... what do you say that we quit our lousy jobs and go travel around the world?
- Quit?
- We could be so happy.
Tonight, just tell your boss that you quit, OK?
ANDRE: OK.
- Be free.
- Free!
Because I am a free man!
You've got that right, baby!
ANDRE: Master. You are worried.
What is wrong?
The wizard... he exploded.
JULIA: Yes. It wasn't a very pretty sight.
ANGELIQUE: The wizard exploded?
Well, I don't know about you guys... but good night.
ANGELIQUE: But first...
Andre has something to say to Thibault.
What is it, peasant?
Well, speak.
ANGELIQUE: Nothing. I guess I was wrong.
JULIA:
Thibault, he was standing by the river.
The saddest, most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
Hmm. Well... that Thibault really is a special guy.
Yes. Yes, he is.
That's why I've decided to give the entire estate back to him.
You what?
Honey, did you know that the women of my lineage... are all lionhearted?
They still haven't brought the stiff down?
I heard somebody say the old geezer's body parts... are sticking to the ground.
Best I pull myself together.
WIZARD: Come on, my little ones.
Well, that feels better.
- (KNOCKS)
- Can I come in?
HUNTER: What do you got?
INVESTIGATOR: Fingerprints don't match.
Whoever your friend is, he's not this Thibault Malfete... that died in that sailing accident three years ago.
I knew it.
This is how we're gonna sell it to the cops.
OK, OK.
- Ah, hello.
- Oh, my...
WIZARD: Well, don't look so astonished.
It's magic.
WIZARD: All I did was cast a little...
Oh. Good day, my lord.
I do apologize...
Damn wizard. This way.
WIZARD: The trick with pork penis... is to chop it very fine.
Oh.
(SNIFFS) Mmm.
JULIA: Ohh.
Be careful.
WIZARD: If you get that on you... you'll grow fur.
THIBAULT: Peasant!
Peasant!
Get our things ready to go.
THIBAULT: Soon, we will be back in our beloved homes.
Master, my father is a drunkard.
My mother is a hunchback.
My brother is a dwarf, and my sister is a whore.
I do not have any beloved home.
I don't want to go back with you.
I don't want anymore to run behind your horse.
I want to eat wheel cakes and doughnuts.
And I want to have a chariot in iron.
And exciting men's fashions... direct from Europe at rock-bottom prices.
And I want to... and... and I want... and I want to stay here with Lady Angelique.
There you go.
And I want to be free!
I want to be cool and OK!
You are my property.
THIBAULT:
You will go back with me dead or alive.
Choose quickly.
JULIA: Thibault...
He only wants what we all want.
He belongs to me.
I decide his fate.
No, master.
I mean, no way, Jose.
JULIA:
Please, Thibault. It's the noble thing to do.
Thank you, Thibault.
Long life to your family.
Yes. Lady Julia...
If you'll allow me...
Sire Hunter's sister left this last night... in the house of the troubadour.
Sister? He d...
Hunter doesn't have a sister.
Thank you, Andre.
Angelique!
I'm coming!
HUNTER: Hey! Who are you?
Stay here. I will go kill him for you.
No. I want to handle this myself.
What are you doing in here?
What's this?
A 12th century English wizard.
JULIA: Can I talk to you in the other room, please?
Don't touch anything.
JULIA: What's this?
You offended the lady's honor.
Prepare to die.
Did you hear that? He threatened me!
And you're a witness.
HUNTER: You see? He's a violent criminal.
Thank God I called the police.
You called the police?
HUNTER: Julia, this man's a fraud.
All he wants is the money.
No, Hunter, all you want is the money.
It's over.
What?
You couldn't make it through one day without me.
HUNTER: Ah, come on.
You're my little bunny.
Bunny?
Do I look like a bunny to you?
No.
Do I look like a bunny to you?
Nay.
You know what, Hunter?
I don't look like a bunny.
I don't act like a bunny.
I don't think like a bunny.
JULIA: And if you loved me... you wouldn't have made me try to feel like a bunny.
I am strong, and I am smart... and I don't need you to take care of me.
Oh, really?
Courage is my creed.
Are you insane?
No.
Put that thing away.
You're right. I should.
(SQUEAKING) Ow!
Aah!
And stay out!
WIZARD: My lord. Remind you of anyone?
POLICE RADIO: All units, be on the lookout for a heavily-armed dangerous male... with kidnap victim female.
Use extreme caution.
Go, gentlemen.
Don't be afraid to use your guns.
We should check the kitchen.
JULIA: Taxi? Museum of Fine Arts, please.
And quickly, or off with your head.
OFFICER: Hey! They're getting away!
Chief...
OFFICER: I'm going after 'em!
Where are y'all from?
THIBAULT: The lady's from here.
The wizard and I are from the 12th century.
CHIEF: Don't lose 'em, O'Malley.
We're right behind you! You stay here.
JULIA: If we get caught,
I will verify to the police... that you are a hostage, OK?
DRIVER:
All right. Now we talkin'. Hold on.
THIBAULT:
Can we go back in time from here?
We have to go through the same chamber from whence we came.
(SIGHS) Good going, O'Malley.
- Unh!
- Hey!
Damn.
COP: Roadblocks established,
State and Michigan.
He's getting away!
I've never ridden the "L" quite like this before.
COP:
A big guy in a metal hat with a blonde?
Oh, man, they're already out of here.
PILOT: Aerial unit 2.
Suspects headed south on Michigan.
Suspects entering museum.
TEACHER: Look, the knight is in his home.
Welcome, knight.
Say hello to the knight.
CHILDREN: Hello, knight.
Please, wait, one second.
I'm sorry, folks, but this exhibit is closed for today... so you'll have to move on.
Thank you. Thank you.
Shh.
What am I gonna do without you?
JULIA: You're my knight in shining armor.
THIBAULT: Soon you will find a wonderful man to marry.
You will make a long life together.
I had the vision of this.
You are so charming.
I am so proud of you.
And... when your children are big enough to understand...
I want you to tell them about an old ancestor... because I am a part of you, and one day...
I will be a part of your children.
THIBAULT: Here.
A present from your great, great, great, great-grandmother.
Wait.
Here.
Will you give this to her for me?
I will.
I promise she'll be the only girl... with anything like this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your Grace...
Aah.
What are they doing?
TEACHER:
They're drinking vitamins, obviously.
WIZARD: Per Horus...
Invictus ducere!
COP:
Where is he? The guy with all the armor?
He's gone.
- Where?
- Home.
THIBAULT: One moment!
Please.
My dear Earl of Warwick... in celebration of this happy occasion...
I want to dismiss forever our disagreements.
Please, drink of our wine.
You shall accept this peace offering, Warwick.
I command you.
Wait!
Ah!
What in heaven's wrong with Warwick?
He did not like the wine.
If he preferred white, he should have said so.
It has been so long since I saw you...
When have we been apart, my lord?
When I was with the Lady Julia.
Lady Julia.
She bade me to deliver you this... wedding gift.
Here.
It is an odd piece, isn't it?
THIBAULT: It is before its time.
That's what I'm saying. Literally, she threw me out of the house... and took off with the idiots. Animals.
HUNTER: Ugh.
They poisoned my shake!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They left some kind of note here.
- Some old French parchment.
- AMBER: Well, what does it say?
I don't know, Amber. I don't speak French.
HUNTER: Per Horus et per Ra... invictus ducere.
Ah!
Oh, my God. Hunter? Are you OK?
Oh!
AMBER: Hunter?
Hunter, Hunter, OK, talk to me! Hunter!
- Stay away from me!
- Aah!
Who are you people? Don't touch me!
Ohh!
HUNTER:
I am a close and personal friend... of the chief of police.
I am the chief of police!
You'll make a great servant for the count.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
HUNTER: Ow!
MAN: I must tell you that all of us at the firm... are delighted with your decision to keep the estate intact.
I can't wait to get really acquainted with this place.
MAN: We'll go over everything.
I can even show you the dungeon.
Unless you're afraid.
She's not afraid.
YOUNG MAN: Courage is her creed.
How do you know my family's creed?
I know a lot about your family.
MAN:
Miss Malfete, this is Francois le Combier.
He's the attorney handling the French interest... in the estate.
He knows the history of the castle even better than I do.
Francois, perhaps you would like... to be Miss Malfete's guide today?
FRANCOIS: It will be my great pleasure.
Mademoiselle.
Merci.
CHER SINGING:
So let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care
With you I can't go wrong...
I have one small worry.
What's that?
Who's going to protect me from the devil?

One little task that I want you to do

It just doesn't work anymore.
Have you tried the self-diagnoser?
- No. It's also broken.
I see. What model?
- My vacuum-cleaner?
Yes. The vacuum-cleaner robot.
- It's an IR2020.
On or off-line?
- Off-line.
Is the discharge light on?
On the side.
- No. It's broken.
OK.
Please bring it to the shop.
OK. But there's a problem.
- Yes?
I can't go anywhere.
All repairs are done in our workshops.
Yes. But you must understand.
I never go...
I don't have time to listen.
I have other clients.
So please bring us your IR2020 or don't clean the carpet anymore.
My contract specifically states...
We do not include transport.
Goodbye.
You don't understand. I have a right...
Yes. OK. Thank you.
Hello. Mr Thomas.
- Yes. Hello.
Your insurance policy number. JM 88...
- I knew that.
So. What can I do for you?
My vacuum-cleaner is broken.
I called the repairman. but he refuses to come.
He says I have to bring it to him.
You do have a maintenance contract?
- Of course.
Apparently it does not include transport.
With which company?
- Domotics Clinic.
Let's see. I'm checking.
One moment.
I talked to a real stubborn guy.
I see. Did you catch his name?
- Yes. Gregory.
Perfect. You can count on me.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello.
How are you feeling?
- Fine.
Great.
- I did it.
What did you do?
- I talked to my mother.
She took it very well.
She will only call me once a week.
Thomas. Our session will be different today.
We have to talk.
I was controlled.
Controlled? By the insurance?
Yes. Of course.
And?
- I was almost discharged.
Wow. What's all that about?
You're good. Very professional.
I'm not the reason. The treatment is.
In fact. I asked to be controlled.
You did?
- Yes.
Globale assembled a panel of psychologists. of various expertise.
They saw our sessions and...
- Wait.
They watched our sessions?
Neither one of us owns the sessions.
They are Globale property.
Really. Thank you.
That was thoughtful of you.
So. What did your peers say?
They confirmed what I already knew.
You've been deviating.
- Deviating?
You're smart. You're avoiding.
You've invented a new patient. a virtual patient you use as protection to avoid asking yourself questions.
Isn't all that a bit far-fetched?
You don't do it on purpose.
It's subconscious.
It's alright then.
If it's subconscious. Everything's OK.
Our conclusion is that you have to be shaken up a bit.
Shaken up?
What are you going to do to me?
I've already done it.
What?
- I signed you up in a dating club.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
I gave your name to a dating club.
- A matrimonial agency?
We don't call them that anymore.
It's pejorative.
But. That's ridiculous. I...
Sorry. But I have a meeting in five minutes.
We'll talk later.
- It's ridiculous.
What am I to do with...
"Psy Workshop". Hello.
- Mr Gillon. Please.
I'm sorry. He's out.
- But he was just there.
He left 30 seconds ago. Would you like...
You could call him back.
- I don't think so.
You don't?
- He was in a hurry.
Really?
Would you like to leave a message?
No. I'll call him on his cellular.
Sorry. But he left it on his desk.
What a coincidence!
What should I do?
Do I leave him a message or not?
Yes. Let's leave him a message.
Tell him...
Tell him he's an asshole.
An asshole. Is that all?
What?
- "You're an asshole". That's it?
Well. Yes.
Shall I write your name?
- Yes.
And what is your name?
- Thomas.
Thomas who?
- Thomas.
Thomas Thomas.
First name. Thomas.
Last name is also Thomas.
I see. So it's you.
I saw your name on a file earlier.
It's rather rare.
- Very rare.
Hello.
- Hello.
Welcome to Catch-a-Heart.
- What is...
You have been selected to take our psychoaffective test.
Damn.
- This test will...
Hello.
- Damn it!
Welcome to Catch-a-Heart.
You have been selected to take our psychoaffective test.
I'm so lucky.
This test will help us find your soulmate.
Soulmate!
- Are you ready for our questions.
Mr Thomas Thomas?
Are you ready for our questions.
Mr Thomas Thomas?
Fuck you.
Are you ready for our questions...?
- They won't leave me alone.
Yes.
- OK. Mr Thomas Thomas.
Here is the first question.
What does this image remind you of? a. A dog. b. A marine landscape at dusk. c. A man or a woman's face.
What is this bullshit?

- Definitely a.
What does this image remind you of? a. Raisin pudding. b. A song. c. A mother's breast.
- A again.
Thank you. Mr Thomas Thomas.
The personality test is over.
Already? I was starting...
- After our selection. a female candidate will contact you.
Really?
- Good luck.
That's it? Five stupid questions...
Mr Thomas. One moment please.
There. Your code JM 88 57.
Right. 56. Go ahead.
Well. It's somewhat tricky.
You can tell me. That's why I'm here.
OK. Well. It's about... certain sexual habits.
You know. In that domain. the client does as he pleases.
We respect all orientations.
For three years. You've had access to professional assistance.
Excuse me?
- Don't you know?
It is handled by the state.
They are professionals.
You mean... prostitutes?
They are trained as nurses. and know basic psychology.
It is reserved for
B6 handicaps and up.
You're B8. So you have access to it.
Wait. You must be kidding.
Not at all.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
No. Do they accept to have cybersex intercourse?
They may. but you are strictly forbidden.
Really?
- Article 121. Clause 12B.
Accidents. You understand.
Electrocutions.
Yes. I heard about that.
But those fools used it in their bathtubs.
Their bathtubs?
- Yes.
I wasn't aware.
Are you interested in such a service?
Well...
We are associated with the "Madame Zoe" agency.
It is named after the agency's director.
The contact code is
"Madame Zoe Zoe". Zoe twice.
Zoe twice. Well OK. Thank you.
You're welcome. It's my job.
Hello. I'm Madame Zoe.
- Hello.
May I have your insurance number.
Yes. JM 88 56.
You've never called on us before.
No.
I'm sorry. But you're a B8. Right?
Yes. That's right.
Male. Hetero. Homo. Or bisexual?
Heterosexual.
OK.
This is the procedure.
You will be contacted by our employees.
They will ask you if you wish to continue or not.
Do not hesitate to say "No".
Be guided by your first impression.
The first impression is important.
- OK.
So. If you say no. you will be transferred to another employee.
But if you like her. You may talk with her as you please. to see if you like her beyond your first impression.
Then you may set up an appointment at your house.
Is it clear?
- Yes.
Yes?
- Yes. It's clear.
Have fun.
- Thank you.
Hello. Do you want to go on with me?
No.
Hello. Do you want to go on with me?
No.
Hello. Do you want to go on with me?
No. No thank you.
Hello.
Do you want to go on with me?
Shit. Excuse me. I'll call you back.
Mom...
- There you are.
I told you.
- I know. I'm calling early.
We have to defuse our relationship.
But I found something this morning.
What?
- An old recording. Watch.
A recording of what?
- I'm sending it to you.
Who is it?
- It's you of course.
Aren't you cute?
I found it in a drawer.
Your uncle Frederic. Maria's husband. filmed it.
I thought you'd be happy to see it.
Thomas. Why did you hang up?
Are you alright?
No. I can't. I can't watch this.
Did you have a seizure?
You mean these images triggered it?
Yes. To see myself outside like that.
Calm down. Thomas. Calm down.
Breathe slowly.
You should rest.
That's what I was going to do.
I'm sorry. I couldn't have known.
You were so happy then.
You weren't afraid.
Yes I was afraid.
The sky. The air...
- But. Your seizures began after...
Yes. I know. Thank you. Mother.
Will you be alright?
- Yes.
I'm going to go lie down.
Are you sure?
- Yes. Goodbye. Mom.
Yes?
- Hi there.
Yes. Hello.
My name is Vanessa.
I got your number from Catch-a-Heart.
Catch-a-Heart?
Yes. The matrimonial agency.
We call it a dating club.
- Right. A dating club.
You seem rather cute.
Your face at least.
What is your problem?
- Excuse me?
Well. Why did you join a dating club?
Everybody does it.
Yes. But guys hit on you. Right?
Of course! But how do I know if he's the ideal person?
Because I'm the ideal person?
The computer selected you for me among thousands of candidates.
Among thousands of candidates. it chose an agoraphobic.
They didn't tell you at the club?
- No.
They didn't tell you!
I don't mind you being afraid of spiders.
Excuse me?
You're arachnophobic. Right?
No. Agoraphobic.
What is an agoraphobic?
It means I haven't gone out of my apartment in eight years.
You must be joking.
- No.
Eight years?
- Yes. Eight years.
And no one has come into my apartment either.
I only see people by visiophone.
Why did you call Catch-a-Heart then?
- I didn't.
My psychologist nicely signed me up. for therapy.
So. Shall we end it here?
I don't think this meeting was a real success.
It wouldn't bother you. Would it?
- No.
Perhaps. You're disappointed...
Goodbye.
Hello. My name is Eleonor.
Catch-a-Heart?
- Well. Yes.
OK.
First I have to warn you.
You'll only be able to communicate with me by visiophone.
Really?
I never leave my apartment and no one enters it.
Did you forget your code?
No.
Medical reasons.
I see.
Well. I'm sorry.
So?
So what?
Is this what you want?
To see me only by visiophone?
No. Not really.
Shall we end it here?
Hello.
- Hello.
Sorry. Roger. leave your sister alone.
Let go.
Excuse me. Wait a sec.
Well. OK.
- Roger. Let go.
Let go. Damn it.
Listen. I'll call you back.
- Yes.
Catch-a-Heart gave you my number?
- Yes.
You see. It's a mistake.
I've been married for three years.
I see.
Happy for you.
- Thank you.
Damn it. Roger!
I'll leave you now.
OK.
Listen. Gillon.
- It's you. Thomas.
What's happening? Are you OK?
Don't panic.
I'll call you back from the car.
There. Are you OK now. Thomas?
Yes.
The dating club contacted you. Right?
- Yes.
How did it go?
- What do you think?
The first time's usually a failure.
How would you know?
From experience.
From experience?
- Yes.
Personal experience?
- Yes.
You've been to such stupid dating agencies?
Yes. That's how I met my wife.
No. I don't believe you.
Most people go to dating clubs. you know.
Yes. I know. But don't tell me you believe in those dumb tests.
Sure I do.
You let a computer choose your wife for you.
The club will find someone else for you.
Well. No thanks. I'll be fine.
I have to go.
You have a lot of appointments these days.
I have busy periods too.
Goodbye. Thomas.
Yes?
- Mr Thomas Thomas?
This is he.
I got a call from your insurance company. I'm very sorry.
They explained everything.
Had I known...
We get a lot of strange callers.
You were a bit suspicious.
I'll send someone tomorrow.
When are you at home?
All the time.
Yes. Of course.
You never go outside?
- No.
You haven't been outside in ten years?
- Eight years.
You never go out?
- No. Never.
Don't you want to sometimes?
- Not at all.
Why not?
I panic.
- You're afraid?
You could say that.
Besides. I have nothing to do outside.
You like to go out?
- Sure.
To do what?
- Lots of things.
Have a drink with friends. walk with the kids.
Not me.
Sorry for asking all these questions.
It's really none of my business.
Do you want to know something else?
- No.
Seriously. How do you do it?
Stay in your apartment all day?
I keep busy with sports.
3D multimedia...
I have a hydroponic greenhouse. and a giant aquarium.
I have a passion for fish.
All that must be expensive.
- Yes. Rather expensive.
I used to conceive tridimensional circuits.
I earned quite a bit doing that.
So when my handicap became unbearable.
I was declared disabled and gave all my money to an insurance company.
Globale.
- That's right.
And I had this apartment built.
I see.
Well. I'm going to have to go.
Thanks for answering my questions.
It's unhealthy curiosity. But...
No. It's normal to ask questions.
I was happy to talk about it.
That's great then.
Well. Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Welcome to Madame Zoe.
If you wish to select someone directly, press B. If you wish...
Hello.
Do you want to go on with me?
No.
Hello.
Do you want to go on with me?
No.
Hello.
Do you want to go on with me?
No.
Hello.
Do... do you want to go on with me?
Or not?
Yes.
From now on, you may call Eva directly.
Simply call "Madame Zoe Eva".
You can be transferred to someone else anytime.
Have fun.
Why did you choose me?
Excuse me?
- Don't you see that...
I'm not doing so well?
Yes... I'm sorry.
Please leave me alone.
Take someone else.
But...
Come back tomorrow. I'll be better.
OK. Then. Tomorrow.
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.
No. That's alright.
Would you like me to transfer you?
- No. I'll disconnect.
Goodbye.
Yes?
Excuse me?
I don't understand what you're saying.
Take off your mask.
I don't understand.
Take off the mask.
I'm from Domotics Clinic.
Why are you dressed like that?
I was told to take precautions.
No need to exaggerate.
It's for the vacuum cleaner?
Yes. An offline IR2020.
This is how we'll proceed.
First. You leave the hall.
I leave the hall?
- Yes.
I will bring the vacuum cleaner.
When the door opens. you will come and take it.
OK. So I go outside.
- Yes. You go outside.
The mask is not necessary.
Please take off the mask.
You don't need it. There's no danger.
I'll take it to the truck and check it out.
OK?
- Yes.
I'll need about half an hour.
- OK. That's fine.
Hello. My name is...
- Catch-a-Heart?
Yes. The dating club gave me your number.
My name is Melody.
- Melody?
Yes. It's not my fault.
I think it's kind of cute.
I don't.
And you? What's your name?
Thomas.
I have to tell you something first.
There's no need to be formal. don't you think?
OK. But I have to warn you.
I'm agoraphobic.
Agoraphobic.
That's when people are afraid to be outside?
Yes. More or less.
So you don't go out too often?
- No. Never.
Never?
No. And no one comes into my place.
- I see.
Since when?
- About eight years.
Eight years?
- Yes.
You're not afraid?
Why would I be afraid?
I don't know.
Me too.
- What?
I have something to tell you.
Well. It's somewhat personal.
But you told me you were agoraphobic. that's brave.
No. No need to exaggerate.
Sure. I think it's brave.
I'll tell you.
But you won't laugh?
No.
So...
Here I go.
I make video poems.
Video poems?
You've never seen video poems before?
Sure I have.
But I thought no one...
You think it's outdated.
- No. Not at all.
You would like to see mine?
- What? Now?
No. I have to prepare them first.
I'd like to select the best ones because some are truly horrible.
What's going on?
- Someone's here. I have to go.
That's alright. We'll talk again later.
Well... yes.
I have to go to my color-exchange tribe.
We're dealing with green and it's an important color to me.
I see.
Can I call you tomorrow?
You'll be home?
I'm always home.
Right.
Tomorrow then.
Well. OK. Tomorrow.
Yes?
Mr Thomas. It's fixed.
It wasn't easy. There was...
A plate was overheating.
I thought that was it. but it wasn't at all.
It was the ceramic sensor...
OK. Fine. Thank you.
There. It's fixed.
- Great. Thank you.
OK. I'm going then.
Goodbye.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
I'm here. Sorry.
I don't want to disturb you.
- I was held up.
I can call later.
- No. Really. It's OK.
We don't have anything to say.
- No.
The situation's rather...
- Artificial.
Yes.
It's like when I go to sweating tents.
- Swearing what?
No. Sweating tents.
It's that Amerindian thing.
You do that?
The company where I work organizes that sometimes.
Don't you know what it is?
- Sure I do.
You've never been in one?
Me? No. Eight years ago. it wasn't so common.
I've never seen the point. In fact.
The goal is to sweat together.
- To sweat together?
It's fashionable.
- I suppose so.
It's like those dating clubs.
I find all that quite ridiculous.
It's beyond ridiculous.
Is it?
No one believes in it.
It's like...
I don't know. Like astrology.
People need it to get through life.
Incredible stuff you have to believe in.
It helps people exult their mystical function.
Their mystical function?
Heard of The Development and Creativity of the Mystical Function by Oppenheimer?
No.
I'll transfer it to you.
You too need all that stuff?
Astrology. Dating clubs. color-exchange tribes?
I'm not someone special. Thomas.
Not like you.
I'm not special.
A guy who locks himself up for eight years is a little peculiar.
People who like to go outside seem strange to me.
Do I seem strange to you?
Yes.
Do I scare you?
- No.
You think you'll let me in one day?
No. That's impossible.
I do scare you.
No. But no one comes in here.
That's the way it is. Sorry.
Too bad.
Why is it too bad?
I don't know. We could have... met each other. Seen each other. touched each other.
Make love?
Yes. Make love. Among other things.
At least try.
Maybe it wouldn't have worked out too well the first time.
With me. With you...
I doubt it. The first time...
But. Still. We could have tried.
We could make love. without you coming to my apartment.
How?
With devices.
You know. Special body suits.
You mean cybersex?
- Yes.
You're kidding me. Right?
- No.
Do you realize what you're saying?
If it bothers you. we won't talk about it again.
That's not it.
It's just a little embarrassing.
Is cybersex not in these days?
No. Not really. Not at all.
But the devices sell well. Don't they?
Yes. But no one says...
I've never heard someone say
"Look. I bought a cybersex suit".
It's kind of taboo to talk about.
Like...
Like masturbation?
Yes.
- But everyone masturbates.
Yes. Well. Especially men.
Really? Not women?
Not all of them.
Not as naturally as do men. Anyway.
What about you?
What about me?
- Do you masturbate?
You see. Thomas. That's the problem.
Were we face to face I'd say yes. Sometimes.
But like this. By visiophone. I can't.
So. Cybersex... talking about it by visiophone is hard enough... so doing it...
- OK. We won't talk about it again.
I didn't...
- It's OK. Forget it.
Don't worry. I won't forget this.
I've been asked a lot of things. but this...
It's not that I like it that way.
It's not by taste.
I don't need it. but if I have sex. It can only...
Yes. I understand.
We better stop here for now.
I'll think about it.
OK. As you wish.
It's better that way. At least for me.
OK. No problem.
See you. Then.
See you.
Hello.
- Hello.
You called yesterday. Right?
Yes. That was me.
You didn't pick another girl?
No. I wanted you.
Why?
I don't know. Maybe. because you were crying.
I see.
You get off on women who cry?
No. Not at all.
Let's stop here. OK?
We don't have to deal with perverts.
We limit ourselves to MPF.
- To what?
MPF: masturbation. penetration. Fellatio.
And yet. Fellatio only in particular cases.
We don't do the rest.
So you can go now.
Listen. You don't understand.
- Yes. I do.
You want to fuck me while I cry.
- No.
Look. I have no sexual preference for women who cry.
It's just that yesterday... I don't know...
I'm not used to calling...
For your services.
Listen closely. Mister. I'm a whore.
A medical whore refunded by the insurance. But still a whore.
We talk. You give your address.
I come over. We fuck and that's it.
That's my job. OK?
Yes. But...
There's a problem.
What now?
My handicap is agoraphobia.
You're a B8?
Yes. An acute case close to sociophobia and I cannot stand human contact.
In fact. No one comes in here.
You mean I can't come into your apartment?
That's right.
So how do we do it then?
Not cybersex. I hope.
Well... yes.
Oh. No. I don't do that.
Besides. It's forbidden.
I know. But...
- I don't do perverts.
This is not perversion.
Fucking a plastic vagina is not perverse?
It's not plastic. It's expanded carbon.
Look. I only work at home.
Why did you call me then?
There are cybersex clubs. You know?
You're good-Iooking.
- Thank you.
You could have women from around the world.
China or Africa. Anyone you like.
- I know.
There are also virtual services.
Yes. I've done that. I know it well.
But conversationwise. it's a bit limited.
I'm not a psychologist.
I have a psychologist.
But he's bald. Has a beard. and sexually. He's not my type.
You're a soft-hearted one. aren't you?
Ah. You think.
You know what you need?
A real woman.
Someone you're in love with.
And you're not a real woman?
- No.
I'm not here for love.
I'm only here for sex.
So. Join a dating club or something like it.
But leave me be.
I'm sorry. But I can't help you.
OK. OK.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello.
How are you since yesterday?
Fine. I'm fine.
I would like to show you my video poems.
Not all of them. The best three. OK?
Sure. Yes.
I realized I had to show them to you. or there would be...
There would be something missing between us.
Yes. I understand.
I'll connect the cable with the visiophone.
There. Are you ready?
Yes.
OK. I'm sending them.
Plants
GOD
God... me...
God... me...
My Foot
My foot... my knee... my scalp... my finger... my stomach... my ankle...
My neck... my hand... my back... my elbow... my sex...
There.
What did you think?
Interesting.
You didn't think it was ridiculous?
No. Certainly not ridiculous.
But. Did it touch you?
Yes.
You can be honest with me.
Yes. It touched me because it was you.
I'm not an expert in poetry. Art. and all that. but what I saw was you.
Dating clubs may be stupid. but without them. we would not have met.
That's true.
I'm going to go.
- Where?
There's a store on avenue Compère. close to here.
I'm going to buy it.
- Buy what?
The apparel. For cybersex.
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to make love with you.
I'll call you when I get back.
OK.
I did it.
I went in and asked for a cybersex suit.
They said: "For a man or a woman?"
Know what I said?
- No.
I said it was for me.
I dared to say it was for me.
- Good.
In fact. Here it is.
Will you put it on?
- You want to?
Yes.
- Then I'll put it on.
To make love?
- Yes.
To make love with you.
You thought I'd just see how it fit?
- No.
You're going to take off your make-up?
What? My elementary signs?
- Yes.
I don't do that.
What? Even when you make love?
- Especially then.
Why?
- I'd feel naked.
Aren't we supposed to be naked when making love?
Yes. But I'd feel too naked.
I can't.
It's just make-up.
For me. If you leave it on...
It's hard enough making love wearing a rock-climbing outfit...
OK.
How do you put it on?
That's the front. Right?
- I wonder...
I have one for men. It's a bit different.
Of course.
I'm taking my clothes off.
- You want me to turn around?
Why?
- While you take your clothes off.
You'll only see my face anyway.
- You're right.
Don't you want to see me naked?
- Sure.
I mean. Yes. No.
I want to see you naked.
I'd rather you didn't.
Are you putting your suit on?
Otherwise...
Yes. Of course.
For the first time.
I'd rather not be seen too naked.
I'm usually not shy. I can be naked in front of people. at the pool or in group therapy.
But the first time. when it's sexual with a man...
I don't know.
So.
Did you put on the gloves?
- Right. The gloves.
Strange.
Are you ready?
- One second.
What do we do now?
First. You could get comfortable.
You mean on my bed?
- For example.
OK.
Wait.
OK. I'm activating.
- Me too.
And now?
- Now. I'm touching you.
Do you feel my hands?
- Yes.
I feel your hands.
They're warm.
Gentler on my breasts.
- Sorry.
Like this?
- Yes.
Like that.
Let my nipples stick out.
Like that.
You can also touch me.
Where are you?
- In front of you.
Yes. I can feel you.
I feel your shoulders. your stomach. your... your penis.
Come closer.
You are...
- Yes.
You are big.
- No.
Your suit's sensors are adapting...
Already?
- Not long enough...
No. Not for me.
- Sorry.
That's alright. It was great anyway.
It was our first time.
And for a first time. It was...
I have to think.
- About what?
I want to be alone and think.
- Now? It can't wait?
I'll call you back.
What is your code?
- No. I'll call you.
Yes. But I'd like to know your code.
Louis. Bernard. Louis. 268.
But I will call you back.
See you soon.
Yes?
- Did I wake you?
No.
I did. What time is it?
Two in the morning.
Sorry. I didn't realize it was so late.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'm up now.
Go back to sleep. I'll call later.
I won't get back to sleep anyway.
There must be a problem for you to call now.
So tell me what's wrong.
I've been thinking. Thomas.
I think...
I don't know.
I don't know how to tell you.
Tell me what?
- You know.
No I don't know.
It doesn't work.
Between us. It doesn't work.
It wasn't so bad last night. Was it?
Even if I was a little quick.
No. It's not the sex.
Well. Yes. It is the sex.
Among other things.
It wasn't good last night.
Really?
It was creepy actually.
I thought it was creepy.
I can't do it like that. You know.
I have to see you.
But you do see me.
You know what I mean.
I want you here with me.
I want to touch you. Feel you.
You're disgusted. Aren't you?
- No.
Yes. You are.
I understand. You being agoraphobic.
But. Me. I can't. I can't.
OK.
What. OK?
That's it then?
But I don't want to end it this way.
What do we do then?
You're being unfair. Thomas.
- No I'm not.
What do you want me to say?
It's 2 a.m.
You tell me it doesn't work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Thomas. I want you to go outside.
I can't.
I want to see you here. With me.
I can't.
I want to touch you.
No.
We'll talk again?
We'll still be friends?
- I don't think so.
Right.
You're right.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I loved you. You know.
I mean...
Even now. I...
I love you.
Hello. Thomas.
- Look who it is.
How are you feeling?
Never been better.
I know about the girl from the dating club.
What?
You've been checking up on that too?
It's standard procedure.
When a therapist calls on a dating club for a patient...
Can't you leave me alone?
Must you snoop around my life like this?
It's normal for you to be aggressive right now.
You must understand...
- You enjoy making me suffer.
Living is also accepting suffering.
Amen.
That girl was a little off the wall.
But I thought it might work.
I fell in love. Like a jerk.
And now. I feel real bad.
Are you happy? Is that therapeutic?
I imagine you don't want to try again.
No.
- At least not now.
I want you to stay out of my life.
You know that's impossible.
Your contract with Globale states that as long as you don't get better...
I don't care!
Look. It's Mr...
- Thomas.
Mr Thomas. That's it.
You're lucky. I was about to close.
When it's time to go. You know.
- Sorry.
What can I do for you?
It's my vacuum-cleaner again.
Didn't I send you a repairman?
- Yes. Yes.
It should be repaired. but when I turn it on. there's a strange smell.
And there's smoke too.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then. It's normal. There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason. Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman. I bet.
- What makes you think that?
Only women can make us feel that way.
She dumped you?
It's a bit more complicated than that.
Figures.
It's always complicated with them.
I say if they make you suffer. they don't deserve you.
I wasn't in love anyway.
Then. You'll forget her soon enough.
- I guess.
Don't let it get you down.
Have some fun. Go to...
I mean. Do... I don't know. what you enjoy doing.
Yes. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
At your service.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Welcome to Sextoon.
Do you want to compose a new...
- No.
Do you want to call your...
- Yes.
Hello. Thomas.
I'm happy to see you.
I have new story lines...
- Yes.
Make your selection. Thomas.
- Number 4.
"poker game"
There. You won. I have nothing left.
But I can bet something else.
You want me to?
- Yes.
I'll bet my body.
Do you want my body?
- Yes.
You'll have my body if you win the next hand.
Or I'll take all your money. OK?
OK.
You're brave. You like to play.
I like that.
Two cards.
No cards for you?
You think you're stronger than me. don't you?
What do you say to that. little bastard?
Bastard.
Go ahead. Take me.
Go ahead. Take me.
Go ahead. Take...
Hello. Eva.
I'll call your insurance.
Why?
You've no right to bother me at work.
I don't.
- You don't want my services.
But I do want your services.
My job is to fuck. At your home.
If I report that you're harassing me...
- I need you. Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.
- Really?
You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.
- Why are you calling me?
Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.
- Maybe I could help.
Great. I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please. Don't compare me to a dog.
I can't stand dogs and cats.
Dogs. Cats. Humans. all part of your illness?
Do you have other similar symptoms?
I have plenty of symptoms.
Look. I'd like to talk with you.
But not here. With all that make-up.
I want to talk with you at your home.
I can't.
- Give me your calling code.
I can't see patients outside of work.
- But I'm not a patient.
Listen. I... Damn. The boss.
Your code?
- I have to disconnect.
Give it to me.
- Please. The boss is calling me.
Give me your code.
- I can't.
I'll file a complaint.
No. Don't.
- Give me your code or I'll file.
I have enough problems as it is.
- Your code.
Please. Don't do this to me.
- Your code.
If she gets another complaint...
Please go.
Your code.
Bernard. Bernard. Oliver. 230.
Thank you.
Mom.
- Hello. Thomas.
It's been exactly a week.
- I'm proud of you. Mom.
But I can't talk right now.
Why not? We had said...
- I have things to do.
What things?
- I don't want to talk about it.
Even with me?
- Yes. Mom.
Call me back in a couple of days.
I knew this once-a-week thing was a bad idea.
Soon you won't talk to me at all.
- Don't be angry.
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
It's all my fault.
- No. Mom.
Yes. It is. No need to feel guilty.
Listen. I don't want to talk with you right now. OK?
Call me in two or three days.
OK. I'll call you Tuesday to...
- That's fine. Bye. Mom.
Hello. Eva.
I forbid you to call me at home.
But...
- You're a bastard.
You blackmailed me. You disgust me.
- No. It wasn't blackmail.
It's going to cause me problems.
Why? Can't someone call you at home?
If you don't hang up.
I'll call your insurance.
So?
They won't be happy.
They may break your contract.
No. You wouldn't do that.
Really?
- No.
I'll count to ten.
- Eva. Please.
One. Two. Three. Four... five. Six. Seven. Eight...
Yes. I know what you're going to say.
But I've been thinking.
I would like for you and I to give it another try.
We have a lot in common and with time. We may...
I'm happy that you called.
Really.
But...
I've met someone else.
Another man?
Through the club. Of course.
Ken.
Ken?
- That's his name. Ken.
He's Ghanaian.
He's in molecular synthesis.
Actually. His parents are Ghanaian.
Ghanaian. Nice.
Molecular synthesis.
That's high technology.
Do you want to meet him? He's here.
- No.
Ken...
Ken. Meet Thomas. A friend.
Hello. Thomas.
- Hello. Ken.
How are you?
- Great.
I'll leave you.
Well. I guess I better go too.
Have a nice life. Melody.
- It's no longer Melody.
What?
- I've changed my name.
I didn't like Melody.
So what is your new name?
- Françoise.
OK. Have a nice life. Françoise.
Thank you. Thomas.
You hate me. Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What? I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes. They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it. I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess. Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean. You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this. This was shorter.
Because...
That way. They'll give me back...
Look. I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on. It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison. There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is. If...
Look. I have to disconnect.
Wait. They check on your private communications?
They can do it.
They always find out anyway.
What if you called from outside. from a public place.
Why would I do that?
- We could talk freely.
About what?
Take down my code. Who knows.
You may need me.
I need no one.
- It's Denis. Xavier. Bernard. 612.
And my name is Thomas.
Thomas?
That's a nice name.
Eva is also a pretty name.
Maybe. But it's not mine.
You're beautiful.
Why do you say that?
- Why what?
You can't say that.
It hurts me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I find you beautiful. That's all.
You just want to fuck me with your damn suit.
So my being pretty or ugly. who cares?
OK. You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me. You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough. I mean...
In two weeks?
A year? Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No. I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No. I'm fine here.
Not me. I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course. I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
You think you're smarter. Don't you?
- No.
You want to manipulate me.
You're playing stupid games.
I love you. Eva.
No. You don't.
You don't love anyone.
You don't know what it means to love.
Hello. Kevin.
Hello. Mr Thomas. How are you?
- Fine.
You have my order?
- Yes.
We didn't have any Kefir Lyofi left. only Bulgarian Lyofi.
You like Bulgarian?
- Yes. Fine.
Are you sure? If not. I'll take it back.
And we'll send you some later.
No. Bulgarian is fine.
OK. Then. As you wish.
See you in three months. Then.
Yes. I'll call you. Thank you. Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No. It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that. from the start?
In five minutes. You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes. I talk to someone. and feel as if I were inside them. watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No. You said you were suspicious of me. that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
I got an MW today. A Major Warning.
Because I called you at home?
- No. Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides. I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes. I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love. If you loved me. you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait. Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
That's not enough.
But it's the same thing...
For me. It's quite something.
You have to go outside.
- I couldn't.
Yes. You can.
- No.
I'm sure you can.
OK. Where is your apartment?
Defosset Street.
Near the Luxembourg Center.
Are you coming?
You remember the park. near the old station?
On the right from Defosset Street.
I'll be waiting on a bench.
No. I couldn't.
- I'm leaving.
Eva. I couldn't.
- Do you love me?
And you?
If you can't go out for me.
I won't even ask myself.
You said there was a bond between us.
We'll see.
I'm leaving.
Hello, welcome to my home.
Leave a message after the beep.
Listen. I love you.
Really. I do.
But I'm sorry. I won't make it.
I am incapable of going outside.
No. Forget what I just said.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
Please wait or leave me a message after the beep.
Thomas. Are you there?
You didn't come out. Did you?
I've been waiting for an hour in the park.
I heard an ambulance.
It wasn't you. Right?
I should have gone to see what it was. but I was afraid to miss you.
Answer me.
Hello.
You've reached Thomas Thomas.
I can't answer right now.
Please wait or leave a message after the beep.
Today is the day
Of your birthday
Happy birthday, Thomas
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.
The age of Christ.
- Cheers.
Here's to you.
Bottoms up!
I bet you had forgotten.
Call us when you wake up.
Cheers.
Yes. Psychomot.
It's you. You are Mister...
Thomas. Right?
- Yes.
How are you?
I just woke up. I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal. Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas. Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
- No.
Mr Thomas. Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well. I came out of my apartment. and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that. I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it. Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What? You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes. But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen. Mr Thomas. you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes. I see.
No nausea? No vertigo?
Here. Now? No. Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky. But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time. You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes. Well.
Thank you. Doctor. Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here.
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
Where can I contact her?
Look. If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she. Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you. she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah. I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah. Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes. The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her. You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK. Enough. Thank you.
Hello. Thomas.
- I should've known.
I am no longer your psychologist.
Globale blamed you for all this?
No. Not directly.
They replaced me by Dr Moreau.
They can. With no reason.
But the girl was...
Eva?
- Yes. Eva.
What will happen to her?
She was transferred to another sector. less demanding of her body.
- What?
Another sentence of substitution. but a longer one.
What does it consist in?
I can't tell you. Thomas.
Globale forbids you to have any contact with her. And it's best.
Where is she?
You must tell me.
Listen. you know. when we were waiting for the insurance experts.
I talked with Eva.
- You saw her?
She asked me to tell you that you were not responsible.
She would have broken down anyway.
She hated being a prostitute. even a medical one.
You were just a catalyzer.
It's not your fault.
You're lying.
- Excuse me?
She would never have said that.
It's not true.
Globale told you to calm me down.
You're totally paranoiac.
I must find her. Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes. I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and
Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you. So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look. We all want you to get better. to go outside. But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?
You were lucky. But if you go out. you'll die like a dog.
Where is she?
She's in a place where you can never find her. Never.
Where?
Outside your apartment.
Hello, you've reached Nathalie Thomas who's not here for now, or only in this bi-dimensional, digital and pixelised version...
Hello. Mom.
You're calling me?
- Yes.
It's the first time.
No. I've called you before.
No. Really. It's the first time in eight years.
I would have called. But...
I would have come to the hospital. but they had already brought you home and said you had to rest.
What got into you. Thomas?
I was worried.
At least. You're OK.
That's what's important.
How are you feeling?
You look good.
- I'm fine.
You just came in?
Yes. I went shopping.
How is the weather?
It just started to rain.
I came in just in time.
Is it cold?
Did you need a sweater?
Why are you asking?
- Just curious.
You're not going to go outside. Are you?
- No.
You know the risks.
- Yes.
So. Is it cold or not?
No. It's not cold.
I went out like this.
OK. I'll leave you now.
Already?
- Yes.
Alright.
Good luck. Thomas.
Love you, Mom.
In the first years
of the 21st century...
a third world war broke out.
Those of us who survived
knew mankind
could never survive...
a fourth.
That our own volatile natures
could simply
no longer be risked.
So we have created
a new arm of the law...
the Grammaton Cleric,
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man,
his ability
to feel.
Police!
You know what to do.
Get down!
Cleric. Lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.
When the door's down, blow the bulbs.
Go.
- This is it.
- Where?
There.
It's real.
Burn it.
Why didn't you just leave it for the Evidentiary Team to log?
They miss things sometimes.
I thought I'd take it down myself, get it done properly.
How long, Preston, until all this is gone?
Until we've burned every last bit of it?
Resources are tight.
We'll get it all eventually.
Libria, I congratulate you.
At last, peace reigns
in the heart of man.
At last, war is but a word
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.
At last... we... are... home.
Librians, there is a disease
in the heart of man.
Its symptom is hate.
Its symptom is anger.
Its symptom is rage.
Its symptom is war.
The disease is human emotion.
But Libria, I congratulate you.
For there is a cure
for this disease.
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.
And you, as a society,
have embraced this cure.
Prozium.
Now we are at peace
with ourselves
and humankind is one.
War has gone. Hate, a memory.
We are our own conscience now
and it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10
for emotional content
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again
and destroy them!
Librians, you have won!
Against all odds
and your own natures,
you have survived.
Every time we come from the Nethers to the city, it reminds me of why we do what we do.
It does?
I beg your pardon?
It does.
The following items have been
rated EC-10 Condemned.
Seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,
seven discs of musical content,
twenty interactive
strategy computer programs.
Thank you for coming, Cleric.
I assume you know who I am.
Yes, sir, of course.
You are Vice-Council Dupont, of the Third Counciliary of the Tetragrammaton. Father's voice.
I am told that you were very nearly a prodigal student, knowing almost instantly if someone is feeling.
I have a good record, sir.
Why do you imagine that is, Cleric?
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.
Somehow...
I'm able, on some level, to sense how an offender thinks, to put myself in their position.
If you had ceased your interval.
If you were a sense offender.
I suppose you could say that, sir.
- You're a family man, Cleric?
- Yes, sir. A boy and a girl.
The boy's in the Monastery on path to becoming a cleric.
Good. And the mother?
My spouse was incinerated for sense offence four years ago.
- By yourself?
- No, sir. By another.
How did you feel about that?
I'm sorry,
I don't fully understand, sir.
How did you feel?
I didn't feel anything.
Really? How is it that you came to miss it?
I...
I've asked myself that same question, sir. I don't know.
A nearly unforgivable lapse, Cleric.
I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future.
Yes, sir.
Every time we come from
the Nethers to the city,
it reminds me
of why we do what we do.
It does?
Every time we come from
the Nethers to the city,
it reminds me
of why we do what we do.
It does?
It does.
Prosecutorial evidence for A&R 136890.
I need it.
It was late this afternoon.
May not have showed up in the records yet.
Nothing logged and nothing pending under that entry.
It was an item brought in by Grammaton Erroll Partridge.
Check again.
Cleric Partridge has not entered anything in for weeks.
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.
Cleric.
There's nothing.
Thank you.
He's been into the Nether every night for two weeks.
We assumed it was enforcement-related.
You always knew.
"But I, being poor, have only my dreams."
"I've spread my dreams under your feet."
"Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams."
I assume you dream, Preston.
I'll do what I can to see they go easy on you.
We both know they never go easy.
- Then I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You don't even know the meaning.
It's just a vestigial word for a feeling you've never felt.
Don't you see, Preston?
It's gone.
Everything that makes us what we are, traded away.
There's no war. No murder.
- What is it you think we do?
- No. You've been with me.
You've seen how it can be, the jealousy, the rage.
A heavy cost.
I pay it gladly.
Don't.
You and your partner were close?
I hope you're as pleased to be assigned me as I am the placement.
I was told this would be a career-making advancement.
I'm like you, Cleric. Intuitive.
Sometimes I know what a person's feeling before they know it.
Cleric.
I could only hope one day to be as... uncompromising as you.
Good night.
The later 20th century
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.
- John.
- Yes.
I saw Bobbie Taylor crying today.
He didn't know, but I saw.
Do you think I should report him?
Unquestionably.
..the single inescapable fact
that mankind united
with infinitely greater purpose
in pursuit of war
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.
"But I, being poor,
have only my dreams."
"I've spread my dreams
under your feet."
"Tread softly, because
you tread on my dreams."
Viviana Preston, don't move!
Don't move! Comply! Comply!
- Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.
We have a warrant for your wife's arrest for sense offence.
Hey! Get her!
Get her off him now!
Remember me.
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day.
Another step...
What are you doing?
I said, what are you doing?
I accidentally dropped my morning interval.
I took it out before I brushed my teeth.
I never take it out before I brush my teeth.
Then you'll go by Equilibrium, log the loss and get a replacement.
Yes. Of course.
Your new partner called.
He'll pick you up at ten for the A&R.
I hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty of telling him you would be at Equilibrium replacing your dose.
No, of course not.
That was the right thing to do.
Stop that.
Due to terrorist activity,
this site is temporarily closed.
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Centre in Sector 8-A.
Due to terrorist activity,
this site is temporarily closed...
More than punctual, Cleric. Hop in.
How are the lines? I'm surprised you could get your interval and get out so quickly.
No, they're fine today.
Maybe I'll drop by later and get my interval adjusted.
You expecting resistance?
That's something you'll find about me. I'm a wary person.
Cautious by nature.
Always expecting the worst.
- You cannot do this.
- Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.
How long have you been off the dose? Look at you.
Look at you!
Look at you.
The mirror's frame's illegal.
Destroy it.
You're gonna burn it, aren't you?
Eventually.
However, you couldn't have accumulated this by yourself.
It'll all be sorted and examined.
We'll discover who your confederates are.
We need her.
- What's your name?
- O'Brien. Mary.
Well, Mary, you can either wait and tell the Technicians of the Palace of Justice or you can tell me now.
Who are your friends?
I'm wondering if you have any idea at all what that word means - friend.
There's nothing you don't feel?
How about guilt?
Let me ask you something.
Why are you alive?
I'm alive...
I live... to safeguard the continuity of this great society, to serve Libria.
It's circular. You exist to continue your existence.
What's the point?
What's the point of your existence?
To feel. Because you've never done it, you can never know it.
But it's as vital as breath.
And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock... ticking.
Then I have no choice but to remand you to the Palace of Justice for processing.
Processing.
You mean execution, don't you?
Processing.
The gun katas. Through analysis of recorded gunfights, the Cleric has determined that the distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically predictable element.
The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each new position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents, while keeping the defender clear of statistically traditional trajectories of return fire.
By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120%.
The difference of a 63% increased lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly.
Without love,
breath is just a clock... ticking.
Prozium - the great nepenthe.
Opiate of our masses,
glue of our great society.
Salve and salvation,
it has delivered us from pathos,
from sorrow, the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.
With it we anaesthetise grief,
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.
Those sister impulses
toward joy, love and elation
are anaesthetised in stride,
except as fair sacrifice.
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness
and all that it has done
to make us great.
- Good morning, Cleric.
- Good morning.
..intrinsically humans
as creatures of the earth
were drawn inherently
always back to one thing: war.
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom,
but the disease itself.
We have sought
to shrug off individuality,
replacing it with conformity.
Replacing it with sameness, with unity,
allowing each man, woman and child
in this great society
to lead identical lives.
The concept of identical
viable construction
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment...
What are you doing?
I'm rearranging my desk.
You didn't like the way it was before?
I had no feelings about it.
I'm merely attempting to optimise.
Sense offenders holed up in the Nether.
We estimate 50 men, sir.
Intelligence tells us they're all fully armed.
This is the group that bombed the Prozium factories.
- You clean, we'll sweep.
- Yes, sir.
Go, go, go, go! Go!
Cover me. I'm going in.
Nice grab, Cleric.
Ludwig van Beethoven.
Cleric, why didn't you leave that for the Evidentiary Team to collect and log?
They miss things sometimes.
I'm gonna take it in myself, make sure it gets done properly.
You know, Preston, if we keep burning all this contraband, eventually there won't be anything left to burn.
What'll there be for men like us?
Sir! We got something out back.
They were defended by women and children. We put them down.
This isn't the first time we've seen this.
Why do they keep these animals?
Do they... Do they eat 'em?
- What do you want me to do?
- Exterminate them, of course.
- All right, let's do it.
- No.
What's wrong, Cleric?
Nothing.
Hey! Grab it. Grab it!
Sir, toss it back in.
I'll finish it off.
- Give it to me, sir.
- Give it to him.
He'll finish it.
Wait!
It seems to me that... at least some of these animals ought to be tested for disease.
If there's an epidemic in the Nethers, it's best we know.
I don't quite follow your logic, Cleric.
They were Resistance. They could have led us to the Underground.
But instead of interrogation, they were slaughtered.
But given the circumstances, the Father has decreed that there will be no more process for sense offenders.
They are to be shot on sight or incinerated without trial.
It's counter to law.
You're a member of the Council...
It is not the will of the Council.
It is the will of Father and he is law.
Sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem?
What we have worked so hard to eradicate?
You must understand, Preston, that while you and even I may not always agree with it, it is not the message that is important.
It is our obedience to it.
Father's will.
Call it faith. You have it, I assume.
Yes. I have it.
Good.
Confiscated evidence X-23-T-45.
Mary O'Brien.
Cleric John Preston passing into the Nether. Enforcement-related.
Thank you, sir.
I don't know what else to do with you.
Go on. Go on.
Go!
Fine. But you're going back in the trunk.
OK.
Here.
Step away from the vehicle.
Step away from the vehicle.
This is your last warning.
Step away from the vehicle.
Identification.
Cleric. I'm here on official...
- Identification!
- It's in my coat.
- Where's the coat? Where is it?
- I don't have it.
Unidentified individuals are subject to destruction.
You're making a mistake. I'm a Grammaton Cleric First Class.
- We'll search your vehicle.
- There's nothing in it.
Search it.
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.
I'm trying to tell you I have a predawn combustion to witness...
This is a waste of my time.
My name is John Preston.
I'm the highest-ranking cleric...
Wait!
Stand off.
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognise you, sir.
That's OK. Just doing your job.
Thank you. We'll escort you back to the gate.
- Thanks.
Animals.
The Nether's full of 'em.
Sounds like it came from your trunk.
Impossible. Just give me my keys.
I'll be on my way.
Captain, I'm asking you one last time.
Don't do this.
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!
Shoot him!
Fuck!
What? Shit!
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
Always practising, Cleric.
I guess that's why you're the best.
Maybe I'm just better.
Something on your mind?
- Why do you ask?
- The intuitive arts.
It's my job to know what you're thinking.
So, then, what am I thinking?
About the murders in the Nether last night.
And if they know who did it.
Am I close?
So tell me, do they know?
There are theories.
I have one of two of my own, but at the moment they're premature.
I'm glad it happened.
- Why?
- Now Father and the Council have to create an acceleration in the crackdown on offenders.
Whoever did it, all they accomplished was a quicker end to the Resistance.
It's gonna be a massacre, Cleric.
I came to tell you there's a raid in the Nether. Sector 7.
So get ready.
That door behind you.
Go.
Go, damn you!
Get out of here.
If you don't, you're dead.
- He'll shoot us in the back.
- I'd shoot you in the face. Go.
Damn you! Follow me. Now!
Let's go.
Prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.
Look out!
What's happening?
We heard gunshots.
- Go!
- What are you doing?
They're Resistance fighters. Cleric!
He's a sense offender!
What is this?
- What are you doing?
- Nicely done, Cleric.
You drive them into the trap.
I close it.
The very definition of teamwork.
Don't you think?
Why don't you take the honours of the execution, Cleric?
These people should be taken for clinical interrogation.
Father's rulings are quite clear.
Offenders are to be shot on sight.
They have valuable information.
They can be put to better use...
Cleric.
If your weapon's low, please use mine.
No.
I think, in the end, it'll be better if you have it.
- Captain.
- Yes, sir. Firing positions!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
- Sir.
- Yes, Cleric.
You asked me to be an instrument against the Resistance.
I'm ready. Today.
I wish to show my faith.
I wish with your permission to locate the Underground once and for all.
To destroy it.
- To destroy it.
- Good. Do it.
I'm so... so very sorry.
These are the possessions he had on him at the time of death.
The legal ones will be burned with him.
Good.
Erroll Partridge.
It's supposed to mean something?
He was a Grammaton Cleric
First Class. You knew him.
News bulletin. I'm a sense offender.
I don't hang round much with the Cleric.
I wanna know about him.
Well, I suggest you go ask him, but I understand that he's dead.
Killed by your friends at the Tetragrammaton.
Not by my friends. By me.
You were lovers.
And thus it is in the writing of the Father that we find our greatest...
Good afternoon, sir.
What will it be for you?
The latest copy of The Insensate?
Revised edition of the Manifesto?
Erroll Partridge.
What do you know about him?
- I beg your pardon?
- Everyone out now.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Erroll Partridge.
What do you know about him?
I'm sure this must be some mistake.
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.
No? Then why are you so scared of me?
You will tell me everything you know about Erroll Partridge, or I will have you taken to the Hall of Destruction for summary combustion.
- I really don't know...
- Speak!
He'd come in here with a fella named Jurgen.
- Why?
- That's all I know, I swear.
Interesting.
We've been watching you, Preston.
You're Jurgen.
You're feeling.
Do you know why you came?
Welcome to the Underground.
Polygraph.
It detects fluctuations of human emotion.
We have to be sure.
Mary.
You're carrying in your pocket a ribbon sprayed with her scent.
You breathe it in sometimes when you think there's no one to see.
But what you feel... could only be satisfied by folding yourself into her.
She's scheduled for combustion.
Tomorrow.
I know.
You know, I was like you.
But the first thing you learn about emotion is that it has its price.
A complete paradox.
But without restraint, without control, emotion is chaos.
- How is that...
- The difference is that when we want to feel, we can.
It's just that... some of us... have to forego that luxury so that the rest can have it.
Some very few of us have to force ourselves not to feel.
Like me.
Like you.
What can I do?
You can kill Father.
Cleric John Preston, you are to come with us immediately.
- Cleric Preston.
- Sir.
I've heard the most disturbing rumour.
- Rumour, sir?
- Yes.
A rumour maintaining that one of us, one of the Cleric, has secretly taken it upon himself to cease his dose.
That one of our elite number is actually feeling.
Feeling, sir?
Are you playing with me, Cleric?
No, sir.
This person, I'm told, is actually attempting to contact the Resistance.
Now, tell me, if you would be so kind, how exactly have you been making use of your time of late?
Attempting to contact the Resistance, sir.
Attempting?
How is it that you intend to expose this traitor if all you do is attempt?
You're absolutely 100% right, sir.
Of course I am.
The Cleric is the final line of defence.
If the Resistance compromises it, we are doomed.
Father is doomed.
I will redouble my effort, sir, to locate the Resistance, to find this traitor and bring them all to the Council's fair justice.
Do it.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I, uh...
I was checking to make sure you've been... taking your interval.
And are you satisfied?
Yes, I am.
Good night, then.
I don't understand.
My execution's set.
Why are you here?
Aren't you going to dose?
My God.
What...
What'll you do?
I don't know.
- Fifty sweepers, maybe more.
- What about an audience?
Father's never given a single audience since the upheaval.
They've trained you to fight these kind of odds.
Even if I could...
Even if I could make it through, what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything, anything would be different?
Our network is larger than you could imagine.
The instant word comes that Father is dead, bombs will be set off at the Prozium clinics and factories.
If we can succeed in disrupting the supply for even one day, one day, our cause will be won by human nature itself.
What about war? There would be cruelties that are gone.
Replaced by the Tetragrammaton?
Will you do it?
Yes.
Can you?
I don't know.
Don't... Seeing her one last time will only make it harder to do what you have to do.
File footage.
Viviana Preston.
Sentence and incineration.
- Auditory.
- Viviana Preston,
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,
you will suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.
You will be taken there
immediately and you will burn.
Has the incineration gone through?
It's going through now. Hey!
Machine turbines priming.
Machine turbines priming.
- I need to speak to this woman.
- You're too late.
If we force the door now, the turbines will explode at street level.
..clear the area immediately.
All unauthorised personnel,
clear the area immediately.
Turbines primed.
Fire in ten seconds,
nine seconds, eight seconds,
seven seconds, six seconds,
five seconds, four seconds,
three seconds, two seconds...
Turbines... fire.
Cleric John Preston.
You are under arrest.
This man, this senior cleric, has ceased the dose.
He is feeling.
He is the worm that has been eating at the core of our great society.
And I... I have brought him for your justice.
I told you I'd make my career with you, Preston.
Vice-Council, this man is guilty of consorting with sense offenders, of having relations with a female, of sense crime itself.
Dispatch a team to his quarters to search for unused Prozium.
If you'll run the trace record on his side arm, you will find it was he who was with the sweeper team when they were murdered.
Cleric, I assume you have something to say to me.
I know... it's hard to believe... that a cleric of the Tetragrammaton could turn his back on everything he's been taught, become associated with the Resistance, even becoming a champion in its Underground.
But it's true.
I promised
I would bring you that man.
And I have.
- Cleric Brandt.
- Sir.
The trace shows that it was your gun in the Nether with the sweepers.
That's impossible.
This is wrong.
I think, in the end,
it'll be better if you have it.
He switched them.
See, I have his gun now.
Of course you do. You took it when you arrested me.
What?
Take him to the Hall of Destruction for combustion.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I can explain this.
I'm not feeling.
He is the one who's feeling.
This is a mistake.
Of course, since a complaint has been lodged, law and the letter is that I allow a team to carry out the search of your premises.
Do you think that's entirely necessary or am I being too... exacting?
As you say, sir, it's the law and the letter.
And it doesn't disturb you in the least that your colleague is going to his end?
The only thing that disturbs me, sir, is that
I am Father's instrument against the Underground, and yet...
I've never had the honour of meeting him.
You know that Father never grants an audience to anyone.
Even to the man who brings him the Resistance?
Just a formality. The search team will be up momentarily.
Excellent. I have nothing to hide.
The search team's already inside, sir.
Excellent.
Looking for something?
If I were you, I'd be more careful... in the future.
- How long?
- Since Mom.
- And Lisa?
- Of course.
- How did you know?
- You forget.
It's my job to know what you're thinking.
Then you know what I'm gonna do now.
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?
It's done.
I've located the Resistance.
Come now. You'll have them all.
Do not address Father unless first addressed by him.
Avoid eye contact.
If you should break his personal security zone, you will be immediately put down by snipers. Is that understood?
You'll be required to surrender your firearm, of course.
- And then there's the test.
- Test?
Yes. You didn't imagine we would risk exposing Father to even such a dedicated servant as yourself without first having him tested, did you?
Please.
Cleric, your weapon, please.
Here.
Sit.
We'll start with a test question first.
More of a riddle, actually.
What would you say is the easiest way to get a weapon away from a Grammaton Cleric?
You ask him for it.
I told you I'd make my career with you, Cleric.
Preston. Brandt's job was simple.
To make you feel like you'd won,
to make you feel safe.
For years,
I tried to infiltrate an agent
into the Underground,
until it hit me.
In order to pass undetected
into their midst,
in order to be trusted by them,
my provocateur
would have to think like them,
and would have to feel like them.
But where to find such a man?
A man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it.
But... we've never met.
No?
Don't look so surprised.
Why should Father be more real
than any other political puppet?
The real Father died years ago.
The Council elected me
to pursue his paternal tradition.
And you, Preston,
the supposed saviour
of the Resistance,
are now its destroyer.
And along with them
you've given me yourself.
Calmly. Coolly.
Entirely without incident.
No.
- Oh.
Shit.
Not without incident.
I'm coming.
You really should learn to knock.
How did it feel, Preston?
Mind the uniform, Cleric.
I plan to be wearing it for a long time.
Be careful, Preston.
You're treading on my dreams.
No!
Wait! Wait!
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm life. I live, I breathe.
I feel.
Now that you know it, can you really take it?
Is it really worth the price?
I pay it gladly.
The following items have been
rated EC-10 Condemned.
..conquest of the known world,
Alexander the Great
slaughtered more than
one million human beings.
Three centuries later,
purely out of jealousy,
Gaius Germanicus Caligula
murdered his own sister,
impregnated with his own child.
...rated EC-10...
...rated Condemned, destroy...
This is my bath water.
There it is, going down the drain.
My soap.
My passport, with no occupation on it... but I'm a film editor.
That's my Nagra 3.
Actually, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it from work.
I'm borrowing this film, too, because I'm shooting everything.
This is the little fern that Marlene and I bought... when we first moved in together.
Wow, it's grown.
It's just been a few months.
I bought these shoes for her.
They do not fit her and she still wears them.
This is my strong French coffee.
And this is... really stupid.
Or is it? I don't know.
Start again.
Paris, September 1st, 1969.
Time is 9:30.
These are pieces of me.
Me in pieces.
I'm trying to find what's real, what's honest.
The total opposite of the film
I'm editing... which is a sci-fi picture about a secret agent...
Codename: Dragonfly.
Bonjour.
Wake up. Wake up.
Rise and shine, Dragonfly.
It is time for you to wake up.
It is a beautiful day today.
You have many secret missions to accomplish today.
It's so early.
It is 2:00 in the afternoon,
Dragonfly.
Can't I sleep?
I never get to sleep.
Would you like to hear your horoscope?
It's good today.
Mystery will be revealed when the moon makes its orbit.
I love a mystery.
Fly
Dragonfly
Seek you out from undercover
Could you be my lover?
Together we can fly
Together we can fly
Fly
The water's freezing.
We are making cinema together!
We are making revolution!
Did I ever tell you that I was the one who discovered her?
You're wonderful. Oh, yes.
Like that. Yes.
Very good.
This is Marlene sleeping.
She's mad at me today.
I asked her if she passed her driving test.
Don't you think I would tell you if I had passed?
Leave me alone!
Yesterday she was happy.
Everything is important.
It's all in the details, they say.
This is the beginning of a new cinema.
It's so delicious.
It's personal, but not pretentious.
- It was beautiful.
- Definitive.
It's such an emotion to see a film like that.
- Daring. Mature.
- Why are you in Paris?
- Which vitamin do you prefer?
- Let him speak.
Gentlemen, we can find out more about a man by his dreams.
I guess I've always been a bit of a daydreamer.
Always interested in film.
A lot my thoughts... my little notions of things and feelings... are like little scenes in my head.
I guess I want to show people what I think about.
What I think is touching or sad or funny...
Oops. I didn't realize you were filming.
It sounded like you were talking to yourself.
Just because you film every possible thing in your life... doesn't mean you'll understand yourself any better.
I'll tell you everything you need to know.
Go ahead. Turn it on.
Go ahead. Tell me.
You're a warm person... but closed off emotionally.
You're self-absorbed and live in a fantasy world.
- Come on.
- Let me talk. It's true.
You've come to Paris to find your life... but it is in front of you, and you won't admit it.
You film all the details of things around you... as if that would bring some understanding.
I just want to capture what's real and honest.
And what if it's boring?
Did you ever think about that?
It may not be interesting for others to watch.
You're mad at me now, aren't you?
Come on.
Let me fix your hair.
I'm just thinking about work.
We've been cutting the ending for two weeks now.
The director has no idea how to end the picture.
And he won't admit it.
Kiss me.
What are you thinking about?
She stands there, looking at him.
She leans closer and says...
I love you.
And we have the ending.
It all comes together.
This shot is not finished yet.
They emerge from the tunnels... and the sun rises... and we see she's joined the revolution.
And so... it ends with a simple declaration of love.
It ends with a beginning.
Yes, a circle. Circle.
Sort of circle.
It's great.
Is that the original ending?
You don't have an ending!
We make an action movie with no action!
It doesn't make any sense!
I haven't shot the end yet.
My vision is to subvert the audience expectations.
I want the end, not with a bang... but with a whimper.
No picture of mine ever ended with a whimper!
We need a bang!
The picture is not watchable!
If you're thinking of changing one frame of my revolution...
- You're off the picture!
- What?
Each moment I spend with you,
I'm losing money.
Fabrizio, shut down this production.
What are you saying?
You're off the picture!
Fabrizio, I don't want to see him ever again!
Go! Go away!
- You're afraid of this film!
- You're not director!
- You fascist! You go away!
- Andre!
It's the young actress!
She's gone to his head!
Finalmente. Eh?
Bullshit!
I have seen this happen many times before.
A director falls for the leading lady... and his judgment goes to the toilet.
Fabrizio, fire everybody involved with this mess.
I have made 63 pictures, and this is the worst.
See if you can bring in...
Felix DeMarco.
The young director.
Call him, now.
One, two, three, four.
Break on me! One, two, three!
Break out.
Something's not right here.
Felix DeMarco.
Now, if I'm being totally honest... which is the point of this film... just hearing his name fills me with envy.
And I don't even know why
I care so much.
They can do whatever they want.
I have this film. My film.
So much has happened since yesterday.
I lost my job.
I need to find a camera.
No more borrowing film.
Need to conserve stock.
Stay on track.
Everything's changing, becoming clearer.
I feel like it might be all over with Marlene.
I need some time to figure things out.
Maybe we should live apart for a little while.
No. It's me. It's all me.
She'll slip into bed without a word... without even a hello.
Maybe a scowl... and I'm going to stop her this time.
I missed him.
Did you miss me?
Yes!
How was your day?
How was your day?
Don't get it. Let's kiss.
Hello? Hey, Pippo.
Really? What, right now?
OK, OK.
They fired everybody this morning... and now they just hired me back... and I have to go to meet the new director.
You're going now?
Till the weekend.
I'm sorry.
Call them and tell them you'll go tomorrow.
There's nothing I can do.
I just get back, you fucking ass!
Why are you leaving me right now?
I'll make a nice salad for you.
I have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm going to cut.
Let's go again.
Can we get some more blood?
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Sure.
I'm glad you're still working on the picture.
Do you know this young director,
Felix DeMarco?
Yeah, I met him before.
He's an ass. Over there.
You look very scary, and action!
A certain number of virgins must be given up to Satan.
I now give you to my master,
His Highness of Darkness... where you will slumber forever in the tomb of Satanic blood.
And... cut!
Print that one.
It was perfect, everyone.
Let's go to lunch.
Come on, baby.
You are getting better and better every day.
Unbelievable.
- Enzo!
- Felix.
Follow me.
What this picture needs,
Felix, is you.
It needs youth, and also... a better ending.
Felix, this is Paul.
He is the editor.
I know this guy.
How you doing?
You did sound on the speedway picture, right?
I pulled cable for you.
I was awful at it, though.
Enzo, Paul's also done the second unit on the picture.
Second unit.
That's fantastic.
Go ahead and tell Felix the plot of the picture.
I would tell you myself, but I'm lousy with English.
Go on.
It's a science fiction film set in...
It's a good little idea, Felix.
You'll make it great.
Use the footage we have.
Cut here, cut there.
Add some action, more of the girl. Very sexy.
I like it sexy, Enzo.
Keep telling the story.
- It's set in the future...
- The year is 2001.
We have one hell of a setup.
Real sexy stuff.
Go ahead, Paul. Go. Go.
There's a group of revolutionaries... hiding out on a moon base... and there's only one answer.
Gentlemen, I want to thank you for attending... this emergency security session.
This visual report will illustrate our problem.
Recent intelligence reports... indicate that a band of youthful revolutionaries... have set up a secret base in the far out region... of the dark side of the moon.
Their leader is a man who's known as Mr. E.
His many followers regard him as a great poet... orator, inventor, and expert in martial arts.
He appears to be leading his group in training exercises... which we believe are linked to a plan to attack Earth... to spread his dangerous anarchistic philosophy.
Not since our troubles began way back in May, 1968... have we seen such a cause for concern.
Most distressing are the reports... that he has developed a top-secret weapon... which we feel we must capture to preserve our way of life.
Gentlemen, we're left with only one option.
To use Agent Codename:
Dragonfly.
- But she's so expensive.
- And so difficult.
I know she's exasperating, but we need her.
Now, I've arranged a teleconference.
Please, Agent Dragonfly.
We had an appointment.
I need my sleep.
We need to get down to business.
OK. What is it?
Your mission is to infiltrate the community... by whatever means available... find Mr. E, and take possession of his weapon.
He's pretty cute, isn't he?
Please. Are you prepared to accept this mission?
I'll take the mission, but you know how much I cost.
Of course.
We're relying on you,
Dragonfly.
The future of the world is in your hands.
So, are you prepared to take this mission?
If you can meet my price.
That sounds like fun.
I love science fiction.
I could probably make this amazing.
I want to tighten it up... reshoot some things, fix the ending... because you don't seem to have that... and...
I could start once the vampire picture wraps.
Perfect.
While Felix shoots... we continue with the trailer and the looping.
Felix, give the editor your thoughts on the trailer.
Stick to Felix like glue.
Hear his ideas, his visions.
Write it.
Yes, we have to go.
We have another projection.
The Three Killers, no?
It just hit me.
I know how the trailer needs to be.
Are you going back to set?
I'll let you know if
I get any other great ideas!
And we're up! We're back!
I want two cameras and another here with me!
We're going to do two!
So, we finally meet.
I like what I see.
- I'm Paul.
- Valentine.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
The director's still on his way.
I'll just get us set up in the meantime.
Sorry about my voice.
My apartment's flooding.
I'm getting a cold.
You'll be fine. Maybe it's...
I was just...
I was just...
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah.
Paul... Felix is missing.
Go ahead and get the session going. Come on.
Yes, yes. People, come on.
- Ever done this before?
- No.
It's pretty easy.
There you go.
So, we finally meet.
I like what I see.
I have a mission, which I intend to accomplish.
I love you.
I love you.
I'm so in love with you.
Do you love me?
I'm in love with you.
I love you.
That's OK.
Changing rolls. Sorry.
You have an eyelash right here.
If you blow on it, you can make a wish.
I wish cats could talk.
You're not supposed to tell me.
It won't come true.
I'm sure it'll come true.
My cat's pregnant.
I wish I could talk to her.
- Can I get you to sign this?
- Sure.
You must be the director.
How exactly you want me to do this?
With a lot of authority, or maybe more playful?
Who is Dragonfly?
She's a super-sexy secret agent.
But that's top secret.
Dragonfly is coming.
- How do you like it? Good?
- It's great.
You hear me? One, two, three.
You hear me?
Dazzling? It's OK.
Dazzling is terrific.
Dragonfly is terrific.
- Everything else good.
- It's great.
Thank you. Thanks.
Just try them.
Where'd she go?
Out that way.
Who is Dragonfly?
Hi, Valentine.
Felix DeMarco, the director.
How are you?
Sorry I'm late.
I'm just... crazy.
Actually, we already finished.
Oh, great.
Want to get a bite to eat?
Sure.
- Do you have any francs?
- Yeah. I do.
I'm fresh out.
I know a little great place.
Do you use The Method?
Do we have to do this now?
Yeah. That's the thing.
I have to do it, even if I don't want to.
It's the only way to be honest and real.
Have you seen my light meter?
You didn't tell me your father was coming for Christmas.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
He's on a lecture tour.
Just be passing through the airport for an hour or two.
Asked me to meet him there.
You never tell me anything.
What was the actress like?
She's a nice girl.
And?
Am I in frame?
Today is December 20th, 1969.
I have to stay focused.
Complete honesty.
Do you love me?
You know how I feel about you.
You just want me to say it in front of my camera?
Why can't you just say it?
I sew your ripped pants.
I trip over your camera.
I love you, of course.
I just don't want to run out of film.
What are you looking for?
What do you mean?
What is your biggest wish?
That cats could talk.
Something that girl said, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
You're being silly.
I thought you had to be totally honest in this film.
I am.
You're being ridiculous.
Who said that? That actress?
You want to sleep with her!
- Now, that's ridiculous.
- What is your problem?
I can't believe you!
I just don't understand!
We need to talk.
Hey, Paul.
Ready to go to the party?
Let me drive.
Did you pass your driving test finally?
Maybe you can drive on the way home.
I got a call from the hospital.
Felix was in a car accident.
Smashed up his Alfa.
The doctor said he was OK.
Just broke his leg.
He's getting out of the Dragonfly picture... taking a break.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I want to recommend you to Enzo.
Me?
I think you should finish the film.
I know you can do a good job.
You're a talented kid.
You have helped the picture a lot.
I have seen that... in the second unit shots
I have gotten.
The footage of the cosmic rays... that was your idea.
It's a good idea.
We talk to him tomorrow.
It is sonic boom of the Concorde.
It's so fucking amazing.
We're living in the future, man.
...acting is to the scenario.
I found this great place in St. Germain.
Would you excuse me one second?
I've got some big news.
Can't you see I'm talking to someone right now?
Give me two minutes.
Excuse me, you were saying?
It's called theater of revolution.
It's going to be a movement, a voice, a poetry workshop.
I'm sure you'd love this place.
- Did you hear about poor Felix?
- I hope he's OK.
He's so talented.
Working with him is so much fun.
I remember once, when we finished early... and he took us all to the go-kart ride.
Oh, God! Come here.
- That nobody can deny...
- Hey, babe!
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
It's Felix DeMarco!
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
Thank you. Thank you.
So kind.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'd like to make an announcement.
I'm sure you've probably heard... about the mad events of this evening... but we're OK, right?
But there's one more thing that happened.
I asked Brigit to marry me... and she said yes!
And so, we can't wait one moment further... and we're setting sail tomorrow.
Don't stand around staring at us!
Let's dance!
Dad. Dad.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. I misplaced my glasses on the plane.
Thank you very much.
Let me hold your hand.
Hold on. Wait.
I took a sleeping pill, and I ate all the ice cream.
It's good to see you.
Good to see you at Christmas, even briefly.
Wait a second.
I brought you something.
Thanks, Dad.
I had a dream the other night... and I thought of you.
Well, you were in it.
I was watching these... hideous films of Vietnam on the television.
And I had this deep, desultory dream... where I met a son that I didn't know I had.
And he looked like you.
You were there, too.
Two brothers.
But then I realized that he was a soldier in the war.
And when I woke up,
I had these... these feelings of worry and of loss.
And I wondered... this is curious... could I have had a child by another woman... and never known about it?
Isn't that a curious thought?
I think about it sometimes and...
What if I met a boy and he looked like you?
Maybe it's really my son.
Sometimes I'll be driving down the street... and I'll see someone who looks familiar... like it could be my brother.
You know?
So, maybe it's true, Dad.
It is possible, Paul.
I wasn't always faithful to your mother.
When I was your age... all I could think about was women.
It was like a disease or a curse.
I think I know what you mean, Dad.
Kids are nice.
When do you think you'll have some of your own?
I don't know, Dad.
Have you thought about coming back home?
Your mother wanted me to ask you.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
We found your glasses.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wow.
I think it's time to go.
I'm very glad for you, Paul.
I know you'll do well in this new job of yours.
What is it?
It's a science-fiction film... about a futuristic spy named Dragonfly.
That's interesting.
Your grandmother used to call dragonflies... the Devil's darning needles.
She told me that they come in the night... and stitch up your mouth if you use profanity... or were otherwise voluble.
This isn't exactly about that.
Maybe you can use it somehow.
Thanks, Dad.
You never know when some little overheard story... or image can find a place in your work.
Here.
- OK, see you.
- See you.
How was it seeing your father?
It was nice.
He told me about this strange dream that he had.
I'm going out to get some milk.
Action!
Give me some screaming, girls.
Louder!
Now give me some moaning.
Louder!
You did good work on the trailer.
Thank you, sir.
Fabrizio says you know the space picture... better than anyone else... and thinks you should take over.
He usually knows what he's talking about.
So, you make some shorts, films, things like that?
- I'm working on a film.
- Come here.
Now, there are two kinds of movies.
Those with an ending, and those without an ending.
This movie needs an ending.
I've made some fifty pictures... and this is my advice... the ending is the most important part of the movie.
The part that people remember when they leave the theater... but everybody works on it last when they are exhausted.
So, listen to me... and figure out how to end this picture... with an exciting twist.
And that we can do it in two days.
Yes, that we can shoot in two days!
I'll be in Rome for the holidays... and Fabrizio will get you out there... and you can show me what you're thinking.
Francheschino!
And you... astonish me.
I'll have a cocktail.
Your cocktail is ready,
Dragonfly.
Attention, all comrades.
We will soon be ready to leave our lunar domes... to descend and bring change to Earth.
We need to be free... to make love all day.
Every day.
Must be free.
So... we finally meet.
I like what I see.
I've been expecting you.
Hope you're not disappointed.
I knew it was only a matter of time... before they sent in
Agent Codename: Dragonfly.
You've got quite a reputation.
Really? Tell me about it.
Work with the revolution,
Dragonfly. Join us.
I have a mission... which I intend to accomplish.
There she is!
Fabulous.
Preparing boosters.
Stand by.
There she is!
There's too many loose ends here.
This gun...
What is so special about this gun?
We got a Christmas gift.
Have a look.
It's a present from the guys in the screening room.
What a temper.
Andrezej was so mad that day.
The mysterious, dark figure.
Who should that be?
Paul, relax.
It's just a movie.
I can't find reel seven here.
What is this?
Oh, Madonna.
Paul, reel seven.
It will take me days to put it back together.
A message.
It's written in the code from the movie.
Yeah. Film 37.
Checking code book.
All right. D-e...
"Defilers beware.
"Defilers beware, exclamation point?"
Who sent this?
Andrezej.
Oh, God, Andrezej.
It has to be him.
He has a key to the door.
This is bad news.
Damn. I knew it. He's crazy!
And you know what?
I'm sure he cut the brakes on Felix's car.
Jesus. You know...
I'm calling the locksmith.
You know what?
You better watch out, Paul.
Damn. He's crazy. I knew it!
He cut the film in a million pieces.
I want to see your soul in action.
I love you.
Take your time. Not so fast.
- I love you.
- Like that, yes.
Say "I'm in love with you."
I'm in love with you.
- One more time.
- Shut up.
Transmission breach.
Need assistance.
Need assistance.
Ship's been damaged.
Hey, you got my message.
Come in.
It must be freezing out.
I've tried everything to fix this... but I can't figure out how it goes back together.
Let me take a look.
You look cold.
I'm all right now.
We'll be out of here in no time.
What are you doing on the moon?
I don't know.
I think I'm lost.
Dragonfly... what happens in the end?
I don't know, but don't worry.
We're going to find out soon.
Hey, what happened?
Are you OK?
Was someone here?
I'm just sad.
I'm losing all my patience with you.
You talk to your camera night and days... but you never talk to me.
Why don't you say anything to me?
What should I say?
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry you're sad.
Come here.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know if I have any ideas.
They want something that
I'm not sure I can give them.
Maybe I should just go to Rome and tell them...
"I don't know what to do with your idiotic story."
It's not even my film.
And this ending...
Paul, I'm glad you're saying all this to me... but I don't care about the stupid film.
I care about us like we used to be.
Come here. Come here.
Now go.
Go to Rome.
Do what you like... but just remember that you bring everything upon yourself.
That came for you.
You spent all your money on a camera.
You are here.
These are good, don't you think?
It's very nice.
Not too bad. Sit down.
Good, good, good.
OK, so... do you have a great ending for me?
I recut most of the picture... to make it shorter and clearer.
And one of my ideas is to take Mr. E's gun... and make it a little more special... so it can temporarily freeze people.
Freeze people. Sounds good.
And that's how they plan to take over.
What about the ending?
The alley...
Dragonfly's running, chasing after the guy.
What happens?
Well...
I have a few ideas.
That's the problem.
You got too many ideas.
We just need one good one.
Look, son, this is my thirty-seventh picture.
I've worked with some of the best in the business... and I've learned a few little tricks.
One of them is to always try to make the audience... wonder what's going to happen.
And then at the end, you tell them... but you surprise them a little, eh?
Easy.
Look, it's New Year's Eve.
You are going to the party.
Come with us. Let's have fun.
Oh, my little monster.
Julietta.
Come on, come with us.
Paul, go ahead to the party.
Have a good time.
We'll be right back.
Valentine!
There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you.
Listen, I know you've been working on that ending... which is exciting because it got me thinking.
This ending has to be fabulous.
I imagine a new scene.
I'm parachuting down to Earth...
Where did you go?
You just left me standing there.
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my director.
Thank you.
I think I'll just walk.
Hold on.
There you go.
- Are you English?
- American.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
My friend is waiting for a boy.
He's in the army.
They haven't seen each other for one year.
He wrote her and say that he would run away... from the army and meet her here tonight.
It's a whole new decade... but it still feels the same to me.
So, let's hear it.
So, Dragonfly's running through the tunnel.
She comes to the figure hidden in the shadows.
And the figure emerges.
And the figure...
Your book!
That cats could talk.
I thought you had to be totally honest in this film.
- Absolutely pretentious.
- Indulgent.
You're just fucking blowing it.
This film is too fractured.
It's confusing.
It's an aggression for your eyes, for my eyes.
Especially the shot where you sit on the toilet.
Where's the story?
Where's the structure?
I don't care about this person.
Do you think you are clever?
I just wanted to make something... that would reflect who I am, who I was.
It was a difficult and confusing time.
What's the point?
What am I supposed to do?
And regarding that space project you're involved in... there's no snow on the moon.
- Wait!
- You should know that.
What should I do?
You need to connect things so they make us feel something.
You surprised me.
I didn't see you there.
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.
Would you please let me know if
I'm not doing something right?
It's my first day, so...
It'll be fine.
Remind me about the scene in the story... right before the one we're shooting.
You... I mean, Dragonfly had just barely escaped... with this special gun from the dark side of the moon.
How does my spaceship get fixed?
I came to the moon and fixed it for you.
Then you landed safely in Paris.
Landing successful.
Please notify the Corporation that the mission's complete.
Affirmative.
You didn't knock.
I wanted to surprise you, my darling.
Dragonfly
Tell me, how can you resist her
Until your lips have kissed her
She'll be a mystery
Please don't try to stop me.
I'm sorry.
He kills me?
The gun doesn't work on you.
Why not?
I'll explain later, but what happens... is the gun actually has a special property.
The revolution depends on this weapon...
The gun freezes people.
Interesting.
So, what happens next?
Incoming call on cine-com.
Do you have possession of the package? Please respond.
Affirmative.
I'm sorry.
Bring it down. You all right?
Sorry, I didn't realize...
I'm fine. My foot...
All right, we'll go again.
It was our fault.
Bring her up, please.
Someone stole the exposed film.
Paul, go.
Here.
Are you scared?
Oops.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- I'm fine.
Go.
How could you betray me?
Destroy my artwork, you little shit!
Do you think that you can make a better ending... by putting in your car chase?
What about the theme?
The story?
Have you thought about that, Paul?
- I wasn't trying...
- Bullshit!
Don't move! I'm warning you!
I'm sorry.
It's a big opportunity for me...
You want to know the real reason?
They are afraid about the film.
They're trying to keep the youth rebellion suppressed.
A film can change the course of the future.
It can invent the future by making ideas concrete.
That's why when I heard you were changing the ending...
I was forced to do this.
I had an idea.
I had a new idea for the ending, that maybe she... the Corporation, its center, betrays her.
The revolutionary get their weapon back in the end.
Promise me that, Paul.
I promise.
Good.
I've been working on a personal film.
Personal film?
With no compromise, right?
- Right.
- We'll... see about you.
I'm old.
I can go now and write my personal work.
Now that I have something to write about.
I have to ask...
Did you make love to her?
Did you cut the brakes on Felix's car?
Remember, Paul... always stand next to the camera.
Your actor will feel you there... and will be playing just for you.
I can't believe it.
Bravo! Did they catch him?
Who was the son of a bitch who stole the film?
Just some old guy.
It doesn't matter anyway.
We got it back.
It's all going to work out.
We'll get the final footage tomorrow on the stage.
- You did good, Paul.
- Where's Valentine? Is she OK?
She was fine. In fact,
I think she enjoyed herself.
She just left in a rush.
She asked that you call her.
She said it was important.
Antonio, come on, eh?
Hi, it's Paul.
You got to come here quickly.
Oh, my God!
Taxi!
Come look.
They were just born.
I like to document all the things of my life.
I found you.
I was cold.
Thank you very much.
All right.
And...
And action.
But how?
You're me.
Quickly, we're in danger.
Nice try, Dragonfly.
Go, go!
My father built the Dragonfly robot... for the most dangerous missions.
He modeled her on me... her looks and her lifelike qualities.
But the Corporation programmed her... so that she couldn't betray them.
She wanted to help you, but she couldn't.
That's why I tried to help.
I knew the revolution needed this weapon... so I took it to give to you.
I did it to help you, to help the cause.
I believe in this revolution... and I believe in you.
We were in love.
We are identical in all respects.
In all respects?
In all respects.
All I really did was stitch together things from my life.
Things that made an impression on me.
Just put a little piece of myself out there... try to organize it, take a look at it... make some connections, some sense of things.
I think that's all the time we have.
Thanks a lot to Paul.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I enjoyed what you had to say.
Thank you very much.
By the way, do you know Felix DeMarco?
Do you think you could pass this script on to him for me?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
My dog knocked over the tripod, and the camera kept running... so I kept it all in the film.
...things around you... as if that would bring some understanding?
I just want to capture what's real and honest.
And what if it's boring?
Maybe Marlene was right... but each one of these images brings up a feeling or a memory.
I can smell Marlene when
I see this shot of the soap.
I found her drivers license... and I tried to reach her by calling her mother... and Marlene answered.
When she heard my voice, she hung up.
I thought that my film was going to be about... looking at all the pieces of myself... but, Marlene...
I got you in pieces, too.
So this is the end... or is it the start?
Of what?
Hah!
Aah! Unh!
[grunting]
Aah!
Oof!
I don't need any help.
You're welcome.
Aah!
Unh!
Yaa!
Aah!
[screaming]
Come on!
He can wait.
Woman: Then fire them.
In fact, get rid of the whole division.
I don't care what Luthor would have done.
I'm in charge now, and if you can't accept that, I'll...
Mercy.
[groaning]
Help me.
I'm... I'm...
Sick?
Dying?
And you couldn't do it somewhere else?
After all I've done for you.
You mean letting me, a lowly chauffeur, run your company while you were away?
Oh, was I flattered.
But then I realized there was no one else you could trust to give it back...
Only me, your loyal dog.
Well, let me tell you something.
This dog took LexCorp out of the hole you dug and brought up the stock 38% all on her own.
So if you think I'm ever gonna let you...
Unh!
[gasping]
Looks like there's some life in the old suit after all.
Now where's professor Ivo?
[gasping]
I... I fired him.
You what?
He was one of our best scientists.
How could you do that?
Well?
I... I was trying to save money.
He's probably at his place in mountain view.
Unh!
Good girl.
[breathing heavily]
[screaming]
Superman: G.L.'s already patrolling the city, and Hawkgirl will join him as soon as we're done here.
Batman and I are going to follow up some leads, but I just don't know if it'll be enough.
So... A psychic sweep.
Of the whole city.
Is it possible?
I've never tried anything like that before.
Once the gate is opened, it might not be so easy to close.
I realize it's a lot to ask, but Luthor...
I know.
He must be stopped.
Smart guy.
Ivo, it's Luthor.
You've got to help me.
Will you get up? I'm d...
[gasp]
Looks like the cigarettes finally got you...
And maybe me, too.
[gasp]
Well, what are you waiting for?
It's not like I won't be dead soon enough, anyway.
Woman, thinking: I want him to love me...
But I don't think he even likes me.
Man: I wish she'd wear some vinyl.
Different woman: I smell bad.
I just know it.
20 showers a day.
I still can't get rid of it.
Man: Bald?
How could anyone say I'm bald?
I just have a high forehead.
Different man: I should ask her out,
but what would she want with me?
But I should try, though.
Woman: Rotten kids.
They don't appreciate me.
Man: I just need a roof over my head.
That's all...
And a drink. Yeah.
Woman: It's funny.
[all talking at once]
[voices stop]
[breathing heavily]
[all talking at once]
Man: I'll sue the pants off him!
Woman: I'll take him for everything he's got!
Man: She thinks she's so special.
Woman: What do I have to tell anyone?
Man: Looks like a gorilla.
[all talking at once]
[groaning]
Aargh!
A little help here.
When will professor come back?
Never.
He has to.
You miss him.
So do I.
He was one of my best friends.
He was?
Almost like a brother, and he would have wanted me to look after you if anything ever happened to him.
So... You're going to take care of me now?
Mm-hmm.
But you're going to have to take care of me, too.
Otherwise, I'll go to sleep and never wake up again.
Thank you.
Now, there's one other thing I need...
Fuel.
[buzzer]
Stay back, freak.
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Whoa! Whoa!
Hold it, big boy.
Yah!
Now, what did you want this for?
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Aah! Unh!
Mmm.
Aah!
[door opens]
[door closes]
Well, it looks like Ivo was right on the money.
His duplication program seems to be working rather well.
I assume you ran into Hawkgirl?
Girl with wings. Yes.
And seeing that you were able to get away with this,
I take it she didn't fare too well.
Is she still alive?
Yes.
Aww.
What's wrong?
Let me tell you a story.
It's about a young man whose dream was to build a great empire.
He succeeded.
Then he lost it all because of 7 very bad people...
Hawkgirl and her friends...
The Justice League.
That young man was me, of course, and now I have another dream.
It's to take back control of that empire.
And then, when the time comes,
I want to hand it down to someone who will continue my work...
The son I never had.
But none of that can happen until you give the Justice League what they deserve.
Mercy: He's the most deeply twisted man
I've ever met.
Of course I'll help you.
Good. If he contacts you, let us know.
You have my word.
He hasn't already contacted you, has he?
Don't you think I would have told you?
The two of you were very... Close.
I'm a different person now.
Right.
She was a little too cooperative, wasn't she?
You're learning.
I wouldn't mind hearing what she's really thinking.
[all talking at once]
Superman on radio:
J'onn? Any luck yet?
No.
Where are you?
I can't talk now.
Are you all right?
Leave me alone!
Grr!
It was some kind of android.
It had wings built into it and a mace, too.
Scary, huh?
Sounds like whoever made it had you in mind.
Yeah. It even acted like me.
Now, that's scary.
The android...
It's about 10 feet tall, gray skin?
How'd you know?
Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
Aah!
Ohh!
[sirens]
Aah!
You forgot to mention he's as strong as I am.
Hawkgirl: He wasn't like that before.
Aah! Aah!
Unh!
Ooh!
Unh! Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
[groans]
Unh!
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Hah!
Unh!
Unh!
[telephone ringing]
Ohh!
Ohh...
[grunting]
Another business call?
She fired Ivo months ago, and he's an M.D., something Luthor should be needing right about now.
One more thing...
Ivo's specialty is nanotechnology.
Green Lantern: Batman, it's Lantern.
We've found Hawkgirl's robot.
Where are you?
Don't even think about it.
Somehow this thing's copying all our powers just by looking at us.
We can't just stay here.
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
You come here, and all you'll do is make him even stronger.
Aah!
Lantern!
Unh!
Unh!
Hera help us!
She'd better.
No one else can now.
Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant.
Very good, Lieutenant.
We made it.
I guess I was wrong.
There was no danger at all.
Cordé.
Milady, I'm so sorry.
I've failed you, Senator.
No.
Milady, you're still in danger here.
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.
Senator Amidala, please.
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.
More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
If they do break away--
I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years... be split in two.
My negotiations will not fail.
If they do, you must realize... there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic.
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
Master Yoda... do you think it will really come to war?
The dark side clouds everything.
Impossible to see the future is.
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honour.
Good.
Send them in.
We will discuss this matter later.
Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform-- terrible.
Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.
But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are.
Master Jedi, may I suggest... the senator be placed under the protection of your graces?
Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--
The situation is that serious?
No, but I do, Senator.
I realize all too well that additional security... might be disruptive for you... but perhaps someone you're familiar with.
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.
That's possible.
He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
Do it for me, milady. Please?
The thought of losing you... is unbearable.
I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.
Thank you, Master Windu.
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.
I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
You fell into that nightmare, Master... and I rescued you, remember?
Oh... yes.
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.
Obi? Obi!
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again,Jar Jar.
Senator Padmé.
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.
Desa Jedi arriven.
It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.
Ani?
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.
Well, for a senator, I mean.
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.
Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service.
Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment.
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.
The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.
I don't need more security.
I need answers.
I want to know who's trying to kill me.
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.
We will find out who's trying to kill you, Padmé.
I promise you.
We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin... and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?
- What?
Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?
Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.
We will do exactly as the council has instructed.
And you will learn your place, young one.
Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I will retire.
I know I'll feel better having you here.
I'll have an officer stationed on every floor... and I'll be in the control centre downstairs.
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.
She hardly even recognized me,Jar Jar.
I've thought about her every day since we parted and... she's forgotten me completely.
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.
She was pleased to see us.
Now, let's check the security.
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.
We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.
My client is getting impatient.
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.
And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.
I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.
I don't think she liked me watching her.
What is she thinking?
She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder.
There are many other ways to kill a senator.
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master?
You're using her as bait.
It was her idea.
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.
I can sense everything going on in that room.
Trust me.
It's too risky.
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.
And yours are?
Possibly.
You look tired.
I don't sleep well any more.
Because of your mother?
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.
Dreams pass in time.
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.
You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken.
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.
She's not like the others in the senate, Master.
It is my experience that senators focus... only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.
At least not on the economics of politics.
And besides, you're generalizing.
The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
Palpatine is a politician.
I have observed that he is very clever... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.
I think he's a good man--
I sense it too.
Stay here!
Are you all right, milady?
What the--
Jedi poo doo!
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is. with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.
If you spent as long practising your sabre techniques as you do your wit... you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
I thought I already did.
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!
You know I don't like it when you do that.
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.
I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide!
Anakin! How many times have I told you... stay away from power couplings!
That was good!
Where are you going?
He went that way.
Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep-fried... and, personally, I'd like to find out who he is and who he's working for.
This is a short cut... I think.
Well, you've lost him.
I'm deeply sorry, Master.
That was some short cut, Anakin.
He went completely the other way.
- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.
I hate it when he does that.
Anakin!
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.
Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?
Don't say that, Master.
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.
Then why don't you listen to me?
I am trying.
Can you see him?
I think he is a she... and I think she is a changeling.
In that case, be extra careful.
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?
For a drink.
Thank you.
-You wanna buy some death sticks?
-You don't want to sell me death sticks.
I don't want to sell you death sticks.
You want to go home and rethink your life.
I want to go home and rethink my life.
Easy.
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.
Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
It was a senator from Naboo.
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.
Who hired you? Tell us.
Tell us now!
It was a bounty hunter called--
Wee shahnit... sleemo.
Toxic dart.
Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.
Most importantly, find out who he's working for.
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.
Handle that your Padawan will.
Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo.
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.
Travel as refugees.
As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
Until caught this killer is... our judgement she must respect.
Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.
I will talk with her.
Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order.
I know her well enough to assure you of that.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
And so, they've finally given you an assignment.
Your patience has paid off.
Your guidance more than my patience.
You don't need guidance, Anakin.
In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.
Then you will be invincible.
I have said it many times:
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin... even more powerful than Master Yoda.
I am concerned for my Padawan.
He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.
The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.
The boy has exceptional skills.
But he still has much to learn, Master.
His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
Yes.
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.
Too sure of themselves they are.
Even the older, more experienced ones.
Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.
It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.
Mesa honoured to be taking on dissa heavy burden.
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and--
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
Of course.
Milady.
I do not like this idea of hiding.
Don't worry.
Now that the council has ordered an investigation... it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.
I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided.
Sometimes we must let go of our pride... and do what is requested of us.
Anakin, you've grown up.
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.
As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu.
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.
In some ways-- a lot of ways--
I'm really ahead of him.
I'm ready for the trials... but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.
He won't let me move on.
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.
He's overly critical.
He never listens.
He doesn't understand.
It's not fair!
All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.
It's the only way we grow.
I know.
Anakin... don't try to grow up too fast.
But I am grown up.
You said it yourself.
Please don't look at me like that.
Why not?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry, milady.
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.
He'll be safe with me.
You'll be fine.
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.
What if they realize you've left the capital?
Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.
Anakin... don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.
Yes, Master.
I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.
You'll be back here in no time.
I'll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
- It's time to go.
- I know.
Anakin, may the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you, Master.
Suddenly I'm afraid.
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.
Someone to see ya, honey!
Jedi, by the looks of him.
Obi-Wan!
Hello, Dex.
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
Old buddy!
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
You can tell me what this is.
Well, whattaya know!
I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin'... on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.
Can you tell me where it came from?
This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino sabredart.
I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives.
It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.
I should think that you Jedi would have more respect... for the difference between knowledge and... wisdom.
Well, if droids could think... there'd be none of us here, would there?
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.
I'd say about 1 2 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze.
Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.
Depends on what, Dex?
On how good your manners are... and how big your... pocketbook is.
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze.
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for... doesn't exist.
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist.
Hey, you! No droids!
Get outta here!
Thank you, R2.
Must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.
Or be with the people that I love.
Are you allowed to love?
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
Attachment is forbidden.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi's life.
So you might say that we are encouraged to love.
You've changed so much.
You haven't changed a bit.
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.
Use your feelings you must.
Younglings. Younglings!
A visitor we have.
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.
Hello.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?
I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.
I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.
How embarrassing!
Liam, the shades.
Gather round the map reader.
Clear your minds... and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.
It ought to be here... but it isn't.
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.
Gravity's silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have.
How can this be?
A thought?
Anyone.
Master?
Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.
The Padawan is right.
Go to the centre of gravity's pull... and find your planet you will.
The data must have been erased.
But who could empty information from the archives? Isn't that impossible?
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.
But who and why, harder to answer.
Meditate on this I will.
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.
I'm not sure I was ready.
The people you served thought you did a good job.
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution... so you could stay in office.
I was relieved when my two terms were up.
But when the queen asked me to serve as senator...
I couldn't refuse her.
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.
I'm glad that you chose to serve.
If the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war.
It's unthinkable!
There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.
Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
Not if they feel threatened.
They'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.
It's outrageous... but after four trials in the Supreme Court...
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.
I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.
We must keep our faith in the Republic.
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
Let's pray that day never comes.
In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.
- But I was thinking--
- Hold on a minute.
Excuse me.
I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.
There are some places up there that are very isolated.
Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady.
And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here.
I think it would be wise... if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
Sorry, milady.
Perfect. It's settled, then.
There it is, R4, right where it should be.
Our missing planet Kamino.
Master Jedi.
The prime minister is expecting you.
- I'm expected?
- Of course.
He is anxious to meet you.
After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren't coming.
Now, please, this way.
May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino.
And this is Master Jedi--
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.
Please.
And now to business.
You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.
200,000 units are ready... with a million more well on the way.
That's good news.
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas... that his order will be met on time.
I'm sorry. Master--
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still... a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.
The army?
Yes, a clone army, and I must say... one of the finest we've ever created.
Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master first contacted you about the army... did he say who it was for?
Of course he did.
This army is for the Republic.
But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
That's why I'm here.
We used to come here for school retreat.
We would swim to that island every day.
I love the water.
We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
I don't like sand.
It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere.
Not like here.
Here, everything is soft... and smooth.
No.
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.
Very impressive.
I'd hoped you would be pleased.
Clones can think creatively.
You will find that they are immensely superior to droids.
We take great pride in our combat education and training programmes.
This group was created about five years ago.
You mentioned growth acceleration.
Oh, yes, it's essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.
Now we can do it in half the time.
I see.
They are totally obedient... taking any order without question.
We modified their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host.
And who was the original host?
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
And where is this bounty hunter now?
Oh, we keep him here.
Apart from his pay, which is considerable...
Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.
- Curious, isn't it?
-"Unaltered''?
Pure genetic replication.
No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration.
I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.
I would be very happy to arrange it for you.
Magnificent, aren't they?
I don't know.
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?
They only work on the weak-minded.
All right.
I was 1 2.
His name was Palo.
We were both in the Legislative Youth Programme.
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.
All right, I get the picture.
Whatever happened to him?
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.
Maybe he was the smart one.
You really don't like politicians, do you?
I like two or three... but I'm not really sure about one of them.
I don't think the system works.
How would you have it work?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what's in the best interest of all the people... and then do it.
That's exactly what we do.
The trouble is that people don't always agree.
Well, then they should be made to.
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.
- You?
- Of course not me.
- But someone.
- Someone wise.
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works.
- You're making fun of me.
- No.
I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.
Ani, are you all right?
Boba, is your father here?
Yep.
May we see him?
Sure.
Dad, Taun We's here.
Jango, welcome back.
Was your trip productive?
Fairly.
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
He's come to check on our progress.
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.
I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.
Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
- Once or twice.
- Recently?
Possibly.
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.
Master who?
Sifo-Dyas.
Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job?
Never heard of him.
Really?
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
Curious.
Do you like your army?
I look forward to seeing them in action.
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.
Thank you for your time,Jango.
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
What is it, Dad?
Pack your things.
We're leaving.
And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.
" Aggressive negotiations''?
What's that?
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.
If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.
From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.
And now that I'm with you again...
I'm in agony.
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
The thought of not being with you--
I can't breathe.
I'm haunted by the kiss... that you should never have given me.
My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul... tormenting me.
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.
If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.
I can't.
We can't.
It's... just not possible.
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.
No, you listen.
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it'll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something.
I will not let you give up your future for me.
You are asking me to be rational.
That is something
I know I cannot do.
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings... but I can't.
I will not give in to this.
Well, you know... it wouldn't have to be that way.
We could keep it a secret.
We'd be living a lie... one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.
I couldn't do that.
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?
No. You're right.
It would destroy us.
Tell your council that the first battalions are ready.
And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them.
I won't forget, and thank you.
Thank you.
R4!
Scramble code five to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home!
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...
is the assassin we are looking for.
Do you think these cloners are involved... in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.
Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
Yes, Master.
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?
No. Whoever placed that order... did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.
Bring him here.
Question him we will.
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.
Blind we are if creation of this clone army... we could not see.
I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished.
Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.
If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will.
No.
Mom, no.
Don't go.
I don't want to disturb you.
Your presence is soothing.
You had another nightmare last night.
Jedi don't have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother.
She is suffering, Padmé.
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.
She is in pain.
I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go.
I have to help her.
I'll go with you.
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.
Dad, look!
Boba, get on board!
Oh, not good.
Wait right there.
Okey-okey.
Chut-chut, Watto.
Let me help you with that.
What? What do you want?
Wait! You're a Jedi!
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
Ani?
Little Ani?
Nahhh.
You are Ani! It is you!
You sure sprouted, huh?
AJedi! Whattaya know!
Maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.
My mother.
Oh, yeah. Shmi.
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.
- You sold her?
- Years ago.
Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business.
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.
At least I think it was Lars.
Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her!
Can ya beat that, eh?
Do you know where they are now?
Long way from here.
Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.
I'd like to know.
Sure. Absolutely!
Let's go look at my records, huh?
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!
He must have put a homing device on our hull.
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field... and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.
Seismic charges!
Stand by.
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.
Watch out!
Get him, Dad! Fire!
Blast! This is why I hate flying!
We got him!
We'll just have to finish him.
R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters.
Fire them now!
We won't be seeing him again.
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.
There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4.
Stay with the ship, R2.
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C--
3PO?
The maker!
Master Ani!
I knew you would return.
I knew it!
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.
Hello, 3PO.
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.
I've come to see my mother.
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.
Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors.
I'm Anakin Skywalker.
Owen Lars.
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.
I'm Padmé.
I guess I'm your stepbrother.
I had a feeling you might show up someday.
Is my mother here?
No, she's not.
Cliegg Lars.
Shmi is my wife.
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did... to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.
From the tracks, she was about halfway home... when they took her.
Those Tuskens walk like men... but they're vicious, mindless monsters.
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.
I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg...
I just couldn't ride any more until I heal.
I don't want to give up on her... but she's been gone a month.
There's little hope she's lasted this long.
Where are you going?
To find my mother.
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.
You're gonna have to stay here.
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.
I won't be long.
We must persuade the Commerce Guild... and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.
What about the senator from Naboo?
Is she dead yet?
I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.
With these new battle droids we've built for you... you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.
As I explained to you earlier...
I am quite convinced that 1 0,000 more systems... will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.
What you are proposing could be construed as treason.
The Techno Union army... is at your disposal, Count.
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.
Good. Very good.
Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support... and when their battle droids are combined with yours... we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy.
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.
The Republic will agree to any demands we make.
Mom?
Ani?
Ani?
Is it you?
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.
You look so handsome.
My son.
My grown-up son.
I'm so proud of you, Ani.
I missed you.
Now I am complete.
I love y--
Stay with me, Mom. Everything--
I love--
I love--
Anakin!
No!
What is it?
Pain, suffering... death I feel.
Something terrible has happened.
Young Skywalker is in pain... terrible pain.
The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal.
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?
We'll have to try something else.
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.
It's much closer.
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?
He's not on Naboo, R4.
I'm going to try and widen the range.
I do hope nothing's happened to him.
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right... but it's coming from Tatooine.
What in the blazes is he doing there?
I told him to stay on Naboo.
We haven't got much time.
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Retransmit this message--
Anakin, do you copy?
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
I brought you something.
Are you hungry?
The shifter broke.
Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things.
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.
But I couldn't--
Why'd she have to die?
Why couldn't I save her?
I know I could have!
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!
Someday I will be.
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.
I promise you.
I will even learn to stop people from dying.
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
What's wrong, Ani?
I killed them.
I killed them all.
They're dead.
Every single one of them.
And not just the men... but the women... and the children too.
They're like animals... and I slaughtered them like animals!
I hate them!
To be angry is to be human.
I'm a Jedi.
I know I'm better than this.
I know wherever you are it's become a better place.
You were the most loving partner a man could ever have.
Goodbye, my darling wife.
And thank you.
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.
I wasn't strong enough.
But I promise I won't fail again.
I miss you... so much.
R2? What are you doing here?
It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming--
Wait.
More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.
I agree.
We will deal with Count Dooku.
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.
Protect the senator at all costs.
That is your first priority.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there in time to save him.
They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look.
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Are you just gonna sit here and let him die?
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.
He gave you strict orders to protect me... and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
The debate is over.
Now we need that clone army.
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.
The senate will never approve the use of clones... before the separatists attack.
This is a crisis.
The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers.
He can then approve the creation of an army.
But what senator would have the courage... to propose such a radical amendment?
If only Senator Amidala were here.
Traitor.
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.
They have gone too far.
This is madness.
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.
I will petition immediately to have you set free.
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.
May I ask why a Jedi knight... is all the way out here on Geonosis?
I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.
Do you know him?
There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of.
The Geonosians don't trust them.
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.
It's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.
I wish he were still alive.
I could use his help right now.
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.
You forget that he was once my apprentice... just as you were once his.
He knew all about the corruption in the senate... but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have.
- The truth?
- The truth.
What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control... of the dark lord of the Sith?
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.
The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend.
Hundreds of senators are now under the influence... of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.
I don't believe you.
The viceroy of the Trade Federation... was once in league with this Darth Sidious... but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord.
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.
You must join me, Obi-Wan... and together we will destroy the Sith!
I will never join you, Dooku.
It may be difficult to secure your release.
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact... wesa desa Federation du Trade.
Senators, "dellow felagates'':
In response to this direct threat to the Republic... mesa propose that the senate... give immediately emergency powers... to the supreme chancellor.
Palpatine! Palpatine!
Order! We shall have order!
It is with great reluctance... that I have agreed to this calling.
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.
The power you give me...
I will lay down when this crisis has abated.
And as my first act with this new authority...
I will create a grand army of the Republic... to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.
It is done, then.
I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino... and see this army they have created for the Republic.
See those columns of steam straight ahead?
They're exhaust vents of some type.
That'll do.
Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead.
I'm not interested in getting into a war here.
As a member of the senate... maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.
Don't worry.
I've given up trying to argue with you.
My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help... they would have asked for it.
You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behaviour.
For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.
I am programmed to understand humans!
"What does that mean?''
That means I am in charge here!
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?
Idiot!
Please wait.
Do you know where you're going?
Wait.
Oh, my goodness!
Shut me down!
Machines making machines.
How perverse!
Calm down, R2!
I almost fell.
You'll get your chance--
I'm scrap.
It's a nightmare!
I want to go home!
What did I do to deserve this?
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.
He's always getting himself into trouble.
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
I'm so confused.
Not again!
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.
Don't move,Jedi!
Take him away.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid to die.
I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?
I thought we had decided not to fall in love... that we would be forced to live a lie... and that it would destroy our lives.
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.
I truly... deeply love you... and before we die,
I want you to know.
I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.
I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master.
Then we decided to come and rescue you.
Good job.
Settle down. Settle down.
Let the executions begin.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
-Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?
She seems to be on top of things.
She can't do that!
Shoot her... or something!
Jump!
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.
Master Windu.
How pleasant of you to join us.
This party's over.
Brave... but foolish, my old Jedi friend.
You're impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.
What's all this noise?
A battle!
There's been some terrible mistake!
I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!
Die,Jedi dogs!
Oh! What did I say?
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.
R2, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.
My neck!
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!
I'm quite beside myself.
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!
Yes, but is my head on straight?
Master Windu... you have fought gallantly... worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi order.
Now... it is finished.
Surrender... and your lives will be spared.
We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!
Then...
I'm sorry, old friend.
Look!
Around the survivors a perimeter create.
I've had the most peculiar dream!
If Dooku escapes... rally more systems to his cause he will.
Hold on!
Aim right above the fuel cells!
Good call, my young Padawan.
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
That doesn't seem possible.
How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly?
We must send all available droids into battle.
There are too many.
Our communications have been jammed.
Pilot, land in that assembly area!
Yes, sir.
Sir...
I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir.
To the forward command centre take me.
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!
Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing.
Very good.
Very good.
This is not looking good at all!
We must get the starships back into space.
We have to order a retreat.
My master will never allow the Republic... to get away with this treachery.
I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.
The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon.
If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.
They will be much safer there with my master.
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.
Yes, sir.
Move all quadrants to sector 51 5.
Look over there!
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!
We're out of rockets, sir.
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!
Put the ship down!
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way!
Follow that speeder!
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!
I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now!
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!
You will be expelled from the Jedi order!
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!
What do you think Padmé would do were she in your position?
She would do her duty.
The droid army is in full retreat.
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.
We'll take him together.
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!
As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.
Now... back down.
I don't think so.
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
Surely you can do better.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
We'd better get back to the forward command centre.
No.
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.
Get a transport. Hurry!
Right away.
Brave of you, boy.
But I would have thought you had learned your lesson.
I am a slow learner.
Master Yoda.
Count Dooku.
You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.
Powerful you have become, Dooku.
The dark side I sense in you.
I've become more powerful than any Jedi.
Even you.
Much to learn you still have.
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided... by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsabre.
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
This is just the beginning.
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.
You have done well.
I have good news for you, my lord.
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.
Everything is going as planned.
Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate?
It doesn't feel right.
Joined the dark side Dooku has.
Lies, deceit... creating mistrust are his ways now.
Nevertheless..
I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.
I agree.
Where is your apprentice?
On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home.
I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
Victory?
Victory, you say?
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.
Begun the Clone War has.
Hello, I'm Mr. Conductor, and I'm going to tell you a story about trains, folks far apart and the magic railroad that brought them together,
Every story, like a railroad, has its heroes.
Meet Thomas, he's our number one hero.
Hello!
But he's running a little late today.
This is the island of Sodor where Thomas and his friends live.
It's at one end of my special universe.
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hello, James.
-I like helping out here.
By the invitation of
Sir Topham Hatt, of course.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
Practicing your numbers, Gordon.
That's a good engine.
I'm counting how many seconds late you are.
What does that sign say?
Hmm...
"Sodor Railway.
"Really reliable and right on time."
Signed, "Head of the railway,
Sir Topham Hatt."
But you weren't on time, little Thomas.
And you're being bossy, Gordon.
Please excuse me.
I'm meeting Mr. Conductor.
He's looking after us while Sir Topham Hatt takes a much needed holiday.
I think we can take care of ourselves.
Get out of my way!
I have unfinished business here and I wanna finish it fast!
Diesel 10's back!
Yes, ten out of ten for devious deeds and brutal strength.
The blast from the past who hates steam engines.
Maybe we do need
Mr. Conductor here after all.
On time!
At the other end of my universe, far away across oceans of time, up and over Muffle Mountain and hidden deep in a valley, is my hometown,
Shining Time.
# Every now and then
# There appears a sign
# That points just round the bend
# To a place you'll find
# Covered in clover
# The magic comes over you
# Showing up right on time
# This is your Shining Time
# Climbing through stars to
# Your own cloud nine
# Soft strokes of lightning
# Paint the skies brightening
# Up all your Shining Time
And by the way, I think you're going to help me and Thomas somewhere in this story.
If Diesel has unfinished business, there's sure to be trouble right around the corner.
Sandal, fly! Boo, fly!
Shoo, fly! That's it!
Better still, buzz off.
Botheration!
You weren't concentrating, Thomas.
Lucky for you that the buffers were there.
That's what buffers are for, to stop engines from crashing.
Why are you in the sheds, James?
I'm feeling a little blue.
Which isn't so hot when you're red.
I was naughty and Sir Topham Hatt told me to think about all the ways
I can be Really Useful.
Then I can come out again.
He's just trying to make this a better railway for steam engines.
He says, the harder we work, the less he'll need diesels to help.
Help you?
You'll always need help!
Because steam engines are cowardly, cranky, wornout hunks of metal who couldn't hurt a fly.
- No, we're not!
- Yes, you are!
- Aren't!
- Are!
- Now, I've come back to find a lost steam engine.
I'm gonna destroy her and dominate you!
And then you'll be nothing but useless scrap!
Right, Pinchy?
Big bully! Stinker!
We're Really Useful engines!
You won't dominate us and you won't destroy her!
We won't let you.
Neither will Mr. Conductor.
I'm off to fetch him now.
What lost engine?
There, Mutt, the paint job's finished.
I reckon Shining Time has the best welcome sign of any town in our valley.
I'm glad you agree.
Billy's old map sure helped a lot.
He's on his way back now, is he?
You hear that train whistle sooner than it hears itself.
Fine work, Patch.
Thanks.
Oh, I've been looking at your map.
What are these mysterious shadowy lines?
They look like straight railroad tracks, but I can't see any tracks around here, except the ones you travel on.
It's mysteries that make this land so...
Magical?
I better be off to Muffle Mountain.
I promised Mr. Stone that I'd clean his yard.
Does Burnett Stone ever give you a smile?
No, but he doesn't frighten my horse, either.
Which means,
I don't think he's a bad man.
I think he's just sad.
I didn't know that in
Muffle Mountain there was a secret that Burnett had shared only with his childhood friend, Tasha.
One day, Tasha, I'm going to drive this engine.
And I'll take you with me.
Promise you will,
Burnett. Promise!
I promise.
This engine was vital to the magic that held these worlds together, but only Burnett knew that.
Hello. Shining Time Station.
Manager Stacy Jones speaking.
Oh, yes, the 10:15 from
Pelican Falls to Shining Time is right on schedule.
-You're welcome.
The 10:00 to Lucy's Leap is leaving now.
Oh, Billy, I found this child's drawing in an old locker in the lost and found.
Look at the signature, Billy.
Burnett Stone!
It's hard to believe Burnett could have ever looked that happy.
Burnett had a wonderful smile.
And he loved railroading, too.
How did you find me here?
I found the entrance to your workshop ages ago.
But I would never tell anybody.
See that switch on the wall?
Flip it on.
I guessed there was something mysterious about this mountain.
Yeah. All mountains have their secrets, Patch.
Shouldn't surprise a kid like you.
Could I help you,
Mr. Stone?
Sure. You can help me dust her off.
This engine's name is Lady.
Why is she locked up?
She isn't.
She's safe from harm.
Long ago, I made a mistake as Lady's caretaker.
An evil diesel found Lady and threatened to destroy her.
He chased her and used up all her coal.
He made her go too fast and then he crashed her.
Then I brought her here.
I tried my best to fix her up but I've never been able to make up for the mistake I made.
And I've never been able to bring her to life.
To make her steam.
Patch, she's as precious as gold.
Pinchy, you captured the real me.
That's beautiful. I could cry.
- Boss?
- We're here.
Listen, you two.
I've got a job for you,
Splodge.
- Actually, it's Splatter.
- And Dodge.
I ain't got time to say both names!
Oh, well.
I've come back to find a steam engine.
That's easy.
Yeah, they're everywhere.
Not the one I want.
She escaped me once before.
As long as she exists, so do the others.
But if she can be destroyed...
Destroyed.
Did you say the destroyed?
Yeah, destroyed!
There's one problem.
Mr. Conductor's coming, and he won't let you destroy.
I can do whatever I want!
I'll get him, too!
With Pinchy!
Ow! Pinchy,
I hate it when you do that!
- Hello, Mr. Conductor.
- Hello, Billy.
Tool kit? Check.
Ticket puncher?
Check-check.
All aboard!
Just testing, Billy.
Mustn't let my conducting skills get rusty.
Important day, Mr. C?
It is a very important day!
I'm going to the island of Sodor.
It's the only place in my universe where I fit in size-wise.
Sir Topham Hatt has given me a big responsibility.
Diesel 10 is back and I have to make sure he behaves himself.
Excuse me, Billy.
I hope your visit goes well, Mr. C.
Thank you.
I must be responsible, reliable and...
Don't tell me.
Really Useful. I knew that.
Well, Thank you, Moby Dick.
I like my sparkle, too.
You know, gold really is your color.
Stacy, where did you find this painting?
In an old locker. It was done by Burnett Stone when he was a child.
I was told that he used to work on this railroad.
But he never leaves the other side of the mountain now.
You seem puzzled,
Mr. Conductor.
Well, I am puzzled.
This place looks like the island of Sodor but how would
Burnett Stone travel there without gold dust?
Sparkle's been the only way to make the trip since the lost engine disappeared.
Anyway, I just came to say goodbye.
I have to go now.
Right now?
Yes. I have to make sure everything's safe and sound on the island of Sodor just as I try to do here.
Like Stacy, Mutt sensed danger, he didn't want either
Billy or me to leave
Shining Time.
Old Smoky, you stay right here until I get back.
Ah, there you are.
Is something wrong here?
Ah!
I'm going to be late.
I'll get back as fast as I can.
I have to concentrate now, Mutt.
I'm suddenly having problems with my sparkle.
Mutt?
-Goodbye, Mutt.
-Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.
Mr. Conductor, where are you?
I know you live far away, but you always seem to get here on time.
Oh, Mr. Conductor!
Are you all right?
Yes, Thomas. But sometimes everything happens at once.
I have to see Sir Topham Hatt to get my orders right away.
The journey from Shining Time keeps getting bumpier and bumpier.
- A big bully Diesel is back.
- You had better be careful.
Sir Topham Hatt warned me about Diesel.
Don't worry, Thomas.
I'll just pop in and out with my sparkle wherever he goes and keep him in order.
I hope.
# Old MacDiesel had a plan
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
# A pinch-pinch here, and a pinch-pinch there
Here a pinch, there a pinch #
I crack myself up.
Tasha, the Conductor family has a little steam engine, with her own railroad, and has wonderful energy because of it.
But a diesel wants to destroy her.
And without her, the Conductor's universe will vanish.
The man with the sparkle told me that one day, one of his family will return, but until then,
"To guard her well, young Burnett."
But I didn't guard you well.
I just don't seem to understand about...
About magic anymore.
This is where
Burnett's granddaughter,
Lily, comes into our story.
She lives with her mom and dad in the big city, a few hours train ride from Shining Time.
She sees magic no one else has time to, like lovely reflections of light on a rainy day.
Soon, she was off to stay with her grandpa on Muffle Mountain,
Grandpa's been so sad since Grandma Tasha died and he never comes here to see us.
Well, maybe your visit will cheer him up. Hmm?
Did you get his present?
Here. I'm making him a friendship bracelet.
Honey, that's beautiful.
But I'd rather just stay here with you.
I know. Come here.
- I'm gonna go up this way.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
- You always say that.
See you in a minute.
You're coming with me to Grandpa's, Bluebird.
I know how much you like to travel.
Faraway on Sodor, the steam engines were confident, cheerful, and determined not to be bullied by Diesel.
Only James, who now felt
Really Useful too, was complaining.
- Wobbly wheels.
- Puffy pistons.
Thomas,
I should have collected Mr. Conductor!
James is right, little Thomas.
Collecting Mr. Conductor is an important job.
Important is big.
James is a big engine.
You, Thomas, are small!
Small, small, small.
Teeny, weenie, weenie.
And I am a big, blue engine who knows everything.
Bossy sprockets!
All that steam has gone to your funnel!
- There they are.
- We'll fix their wagons.
I'm no good at backing up.
Me neither.
What's important is to stand up on our own wheels to Diesel.
Diesel knows that the lost engine in the legend really exists.
- What engine?
- What legend?
An engine whose magic makes her more powerful than Diesel will ever be.
That's why he wants to find her.
Then we'd better find her first.
Leave it to the big engines,
Percy.
Little engines can do big things.
Especially when they have nice blue paint like me.
Hey, just watch what happens to that blue puffball...
When Harold the flopper chopper flies past here.
Right!
Routine fly-by, chaps. Hello.
The boss dumped sneezing powder everywhere.
Let's start laughing now.
Oh, sorry, fellas.
A bit of a dust up.
Love to stay and clean up.
Got to go. Bye.
Did you mean to look like that?
- No.
- Neither did I.
This must be
Diesel's doing!
Toot!
"Where were you?
"My wife said she couldn't miss our little holiday.
"We'll telephone to make sure you have arrived."
Signed, "Sir Topham Hatt."
Sir Topham Hatt.
Where were you?
Good afternoon, sir.
A real honor, sir.
Like my family before me.
And how is Lady Hatt?
Yes. Watch out for Diesel.
Definitely.
Keep an eye on Henry's health.
Certainly.
Yes, sir, the three R's, reading, writing and arithmetic.
I mean...
I will be responsible, reliable and Really Useful.
Yes, sir.
We will all get a good night's sleep.
Looking forward to a hard day tomorrow.
Goodbye, sir.
So, who dropped the ball then?
Oh, there you are.
I'd like a nice cup of hot cocoa.
Would you fellas care to join me?
No.
Go outside and play?
Well, I can understand that.
What do you think?
Why do you keep hitting him like that?
You need a time out.
Just a little sweeter, I think.
All right, Pinchy, my little bucket of badness, time to feast yourself.
Ah! Now that's better.
Cinders and ashes!
It's Diesel!
Oh, no!
Hello, Twinkle Toes!
I've got a plan and you're not in it!
-You can't catch me, Diesel!
- Losing your sparkle, huh?
- What perfect timing.
You won't find her here.
You're not clever enough to stop me.
Oh, yes, I am!
No, you're not. Is that...
That's right.
It's sugar, Diesel.
And if I throw this in your tank, it'll seize you up for good.
Make the most of tonight,
Twinkle Toes, because you won't like tomorrow!
Neither will that line of tin kettles!
Shut up, Pinchy.
Mr. Conductor, but what happened to your sparkle?
I don't know, Thomas.
I'll just have to sleep on that.
On your sparkle?
No, Thomas.
On the problem of what happened to it.
But, Mr. Conductor, without your sparkle or the lost engine, you can't travel here to help us anymore.
I'll solve the problem.
You just go to sleep now.
Easy for you to say.
Sparkle, gold dust, magic, railroad, buffers, lost engine.
The family told me, as long as there is a railroad, there will be harmony.
As long as there is gold dust, there will be energy.
You will never have to worry.
Yeah, sure.
Mr. C?
Mr. C!
Why aren't you here?
Why couldn't you travel anymore to the island of Sodor or back home here to us in Shining Time?
The magic is all gone.
What's going wrong with our railroad and why?
My universe is in danger.
I've got to find more gold dust!
Next morning,
Mutt traveled with Billy to the big city station.
Mutt was sure Lily could help her grandpa, and that together they could help me, but only if Lily met someone special at Shining Time first.
The train for Muffle Mountain will depart from Track 3, last stop, Muffle Mountain.
The train for Shining Time will depart from Track 4.
I don't suppose you know where Track 3 is, do you?
You do?
Well, why not?
-I hope you're right.
Mutt was feeling pleased with himself.
He had put Lily on the wrong train but he knew he had done so for the right reasons.
# I know how the moon must feel
# Looking down from the heavens
# Smiling at the silly things
# We put ourselves through
# Missing magic each day
# And not seeing the wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
# I know how the moon must feel
# When he makes someone happy
# That's the feeling I will feel
# When you smile at me
# I'll be floating on air
# I'll be beaming with wonder
# That's how the moon
# Must feel
Left a bit... Ah!
Right a bit.
Up a bit!
There, James.
Tickle all gone now?
No. Still itchy.
Hey, Mr. C, why do you look so tired?
Is it because I'm red?
Diesel says red is a very tiring color.
But, Mr. C, red looks so nice against the snow.
It's not me, is it?
No, of course not, James.
Red is bright and cheerful.
- Oh, good.
- Just like my sparkle.
Or at least it was, and must be again!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to the windmill to search for something important.
Now off to work, please.
Okay.
Keep your steam up.
What happened?
Where's the windmill?
That's where I'm supposed to be.
Now I've completely lost my sense of direction.
Oh...
Now my gold dust really is all gone.
If I can't find the source for making more, the consequences will be bad.
I saw them in my dream last night.
My family never told me what to do in a gold dust crisis.
They only said,
"If you can't remember the clue,
"the windmill will remind you."
But where is the windmill?
And what is the clue?
- Smile, you steamers.
- It's a sunny day.
It's not sunny,
'cause Mr. C's not at the windmill. I looked.
I think his sparkle's all gone.
My smoke box doesn't feel sunny.
It feels stuffed up.
Nasty fumes from dingy Diesel.
And Diesel is after the lost engine.
And if he finds her,
I fear that will destroy us all.
What, even an engine as big as me?
Yes, Gordon, even you.
Say it, don't spray it, Thomas.
I've still got sneezing powder up my funnel.
Now I'm going to look for Mr. Conductor.
Let us get back to work.
That's what he would want.
How about a race, Thomas?
Sorry, Bertie. I can't today.
I have to be a Really Useful engine and solve some mysteries instead.
I guess that means I win.
Perhaps another day.
What's that?
What's this?
"I notice you left your thinking cap behind.
"Try these instead.
They're good for the brain.
"Gone fishing. Rabbit."
Well, well, well!
How very thoughtful.
Plane, drain.
Mountain, fountain.
That might be something.
I think I'll try the celery.
Sausage, bicycle.
Toothpaste, beach.
Wait a minute.
Beach.
Beach! That's it! That's it!
I have to find a bellflower.
I need to make a call.
# It's a summer Sunday and I'm under

That's my shell phone!
Junior is that you?
Oh, hi, Cous.
Are you in a tunnel?
This isn't a very good line.
Where are you?
Hmm... I'm in paradise.
I got on cloud nine, and here I am.
Listen to me,
You've got to come to the island of Sodor right now.
Now? But I'm waiting on the perfect wave!
Oh, no, you're not!
You're coming here.
You have to help me find the source of our family's gold dust.
What is the source?
That's the trouble.
I haven't a clue.
And I've used up most of my gold dust, too.
What?
Then go to
Shining Time Station first, and in my signal house, in the box under the staircase, you'll find my emergency whistle with the last of my supply.
Please take care of this and...
Don't talk to anyone about the buffers!
What buffers?
Shh!
This is a really bad line.
Hello!
My shell phone's not working properly.
You've got to come here right away!
I'm counting on you!
Hello?
I want my money back.
Shining Time?
What does that mean?
- Do you want me to get off here?
Where is everyone?
What have you brought me here for?
That's gonna leave a mark! Oh!
Maybe it's in here.
Oh, cake!
Ugh, that's not cake!
-How cute. Six little...
Five little glass figurines.
Ooh! Hello?
This is too much.
I've got to get back to the island.
I've got to get to cousin.
Hiya. Who are you?
I'm Lily. Who are you?
C. Junior.
Did I drop some sunglasses when I came in here?
I don't know.
Oh, well, I might as well use some more of this stuff.
See you, Lily.
What is this stuff?
The magic is gone.
Why did I take my gold dust for granted?
I can't help without my gold dust.
What is the source of my gold dust?
Is someone there?
Thomas, is that you?
Mr. Conductor?
-Mr. Conductor!
Oh, Mr. Conductor, where are you?
Thomas?
How could I possibly say that
I'm Really Useful now?
Excuse me. Are you Lily?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Stacy Jones.
I'm manager here.
Your grandpa's very upset.
You must've gotten on the wrong train.
I'll take you to Muffle Mountain.
Thank you.
Stacy, did you know my grandma?
My mother did.
She said Tasha was a wonderful dancer.
I think Grandpa liked to call Grandma "Lady."
Lady?
Yes.
I heard him say that name when they were talking.
I wish...
Oh, never mind.
Turn right here, you can't miss it
Stacy, I'm a little nervous.
Well, maybe your grandpa is, too.
It's been a while since you've seen each other.
Thanks a lot.
Hello, Burnett.
Stacy.
Hello, Lily.
Hi, Grandpa.
Have a good evening.
Thanks, Stacy. Good night.
You said, "I wish..."
I wish?
Oh, yes.
I wish you'd come back and see us tomorrow at Shining Time.
If your grandpa lets you.
Here, Grandpa.
This is a friendship bracelet.
Grandma taught me how to make one when I was little.
This one's for you.
Thank you, Lily.
As the sound of Lady's magic echoed through the night on Muffle Mountain, the engines on Sodor had her very much in their thoughts,
Thomas, I was thinking.
How does Mr. Conductor travel here?
By gold dust.
But if there' s a lost engine, maybe there's a lost railway, too.
Mr. Conductor's railway!
The journey gets bumpier and bumpier.
That's what
Mr. Conductor told me.
Oh!
He talked about buffers in his sleep!
Buffers are at the end of a railway.
I think that's how he travels here, on a secret railway.
Belonging to the lost engine!
Percy, you are clever.
Oh! My wheels are suddenly feeling very wobbly.
I think Diesel's around here!
I'm sorry, you two.
Diesel heard every word you said.
I'm going after him to see what he does next.
You'd better get the mail delivered.
You're very brave, Toby.
Diesel won't bother with an old engine like me.
He thinks I'm really useless.
# I've been working on the railway
# All the livelong day #
Who wants to work a livelong day anyway?
There he is.
Come in! Come in and join the party, Splodge!
Hooray!
We're gonna have a party.
I love parties.
Who's got the balloons?
What?
Correction.
Join the party that's over.
Just like Twinkle Toe's magic railway is gonna be over.
Hmm.
Gone, like the lost engine and the buffers that lead to her.
What are you gonna do?
That's a good question.
It's time to put Twinkle Toes' lights out.
Ooh.
This is a job for the boss!
I've got to delay him.
I've got to distract him. Hmm.
- It's the old teapot!
- Smash him!
- Pinchy, get back here!
- I hate it when you do this!
Good show!
Uh, Boss, did you mean to let the roof fall in?
All the way in?
I always mean what I do, you rattle traps!
Diesel was in a dump, but the steam engines were still right on track.
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# All the other engines
They'll tell you so
# He huffs and puffs and whistles
# Rushing to and fro
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's a Really Useful engine
You know
# 'Cause the Fat Controller
He told him so
# Now he's got a workshop to call his very own
# He's the Really Useful engine we adore
# He's the one
# He's the number one
# Thomas the tank engine
# He's the Really Useful engine
# We adore
Morning, Henry.
What's the matter?
I've got boiler ache.
And I'm collecting one, two, three, four, five, six trucks of special island of
Sodor coal for you.
Oh, Thank you, Thomas.
Special coal will make me feel much better.
But I wish I could make Mr. Conductor feel better too, by finding him.
Hello, Thomas and your five coal trucks.
Five?
But I'm supposed to have six.
Hello, Percy.
Oh, Thomas,
I've been worried about you.
Bertie says you lost a coal truck today.
Yes. It disappeared when I was at the buffers near the little grotto.
Maybe those are the buffers that lead to the secret railway.
And the grotto is the lost engine's special platform!
Yes!
Percy, you protect those buffers from Diesel...
...and I'll find
Mr. Conductor.
- Because you're a brave engine, Percy.
Oh, I forgot.
- Hello, Twinkle Toes!
- Remember me?
Fat Hatt won't have much use for you looking like that.
Oh, I see you forgot to bring the sugar.
How careless of you.
Say hello to Pinchy!
Okay, Twinkle Toes,
I know about the buffers.
- That's what I saw in my dream!
- It's coming true!
My universe is starting to crumble!
And I know about the magic railway.
And when I find that engine, you and all those puffballs will be history!
Now tell me where the buffers are! Now!
-You got 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Too late, Diesel!
Did you put all this here for me?
You must've known that I was coming.
How kind of you.
Oh! I'm at the windmill.
That's what I call a perfect landing.
This must be the clue to unlock the source of the gold dust.
Where has the writing gone?
So, Boss...
How come you let
Twinkle Toes escape?
Oh, that!
Well, uh,
I did it on purpose.
I was testing him to see if he could escape.
- Liar, liar.
- Pants on fire.
All right!
Playtime's over, Splodge.
Uh-oh.
Now it's time for the next lesson, huh?
I call it
"How to stop being stupid."
That's gonna ruin my facial.
Oh.
Bet you can't climb that tree.
See?
-On my fire escape.
Hi. I'm Patch.
I'm Lily.
Do you live around here?
Yes.
My mom and dad run the stables.
- Morning, Patch.
- Good morning, Mr. Stone.
I'm riding into Shining Town.
Could Lily come with me?
- If she'd like to.
- I'd like to.
Sure, she can go.
Be back by sunset, Lily.
Do you wanna come, too?
I never go there now.
Bye, Grandpa.
So, have you ever ridden a horse before?
No.
I've always wanted to go this way.
We're following some shadowy lines
I've seen on a map.
They're like railroad tracks without any rails.
Well, Lady, what are we to do?
It all seemed so much easier when Tasha and I were children.
Junior?
Presto!
I'd given up on seeing you again.
What's blue, green and red and goes beep.
A parrot and you mean chirp-chirp.
No, trains. Talking trains.
And I'm off to see them right now in the island of
Sodor, and cousin.
But I overslept and I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Do you want to come?
Can we be back here by sunset?
I hope so.
I wanna get back to the beach.
- Okay.
- Good.
It's this way.
We'll take the shortcut.
-Hmm...
There's two of us.
Oh, well. That means
I'll have to use Cous' extra supply of gold dust.
It doesn't matter.
We'll have plenty more soon.
Can I take this little bit back for Grandpa?
Be my guest.
I'll take care of it for you.
Ready? Here goes.
You've grown bigger.
May be you're smaller.
I'm adjusting to my new surroundings.
This is the only place this ever happens to me.
Whoa!
A bit bouncy, isn't it?
-Conductor's railroad.
-Whatever.
We're traveling miles and miles to the island.
But I don't know if this railroad's gonna last much longer.
-It'll vanish like the engine.
The engine that used to travel on this railroad.
Cous and I never saw it.
We don't know what happened to it.
Hey, what's that doing there?
You ready, Lily?
Here are the buffers.
Now!
Where are we?
The island of Sodor, of course.
This way.
-Oh, bogus!
I think I'm allergic to grass.
It's a good thing
I like climbing things.
Grass.
What's that noise?
The trains. They talk.
We're just too far away to hear what they're saying.
Good morning.
Annie! Clarabel!
There's Mr. Conductor!
We found him!
Oh, bunko! It's Junior.
- Junior, look!
- It's Thomas!
Thomas, now, don't look so surprised. I know you haven't seen me since...
You stuffed party poppers down my funnel!
- We had a laugh.
- You did.
- You're talking to each other.
- Ah! First prize.
Lily, Thomas. Thomas, Lily.
Now, where's my cousin?
-Hi.
-Hello, Lily.
Welcome to Sodor.
Come on, Lily.
I'm very at home on trains.
Annie, Clarabel,
I'll send Percy back to fetch you.
We've heard that one before.
-Travel sickness.
What's that shining at the windmill?
Presto, Lily.
I think it's my cousin!
Mr. Conductor!
Mr. Conductor!
Thomas!
Thank throttles you're safe!
Come on, Lily.
Hey, Cous, what's up?
-No, Junior, I am not.
As a matter of fact,
I just landed here after escaping a heavy metal monster.
Junior, where have you been?
Is your sparkle back,
Mr. Conductor?
No, Thomas, it isn't.
But I do know the clue.
Stoke up the magic in the mountain...
Darn!
Dither!
Hey, Cous, you're looking terrible.
Why don't we get more gold dust
'cause I used yours up.
Then you can go back home and I can go to the beach.
Junior, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Uh-oh.
- I'll get that.
- I've got it.
Hello?
No, this is his cousin.
Give the phone.
Who's this?
Oh, hello, Hattie.
No, no. He's hanging around here somewhere.
Yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
No, he just wanted to be friendly.
No, he is not a dog.
Let's just say he's a puppy in need of a good trainer.
No, nothing to worry about, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Cous, this is Lily.
She's staying with Grandpa Stone.
Hello, Lily.
Hello.
- Junior?
- Whoa!
- What are you doing up there?
- Come down.
It's too windy!
This is just like the fun fair!
Give us two seconds.
Whoo-hoo!
Two seconds is all it takes for you to land in trouble!
- Ah-ha! Twinkle Toes Junior!
- Oh, no, my beach bag!
You won't be doing any surfing up here, Mr. Kahuna.
Really? Watch me.
Hang on tight, Moon Doggie!
Yee-haw!
Diesel's hijacked him!
What's gonna happen to Junior now?
My family's pretty good at getting themselves out of trouble. Eventually.
I don't know what eventually means but it sounds very, very long.
-I wish I knew.
I'm sorry.
She wasn't at the station when I went back for her.
It's okay, Patch.
We'll find her. Don't worry.
I am brave.
I am brave.
Thomas says I'm brave, so I'm brave.
Oh! It's not easy being brave.
Shiver my pistons!
There's Splatter and Dodge!
Oh! They found the buffers.
Oh, now what's going to happen?
- Howdy partner.
- Excuse me.
Oh, that's just nothing.
Ah!
That nothing was something.
These must be the buffers
Diesel's looking for.
Are we supposed to go through them?
Not we, you.
Not me, you.
This is a job for the boss.
We'll tell him tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow's good.
Oh,
I'd better hurry back and warn Thomas.
I was doing my best to keep Lily cheerful.
I knew she was worried about being late for her grandpa,
Mr. Conductor,
I was supposed to be back by sunset.
You know, Lily, perhaps your grandpa can guess where you are.
-Maybe.
Because I think he's been here himself, long ago.
And if he can help,
I do wish he'd hurry.
I haven't told Junior this, but soon he'll grow as weak as I am.
Junior said there used to be an engine that traveled on the magic railroad.
And if only we could find that we could still head back to
Shining Time.
Oh, that engine disappeared.
Never to be seen or heard from again.
I have to tell you something, Mr. C.
I've heard a train whistle and it sounded like it came from the mountain.
Mountain. I just remembered another part of the clue.
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain and the lady will smile."
But we need more information, Lily.
And I know that your grandpa could help if he would just believe that he could.
Lady?
She can whistle.
I've heard her.
Yeah, so have I.
It's because she's magic.
This must be the map of her magic railroad.
But the railroad's energy is fading away.
I sensed it when we were out riding.
Lily and I were traveling on the ground above it.
The railroad needs Lady but I don't know her special secret.
And I need to know it now more than ever.
-Yes, because of Lily.
So, Thomas, we must get Lily back to her grandpa now incase Diesel gets rid of the railway.
But how can Lily go without gold dust?
Only in the lost engine.
-Unless...
Thomas, will you please take Lily?
Through the buffers?
But what if I go on the railway and my wheels don't work?
-But what if, if...
- It will be for a while.
- And cold.
- Maybe.
- And how will
I get back again?
Because you're a
Really Useful engine and will find a way.
Then I'll try.
I promise
I'll get you home to your grandpa, Lily.
Follow me, partner.
Right this way to Bufferville.
- Just a walk in the park.
We're going through, Lily.
You're on your own from here on in, little buckaroo!
Little engines can do big things.
It is dark and cold and bumpy but I'm not afraid.
Oh, there's the missing coal truck.
Coal truck?
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain."
That's part of
Mr. Conductor's clue to his gold dust.
And, Lily, that's what you do with coal, stoke it up to make steam.
We're going to be really reliable and help
Mr. Conductor.
We're going back for that coal truck.
Buffers. Coal truck.
We're starting to solve the mysteries, Lily.
You're a Really Useful engine,
Thomas.
- Lily, where are we?
- Muffle Mountain, Thomas.
I think I feel a little dizzy.
I can't go any further.
My wheels won't let me.
Then I'll be back, Thomas.
I promise.
But I must find Grandpa.
It's getting windy up here.
Bust my boiler!
I've left the coal truck behind!
Where's Grandpa?
Can you take me to him?
- Jump up.
- I knew I could count on you.
Stop, wheels. Stop!
Whoa!
Grandpa!
Oh, Lily.
I'm so glad to see you.
There's this island with talking trains and they said you might have been there.
But Mr. Conductor's very sick and Junior's in danger and I had to leave poor Thomas behind.
Please help me.
I'd like to, Lily.
Nothing seems to work.
This is the lost engine from long ago.
Now we can go back to the island and bring
Mr. Conductor and Junior home.
I can't make her steam.
I've tried all the different coals in the valley.
Lady.
-Yes.
Coal. Special coal from the island of Sodor.
That's what Lady needs.
Patch, there's a coal truck up at the top of the mountain.
- Do you think you could get some?
- Of course I will.
I'm sorry, Lily and Cous,
I haven't been responsible, reliable,
Really Useful...
But I will be!
But I will be!
James!
So you've lost your sparkle, too, huh?
Bye-bye, Twinkle Toes.
Oh! It's empty.
Here we go.
Junior, what are we gonna do?
We'll think of something.
That's it.
I'll find you some more, Lily.
I promise.
But if I'm going to be any help at all, it's now or never.
I've got to use up the rest of this stuff.
- Are you ready?
- No, we're not.
James the brains, get us out of here.
Now we are.
What the...
- Bye, James.
- Bye, Junior.
Sorry I've been so long, Cous.
But better late than never?
Junior, we are all out of gold dust, aren't we?
Bankrupt.
Hey!
It's a beautiful day!
I mean we're down, but we're not out.
No, we're out...
But we are not down.
Did Grandma love Lady as much as you do?
Did she take a ride on her?
Grandma loved her because I loved her.
But she never took a ride on Lady.
I couldn't fix her in time.
Lily, look.
The railroad's getting its energy back.
Well, my Lady, the lights are all green for you now.
Green for glory.
- Tasha would have loved this journey.
- Yes, she would.
And she'd love it that you're with me now.
So, Burnett, you didn't forget about magic.
It's safe inside you.
Thomas!
You've found her!
And she's beautiful!
We're on the island of Sodor.
Stop, Grandpa.
Stop, Lady.
Hello, Junior. Hello, Mr. C.
Mr. Conductor, this is my grandpa.
I'm glad you were able to find your way back.
Junior, do you realize who this is?
I reckon this is one beautiful engine.
Oh...
This is the lost engine.
Oh, are we glad to see you.
Now we can go back to Shining Time.
Junior.
We won't make it back to Shining Time without the gold dust.
Without it, the magic can't exist.
Ah-ha!
There's the blue puffball!
And look who he's with.
Splodge, come and destroy.
No.
You do it yourself.
We don't like you.
- We mean that.
- Emphatically.
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.
Run, Lady. Quickly!
And I'm going to help you.
So am I, my Lady.
I'll not let you down again.
Who needs you, Splodge?
Watch out for the viaduct.
It's dangerous!
What's the matter?
Lady.
That engine's name is Lady.
- She's part of the clue to the source of...
...The gold dust!
Now I'll get you, Burnett Stone.
No, you won't, because the magic you refuse to believe in will get the better of you.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Right, Pinchy?
- Pinchy's hungry.
- Get back!
Come on, Lady.
Coming, Puffball.
Look out!
Here I come! Duck, Pinchy!
I like my lunch steamed.
Pretty fast for a puffball.
Well, Lady, this is your shining time, too.
I hope so.
Come on, Lady.
Little engines can do big things.
Well done, Thomas!
Well done!
Hey! Ooh! What's going on?
Oh! Hold it!
Puffball!
Teapot!
Tin kettle!
Oh, well.
Nice time of the year for a cruise.
But, Mr. Conductor, you still don't have your gold dust.
I think he will soon.
Wait a minute.
"Then watch the swirls that spin so well."
Swirls. Like the shavings around Lady when we were on the railroad.
- Is there anything else?
- Of course there is.
"So well."
A well means water.
Lily, put the shavings in with the water.
Go ahead, Lily.
Throw it up in the air.
Please! Please!
Now, Lily.
- Gold dust!
- Gold dust!
Yey!
Gold dust!
Lady, you're a really helpful engine.
And helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.
Come on, Mutt.
Let's look around.
Lily...
I think I promised you something.
Here.
Take some.
So, Cous, how else can I help?
You mean, you don't want to go back to the beach?
No.
Well, maybe for a holiday.
But I'm ready to work.
You got a job for me?
You know, Junior, there is a railroad.
-One or two.
-Sunny spells.
I'll take it.
What's the way?
This is the way.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Sir Topham Hatt, sir.
You're on your way back right now.
Splendid news.
I'll be at the sheds to welcome you.
Oh, yes, sir.
Everything is under control.
Goodbye, sir.
Well, see you in Shining Time.
Here, Grandpa.
I'd like you to have this.
Well, how sweet of you, Lily.
Here. Give me the bluebird.
I think we should share it.
Now we'll always remember our Shining Time together.
Have a great time.
Ah!
And so we've come to the happy end of our story.
But it's time for all of us to go home, just like Thomas.
NARRATOR: For weeks, rumors have spread across Mars,
from outposts to settlements, from town to town.
Something that had been buried for centuries has just been uncovered.
And as this mysterious force moves across the southern valley,
it leaves behind only silence and death.
Take your seats, please.
I just talked with the Cartel.
They're concerned that the rumors are getting out of control.
They'd like to make a statement in two hours.
Some of you may not know we've had another incident.
At 1520 hours yesterday a freight train, Trans Marineris 74 Yankee,
returned from the southern valley on auto pilot.
GUARD 1: Get to your security stations now!
GUARD 2:
Okay, let's move!
INQUISITOR: Initial reports indicated it was a ghost train.
It appeared no one was aboard until a single
survivor was discovered in a rear compartment.
GUARD 3:
Call for Med-Tech backup.
INQUISITOR:
Lieutenant Melanie Ballard, second officer for a squad of escort police.
They were assigned to transfer a prisoner from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine back here to Chryse.
Lieutenant Ballard was taken to hospital under guard.
She had superficial wounds but was in otherwise good physical condition.
However, traces of an illegal substance,
tetromonochloride, were found in her system.
MAN: Everything will be all right.
Take it easy.
Bring her in, please.
Lieutenant Ballard, please be seated.
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police officers have rights these days?
Representation by counsel won't be necessary.
Your rights are protected by the Matronage.
You can speak freely.
Then I'm not being charged?
INQUISITOR: Sit down, lieutenant.
This is a discovery hearing, and your presence is required as ranking officer.
I want your After Action Report.
Where's the rest of your team? The prisoner you were sent to pick up?
What happened at Shining Canyon?
Last Friday at 1750, we were slamming through a dust storm
on the edge of the southern valley.
74 Yankee was an ore hauler servicing the mines in the outer sector.
My squad was hitching a ride into Shining Canyon.
JERICHO:
You beat me.
Looks like you've played Tarts before.
DESCANSO:
No, I never done this.
JERICHO: Let's spin them again.
One down and one up.
Fuck me, the Five of Bats.
You've got the Wheel.
What's your wager?
Five bucks.
[DOOR SLAMS]
Helena. Hey.
Sorry.
Weather station's tracking a huge storm across the southern sector and we're right under it by now.
What's the mark on it?
3200 klicks.
We should be there by 1800.
[RUMBLING]
So, urn, just let me know if you need anything.
HELENA:
Melanie!
You high?
Fuck, Helena, it's just Clear.
Be straighter than this track long before we hit the canyon.
You better be. This prisoner transfer is no sleepwalk.
We're picking up
James Williams.
You mean
“Desolation" Williams?
Cooling his heels in the Shining
Canyon jail. Deep solitary.
What's the charge this time?
Murder.
Man's been up on murder three times.
He gets off every time on self-defense.
It's different this time. Sounds like he finally went psycho.
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.
Williams shows up at the Shining Canyon
Mine with some bizarre-ass story.
Sends three officers to the medevac before they locked him down.
You starting to see the picture?
All we got is you, me and this new guy Jericho and a couple of rookies.
HELENA: What do you think of Sergeant Jericho?
I mean, I was hoping we'd get a good, solid woman we could count on.
MELANIE: I don't know.
I guess we'll see.
Well...
I need you straight,
Melanie.
Don't worry about that, commander.
I'm as straight as they come.
Such a shame.
Check on our transfer schedule.
McSIMMS:
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
They ready for us?
This storm is really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.
Here's your coffee,
Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites, just the way you like it.
You want some?
No, thanks.
How long?
About 40.
Shining Canyon?
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee...
ETA, 40 minutes.
Everybody, check your equipment.
I don't want any surprises.
Is everything all right, lieutenant?
I couldn't help but notice that charming little scene with the queen bee.
Yeah, well, you know how the service is, sergeant.
She figures if I want to make captain, I'll have to pay the price.
The thing is, I don't give a damn about wearing another bar.
Yeah, it could be that.
Or she just has good taste in women.
Sergeant, you are seriously out of line.
I'd hate to spoil my record.
All right.
I know you think you're some pretty tough hombres.
You've had the best training, you have the best gear.
You probably think this is a routine prisoner transfer.
But that's what I want to bang into your heads.
There's nothing routine about this prisoner.
We are here to pick up
James "Desolation" Williams.
I want you all jack-ready and double-tough.
Officers, you can disembark here.
What time is departure? We'll need at least a half an hour to secure our prisoner.
We got about a four-hour turnaround and we're due back at this spot at around 2200. You can report anytime after that.
See if you can raise the yard master, will you?
Ed?
Ed, you out there?
HELENA: Rookies, use your breathers.
We're not going to have air like Earth for 10 more years.
Let's go.
God, I hate this thing.
You'll get used to it.
Two years ago we were still wearing full-face breathers.
Takes about a month to get over the headaches out here.
Huh.
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.
MELANIE: First time in the boonies, eh, rookie?
JERICHO:
Standard layout.
Just another shitty boomtown like all the others. Seen one, you can go home.
MELANIE: You're always cold, you can't get a decent shower and they don't tell you a one-year contract here equals two years
Earth time.
Gotta read the fine print.
JERICHO:
Where is everybody?
Yeah. Friday night, the place should be packed.
I mean, a whole 12 hours before sunup and there's money to burn,
whores to fuck and drugs to take.
Instead we got a graveyard.
Maybe they're all inside spending their money.
Me, I'm gonna get us squared away at the RecFac.
You and Sergeant Jericho check in at the jail.
MELANIE: Save some hot water for me.
Where were you before Chryse?
Utopia.
It was the arse end of the universe.
A penal camp full of work-amnesty cutthroats.
Sounds nasty.
But you seem to be holding together all right.
What you see is nothing.
I have numerous hidden talents.
Need some help with that?
You're persistent, aren't you?
I've changed a few minds in my time.
Not many of us breeders around.
I'd hate to miss a chance to give it a go.
What do you say?
[DOOR CLATTERS]
[CLATTERING]
Hello.
Anybody here?
[OVER PA]
Officer to front desk.
Well, hello, Mr. Williams.
No one's seems to be about.
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
You want me to pop the lock and oust the prisoners?
What do you mean, “pop the lock"?
It's a level-eight security door.
I got a mystical way with locks and mechanical objects.
There isn't a machine on
Mars that doesn't love me.
How about we check with the commander first?
So, what do you do for fun, then?
Are you a gambler?
No, I'm short-time, sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.
Let me put it this way.
Maybe I'd sleep with you if you were the last man on Earth.
But we're not on Earth.
JERICHO: It's a voltage overload, most likely.
You wanna check it out?
It's probably nothing.
But, on second thought...
Police officer.
Anybody there?
Oh, Shit!
Jericho!
This is not making me happy.
All right.
It's time to get backup.
JERICHO:
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
I almost killed you.
MELANIE: What's going on?
RecFac's a slaughterhouse.
What?
“Slaughterhouse"?
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.
According to what Commander Braddock told me right after we first arrived in Shining Canyon, she and the two rookies headed towards the recreation facility.
Me, I'm gonna get us squared away at the RecFac.
You and Sergeant Jericho go and check in at the jail.
MELANIE: Save some hot water for me.
Descanso, sweep left.
Bashira, stick with me.
Bashira!
Bashira!
Officer to train, do you read?
The casino, the barracks, the dining hall, the rec center. No one alive anywhere.
Commander?
What?
I can't reach the train.
Well, keep trying.
What do you think?
How we doing?
I don't know. This thing was built to stay locked.
And Williams is still locked up?
What do you mean?
Williams was arrested on the suspicion of murdering six rail workers and a payroll courier up at Klick 305 Hub Station.
The bodies were hung and decapitated, just like the bodies found in the RecFac.
So how did they pin that on Desolation?
He showed up here with the courier's payroll.
The cashier realized it was a stolen scrip. They made the arrest.
There's gotta be a day log here somewhere.
Sergeant's desk.
Here.
Last night the mine called in a work stoppage.
Reported winds gusting up to 60 knots.
Sixty?
That's what it says.
Anything else?
Arrest for theft...
Then nothing.
[WHIRRING]
Got it.
What's the hell going on around here?
We haven't had a meal or a piss break in six hours.
Descanso, open the door.
All right, everybody. Answer "here" when I call your name. Akooshay.
AKOOSHAY: What?
Just answer "here."
Yeah.
HELENA: Zimmerman.
I'm right in front of you.
Benchley.
Who's that?
AKOOSHAY:
She showed up last night.
Checked herself in. insisted on being locked up here with us.
Well, wake her up, sunshine.
Let's see what she has to say.
Hey, hey. Somebody wants to talk to you.
Who are you?
Whitlock.
What are you doing in the holding tank, Whitlock?
It's the only safe place at the moment, okay?
Can I go back to sleep now?
HELENA: No, you can't.
I need answers.
What's going on out there?
What's your ID?
Dr. Arlene Whitlock.
I'm the Spec Six Science Officer for the mine at Drucker's Ridge.
I left Drucker's about a week ago by means of a weather balloon I'd modified.
There was a disturbance in town.
Seemed prudent to get out.
Yeah, they said there was some sort of a riot, and the place destroyed.
Yeah, something like that.
I was adrift for several days.
Ran out of food.
I followed the rail road tracks until I got here.
Ah, shit!
Then the storm forced me too low.
I hit a windmill and crashed.
They were kind enough to take me in here.
Well, wasn't that nice of them?
Mel, Jericho, go check out Williams.
See if he knows anything about this.
Williams?
Do you know what's going on outside?
Are you aware of what's going on outside?
Let's go. This asshole doesn't know anything either.
JERICHO: You got some balls calling him an asshole to his face.
That's Desolation Williams.
I heard he took out at least six when they cornered him at Deimos Station.
Yeah, and this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate, Jericho.
Just goes with the territory.
Yeah, well, in my case, it's a bit different.
Perhaps a connoisseur like yourself would appreciate what I have to offer.
[BANGING ON METAL]
Go get the commander.
[BANGING ON METAL CONTINUES]
Disarm her.
Officer!
It was almost like she was...
possessed.
Like a force was inside her.
Who was she?
She was a dispatch officer.
We tried to make her comfortable.
The rookies took her to a storage room in the back of the jail.
Then the commander and I went back outside to look around town.
What do you think?
That the Science Officer's lying.
Tell me again about Williams.
I didn't read the full file.
Caught him with the money but he said didn't kill anybody.
Huh, of course. They all just died of fright.
And then cut their own heads off?
[SCREAMING]
[MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Put down your weapon!
Put it down!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Call Jericho.
Sergeant Jericho, we need backup.
We're 20 southwest of the RecFac.
MAN: Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!
Who goes there?
MAN:
Can't fight it! It's in me!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Commander Braddock!
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING
AND SHRIEKING]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
There's a man in there. Open it.
The lock is destroyed. We're gonna need a cutting torch.
How long? At least half an hour, maybe more.
What the fuck is going on here, lieutenant?
He committed suicide. But before he slit his throat, he yelled something,
Something like:
“Stay away!"
"Don't open the door."
"Stay away."
And now the commander's gone.
Helena!
Maybe he was contagious.
Or crazy,
I don't know.
I say we take him at his word and leave him locked in.
Look, one of us has to stay with the rookies.
Why don't you go back to the jail?
I'll find the commander.
Let's get the hell out of this place.
There's nothing we can do for this guy.
You're right.
Okay, let's go.
Drop your weapon, or I'll cut this dyke-bitch head off!
What the fuck happened?
Bashira let him out for some food.
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.
What do you want, Williams?
I want to get the fuck out of here.
Okay. We'll let you walk, just let the girl go.
Think I'm falling for that shit?
I can't let you take the rookie.
Take me.
Okay?
Put the gun down.
Put them down!
MELANIE: Drop your gun, Descanso.
Yeah, drop the gun,
Descanso.
MELANIE:
Okay.
Relax! Take it easy.
Relax! Relax.
You're gonna get what you want.
I know I'm gonna get everything
I want. Now let's go.
[GRUNTING]
Damn, girl.
I like you already.
Shit.
You okay?
Just swell.
Where's Williams?
He took off out the airlock.
He ran into the clinic. Saw him go in not even two minutes ago.
Let me guess, he's got your shotgun, right?
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.
He's still in there, though. I can see the back door from here.
MELANIE: All right. You two take the back door.
I'm gonna go in the front and flush him out. If he comes at you, shoot to kill.
Hey.
[CREATURE HISSING]
[SNARLING]
[GRUNTING]
Now what?
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
How the hell did that happen?
MELANIE: Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like you're coming with me now.
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.
I said move it.
I ain't going nowhere.
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.
Now move it!
[INDISTINCT SHRIEKING
AND WHISPERING]
Let me ask you something, Desolation.
You're so innocent, how come we found all that stolen flash on you?
I didn't say I was innocent.
I said I didn't kill nobody.
Let's say I believe you.
What exactly happened at K-305?
I don't know. I was just changing trains from Camp Sinai.
Had a little time to get me something to eat.
So I went into the station.
MELANIE: It was just lying there, so you took it.
You would have done the same thing.
See, that's where you're wrong.
I'm a cop, not a crook.
It's a thin line between a cop and a crook these days.
You think it's a big difference between you and me?
You just got the Woman behind your bullshit.
Look at you.
You look high right now.
You know I saved your life out there.
So why don't you save mine, and let me out of here?
Look, my job is to bring you back to Chryse to stand trial.
I don't think you did it.
But that's not my call.
So let's not make this any more complicated than it has to be.
WILLIAMS:
It's gonna be real complicated.
Believe that shit.
I ain't going back.
So you secured your prisoner.
Where was your commanding officer during this time?
I can only report what Sergeant
Jericho told me later.
After the man in the rover committed suicide,
Jericho went looking for the commander.
Let's get the hell out of this place.
There's nothing we can do for this guy.
Yeah.
You're right.
Let's go.
Commander Braddock!
[GROANING]
[SCREAMING]
[CREATURES CHANTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
[CHEERING]
[GRUNTING]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING]
Lieutenant.
We got a situation here.
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.
The commander's dead.
JERICHO [OVER RADIO]: Everybody in the mine's gone insane.
Jericho, can you read?
[STATIC BUZZING]
Jericho.
BENCHLEY: Hey, hey, come on, let us out of here.
Start at the beginning!
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.
I told you I got here last night.
Don't bullshit me!
BASHIRA: Lieutenant.
Okay.
What the hell is going on out there?
What?
In semi-arid regions on Earth, there are certain organisms that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains.
When the pools dry up, those organisms can't live but they don't die either.
They go dormant.
Below the surface, away from the hot sun until the next rain cycle begins.
Then they reemerge.
I think something like that's happening here.
I don't understand.
Well, whatever used to live here, we woke it up.
It takes us, okay?
I'm talking about a kind of possession.
DESCANSO: Lieutenant,
Sgt. Jericho's on the radio.
He said he found three people out there.
They're on the way in. They got an ETA of 5 minutes.
You should get on the radio and talk to him.
MELANIE: The hell do you mean he's found three people?
DESCANSO:
That's what he said.
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
MELANIE: You Okay?
WHITLOCK: No.
MELANIE:
Is something broken?
No, I'm all right.
But it's out of the body now.
Yeah, it's loose in here.
Lieutenant, sergeant's on the radio.
JERICHO [OVER RADIO]: Lieutenant, we're coming in. Can you read me?
Sergeant, where are you?
We're right down the street.
We?
Who's "we"?
I found three people alive out here.
Come and open the door for us.
JERICHO: I tried to reach you on the radio.
Just you make sure that door is locked.
There must be 200 of them fucking freaks, and any minute now they're going to be coming down the street looking to kick our ass.
Okay. Relax.
Who are these guys?
I found them hiding up in the mine shed.
Lieutenant, we got a situation here.
MELANIE [OVER RADIO]: Sergeant, you're breaking up. I can hardly hear you.
The commander's dead.
And everybody in the mine's gone insane.
Check the window!
They didn't see.
Who are you?
Who are we?
Who are you?
The man asked you a question.
My name's Jericho.
At least he's not one of them.
What's happening out there?
Who the fuck are those clowns?
What are they all sparked up about?
UNO: Used to be miners. Then everybody in this place lost their mind running around, chopping people's heads off.
Ease up, man.
We were up on the rim when they called the work stoppage.
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
What are they doing?
Shit, I don't know.
TRES: Look at that. They're knocking off early for the night.
How are we gonna sneak into our shift change if they lock up early for the night?
Shut up!
What the hell is that?
[SCREAMING]
Let's get the hell out of here.
We hid until the storm was over.
Later, I went out to take a look around.
Thought they were all dead.
Then some of them started to come to.
They walked around like they were confused or lost.
A few of them seemed okay.
They was trying to help the others.
Then they started changing.
Changing? What do you mean?
They act different, stand different.
Start cutting themselves for decoration.
Filing their teeth.
Making weapons.
Killing the ones who hadn't changed.
[GRUNTING]
UNO:
Cutting people's faces off
and wearing them for masks.
You lads got any weapons?
I mean real weapons.
Only cops can have guns.
Some detonators in them cases over there.
Do you know how these things work?
I know you need dynamite to use them.
Okay then.
We take our prisoner and we all get on the train.
What prisoner would that be?
That's doesn't concern you.
If it's Desolation Williams, it concerns me very much.
Now drop your weapon.
All of you!
Weapons on the floor.
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.
[IN ENGLISH ACCENT]
We lied.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Now go get Williams.
I don't think so.
What was that?
MELANIE:
Fucking kill me.
No problem.
JERICHO: Look.
Will you two stop fucking about?
Lieutenant, let Williams out.
Give me one good reason.
I just gave you about
200 good reasons.
They're probably outside right now.
Doesn't matter that Williams is wanted for murder, and it doesn't matter that this lot are scumbags.
What matters right now is that we stick together to get out of here.
All of us, including Williams, including them.
Who are you calling scumbag, motherfucker?
Now quit with all your fucking stalling and take us to Williams!
WILLIAMS:
I'll be goddamned.
Whoo!
Finally.
Man, this town done went crazy.
We had to improvise.
You like it?
I love it.
I want you to let him out.
What's up, D?
I'm still shackled.
What, are you pigs on a fucking break? Free him up.
I knew you'd let me go.
It's been a long time.
WILLIAMS: I didn't think you all could do it.
Piece of cake.
It was my plan,
Desolation.
[IN UNISON] Fuck!
WILLIAMS: I thought you were watching the door?
I was!
Bitch, you better open this door.
I don't think so.
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Then your asses will never get out.
Someone will find you guys sometime probably tied upside down in here with your heads cut off.
Tell your dogs to quit barking so we can talk.
Put them down.
Put it down.
Listen to me, Williams.
We don't have a lot of time.
You need us and we need you.
We've all seen what's going on out there and none of us is gonna survive if we don't stick together.
I need you to give me your word that if I open this door you and your boys will stand by my command at all times.
I never give my word.
It's okay. I never make deals with criminals either.
You got it.
What? Oh, no. You're making deals with cops?
And you are too.
Give her your weapon.
Everybody, give it up.
Well, introduce us to your friends.
These are my
compadres.
Uno, Dos
Uno must be the nice one.
[UNO CHUCKLES]
UNO:
You got that right, butchy.
I'm not as nice as Desolation, and
I'll cut your fucking titties off--
MELANIE:
Who's in charge here?
You better let go of my arm.
Who is in charge here?
You! You!
Je-- You, you, you.
Shit!
You just gonna stand there and watch her break my shit?
Yeah, and now that you're done mopping the floor, why don't get me a beer, killer?
All right, what's next?
We get more deputies.
You're deputized. Consider this a martial law situation.
Let's go.
When did this start?
It started a few minutes ago.
MELANIE:
What should we do with him?
WHITLOCK:
We can't take him with us.
Then here he stays.
Guys, what is that?
It's a Laffer, a black-market breather.
JERICHO: It has a
15-percent nitrous mix.
It gets you high?
Turns your brain into Swiss cheese.
One gross of detonators.
What are those good for?
It would help if we had some dynamite, but they make a pretty good bang.
We could put them into food cans or something, make some hand grenades.
All right, you got 10 minutes.
Hey.
Easy.
Here, let me do it.
[UNO LAUGHING]
That's beautiful!
That's what you get, dumb-ass.
You gonna be okay to do this?
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
MELANIE: All right, it's almost 2200 hours.
Here's the plan, short and simple.
Descanso and Jericho take the lead, everybody else follows.
It's about 50 meters from here to the station. Bashira and I are in the rear.
Any questions?
Hey.
Put your hand down.
All clear.
Let's do it!
Hey, bro, I don't see no motherfucking train.
Hey, lady, we don't see no train.
It'll be here.
All right, come on, let's go!
Oh! That's the mine office!
What the hell are they doing?
It's like they're tearing the whole town apart, building by building
MELANIE:
Come on, pick it up!
[GROWLING]
JERICHO:
Lieutenant!
MELANIE: Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.
[GRUNTING]
MELANIE:
Go!
Where's the train?
I don't know.
You don't know? What the fuck is that supposed mean?
Lieutenant Ballard, to the train. Come in.
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?
Yeah, it's the same as plan A.
You got any fresh ideas?
Yeah, what we should have done in the first place.
Shit!
Come on, you mindless motherfuckers!
[CREATURES GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
[SCREAMING]
Second time
I've saved your life.
Yeah, run a tab.
[GRUNTS]
UNO:
Jericho, grenade!
[INDISTINCT SHRIEKING AND WHISPERING]
Come on, man, on your feet.
Let's move!
Shit.
[CREATURE SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING]
[YELLING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey.
Open that door.
MELANIE:
We sealed the airlock doors, and Sergeant Jericho dismantled the lock.
They couldn't open the door from the outside, so we were safe... for a while.
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.
Where's your brother?
He didn't make it.
Oh, God.
Uno was your brother?
Yeah.
[ROARS]
[CHANTING]
[SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Look at him.
Whatever's inside of him has waited a long time to get out.
I didn't understand their design, how they move.
It's got to be the wind.
Yeah. yeah, the wind takes them.
And then once their host dies, they just drift along the rail road tracks from town to town, human to human.
What a perfect creation.
Vengeance on anything or anyone that tries to lay claim to their planet.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
What did you see at Drucker's Ridge?
I was at the mine when they called a work stoppage.
There was a section 740, a scientifically significant find.
[EXPLOSIONS]
A 740 applies to any number of things found on Mars:
A biological organism, indication of water, things like that.
After we dynamited the mountain we discovered an entrance.
It was a tunnel carved into the rock.
It had been hidden underneath the outer walls for centuries
and someone other than man had carved it.
WHITLOCK:
Jesus!
MAN: What the hell is that?
WHITLOCK: I don't know.
MAN:
Get the hell out of here!
It was me.
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.
BASHIRA: I made contact with the train.
They're about three klicks north of town on a decoupling spur.
They said the tracks are blocked.
Can they get through?
Yeah, they're working on it.
[ROARING]
You okay?
Yes.
Barricaded the rear door.
Good.
There's a maintenance courtyard out the back enclosed by a 5-meter wall.
There's even a rover parked out there.
Maybe we can make a run for it.
No, we wait.
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.
[YELLING]
Well, if a train's coming, they better hurry up.
What's the matter with you?
You did good out there.
Yeah, right.
It's a fucked-up situation.
I never put too much faith in cops, but you did all right.
You trust me?
Hell, no.
You know, I really don't understand you at all, Desolation.
The only one looking out for me is me.
Doesn't that bother you?
Nothing bothers me.
I stopped worrying a long time ago.
Don't you believe in anything?
I believe in staying alive.
Yeah, but for what?
Stick around, I might let you know one day.
When?
When the tide is high and the water's rising.
[GROANING]
Doing okay in here?
Mel.
Check this out.
What about it?
It's pretty solid.
One way in and a back door out, leading to the rear entrance.
A good, sturdy door.
So, what's your point?
It's rather cozy, don't you think?
I don't believe this. You lured me back here to seduce me?
Well, the way things are going
I thought this might be our last chance to, uh, to dance.
Yeah.
[GUNSHOT]
BASHIRA: Fuck him, whatever the fuck he is.
It's out of him.
Everyone go! Now!
Let's take her out back.
What the fuck do you mean?
We ain't moving her anywhere.
It's taken her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.
Easy, man,
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.
Come on.
WILLIAMS: Let's put her down, before they hear us.
Oh.
This belongs to her.
Where did you get it?
I stole it.
Do you know what it is?
It's her stash.
This will mess with anything in there.
Bon voyage, Mel.
Come on. Let's get the hell back in here.
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
No...
I will not!
MELANIE:
I was aware of having thoughts or memories.
Like I'd been invaded by something, and it was trying to take me over.
Something inside of me wouldn't let that other thing take over, and I fought it.
I didn't know where I was at first, and then it hit me.
I was outside, alone...
unarmed.
[GROWLING AND GRUNTING]
[RUMBLING]
[EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE]
[ALARM WAILING]
The back Wall's been breached.
Don't worry, the back door's locked and secured.
[OVER MONITOR]
Let me in!
It's me!
Shit. It's Melanie!
Open the door!
Looks like her to me.
Haven't heard any of these things speaking English.
Come on, Williams, the tide's getting high out here!
Give me those keys.
Come on!
Is it you?
Yes.
It's me.
MELANIE: I had a glimpse of the Martians,
of their minds, of what they want.
They won't rest short of the destruction of any invading species.
As far as they're concerned, we are the invaders.
BASHIRA:
Something's kicking out there.
[YELLING]
Shit. They made a battering ram.
All right, everybody to the rear of the jail.
Bashira, you and Jericho go back to the storeroom. Load up on detonators.
You're the second line of defense.
So we stay here?
We hold them off as long as we can.
Then we fall back to the storeroom.
You know soon as we kill one of them, whatever's inside's gonna come after us.
I know. So if one of us gets possessed...
Leave them.
[YELLING]
Here we go.
Party time.
[GRUNTING]
[GUNSHOTS]
I'm out.
I'm out.
Move! Move!
Clear!
Clear!
[GUNSHOTS]
Stand clear!
Clear!
Get out!
[GUNSHOTS]
WILLIAMS: I got it!
MELANIE: Take them out back.
Better get out of here.
MELANIE:
Get back.
[ROARING]
Come on!
[YELLING]
[GRUNTING]
Come on!
WILLIAMS:
Come on, let's go!
[ROARING]
Look for the train. See if you can get someone on the radio.
Jericho, get this thing started.
Whitlock, unlock the gate!
MELANIE:
Come on, hurry up!
BASHIRA:
The train's sitting at the station.
Officer to train, do you read?
This is the train.
Where have you been?
Where the hell have you been?
All right, come down.
Bashira, come down!
All right. Wait for us.
We're on our way.
Let's go! Come on!
Get in!
[ROARING]
Get yourselves ready!
RODALE:
Oh, my.
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Okay, go! Go!
[YELLING]
What the hell happened to you?
We got trapped a couple of klicks north of here trying to offload.
I'll get us out of here.
We've gotta go back.
Slow down outside of town, then come to a complete stop.
No way.
I'm giving you an order.
I don't care.
The answer's no.
The answer's yes.
Look, even if we get back to Chryse those things will just keep coming.
We've got a chance here.
We've got a chance to stop this thing before it goes any further.
This is about one thing:
Dominion.
It's not their planet anymore.
What about him?
Isn't our job to take him back?
Is he still a prisoner, or is he one of us?
I can give a damn about saving this planet.
Seems like it's been after me since the day I was born.
If I die,
I'm gonna die fighting, not running.
Hey, Whitlock, if we blew up the nuclear power station, what would happen?
I mean, there'd be a huge explosion, right?
No, not unless you retract the control rods and expose the core.
Then what?
Well, then you'd have a small atomic bomb, going "boom."
MELANIE:
How small?
I don't know. It'd blow out a radius of a mile, maybe two.
Would it kill them?
WHITLOCK: It'd certainly destroy their human hosts, but as for them...
Hell, I don't know.
Jericho, can you get us in?
I can try.
MELANIE:
The plan was simple.
Sgt. Jericho, the science officer and I jumped off
the train and headed towards the power plant.
The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station.
The idea was they'd provide cover and distract
the Martians as we set the charges in the plant.
Then they'd swing back, pick us up,
Like I said, it was a simple plan.
The only problem was it didn't work the way it was supposed to.
How you doing, Jericho?
JERICHO: I'm working on it.
Hurry up.
[GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING]
I'm gonna remove the water jacket and destroy the containment shell.
Okay, so where do I put the dynamite?
Officer to the train, they've spotted us.
Get your ass back here now.
[CREATURE SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
[GRUNTING]
[GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE]
Yeah?
[ROARING]
[GROANING]
[EXPLOSION]
Let's
We've got to get out of here fast.
The doc says the blast radius could be up to two miles.
So, what's that mean?
It means step on it!
[CLANGING]
Stay here and keep it full throttle.
What are you gonna do?
Lighten our load.
I think there's some more dynamite in the rear car.
[HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE]
[HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE CONTINUES]
Williams?
[BEEPING]
[ROARING]
[GRUNTING]
[ROARING]
See you later, you big motherfucker!
You okay?
Say your prayers.
I didn't know you was cut this deep.
Should have taken care of this hours ago.
You do that like a pro.
Yeah. Me and my brother have been through a lot of battles ever since we was kids.
I never thought I'd go to war with somebody like you.
I know when you get to Chryse you'll tell those people that I helped you, and I wasn't the cause of all this mess around here.
Because I know they're looking for somebody to blame.
I swear to you, Williams, as soon as I get back,
I'm gonna tell my superiors all about this fucked-up planet.
They'll drop the charges as soon as they get the report.
Okay.
That ought to hold it.
When you get there, have somebody look at it.
I couldn't get it perfect, so it might leave a scar.
I'm getting a collection.
You'll be all right.
Comfortable?
Yeah.
I'll get you a blanket.
[HANDCUFFS CLICKING]
MELANIE:
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, this is where I get off.
What are you talking about?
We'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't let you turn me in.
I can't let you walk.
What are you going to do?
Fucking shoot me?
Look, there's nowhere to run.
Anywhere is better than hell.
Catch you later.
Yeah, right.
Shit.
And what happened to Williams?
MELANIE:
I don't know.
When I woke up, he was gone.
And you were handcuffed?
He must have done it while I slept.
At that point I trusted him.
That's all you have to tell me?
That's all I know.
INQUISITOR: All right, Lt. Ballard,
I suggest you get some rest.
You're dismissed.
Is our statement to the Cartel going to be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Attention all police personnel.
Report to your nearest munitions station immediately for weaponry assignment.
A security breach has occurred in the south quadrant.
This is a level 10 emergency.
All police personnel, report to your division sergeant for assignment.
All civilian personnel evacuate the streets immediately.
Please remain indoors until further instructed.
[YELLING IN DISTANCE]
Come on!
Tide is up. Time to stay alive.
If you ever want to come to the other side, you'd make a hell of a crook.
You'd make a hell of a cop.
[IN UNISON]
Nah.
Let's just kick some ass!
It's what we do best.

Planning a vacation, Mr. Sullivan?
No. No. Just - just some reading to pass the time.
Step ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
You're expected in Room 102.
Down the hall and to the right.
Thank you.
- What is your name?
- Um- Morgan Sullivan.
- Where were you born?
- Madison, Wisconsin.
- Are you a spy?
- No.
Are you an undercover operator for Sunways Systems?
No.
Were you paid by Sunways Systems to steal data from
Digicorp Technologies?
No.
Have you ever worked at any capacities at Sunways Systems?
No.
This is a technology firm, Mr. Sullivan.
If we choose to employ you as an agent of Digicorp, you will spy on other corporations, inform us of their business plans, research programs, and counter-intelligence operations.
Thus far, your determination has been very impressive.
Well, if there is anything more
I can tell you about myself, anything that has not been already checked by Digicorp.
Your personal records are fine. You've passed our neuro-graph five times.
I'll take the test again if you'd like me to.
You've been married four years.
You live in a respectable neighborhood.
You've always had stable jobs.
You have an excellent credit history.
No drug habits. No drinking problems.
- You don't smoke?
- No.
No other vices to speak of?
Is there anything else we should know about you?
Well -- It might have taken me quite a while to get to this point, Mr. Finster, but now that I'm here, I'm going to make the most of it.
This is who I am and this is what I want to do.
The stakes in this line of work are very high.
Yes, I understand.
It will be like nothing you've ever done before.
Oh, I'm prepared for that.
You will be sent to conventions across the country.
You will record the speeches.
That's been made very clear.
You'll have to deceive other people about what you do for a living.
- Yes.
- Even your own wife.
Yes.
You don't mind lying to your wife?
No.
No, I don't mind.
That was a good one. Move on ahead to the next station.
- Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hello.
Keep it out of view until the convention speeches actually start.
Press the back notch.
You see the flash? It's now on.
Press it again. It's now off.
Easy, isn't it?
And the transmissions are really clear?
Within fifty yards.
Just keep up front for good reception.
Where do the signals go?
Up to our satellite systems, then back down to our data banks.
I guess the speeches must be pretty important.
The speeches are not your concern, Mr. Sullivan.
Just do your job.
Follow our instructions, nothing else. Do you understand?
Yes, Mr. Finster.
Ready!
Jack Thursby? That's what you'll be called from now on.
As far as Digicorp concerns,
Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist.
We've never met him. We never will.
- What's he like?
- Pardon?
What's his personality?
He's whoever you want him to be.
Buffalo? Why do they need you to go all the way to Buffalo?
They want me to tutor them on that spreadsheet software
I was using at my last job.
And you'll be paid freelance for this?
Sure. Independent contract.
You know, if things work out, there could be more trips down the road.
I thought we agreed you weren't going back to work yet.
Not until that position at my father's firm opened up.
I can do this in the meantime, can't I?
I really need you at home right now, Morgan, with me being so busy with the Williams case.
It's only temporary, honey.
I won't be gone for long.
Hello.
After the convention, you will confirm the transmission on your returning flight.
Yes.
Do you remember the location of the briefcase?
Uh, yes.
Good luck, Mr. Thursby.
We're counting on you.
Thank you.
I left it in the stall.
Something to drink, sir?
I'll have a ginger ale.
- Actually, I'll have a scotch.
- Scotch?
Hmm. Single malt.
- On the rocks.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. Thursby.
This is our new mascara line.
- It's hypoallergenic and it's vitamin enriched. - Really? Mr-
- Fred Garfield.
- Hi. Hi. Jack Thursby.
Fairway Fragrance. Where are they located exactly?
Uh
- Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma.
You don't say? I've got family from Tulsa.
You don't have much of an accent.
- I didn't grow up there.
- Oh, where did you grow up?
- I said, where'd you grow up?
- South Pacific.
- I'm sorry, where?
- The South Pacific Islands.
The Tuamotu Archipelago. French
Polynesia. Tahiti. Papeete.
Wow. That's pretty unusual.
Yeah, I plan to go back there someday when I retire.
Water, sir?
- Thanks.
- Well, see you around, Jack.
Sure thing, Fred.
The conference room will be open in five minutes.
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Robert Tuttle.
I'll be your first speaker.
I will first discuss shaving cream distribution outlets in North American markets.
Let me begin by acknowledging what has become axiomatic in the field of shaving cream distribution.
Mainly that shaving cream, indeed almost all personal hygiene products for men, is what we call fashion resistant.
The overwhelming majority of shaving cream users will adopt a brand and remain loyal to it.
It is especially interesting to note, the difference in methods used to penetrate that market.
Because these two methods employed by the respective companies really illustrates the essential strategic choice that faces-
- The Mediterranean.
- Yes.
The Mediterranean is beautiful, of course; but if it's real sailing you want,
I recommend the Sunda Islands in the Banda
Sea. I was there on a trip last spring.
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Hmm, Cohibas, my favorite brand. Thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Would you excuse me?
Good evening, sir. What'll it be?
Give me a scotch. Single malt, on the rocks.
You got it.
Haven't we seen each other before?
You'll have to come up with something more original than that.
I'm here for the convention.
That's fascinating.
- You're in marketing, right?
- Uh-uh. Sales.
- Is there a difference?
- What about you?
I do health inspections of hotel restaurants.
- That sounds interesting.
- No, it doesn't.
- Do you have an answer for everything?
- Yes.
Rita Foster.
Jack Thursby.
So what do you do besides travel to dull cities and talk to women in hotel bars?
- I- - uh- play golf.
- Are you any good?
- No.
- Honesty. I like that.
What else do you like?
No commitments. No bullshit.
- And no rings.
- No rings?
You might want to take yours off?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll leave you alone now.
Your transmission came through, Mr. Thursby.
The signal was clear.
I can do something else on my next trip.
I think I'm ready to handle a bigger assignment.
We'll be sending you to Omaha next Wednesday.
Omaha?
You'll perform the same job that you did in Buffalo.
Omaha? Why can't they find someone in Omaha?
Why do they need to fly you all the way out there? It doesn't make sense.
Morgan.
Morgan, are you listening to me?
Since when did you ever care about golf?
You're not going on this trip, Morgan. I'm sorry.
What do you mean, I'm not going?
My father wants you to come to his office tomorrow.
Getting a position with his company is more important than a silly freelance job.
I said I'd go.
You're not going,
Morgan. End of discussion.
You're staying here. I'll call my father tonight and we'll-
Tell your father to go fuck himself.
What did you just say?
Say you're sorry, Morgan!
Morgan!
If you don't apologize, I want you out of this house.
Morgan! Are you listening to me?
What in God's name has gotten into you.
Since when did you start smoking? Morgan!
Morgan, what's going on? I think I deserve an explanation.
Your scotch, Mr. Thursby.
Turn around slowly, please.
What is your transmission device?
I thought you were a health inspector.
I'll ask you again: what is your transmission device?
The pen, in my jacket pocket.
Do not turn the pen on.
What?
When you're inside the convention room, keep the pen turn off.
Do not send the transmission to Digicorp.
If you tell Digicorp you met me, they'll kill you.
Take two every six hours, it will get rid of the nightmares you've been having.
Your headaches will go away, too, and the pain in the back of your neck.
How do you know that I'm having nightmares?
We'll be in touch in Boise.
What will they do if
I don't turn on my pen?
Just remember who you are. You are
Morgan Sullivan. You are not Jack Thursby.
Wait!
Good morning, everyone. I'm Alex
Chen. I'll be your first speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to address the controversy that's been raging around new techniques in the preparation of process cheese.
Now at the risk of oversimplifying the question facing the average manufacturer of process cheese is this:
Given an increased consumer prejudice against chemical additives, how do we stem the tide away from natural or organic based products and instil in the cheese buyer.
I'm glad to hear that there were no problems at the convention, Mr. Thursby.
I'll call down to the lab to make sure the transmission went through.
Excellent work, Mr. Thursby.
Thank you.
Your transmission came through perfectly, just as clear as the last time.
I want you to take another trip. Boise, Idaho.
Boise?
We scheduled a connecting flight for you to board when you landed.
You won't have time to go home.
That's not a problem, is it?
No. No problem.
Room 1493, Mr. Thursby.
The convention room will be open in an hour.
Thank you.
Mr. Thursby! One last thing: the first letter from each word is the phone number to call her.
Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
You dialed a special number that can't be traced or monitored.
Now, listen carefully.
Take the service elevator at the end of the hall down to the basement level.
You'll be clear for the next five minutes.
Wait a minute, wait!
Keep moving.
Roll up your sleeve, please.
We don't have much time.
Are you insane? You're not sticking that into me!
He has medical training, Mr. Sullivan.
I don't care if he's a fucking brain surgeon!
You're not gonna drug me.
We're undrugging you.
The shot will block out the Digicorp narcotic.
What?
The chemical they're putting in your bloodstream at every convention.
Do you normally drink something inside the convention room?
Mineral water.
The drug is tasteless and odorless. You wouldn't have known.
Did you take the pills I gave you?
Had the noises in your head started to go away?
- And the recurring dreams?
- Jesus, what is this?
W-w-why didn't Digicorp check my transmission in Omaha?
There was no transmission in Omaha.
Or in Buffalo. Or anywhere else.
Why do they send me to these conventions?
- The conventions are charades.
- Charades?
You and the other convention guests all work for Digicorp. You're all spies.
You're given phony assignments, phony identities.
You think your pen is a transmitting device, another guest thinks it's his tie clip or her watch.
The whole thing is just a ploy to keep you all distracted, to not realize what's really going on.
What is really going on?
If you want answers, take the shot.
When you're inside the room, act as you always act.
Order the mineral water. Drink it.
Don't make them suspicious.
The shot we gave you should protect you.
It should protect? What'd you mean? What if it doesn't?
Listen to me carefully.
Whatever happens in that room, show no reaction, no emotion, no surprise.
No matter what you see, do not move.
What will I see?
- Who sent you?
- A friend.
I don't have any friends.
- When will I see you again?
- Soon.
I promise.
There are several points of interest here. First of all, the fact, that by an impressive margin, new home purchases took most of the brunt of that decline.
By this I mean that sales of older homes are done on an individual basis where there's considerably more room for negotiation.
Therefore, in those sales we're more likely to find that the official rise in mortgage rates has been offset somewhat by the ...rates of return on high tech investment, which led to a surge in business capital spending and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity.
The capitalization of these higher than expected returns boosted equity prices generally beyond even that expected by the enhanced rise in real incomes.
The elevated level of light vehicle sales, for example, has put more vehicles on the road than the industry could sustain.
And even though demand for the number of high tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on ever faster.
Overall capacity in high tech manufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its rapid rate of increase.
Accordingly the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of last year intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out around the turn of the year.
As the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high tech sector, where previous high evaluations were being re-evaluated, resulting in significant losses in some investors.
Clearly some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary, if the economy was to progress along balanced and sustainable growth.
With the process likely to intensify with the rise in the cost of energy
that has strained business and household purchasing power,
purchases of durable goods and investment
in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.
Because the slowdown was not anticipated by business,
it induced some backup in inventories, despite more advanced technologies...
Inventory sales ratios rose only moderately, and even after the policy actions taken in January,
the risk continue skewed toward the economies remaining on a path
inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance.
Crucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding
of recent policy options,
is the role of the technological change in productivity
in shaping near-term transcyclical forces
as well as long term sustainable growth,
perceptible for sustaining slow advances in quality...
Just a reflex.
...Managers appear to be more generally sanguine about the potential for innovation.
You are not Morgan Sullivan. You are Jack
Thursby. You are not married to Amy Sullivan.
Your wife is Diane Thursby.
Your wife is Diane Thursby.
You live in Redmond, Washington.
Accordingly to foster financial conditions,
the federal reserve has quickened the pace of adjustment for its policy, and in conclusion, a cautious approach is always the best strategy.
Thank you for your attention.
Excuse me, do you have the time?
- The time? Your watch?
- Yeah, it's 3:30.
Already? Gosh, the last speech just flew by.
Yeah.
Did you enjoy it?
Oh, yeah. Very much.
Hello?
It's for you.
Digicorp will approach you at the airport. Tell them you are Jack Thursby.
Tell them you've never heard of Morgan Sullivan.
Make them think you're brainwashed.
If you're exposed, they'll kill you.
What happened back there?
You're feeling the side effects of the neutralizing agent in your system.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
Mr. Sullivan. There's been a change of plans, Mr. Sullivan.
You need to come to Digicorp's local office right away.
Mr. Sullivan?
Mr. Sullivan?
Are you all right?
I think you're mistaken.
My name isn't Sullivan.
You're not Morgan Sullivan?
- You don't work for Digicorp?
- No. My name is Thursby. Jack Thursby.
I think you're looking for somebody else.
I'm sorry, Mr. Thursby. My mistake.
That's okay.
Hello, sir. How are you?
I just need to see your boarding pass, please. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Excuse me.
- No problem.
Your turn. There's not much hot water left. Sorry.
Could you make dinner a half hour earlier tonight?
Sure.
I wrote down a list of errands I need you to do today.
Okay.
Your car keys are in the foyer next to your briefcase, right where you left them.
Planning a trip?
Just some reading to pass the time.
You're expected in reception, Mr. Thursby.
Down the hall and to the left.
- What's your name?
- Jack Thursby.
My name's Frank Callaway. I'm head of security for Sunways Systems.
According to your neuro-graph, you're lying.
You're lying when you say that your name is Jack Thursby.
You're lying when you say that you are not an undercover agent.
You are lying when you say that you do not work for Digicorp.
And I cannot tell you how happy that makes us.
No way. I am not going back to that house.
You are in a unique position here, Morgan.
Digicorp thinks that you're brainwashed as Jack Thursby.
They think that you passed our neuro-graph and they want us to hire you as one of our agents.
I don't care what they want.
Your counter intelligence work for Sunways will be very simple.
Digicorp will never suspect that you're working for us.
So they won't watch you too closely while you're in the house.
All you have to do is to place one bug in each room.
You don't fucking understand. I'm going home. I'm going to my real home.
Your real home is gone, Morgan.
What are you talking about?
Your wife put your house up for sale.
Her lawyer has been trying to contact you for the last few days.
She filed for divorce three days ago.
I'm sorry, Morgan.
- Look, Morgan, I know this is hard.
- I want to see Rita.
- Who?
- Rita Foster.
- She pulled me out of the brainwashing.
- No, Morgan. You cannot see her.
- Why not? She works for you.
- She does not work for us.
But you sent her to find me at the hotels, right?
No.
But you know who she works for?
Who does she work for?
- She works for Sebastian Rooks.
- Who's Sebastian Rooks?
Sebastian Rooks is a freelance operative who we hired to find out how Digicorp was getting their agents past our neuro-graph.
Then we asked him to send us an agent who wasn't brainwashed.
He delivered you.
He's the best in the business, but he's also very dangerous and very ruthless.
I advise you to stay away from him.
Stay away from him and her.
Look, we are offering you a very good deal here.
When your work for us is finished, we'll give you a new identity and a new home, somewhere very far away and safe from Digicorp.
I'm sorry, Mr. Callaway, but you'll have to find someone else for your job.
You won't last long out there.
Anywhere you go outside this complex,
Digicorp will have agents watching you.
If you try to run, if you behave like Morgan
Sullivan instead of Jack Thursby, they will eliminate you.
Quick. Efficient. Ruthless.
You're fortunate, Morgan. If we hadn't interrupted the brainwashing process you'd be like the other convention guests: programmed with a new identity and sent to companies across the globe, disposed of when you're no more useful to Digicorp.
You have a chance to fight back.
So, are you ready to be a spy, Morgan?
I'm gonna get some more broccoli.
Phone lines are tapped.
We've got visual in all the rooms.
There they are in the dining room.
The salt shaker gives a nice angle, doesn't it?
Very well. He believes he's Jack Thursby.
He believes I'm his wife.
He's adjusted to this house.
- Who's she talking to?
- Digicorp agents.
She's giving them a report on you.
He spends much of his time indoors.
Of course he has no friends and he has little contact with the outside world.
We've got the Internet lines tapped too.
Excellent work, Morgan. Excellent.
My God.
My life is the same as it ever was.
That's because Digicorp monitored your old life and then duplicated it.
It helps ease the transition of becoming another person.
That's not who I am anymore.
I
- I smoke cigarettes.
I like to drink scotch.
I play golf.
I'm not supposed to live in the suburbs.
I'm not supposed to be like that.
I'm sorry if you're disappointed, Morgan.
But that is your vision of Jack Thursby.
It's not Digicorp's.
Can you guys clean up the camera reception in that hallway?
Yes, Jamison?
This isn't Jamison. It's
Morgan Sullivan. Bitch.
- What do you want, Mr. Sullivan?
- I need your help.
I want to hire Sebastian Rooks.
- Are you still there?
- Goodbye, Mr. Sullivan.
- I'll pay him for his service.
- He doesn't work for individuals.
Ask him to make an exception.
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're on your own, I'm sorry.
No. No!
- Listen, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing I can-
You gotta help me, please.
You said I could trust you. I believed you when you said that.
Meet me at the carwash at Fourth and Jefferson in three hours.
Morgan! We'll be sending you on your first assignment next week.
Our surveillance of your house has already paid off.
We know exactly what sort of data
Digicorp is trying to steal from us.
So tonight you will say that you're going out of town on a business trip.
Now, you know how to tell her that, right?
- Morgan?
- Yes.
You will stick to the script, Morgan.
You won't try anything risky, do you understand me?
Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you.
- When does he want to meet me?
- Not yet. He's in the car behind us.
- How much money does Rooks want?
- He's not interested in your money.
It's your situation. He thinks he can use it to his advantage.
- How?
- I'll be in touch with you in Wichita.
Wichita?
That's where Sunways will be sending you for your last assignment.
How do you know that?
They haven't even told me.
Rooks knows. He knows everything.
- Can I trust Rooks?
- I can't give you guarantees.
But he has the resources to provide you with a new life, a new identity.
It's your choice, Mr. Sullivan.
What do I have to do?
Sunways will send you on a series of assignments.
You'll receive a courier disk on each trip.
Digicorp agents will be following you wherever you do.
Let them, that's what Sunways wants.
At each destination you'll be met by a Sunways contact.
They'll download data onto your disk.
Digicorp's agents will assume you're receiving valuable information.
As you travel to more cities, collect more data, and complete more assignments, your agent status will rise.
Digicorp will then assume you have become one of
Sunways top company men.
Jack?
Each disk you bring home will seem more important than the last.
As they copy the Sunways files,
Digicorp will think they have won a major victory against their greatest rival.
In reality, Digicorp is the loser.
Sunways is feeding them corrupt data that will sabotage their operations.
But make no mistake, Mr. Sullivan.
Sunways is just as ruthless as Digicorp.
Once this operation is complete, they will eliminate you.
Rooks will protect you.
Please. You can trust me.
We're sending you to Kansas. Wichita.
It's almost over, Morgan.
After this trip to the vault, your work for us will be finished.
- The vault?
- It's our data warehouse.
It's completely isolated from the outside world, but we send in agent couriers if we need to retrieve or add a file.
You will be our next courier.
And Digicorp will they have hit the mother lode.
Shh! We need to keep our voices down. Switch this disk with the one in your briefcase, before you go to the vault. Take off your ring.
- What?
- Your ring.
This is a tracking device. We'll know your precise location at all times.
Does this mean we can see each other again?
I pick you up after you leave the vault, deliver you to Rooks.
- I mean, after that?
- We can never see each other again.
It would compromise your identity.
I'm never getting out of this, am I?
500 Horse Creek Road, please.
I know where to go.
Settle down, Mr. Sullivan. We have a long ride ahead of us.
You don't have to pretend to be Thursby.
I know you're not brainwashed.
I know that Sunways has been using you as a double agent against Digicorp.
Are you going to kill me?
Not if you turn your loyalties to me instead of Sebastian Rooks. Oh, yeah. I know that you work for him.
As a matter of fact, we both do.
I'm Rooks' inside source at Digicorp.
- His what?
- He paid me to hire you so you could be his pawn once you were sent off to Sunways.
You didn't think I hired you because
I was impressed by you, did you?
It's a good plan, really.
Rooks knew that you'd end up here in
Kansas on the way to the Sunways vault.
He knew he could convince you to switch their disk with his.
- That was his scheme from the very start.
- It's not possible.
Rooks' disk contains a search program.
It penetrates the vault's secure network and quietly steal a data file without triggering any alarms.
What data file?
Who knows? But if Rooks has gone through all this trouble to get it, it must be extremely valuable.
The plan was foolproof.
Except for one factor he failed to consider: me.
What do you want?
When you come out of the vault, deliver the disk to me, not Rooks.
I've been loyal to Digicorp all along.
Why should I trust you or Digicorp?
Because we'll let you live and
Rooks won't. It's as simple as that.
No one sees his face and lives to tell about it.
No one sees his face?
He's a deep cover operative.
A Yuri in cyberspace.
He's a phantom. Companies hire him without actually knowing who he is.
If they did, they'd kill him.
The moment you give that disk to
Rooks is the moment he eliminates you.
There's only one person Rooks trusts with his identity:
Rita Foster, his lover.
She's completely loyal to him. No one else.
I'm the only person you can trust now.
I'll be nearby when you come out.
Just in case we get separated.
No charge for the ride.
Good evening, Mr. Thursby.
My name's Virgil Dunn.
Welcome to the vault.
Your first time?
Hope you didn't have a big dinner.
Step ahead, please.
Now that we know you are bug free,
I can call you by your real name, Morgan.
Dunn, Virgil C.
I need your disk now, please.
Good, good.
Digicorp will cream in their pants when they copy the bogus data that I just cooked up for them.
You wouldn't believe the number of times they tried to jack into the systems down here.
- Have they ever succeeded?
- Hell, no.
This place is tighter than a nun's asshole.
Uh, snort while we wait?
Sure.
I distilled it myself down here. One of my little hobbies to pass the time.
- Thanks.
- Here's to the information agent.
I used to be an agent like you once.
I was the best mole spotter in the business.
You put me in a room with a possible double agent, let me ask him a couple of questions, and I could tell you right there whether he was a spy or not.
That was before Sunways sent me down here. That was three years ago.
- What happened?
- Those fucking machines is what happened.
They said the neuro-graphs were
100% accurate, but I wasn't.
That a really good spy, a really good liar, could trick me every time.
It's bullshit, I told them.
But they wouldn't listen.
You see, there are things that only a person can know about another person, Mr. Sullivan, things that a machine could never pick up.
For example, let me ask you a couple of questions.
Excuse me?
What is your favorite drink? Go ahead.
Answer. I just want to prove my point.
What is your favorite drink?
Er, scotch, single malt, on the rocks.
You're telling the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.
Truth again. See, you're very
- very easy to read.
Now
- Are you in love with your wife?
- Yes.
- There, you just lied. Am I right?
Yes, I lied.
It's more than just questions, however.
For instance, I'm sensing a kind of tension in you.
It's been evident ever since
I put your disk in my computer.
Now why would that be? We both know the disk is from Sunways.
That's nothing that should make you uneasy.
- One last question, all right?
- Sure.
Are you a double agent?
Where's Mr. Dunn?
He decided to stay in his office.
- Right. You can go ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
- Thank you.
Open the door!
Emergency crews are on their way.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
Emergency crews are on their way.
For your safety, please remain inside the elevator.
Jump!
Now!
I told you I'd know where you'd be.
- Is this Rooks?
- I can take the disk now.
Jamison, one of our operatives.
Rooks is back at the hotel.
He's looking forward to seeing you.
The car's waiting downstairs.
Call me when you get to the lab.
- This is where Rooks lives?
- For now. He moves around a lot.
- But you know where he is at all times?
- We have a special relationship.
Your assignment is nearly finished, Mr. Sullivan.
I'll be back in a moment.
Finster.
- It's Morgan Sullivan.
- Sullivan! What happened to you?
I'm in the penthouse suite of an old building. I don't know where it is.
We're tracing the call. We'll be there shortly. Where's Rooks?
- I'm just about to meet him.
- Get off the phone before he sees you.
He will kill you, understand? Hold on to the disk. We're on our way.
- Don't come any closer.
- Put the gun down, Mr. Sullivan.
I'll break it. You come any further, I'll break it.
I gave you the Sunways disk. This one is yours. The one Rooks wants.
Stop!
- You really don't want to do that.
- You used me. You and Rooks.
- You used me from the very start.
- Wait, let me explain.
No. Finster already explained everything.
- When did you talk to Finster?
- He's on his way. I just called him.
If Rooks wants this disk before Finster arrives, you better unlock that door and let me go.
Listen to me. Sebastian Rooks is not the person you think he is.
Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy
- and so are you.
- No, you're wrong. He's-
I know about you.
I know about the two of you. I know about your special relationship.
Please, just hear me out. I-
I don't want to hear any more lies!
I don't want to hear any more lies!
God! I can't believe I thought you actually cared about me.
- I can't believe I was such a fool.
- I do care about you.
No, no.
Just go see Rooks. It'll be okay.
Hurry. Find him.
I tried stopping you, but you insisted.
You said it was the only way to steal the data from the vault.
Welcome home, Mr. Rooks.
Come on. Finster will be here any minute.
No, no. No more lies. You can't trick me anymore.
Listen to me. You are not Morgan Sullivan.
You created him out of your own imagination.
Your life in the suburbs, your miserable marriage-- Your wife, Amy, was one of your own operatives playing a part you assigned her.
The more you fight the truth, the more it'll hurt.
It's not possible.
You used the same brainwashing technique Digicorp uses.
You were the one who sold them the technology to begin with.
- This makes no sense!
- It makes perfect sense!
By turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan was the only way you could pass
Digicorp's neuro-graph.
It was the only way you could get hired to be their spy and get sent to Sunways.
- Why would anyone do this?
- For this.
- What's on it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
You don't know?
I've put a lot of faith into this assignment.
Clear! Freeze! Don't move!
Sunways Security! Identify yourself! Digicorp Security!
- You're following me, Callaway?
- I'm here for Rooks, not you.
That's who I am here for.
- You've flown this before?
- No, never.
You know how to fly it. You designed it.
- I don't know what to do.
- Sebastian Rooks knows.
- I can't remember Sebastian Rooks!
- You remembered that you loved me.
Just think.
We're out.
Did you get a look at him?
Did you see Rooks' face?
Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.
Jesus! He's Rooks.
Is it what you want?
Yes.
Yes. It's you.
The file in the vault was erased. And this is the only copy.
Now there's no copy at all.
You know how blind I am without them.
Howard, don't cry.
Murder.
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?
Only the ones you give me.
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.
This will be case number 1108.
Morning, detectives.
Case number 1108, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...
...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks.
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Good morning.
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?
Affirmative. I will validate.
Go get them.
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds from now. This is a Red Ball.
You know how blind I am without them.
All right, Howard Marks, where are you?
Howard? Howard, breakfast.
Four score and seven years ago...
- He looked familiar.
- Who?
A man standing in the park across the street.
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.
- You know how blind I am...
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.
I was thinking I'd stay home today.
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.
You know how blind I am without them.
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.
I've been working too much anyway.
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...
I have an open house at the Ressler place.
- Have consecrated, far above our poor power to add or detract. "
I guess that's why you look so nice.
Chief! We got a problem with our location.
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.
Investigator from the fed's here.
I don't need some twink from the fed poking around.
I wrote it on your calendar.
See if the neighbors knew where they went.
- Check all relations.
- Checking.
Just get him some coffee, tell him how I save your ass every day.
I got coffee, thanks.
Danny Witwer, the twink from the fed.
Oops. Gum?
I'll give you the full tour some other time.
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody knows where. Still searching for family.
Time horizon, 12 minutes.
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...
...clues as to where the murder will happen.
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.
And that this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth.
Victims are pronounced here, killers here.
Beyond that, all we have to run on are the images that they produce.
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?
Georgetown.
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder four days out. Why the late call?
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no premeditation, so they show up late.
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.
People have gotten the message.
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.
Look at this kid.
In this one, he's on the left side of the man.
Yes. So?
This one he's on the right.
Merry-go-round.
It's a park.
There's only 16 of these old merry-go-rounds left in the city.
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Time horizon, six minutes.
Let's go to bed.
Let's do it in here.
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.
Shit.
Which one is it?
- Not the bed.
- Come on.
I don't want to be on the bed.
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?
- Jad?
- Go ahead.
- Did he close the front door?
- What?
Did Marks close the front door?
Front door...
I didn't wanna be on the bed.
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.
I forgot my glasses.
Howard.
You know how blind I am without them.
Howard, don't cry.
Marks!
Look at me. Look at me.
Positive for Howard Marks.
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...
...you're under arrest for the future murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...
...that was to take place today at 0800 hours and four minutes.
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.
Sit here a minute and listen to me.
Your husband is being arrested by Precrime.
Oh, God, Howard, no.
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I thought they stopped the murder.
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.
The really bad ones the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.
Wally, erase the incoming.
Imagine a world without murder.
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.
Just six years ago, the homicide rate had reached epidemic proportions.
It seemed that only a miracle could stop the bloodshed.
But instead of one miracle, we were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.
Within just one month under the Precrime program...
...the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90%% .
- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.
Within a year, Precrime effectively stopped murder in our nation 's capital.
In the six years of our experiment...
...there hasn't been a single murder.
And now Precrime can work for you.
We want to make certain that every American...
...can bank on the infallibility of the system.
And to ensure that what keeps us safe will also keep us free.
- Precrime. It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
- It works.
Precrime. It works.
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes" on the National Precrime Initiative.
What's the matter? Can't sleep?
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.
You want the customary clarity or the new and improved kind of clarity?
Give me the new stuff.
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.
Come on. Come on.
Don't bust my balls. You've only given me four, and some of these are duds.
Sweet dreams, chief.
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
I could use a little juice on my side.
What do you think you know?
It's like my daddy used to say:
"In the land of the blind...
...the one-eyed man is king. "
I'm home.
Overhead.
Wall screen.
- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.
Can you teach me how to run faster?
Because all the kids in my class run faster than me.
That's good.
Keep your knees up.
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.
Yeah. Gotta keep running.
Gotta keep running.
- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.
- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.
Yeah, all right. All right.
I love you.
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.
Remember?
We had 20 dollars and...
Waiting in that van so the sun would shine on our vacation.
John. John. John, put the camera down.
Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.
It's time to put the camera to sleep...
...and time to come and take care of your wife.
Why don 't you put the camera down and come and watch the rain with me?
No? I promise I'll make it a memorable moment.
Put the camera down or you're not getting anything tonight.
A gentleman at Justice wants to take this away from us.
In a week, people will vote on whether or not...
...what we've been doing has been a noble-minded enterprise...
...or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
John...
...watch this Danny Witwer, the observer from Justice.
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.
Answer his questions, but watch him.
If there's any problem, make sure we know about it.
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood.
Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge.
You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology.
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...
...but we arrest individuals who've broken no law.
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.
The Pre-Cogs see the future, and they're never wrong.
But it's not the future if you stop it.
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.
You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time.
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.
You're certain?
But it didn't fall. You caught it.
Preventing it doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
You ever get any false positives?
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?
They don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides?
Because of the nature of murder.
Nothing's more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us...
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs, designed the system and the interface.
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.
- To Hineman?
- To them.
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?
We keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering.
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.
You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
- Show it to me.
- Sure.
This investigation of Precrime and its personnel is conducted...
...under the direct supervision and permission from the attorney general.
I'm here as his representative...
...which means you're now operating under my supervision.
Seems you've been left out of the loop.
All right, we're ready. Let's go.
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.
Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.
White-light pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear...
...and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue.
In other words, we see what they see.
They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine.
Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels.
Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep.
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.
No. They're much more than that.
Science has stolen most of our miracles.
In a way, they give us hope, hope of the existence of the divine.
It's interesting that some people have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.
The oracle isn't where the power is, anyway.
The power is with the priests, even if they had to invent the oracle.
You guys are nodding like you know what he's talking about.
Well, come on, chief. The way we work, changing destiny and all...
...we're more like clergy than cops.
- Jad.
- Yeah?
Go to work. All of you.
Sorry. Old habit.
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?
I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.
I know what it's like to lose someone close.
Nothing's like the loss of a child.
I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that was like.
To lose your son in such a public place like that...
Now we can make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years. This system is...
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.
It always is.
John.
Wally.
Can you see?
What happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.
- She spoke to me.
- To you?
What'd she say?
"Can you see?"
You the sentry?
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.
You're Chief Anderton.
The music relaxes the prisoners.
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow. You like this tie?
Stop.
Roll back.
There.
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.
Combined data stream based on all three previsions.
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...
...we go for a ride.
My God.
I'd forgotten there were so many.
And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.
The killer's a John Doe, never identified.
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?
Those are not his eyes. He had them swapped out to fool the scanners.
You can get it done on the street for a few thousand bucks these days.
Okay, so you want just the female prevision.
That's right.
We don't seem to have her data.
Try again.
This is odd. See?
We have the two previsions. We got what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.
But Agatha's isn't here.
Probably just a glitch.
Tell me about the intended victim, this Anne Lively.
Looks like she's a neuroin addict, like our John Doe here.
Address history includes the Beaton Clinic.
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?
I guess glitches come in twos.
You finally crawl your way out of one hole just to fall into another.
No.
Can't let you take that out of here, chief.
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?
Careful, chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.
The third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something?
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.
That's not all. There are a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
You'd think we'd have found the cure for the common cold.
- It's stress.
- What's this?
Herbal tea with honey.
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.
Just drink it, before I pour it in your lap.
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.
Witwer's scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow.
Yeah, give him a tour.
- Lara called me.
- What?
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I understand you've been spending a lot of time in the Sprawl.
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.
What if Danny Witwer insisted on a full chem run?
I'm fine.
The minute Precrime goes national, they are going to take it away.
- We won't let them.
- No?
How is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
My father once said to me...
..."You don't choose the things you believe in. They choose you. "
There's a reason you are here.
Had Precrime been in place earlier, your loss would have been prevented.
Remember, the eyes...
The eyes of the nation are on us right now.
I'm not the generation anyone listens to...
...but people trust you when you speak of your belief in Precrime.
They know that it's a belief born of pain, not politics. I understood that.
I may have even encouraged it to help with the cause.
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.
They're not going to take it away from us.
I won't let them.
Bingo.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.
- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?
- We practice at school.
- With Connor?
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.
- Wait!
- No!
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?
We're in motion on something. We got a white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.
He takes a round in the 10-ring and goes out a window.
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.
It's premeditated.
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109. Time of occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...
...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks.
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Good morning.
Are you ready to preview and validate 1109?
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.
I love this part.
I've got no address. No tax returns for the last five years.
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.
We'll send a protection team as soon as we lock location.
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.
Ouch. About a thousand of those in the District.
Fractured images coming in.
Numbers nine...
Nine, six.
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.
She's laughing.
Okay, now I'm inside a room.
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.
Two figures resolving in the room.
- Wait!
- No...
Looks like we got a third party.
Wearing sunglasses, just out the window.
You're not gonna kill me.
Goodbye, Crow.
You're not gonna kill me.
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!
Wait. Wait.
You say something, chief?
No.
I'll get this one.
We got time on this one, Jad.
Mind getting me a piece of cake they're eating?
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.
I think I'll get one for myself too.
Take your time.
Chief Anderton, what is this that I'm seeing?
I'm confused about...
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.
Anderton, wait!
Anderton, wait!
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.
Give you two minutes before I hit the alarm.
Hold that, please.
Thanks.
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you've been doping on.
Easy.
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.
What are you gonna do?
Possession will cost you six months and your badge.
I guess we won't be working together after all.
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.
Lamar. Lamar.
- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?
It's Witwer. He set me up!
Stop, just wait.
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?
- Somebody.
- Who?
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.
But I'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours.
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?
- Now listen, come in.
- What?
I'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this.
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.
Ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents into the analytical room.
Who's Leo Crow?
Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.
Lamar, they found me.
Is there any way to override the lockdown?
- No, no, no.
- No?
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.
You can't run.
Everybody runs.
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.
What?
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.
He came to see you the other day right before he was tagged.
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.
John doesn't think they have a deep enough pitching roster.
Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing.
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.
It's my business. Investigation of a supervising officer for a capital crime...
...falls under federal jurisdiction so as to rule out any conspiracy.
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.
Call the attorney general. I'm sure he'd clarify the issue for you.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
I'm going to enjoy working here.
A road diverges in the desert.
Lexus.
The road you're on, John Anderton, is the one less-traveled.
- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...
Good evening, John Anderton.
John Anderton! You could use a Guinness right about now.
- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.
Send units to each location.
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.
Fire them up!
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.
Hey, don't do this.
John?
Don't run.
You don't have to chase me.
You don't have to run.
Everybody runs, Fletch.
You know we'll catch you.
Everybody runs.
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.
Get your sick-sticks ready.
Everybody runs, Fletch.
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.
No sudden moves, chief.
John, it's okay.
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.
Got a grip?
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.
Anderton!
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!
Get out of my house! Go!
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...
Go to sleep.
You two stay with me!
Dr. Hineman.
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.
That would be from the doll's eye, the vine...
...the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall.
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.
Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see...
...the most extraordinary display of blue objects.
This just isn't your week, is it?
Chief Anderton.
I'm not a killer.
You better drink this.
Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered.
All of it.
Okay, now take a minute to right yourself.
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?
You could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.
How would I know that?
Because you invented Precrime.
What's so funny?
If the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...
...can be called an invention, then I invented Precrime.
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.
I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else.
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.
I was doing genetic research, treating children of drug addicts.
This was 10 years ago, when neuroin first hit the streets.
It was impure, not the engineered cocktail popular among the educated.
All of these kids were born with severe brain damage. Most died before age 12.
Those few who survived, they had a gift.
I call it a gift. For them, it was more like a cosmic joke.
They would wake up in the night, curled in the corner...
...screaming, clawing at the walls.
Because when these children closed their eyes at night...
...they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other.
It didn't take for us long to realize that the real nightmare was...
...that these dreams were about to come true, these murders were happening.
You say some of the children died?
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.
Or maybe because of what we did to them. But it doesn't matter.
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
I'm not going to commit murder.
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.
And yet a chain of events has started that will lead you to his murder.
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.
But occasionally...
...they do disagree.
What?
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs will see an event in the same way...
...but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the others.
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?
For Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.
Who wants a justice system that instills doubt?
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?
I'm saying that every so often, those accused of a Precrime...
...just might have an alternate future.
Does Burgess know about this, about this Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the parents of Precrime.
Parents often see their children as they want them to be and not as they are.
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew.
But at the time, we felt their existence was an insignificant variable.
Insignificant to you, maybe.
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?
You wanna bring it down.
You will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim.
That'll be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime didn't work.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.
Certainly not the attorney general, who wants it all for himself.
And not the young federal agent, who wants your job.
Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created.
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.
You said the Minority Report is destroyed.
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.
I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared.
What safe place is that?
The safest place there is.
Where is it?
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.
All you have to do is download it, darling.
That's all, huh?
Just walk into Precrime, get into the temple...
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs and download this Minority Report.
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane.
Or you think I am.
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...
...I'm sure that you know all sorts of people...
...who can help you out in this regard.
It's funny how all living organisms are alike.
When the chips are down, when the pressure is on...
...every creature on the face of the earth...
...is interested in one thing and one thing only:
Its own survival.
Find the Minority Report.
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
The female.
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...
...John is here, and this unidentified male, at the window.
The adjacent building suggests public housing, which means...
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another 22 hours.
This is Chief Anderton's space.
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.
I doubt that. I'm betting he's somewhere in the Sprawl.
He's smart enough to go where billboards can't ID him.
There's fewer consumers, which means fewer scanners.
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.
We concentrate on the Sprawl.
We do fly-overs in ships, with two spyder teams on the ground.
Thermal scan the entire area. Read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.
Where is she?
Started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and I knew that.
This damn cold.
Don't worry. I could cut open your chest and sew a dead cat in there...
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not with the antibios I'll shoot into you.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises?
Please, don't touch.
Because the scanners would read the new scar tissue, alarms will go off...
...and large men with guns will appear.
What was that?
What was that?
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?
You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.
Please, relax.
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have to remove your eyes completely.
I know.
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.
Whatever you say. It's your money.
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant, Miss Van Eyck.
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.
Okay.
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.
Tell you what, since we go way back...
...why don't I give you my old pal discount? What do you say?
You don't remember me, do you?
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.
From where? D.C.?
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.
You remember? Specialized in burn victims, mostly women.
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.
You made those tapes.
They were performance pieces.
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.
Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?
The future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think?
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.
She only has eyes for you.
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?
Let's say that I spent an awful lot of time in the prison library.
That was a great way to avoid the more unpleasant aspects of prison life.
Confinement was a real education, a real...
...eye-opener.
For true enlightenment, there's nothing quite like...
...well, let's say, taking a shower while this large fellow...
...with an attitude you can't knock down with a hammer...
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...
...and giving me the opportunity to get to know myself so much better.
And now to return the favor.
- This your work?
- Yes.
I like it.
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.
He's not here now, is he?
I had to ask.
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?
No, but I don't talk to John much anymore.
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the public pool.
You said in your divorce papers that John tried to kill himself.
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.
John was upset. He...
He took out his gun and watched home movies.
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?
You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Lamar thinks you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.
That's why I left him.
And now you can leave.
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.
Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the bathroom?
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.
The kitchen is your left.
Don't scratch. Never scratch!
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give you a bonus that may come in handy.
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.
People won't even recognize you.
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag, together with your...
...leftovers.
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings, you can remove the bandages and leave.
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.
Don't scratch.
A little something from a mutual friend of ours.
Don 't take the bandages off for 12 hours.
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.
How long can a whale hold its breath?
For about 20 minutes.
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.
We gotta beat the whale.
Here you go.
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.
- Ready?
- Give me the count.
Three, two, one, go!
Sean?
Sean?
Sean.
Have you seen...?
I'm looking for my son. Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit?
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan on all residences on North Powell.
You must really like me, don't you?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.
You're swell company.
It's not that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief, is it?
That you think I might, you know, futz with him?
No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.
Evanna, go.
I show 27 warm bodies.
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we are deploying spyders into your complex.
Mom, I'm scared.
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.
Stay still. Stay still.
Come on!
You stepped out on me for the last time.
I told you where I was.
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.
You're lucky we...
Leave me alone!
We lost one.
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping through a window.
It's an awful big cat.
Fletcher.
I'll go check it out.
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.
Keep your kids away from me.
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.
Be quiet and close the door.
We got an ID. It's not him.
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.
Fletcher, take a look.
There's four people in this room, not three.
Four? There's Anderton, Crow and the man in sunglasses.
The man in the sunglasses is outside the window.
There's also someone here in the mirror.
Definitely female.
The Precrime program began in 2046 with a federal grant.
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.
Why? Because Precrime works.
Precrime has eliminated the need for conventional detectives.
What happens now is the verification and protection of future victims.
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?
They have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...
...so as not to be distracted.
This display should give you some idea of what their daily life is like.
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.
That's more than Santa Claus gets.
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.
My mom's new boyfriend came over again last night.
He's just not very intelligent.
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.
Shit!
Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you?
- I like you.
So I don't wanna have to kick you or hit you.
But only if you promise to help me.
Hi, John.
Who does that look like to you?
I don't know.
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.
Can you see?
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!
Nobody fires a weapon inside the temple. Use bindfoam.
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?
So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?
They're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
They can't see murders anymore?
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...
...the one with the most talent.
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.
Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room, and we stop a murder.
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.
You cold? Can you understand me?
Are you cold? The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
- Is it now?
- What?
Is it now?
Yes, this is all happening right now.
I'm taking you some place in public...
...which means you need something else to wear.
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto, welcome back to the Gap.
How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you?
Mr. Yakamoto?
Miss Belfor, did you come back for another pair of those chammy lace-ups?
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.
It has to do with the information inside of Agatha.
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.
Your average consumer can't buy any of this stuff.
It's been assembled and scrounged from spare parts made to order.
Assuming Anderton ordered this, who put it together?
Who's Rufus T. Riley?
What's your pleasure? We got it all here: Sports fantasies...
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...
...which covers everything from bungee jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.
You can experience sex as a woman.
Women come in to get laid by their favorite soap star.
Or just some good, clean fun.
It's a big rush, but you come out without a heart attack.
I wanna kill my boss.
Okay.
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.
Yeah, being concertmaster for the Philadelphia Symphony...
...is a popular choice.
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.
You make this a terrible world to live in!
Detective, nice of you to come here, seeing how every cop is looking for you.
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...
...and you still have the time to slice off a little... jerky for yourself.
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.
You brought a Pre-Cog here.
Jesus Christ.
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.
No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin.
Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts.
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?
So I need you to hack into her.
I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.
You're gonna help me.
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see what's gonna happen to me.
And then we'll go.
- She works.
- Slow it down.
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.
Yeah, recording.
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.
Goodbye, Crow.
Goodbye, Crow.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- What happened?
- I don't...
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.
Where's my Minority Report?
Do I even have one?
- Do I have one?
- No.
- What?
- No.
What?
Agatha? What? What?
- Can you see?
- See what?
Anne Lively.
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?
Yeah, but it's pouring out of her backwards.
I like my life. Everything's good.
They're inside.
Who?
All your old teammates.
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.
Negative!
- Negative!
- Negative!
I don't deserve that.
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.
Can you see the umbrella?
Take it.
Take it!
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.
Turn in here.
Let's go.
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.
Can you see the balloon man?
Wait.
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?
Wait. Wait.
Wait.
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.
Wait.
Thank you.
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.
He knows. Don't go home.
We've got eyes on.
They're working, but they're standing on it.
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?
Drop some money.
Can't you put it in my hand?
May the Lord bless you.
May God take care of you.
Damn!
That's the guy.
The man in the window.
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?
I mind.
How about now?
Help yourself.
He's here.
Anderton, leave.
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.
I can't. I have to find out what happened in my life.
Please.
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.
- What room is Crow in?
Come on.
Come on.
Wrong room.
Leave.
Leave.
Oh, God.
This is Sean.
My son.
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:
The first is what my son would look like if he were alive today...
...if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street.
And the second is what I would do to the man who took him.
You're right.
I'm not being set up.
You have to take me home.
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.
I don't have an alternate future.
I am going to kill this man.
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.
You still have a choice.
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?
Six years ago, Baltimore...
...you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool on the West End.
Did I? I don't remember anything about that place.
Who am I? Who am I?
Do you know who I am?
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!
Sean!
I told him I was a policeman and needed his help.
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.
He was happy. He was happy.
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.
He floated back up. I took him out.
I was gentle. I was gentle.
I was gentle.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.
How could you do that to my...?
You can choose.
You can choose.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...
...now and during any further questioning.
If you can't afford an attorney...
...we will appoint one.
Do you understand these rights?
You're not gonna kill me?
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?
If you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing.
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.
He? Who's he?
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.
He told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family would be cared for.
If you did what?
If you did what?
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?
If you killed my kid?
Look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing. Okay?
What about the pictures?
They're fake. He gave them to me.
Now, listen to me. You...
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?
I don't know.
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.
I tell you who, and my family gets nothing.
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun. It's okay.
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.
You're not gonna kill me.
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!
What's happening down there?
Murder!
Murder!
Doesn't make sense.
If you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out?
Anderton might have found them.
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.
This is an orgy of evidence.
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?
None.
This was all arranged.
Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment.
Sadly enough, this failure was human.
The protection team simply didn't get there in time.
But the murder itself happened exactly as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.
Today's event put a human face on the Precrime system.
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.
Lamar?
- What?
- There's something wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.
I don 't wanna say over the phone.
Meet me at Anderton 's.
We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room.
I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore.
Please, sir.
Tell me what you have.
This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively.
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.
Agatha's stream was missing.
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.
Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.
Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples.
Moving away from shore.
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.
Watch the water.
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.
This murder's taking place at two different times.
Anderton was watching this right before he was tagged.
He told me about the missing data stream.
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.
It was inside of Agatha.
So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs see the same murder more than once.
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.
We teach the techs to identify and disregard them.
Yeah, but what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo?
What if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?
I don't understand.
All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively...
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict, someone with nothing to lose.
Precrime stops the murder from taking place...
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...
...having reviewed the prevision and dressed in the same clothes...
...commits the murder in exactly the same way.
Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.
It'd have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place.
Someone fairly high-up.
Do you know what I hear?
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.
Do you know why?
Because right now, the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.
Can you see? It's beautiful.
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.
Is he there?
Is the Pre-Cog with him?
Keep them there. I'm on my way.
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.
I won't say a word.
You just don't let John leave, all right?
He's no killer, Lamar.
I know.
It's cold.
Lara, this is Agatha.
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?
He got so scared when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave.
I gotta sit down.
I gotta figure this out.
I gotta figure this out.
They used Sean.
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.
But he didn't.
He didn't.
Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her.
About who?
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?
Anne Lively.
Agatha.
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...
...they look on and help. "
Remember that, John.
Agatha.
Sean.
He's on the beach now...
...toe in the water.
He's asking you to come in with him.
He's been racing his mother up and down the sand.
There's so much love in this house.
He's 10 years old.
He's surrounded by animals.
He wants to be a vet.
You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox.
He's in high school.
He likes to run, like his father.
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.
He's 23.
He's at a university.
He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire.
He asks her to be his wife.
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.
He still runs...
...across the university and in the stadium, where John watches.
Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy.
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.
But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.
And the other man is so fast.
There was so much love in this house.
I want him back so bad.
So did she.
Can't you see?
She just wanted her little girl back.
But it was too late.
Her little girl was already gone.
She's still alive.
She didn't die.
But she's not alive.
Agatha?
Just tell me...
...who killed your mother?
Who killed Anne Lively?
I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna have to run again.
- What?
- Run!
I love you.
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.
- John, no.
- Don't talk.
John Anderton.
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...
...I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.
That's it.
That's my girl.
I was so worried about you.
Did he hurt you?
I missed you so much.
It's okay. Wally's here.
Wally's here.
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...
...that your life flashes before your eyes...
...that all your dreams come true.
This is all my fault.
There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you might want to have those.
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
You look great.
I knew he was having trouble for some time, yet I did nothing.
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.
But this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this.
This is John's legacy as much as it is my own.
Now I have an obligation to protect that.
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.
But maybe you can find some closure in the fact...
...that John finally found the man who killed your son.
Who's Anne Lively?
- Who?
- Anne Lively.
John was talking about her right before they took him.
I don't know who that is.
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?
- Sean.
- Yes.
He came here to work for you because he thought...
...if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening...
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.
Sir, they wanna start the press conference in two minutes.
Lara...
...John was the best cop I ever knew...
...and, in some ways, also the best man.
But the scars he carried around...
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.
And I'll have Gideon run the Containment files...
...see if anyone drowned a woman by the name of...
What did you say her name was?
Anne Lively.
But I never said she drowned.
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.
We'll talk about this later.
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.
I'd like a word with my husband.
You're not authorized.
How did you get in here?
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new National Precrime.
On behalf of your staff, we present you with this.
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.
How did you get this?
I padded your expense account for six months.
Revolvers like this one were given to generals...
...at the end of the Civil War by their troops.
The cylinders were loaded with five gold-plated bullets...
...to symbolize the end of the destruction and death...
...that had ripped the country apart for five years.
Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national...
...maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us...
...will have to discharge another firearm ever again.
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.
Does this mean we can finally use the lake house on weekends?
Hello.
Yes. Right away.
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Sir?
- Yes.
Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line.
Yes, this is Burgess.
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.
You created a world without murder.
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?
All you had to do was kill someone to do it.
A-room. Jad.
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.
- What are you talking about?
- Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.
Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up, but surprise!
She cleaned herself up, and she wanted her daughter back.
She wanted Agatha.
Jad, you getting this? It's from the female only. No time or incident data.
It isn't the future.
It already happened.
And the problem was, without Agatha, there was no Precrime.
She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.
You wouldn't be where you are now, standing there, signing autographs.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.
Slow down.
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, which presented a problem:
How can you kill her without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?
Simple. Use a system you control against her.
You hired someone to kill her, knowing the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake...
...with the promise of reuniting her with her daughter.
Where's my daughter?
Where?
Run!
Run!
When you were all alone, you killed her yourself...
...in the same way the Pre-Cogs predicted your John Doe would kill her.
You made the real murder look like an echo...
...knowing the tech would do what he was trained to do: Disregard it.
Anne Lively became just another missing person.
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?
What are you gonna do?
We got a Red Ball!
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.
Don't you ever say his name!
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.
You knew that would drive me to murder.
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?
Forgive me, John.
Forgive me, John.
Lamar.
It's over.
The question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now?
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
You see the dilemma, don't you?
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were wrong and Precrime is over.
If you do kill me, you go away...
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.
So, what are you gonna do now?
What's it worth?
Just one more murder.
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime.
All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would.
Except...
...you know your own future...
...which means you can change it if you want to.
You still have a choice, Lamar.
Like I did.
Yes, I have a choice...
...and I made it.
Forgive me, John.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, my boy.
Lamar!
In 2054, the six-year Precrime experiment was abandoned.
All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released...
...although police departments kept watch on many of them for years.
Agatha and the twins...
...were transferred to an undisclosed location...
...a place where they could find relief from their gifts...
...a place where they could live out their lives in peace.
Always late
With your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darlin'
And stay?
Always late
With your kisses
Why, oh, why do you want to do me this way?
How long do you think
I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late
With your kisses
Why, why, why do you want to do me this way?
That was Lefty Frizzell's
"Always Late with Your Kisses."
Before that, we heard Buck Owens.
Get your waders out.
It's seven days before the state officially drowns Northfork.
It's sunny skies with the highs being 51...
"T o the loving O'Brien family.
"lt has been brought to our attention
"that the remains of a Mrs. Patricia O'Brien
"have yet to be excavated.
Please make arrangements immediately."
The hardworking citizens of Northfork will be able to have their much-needed power... as well as... the pleasure of the recreation that this body of water will provide.
Let me add this: the good people of Northfork will be able to have their cake and eat it, too.
Two, three...
Where are we going to start-- right in here?
Where should we start?
Let's start right in here.
Then the water shall become a flood and destroy all flesh... and the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, and I will remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature... of all flesh that is upon the earth.
And that's what we have here.
Our town is dying.
I have seen the concrete monument... the headstone for the town for Northfork.
This dam gate will close... the water will rise over the plains, and cover our businesses... our homes... and our well-being.
We have lost Northfork.
We will be losing our dear son... but we will gain the hope, the courage... to move to a higher ground.
We're all angels.
It is what we do with our wings that separates us.
What are we waiting for?
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield.
Father, his health isn't getting any better.
Rose has had to stay by his bed.
All the doctors have left Northfork.
You're returning him then?
He's a very ill child.
We cannot make the journey with him in this condition.
We apologize, Father.
We appreciate your honesty, and will ask for forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
Let's be honest, Father.
You gave us a sick child.
I gave you an angel.
You're misunderstanding us.
We love lrwin.
Halo Home is deeply regretful about the grief
Irwin has brought to your family.
God bless.
Have a nice journey.
This is wrong.
This is just downright wrong.
When did you get this letter?
I received the final notice yesterday.
I don't like this damned cake.
This is wrong on every level.
Yeah.
Where did my parents go?
We don't want to go where they're going.
You rest now.
Father, everybody's leaving.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Oh, let's stay here.
Huh?
You're the caretaker?
Yes?
Cookie takes care of the yard.
Maybe you can help me?
Who are you looking for?
A relative.
Hold still.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis,
Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Marvin, Matt.
Marvin, Matt, Walter,
Willis.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Anybody voted for him voted themselves right out of Northfork.
Have a good journey.
Nice concrete cork.
I have done countless evacs.
And as long as
I've been doing this job, it is never come down to 48 hours before.
That's two days, and by the time I'm through with you, it's gonna be 47.
So you'd better listen up.
And remember one very important thing.
Despite the tertiary inconveniences we're putting these people through, we're giving them new power.
All right.
Matt...
Marvin.
Please go pay a visit to the Youngs.
Eddie, Arnold.
Arnold.
I want you to get down to Hungry Horse Road, and I want you to nail Jigger, do you understand?
You betcha.
Now, you can't go into this treating it like you're throwing out homesteaders, poor old homesteaders.
Look at it like you're saving some poor dumb son of a bitch from drowning.
Mr. Rudolph.
It says here that, uh, there has been some previous attempts at evacuation.
Walter,
Willis.
Stallings. Highway 93.
Remember, the one single most important thing: it is not our business to tell anybody else theirs.
You just come in like you're their guardian angel.
You give them wings and then you move 'em on up into higher ground.
Good luck now, gentlemen.
In the early 1800s,
European settlers named Northfork after the river that embraced their town.
Word traveled around the world that angels roamed these plains like bison. that angels roamed these plains like bison.
I find the humor quite parched.
19th century.
A remarkable piece.
Artist used the finest oils.
Organic pigments.
Magnificent.
The artist has a religious vocabulary.
He used the luxuriantly white wings of the swan.
Fascinating representation of the angelic messenger.
Lovely bird.
If I do recall correctly, the Celts employed the majestic swan as their sacred symbol and messenger to the other world.
Their link that existed between the realm of their gods and the realm of humans.
Very relatable.
I can only speculate... that the man with swan wings, or in this painting, the wild bird man, is a creation of the overtaking by Christianity.
Bless the imagination.
Walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk
-Just a closer walk with Thee
-It's wrong.
It's just downright wrong.
For Thou art strong
Departed.
Jesus keep me from all wrong
It's wrong, and I'm not gonna do it.
And neither should you.
It's death till you part.
She's your mother.
I'll be satisfied as long
-As I walk
-Let me walk close to Thee
-Departed.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee.
Have you ever smelled death?
I don't recall smelling it.
Death smells like nothing you've ever smelled in your life.
What does it smell like?
You know when you've smelled death.
'Cause when you smell it... you say to yourself, "Damn.
Something die?"
Anything?
Does it say anything about a child?
No. Not specifically.
There was a small child roaming the garden.
Oh, Flower, it said nothing about children.
Wait.
Narrator fluctuates between the first and third person.
Quite interesting.
I would have to say that he's above the age of a child.
Flower, every town you go scurrying off looking for offspring.
Wait.
Would you like a cup of tea?
One lump or two?
My name is Cup of Tea.
To my right, as you may already know, is Flower Hercules.
To my left, Cod.
And behind us all, but in front of you, Happy.
And you are?
Irwin.
Hello, lrwin.
And your surname?
Sir lrwin.
Well, Sir lrwin of Northfork, my family and I have traveled a long way, and we are having trouble finding a loved one.
Are you familiar with the unknown angel?
Yes.
Now... this is where we can be of help to each other.
What could we offer you?
When you leave, just take me with you.
No.
Never.
We do not take children.
Then I can't help you.
Now, Sir lrwin... you're being unreasonable.
Where we're going, we can't take you with us.
Then take me a thousand miles.
A thousand miles in anybody's book is a long way.
How about a hundred miles?
-A thousand.
-A thousand.
A thousand.
400, and that's it.
A thousand, and that's it.
Do you know how far that is?
A thousand miles is a far, far, faraway place.
500 miles.
A thousand.
All right.
We'll take you a thousand miles if you bring us the unknown angel.
In the morning?
Deal?
You the pain livin' of a heart full of shame
You broke the law...
Ursula.
-Of God and man
-You have two customers.
You stole from me the one whose ring was on my hand
I'd say that you...
But through that came livin' with a heart full of shame...
Oh, I tell you, these sons of bitches are harder to yank than a tick on the touch-hole of a chicken.
I hear ya.
Ursula...
Good morning.
You have six customers... now seated.
Well, if it ain't the bottom feeders.
Go ahead, Willis.
Eggs?
Bacon?
Mm-mm.
Sausage?
Mm-mm.
No meat?
Mm-mm.
Potatoes?
Mm-mm.
Soup.
Mm!
Uh-huh.
Chicken?
Mm-hmm.
Broth?
Cup or bowl?
Yeah!
Good work, boss.
Nice work, Walter.
Nice work, Walter.
Thank you, boys.
I'll have a bowl.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Okay.
Dent.
It's only dirt.
Afternoon, boys.
Good afternoon,
Father.
Walter.
Your wife, Patricia...
Henry...
Irwin's still sick.
I'm sorry, Father.
Mm...
Well, you got anything that'll keep his spirits up and his fever down?
If I was those parents,
I'd be ashamed.
Well, most parents can't see their child ill.
So they throw him in a lake.
All depends, Henry, on how you look at it.
Either you're halfway to heaven or halfway to hell.
Here we go, Father.
It's an antibiotic.
Inject five cc's of this into his arm.
Okay.
All right?
Bless you.
Have a safe journey.
Thank you, Father.
All right.
We thank you in advance and hope you have... a pleasant journey.
Pop?
Yeah, son?
You suppose he's got two of everything in there?
I suppose we'll find out.
Now, I don't care
If I'm not the first...
Damn it.
That you picked...
I know.
Darlin', I'll never ask...
Not one, but two Chevys.
Yesterday's gone...
I know.
...from now on
They heard of me...
This is going to be difficult.
...about the past
Yep.
Now I don't care if I'm...
Ever since we started moving folks out... we've never done well with people that owned Chevrolets.
...I'll be the last.
Matt...
...this country is being divided into two types of people--
Chevy people...
...and Ford people, Matt.
Yep.
Now, I don't care
If I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Now, I don't care...
Looks like he got some kind of hammer.
...that you picked
Darlin' I'll never ask...
No, it looks more like a...
I think he was holding a shotgun.
I think you're right.
Every town we come to, you want a child.
Once again, selfish.
How observant.
The noble Englishman.
How I longed to be Earl Grey.
The wit that got us here.
It's a splendid acquisition.
Unknown architect.
Probably owner-builder.
A true visionary,
I might add.
Jesus.
No, no, he was a carpenter.
We-we-we're searching for the unknown.
The unknown doesn't just come knocking on your door.
If it is unknown, how would you know if it did come knocking?
Well, it won't be in the shape of a child.
I would have to agree.
Happy.
Do you ever disagree?
I disagree with the Englishman's use of starch.
What do the Scriptures say?
"Temperature, 105 degrees.
High.
Please look after him when I leave."
What do you suppose we do?
We're going to wing it.
It appears they've... worn out their welcome.
Good afternoon, Mr. Stalling.
My name is Walter O'Brien.
This here's my son, Willis.
We're with the evacuation committee.
It's been brought to the state's attention that you are seeking some assistance.
I'm not going anywhere, son.
We're aware of that, sir, that's why the state has asked us to come to your aid.
The state understands your difficulty with moving on.
The state will not hurt, destroy, nor harm you physically in any way.
It is our civil duty to assist you in making this transition as easy and pleasant as possible.
Your agreement is this-- you will each be assigned
65 households to depart.
Having fulfilled said obligation, you will then each receive 1.5 acres of prime, lakefront property.
Your lot size will be increased by one fifth of an acre for every additional household that you assist in evacuating beyond the initial 65.
Have I made myself clear?
I will take your vacant stares as a yes.
I could live with an acre and a half.
Okay by me.
May we, sir?
So...
...the prodigal son returns.
Already packed.
A little ahead of yourself.
I've brought what you're looking for.
You have?
Outside.
I don't see anything.
We still have a deal?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have a deal.
Yeah, we still have a deal.
Where is it?
Oh, my.
Hello.
We'd appreciate it if you both would stop screwing around.
Well, what do you want to do?
The Youngs are going to have a moving sale.
Perfect.
Now, all I need is a pair of sinners like yourselves to mount up there now.
We appreciate very much your giving us this time to discuss this matter.
A pair of wives?
At least they're not mounted.
You know, it appears to me that you folks are preparing for a flood in Biblical proportions.
You got that right, son.
A flood is going to wipe through this place, cleansing the soil of all sin.
Understandable.
When God tells us to get a move on, we're gone at the first holler of a rooster.
We ain't needing the State to come in here and tell us when to pick up and get going.
That's God's doing.
This is God's land, and by God, we ain't movin' until we get that sign from above.
Yes, sir, uh... we aren't telling you to pick up and get going.
No, sir.
Look at us as your life preservers.
You can use us if you want, or not at all.
We give you that choice.
We're all in the same boat.
So, sir, if you don't mind, sir,
I'd like to bend you and your wives' ear a bit and tell you about the signs of God that we are familiar with.
This could be that sign.
A what?
He said he was a relative.
To us?
Yes.
You're the unknown angel?
Yes.
The one you're looking for.
Optimistic.
He is unknown.
The angel part's questionable.
Very.
How romantic.
There's a novel about you, too.
I started to collect these.
This is the first one I grew.
Now I'm not saying that this boat you have built isn't worthy.
From the looks of it, you've done a mighty fine job.
But for the sake of my job, let's just say it doesn't.
Doesn't what?
Your boat doesn't float.
Imagine this, if you will.
One day, a town on the plains, let's say Northfork, was hit by a catastrophic flood, similar to the days of Noah, and you husband and yourselves are standing out there on the roof waiting to be rescued.
A friendly neighbor comes paddling by in his little wooden boat, and he yells, "Hey, there,
Mr. and Mrs. Stalling,
"and... uh, Mrs. Stalling, jump on in and I'll take you to dry land."
What do you say?
I don't know.
The water's rising.
You shout back,
"No, thank you, thy friendly neighbor.
I'm waiting for a sign from God."
No, thank you.
I'm waiting for a sign from God.
Yes, exactly.
And your friendly neighbor paddles away.
A few days later a state rescue team comes by in a larger boat.
And let's just say me and Willis are on board.
And we offer you the same deal.
"Jump on in,
"and you, Mrs. Stalling and... Mrs. Stalling, will be saved."
And you say...
No, thank you.
We're waiting for a sign from God.
A few more days pass, and the water level has risen.
It has risen above the roof.
And unfortunately, you and Mr. Stalling have drowned and now are in heaven in front of God.
Dear, we died.
What about our belongings?
We died?
Oh, yes, you three have died because you waited for a sign from God and it never came, and you three died.
But why?
That's the exact question you would ask God.
You would say, "We waited for the sign and it never came."
And you and she... and Mr. Stalling... died.
Now what do you suppose
God is going to say to you both?
I don't know.
Mr. Stalling?
I'm dead, remember?
May l?
Yes.
I'll tell you what God will say.
"l sent you two boats...
"Two boats.
...to save your lives."
What more of a sign did you three want?
May l?
Fascinating.
You have a lovely collection of feathers.
Thank you.
And your halo.
Where's that?
They took it off when I was little.
I didn't need it anymore.
And these must be your wings.
Oh, mighty.
Look at this.
And where did we get this?
These are quite stunning.
The grace of God.
Yes, they are.
We're offering you a pair of something that only the man upstairs is willing to give you.
Where'd you get these boys?
Born and raised right here in Northfork.
Dear, what are you thinking?
I'm thinking, what bird suffered this?
Oh, there's nothing fowl about these wings.
I understand your initial doubt, but how many times have you seen wings of this size and beauty?
This is what most of us were shot with.
Tranquillity at its finest.
This could make an elephant fly.
It stuck in me right here.
May I look?
Appears to be lengthy needle of some sort.
Five years, maybe six years of age.
Used numerous times for injection.
You were shot with this rifle?
Yes.
I was running with my flock and they shot me.
You were running with your flock?
Yes.
Flock of what?
Doves? Geese? Seagulls?
Angels.
Angel wings, huh?
I'm here to tell you these wings is worthless.
And to remove all doubt, we included this certificate of authenticity.
Signed, sealed and blessed by your own Father Harlan.
"Found near the glaciers, these wings, blah, blah, blah."
From what they could tell, this particular pair were detached from a juvenile who probably strayed from the flock.
"Perhaps no wiser than four years of age.
"The abbreviated wingspan reveals to us
"that he weighed no more than 25 to 30 pounds before they were removed."
A bit too disturbing for me.
Happy... are you looking at this?
Would you say amputated?
Yes. Amputated.
Fascinating.
Angel. Huh.
Aren't we all?
I'd say quite the opposite.
Probably a little devil, and daddy gave him a good strapping.
There's a back story for you.
Does this cause any pain?
No.
This would be recognized as a highly dangerous procedure without anesthesia.
Some people would just bite a bullet.
A highly skilled surgeon was overly concerned with muscle stabilization.
There's no evidence of curvature of the spine.
You're discovering feathers in this area?
Yes.
What time of day?
Morning.
Can you run your fingers through his hair?
What can you tell us about your relatives?
My mother and father were
12th generation angels.
My great grandpa and grandma had wings the size of bombers and would glide the plains of Northfork.
Come on, you ladies, can't you just smell the bird shit?
I mean, I'd like to believe these wings is authentic, but the feathers, they ain't attached to anything.
You take those moose antlers back there.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, it's a fine set of antlers, but it's more than just a rack of horns attached to a piece of board.
That wouldn't be enough.
It's an okay place to hang your hat, but there ain't no pride in it.
What you need is the whole head hanging up there.
And these marble eyes just a-staring on down at you.
Then you know you've got something really worth having.
We're still not leaving.
I've got a thousand-dollar check from the state, or would you rather use that for your funeral services?
No.
Then you best get the hell out of here right now.
Use these to fly the hell out of here.
Wow.
Eddie. Hey, Eddie.
I think Jigger's asleep.
Let's go.
Jesus Christ.
The scars on his forehead tell me he did have a halo.
Most likely metal.
To stabilize his...
Oh.
Everything all right?
Dankish, beetle-headed foot-licker.
What is wrong with you?
Happy?
You should be asking yourself that question.
Fired from a long barrel rifle.
Ten feet away.
Needle meant to penetrate two to three inches of skin.
Perhaps the hide of a herbivore.
Beast of a hallucinogenic.
Would you like a cup of tea?
This isn't tea time.
Given my weight, calculated dosage... this could be a lengthy trip.
Moist.
Mother... may l?
No.
Yes.
Plenty more where that came from.
Here.
Shoot me, shoot Cod.
And then shoot yourself in the foot.
No!
You saucy, sheep-biting, flat-mouthed dewberry.
This could be a family...
Oh.
Santa's everywhere.
I'm happy.
This should back off some evil spirits.
Hmm?
Oh.
Hmm.
Two out of three ain't that bad.
Damn it. I say we hook that thing up to our bumper and drag it out ourselves.
What are you talking about,
Willis?
You know why?
I'll tell you why.
That there was number
I know that, Willis.
I'm marking them down as departed.
We can't.
The state makes their final pass-through, and they find that Mr. Stalling locked up in that boat with his moosehead.
It's our butt.
It's our job to move them out of Northfork.
It's not our job to know where they go.
Willis... it's our job to move people, not change their beliefs.
What more could we have said?
Without the proper words, this is just a man, nailed to two pieces of wood.
Oh, he's cute.
Father?
Yes, son.
I don't think they want me.
Oh, no, they do.
They do, son.
They came a long way for you.
Then, can I go with them?
I will still have to speak with them.
Then, can you tell them I'm an angel?
I will.
I will.
Because I want them to see my wings.
Do you have wings?
Yeah? Me, too.
But mine got old and fell off.
You get some sleep now.
All right.
Mr. and Mrs. Hope?
Yes.
I'm Father Harlan.
Father.
Thank you for coming on short notice.
Irwin is a good boy.
I could go on, but that would seem like I'm selling him to you.
And I'm not.
What?
You're not...
Well, given the chance,
I'm sure lrwin would do a better job at selling himself...
-Oh.
-than me.
Can we meet him?
Unfortunately... you will have to make a decision before you can meet him.
But, Father, it says right here that we can spend the afternoon with him.
Yes, I know. I...
I'm sorry. I apologize.
But lrwin is a fragile boy.
I can't let him get his hopes up too high only to have them diminished.
His health can't afford that kind of a disappointment.
Oh, Father, we can't make a decision based upon viewing him from a window.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you go wait in the car?
Father, we come here attempting to adopt a child, and you turn it into window shopping.
He's not a puppy.
Oh.
Well, maybe that's what you and your wife should be considering.
I'm sorry if I have wasted your time.
Have a pleasant journey.
Many townspeople have speculated that the body of Jimmy Miller, son of Doris and James Miller, still lays in the Northfork dam.
One worker has said,
"There is a slight lump in the interior wall that will hold back
19 million acres of water."
Another worker said,
"Yes, Jimmy is in there.
"They never could retrieve him from the dam.
He is resting in peace."
Tom Johnson, a fisherman, put it this way,
"Heck, you can't exactly troll a hundred feet of just-poured concrete fishing for a body."
Marvin. Matt.
Walter. Willis.
Tours of the Northfork dam, and possibly Jimmy Miller, will be starting in January.
For more information, please contact Montana's
Water and Power.
Somebody is laying there.
You feel a heartbeat?
No.
You can figure... a death of a person is still considered progress.
Son of a bitch is getting the biggest headstone this side of Rushmore.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
65 residents departed.
Good job.
You sign on that bottom line,
1.5 acres will be transferred into your name.
Hmm.
Well, your log reads
64 residents departed.
Is this correct?
Well, sir...
Yes, sir, it is.
Well, you know what?
I'd like to thank you personally for your hard work and dedication in the evacuation of Northfork, and hope to see you boys out there enjoying the lake.
Wait a minute.
That's it?
We get nothing?
That's correct.
Sir, there... there is another house that we did not confirm their departure.
Well, then, you best go out there and get it confirmed, huh?
Duck.
Duck.
Goose.
Boy was a tad pigeon-toed.
What do you think?
For most, Vincent Van Gogh was a fine artist.
To some, he lacked technique.
Paint straight from the tube, very heavy-handed.
How Van Gogh cut off his ear is what is most intriguing to folks.
In each piece I've ever appraised, the story is always more fascinating than the actual piece itself.
And?
It's a fantastic yarn the boy has spun.
Unfortunately... the story is more valuable than the actual piece.
What about his collection of feathers?
Perhaps... from the stork that dropped him.
Feathers are inconsistent.
I couldn't find any connection in the scriptures.
And that spleeny ill-nurtured gnat.
Are you positive?
Oh, Flower, please, be open to inconsistency.
What did the feathers come in?
A book.
The book was in a pillowcase.
I presume that the pillow that the boy
Iays his head on is stuffed with feathers.
He is not what we are here for.
La Fleur was touched by an angel.
Is it snowing?
Can I go?
You're not mine anymore
This is it, son.
Looks pretty vacant.
Indeed it does.
If you don't ever change your mind
Trick or treat.
Smells like something died in here.
That is precisely why we're not going to get mother.
Willis, you smell that?
Yeah, it smells like something died.
Go upstairs and check all the rooms.
Then we'll leave.
What?
You're kidding.
You go upstairs and check everything out.
Willis, go upstairs, and see if anyone is up there.
I'm personally not ready to face death.
This is number 65.
Go upstairs, check it out, and let's get this over with.
I'm checking out the other side.
Willis.
Willis!
Hello?
Hello there.
Pop.
Pop!
Do you see anything?
No.
Come on. Jump.
It's about five feet, come on.
You can make it.
Jump.
Come on.
Pop, come on, jump!
You can make it. Come on.
Are you okay?
Would you like a cup of tea?
I would qualify this in the area of concussion.
A frothy, clay-brained snapper.
Let's help you get up onto your feet.
Definitely going to feel that in the morning.
Willis, let's go.
Did you see anyone?
Nope.
Come on!
Come on!
Get in the car!
Get!
What's got you so spooked?
If you don't ever change your mind
To take me back again
Grab the book.
Pop...
Just do it!
Mark them down as evacs.
Evacuated.
Do it!
Okay, I will.
Since the day you say we're through
I'm even more in love with you
And it's my fault that you're not mine anymore
And I think we should go get your mom.
These have the same texture as the feathers that were in the boy's book.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
No more than four years of age.
Weighed no more than 30 pounds.
These were attached to something very young...
I'm going to have to evaluate the other side.
Fascinating.
Oh, Lord...
Let the holy angels come to lrwin.
And carry him to your heavenly city.
Free his spirit... from the prison of his body.
Fascinating.
No.
Please, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm a man of faith.
Forgiveness is my job.
But right now,
I can't forgive my faith.
Hmm.
Here.
He grew two inches this summer.
-Pop.
Still stacking wood?
Yep.
Pop?
Yeah?
You're not even close to what death smells like.
I'm sorry.
I'm coming to get you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't forget you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Pop.
Come here.
What?
Can you see?
What?
Look closer.
No, I can't see anything.
What am I looking for?
There's a nick in my paint.
There's a nick in my paint!
Don't make it worse.
-Don't make it worse.
-It's only dirt.
I was rubbing it off.
-What color is dirt?
-Brown?
If Marvin weren't blind, he would see that it was gray-- the color underneath my paint.
Willis, the speck is brown.
Look.
Brown after Marvin's filthy hands rubbed it.
Well, I can't see how you'd think you could keep your car perfect the way you drive anyway.
It hurts.
The first one... hurts.
You just never know when it's going to come.
You know, that's fate for you.
A little rock.
You do not have a say in the matter.
Now that you've gotten the first one...
...the rest comes easy.
You spend all your time... polishing your car, making everything perfect.
Then this rock... flies out of nowhere, and puts all your hard work to shame.
Nothing you can do about it.
Absolutely nothing.
-Holy cow.
-Oh, my God.
...into the hole... take that...
...soft, so when you get down in there, you just thread this rope through the top handle.
What?
You jump down there and do it.
-Willis.
-No more. No, no, no, no.
This is downright wrong.
Once something's buried, it should stay buried.
I can't show no more respect.
You know, when this small town becomes the biggest lake this side of the Mississippi, your mother will be the catch of the day!
Then throw some rocks on her.
That should keep her down.
Where you going to take her?
What about California?
What's there?
I heard in California they're serving cheeseburgers and a soda in less than two minutes flat.
Wow...
That's fast food.
I know you've been praying.
Not to worry.
A family will come soon.
You may be an orphan... but you're still a child of God.
We must go get him, Flower.
If I didn't know your voice,
I would think it was my subconscious.
Could he be?
He is.
You don't want to believe him, do you?
You do?
He's just a child.
I can't accept that.
Yes,
I know.
We can't.
We have to.
You have to.
Don't let your motherly nature cost you your manhood.
He prayed for us.
1.5 acres of lakefront property.
Hmm.
Northern Pike?
Might be.
Pike's not a fish.
It's a dog.
Skull full of teeth.
Pick those suckers up by their eye sockets.
Weapons of massive destruction.
They drop that pike's milt into this lake.
You can forget all about the fish
Iiving in peace and harmony.
Pike eat their children.
What they should do is introduce a nice game fish
Iike the Muskie.
Now, that's a fine species.
-Mm.
-No fish from Minnesota should be allowed to swim past the Missouri.
The fine citizens of Northfork knew that Muskie was swimming through their houses, we would've never been able to get 'em to leave.
Canada ought to claim that bug-heap they call Minnesota.
Throw in Wisconsin for free.
You have to think that this must have been his last day on the job.
You ready?
1,000 miles?
Farther.
You're a relative.
Hercules... the strongest man ever to wear a skirt.
Are you going to be my mother or my father?
I'm both.
Considered the perfect soul,
I search for no one, and no one looks for me.
Whatever
I need I look within myself to find.
I am complete.
I am not king nor queen, yet I am both.
A mother and a father.
You prayed to be this way?
Isn't that what Father Harlan says?
"Pray and you shall receive?"
Would you like a cup of tea?
Irwin?
Well?
There you go, son.
And in that journey of dying, you see many things.
But all issues I had passed.
Because I was to be a witness.
A helper.
And that's the thing, I think, is important about death, is the ability for us to be witnesses.
Not only for our births of coming in, but going out.
And that's what we have here.
We've lost our town. It's gone.
But maybe there's a birth someplace else.
Maybe there's a blessing from that experience.
I'm no longer afraid of death, but it's a lesson that's taken me
60 years to learn.
As you stroll around Northfork, take your last walk down the dirt road that leads to where your house may have been, and look at the trees that you once climbed.
Smile, and remember those trees for what they will become: future snags for fishing tackle.
As you continue your walk, think to yourself,
"This is the only time
I will ever be able
"to walk on the bottom of a lake without having to hold my breath."
Remember when you leave to pack all your good memories.
No one else will pack them for you.
Good night to you all.
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
An instant of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
THE DEVI L'S BACKBONE
We'll be there soon.
What the...
It fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.
They came... they defused it... and they left it there.
Nobody can move it.
Follow me, please.
Carlos... wait for me here.
We won't be long.
Who are those people outside?
The caretaker and two men who help him.
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.
They're building a chicken coop.
What's going on out there?
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Domínguez again?
Yes. Ayala's wounded.
They're always in trouble.
They've brought another boy.
As if we didn't have enough already.
Let's go.
Are you a new kid?
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?
I'm Gálvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he sure sees a lot.
I'm Carlos.
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?
No, but I've got some comics and toys.
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.
I can barely feed the ones who are here. I'm sorry.
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.
Oh, no!
I'm the brave one.
Ricardo was a man of books, of ideas.
He decided to die and leave me here to defend his ideals.
The Nationalists will arrive any day and what will they find?
Reds looking after Reds' children.
Not to mention this!
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy... take the rest of the gold.
There are 10 ingots left.
At least you can buy guns.
I can't even buy bread with it.
- Take it away.
- We can't.
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.
The boy goes hungry here or gets killed out there.
Class time!
Come on!
Look, Owl, a comic book!
I'll swap you.
Look at this marble.
It's my favorite. It's from China.
Or look at this one.
Owl made it himself.
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.
Hey, you! That's mine!
- Are you here to stay?
- No.
Then why are you here?
I came with Mr. Ayala, my tutor.
- What's the hell's a tutor?
- He looks after me while my father's away.
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.
Take the comic from me.
Go on.
Take it away.
C'mon.
Carlos, look!
Mr. Ayala.
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!
Stay with him for a while.
He seems quite meek.
I'm sure you'll get along.
We'll have to fix it.
The Count of Monte Cristo.
Has Edmond Dantés broken out of prison yet?
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.
Why don't you read on, then tell me?
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.
She teaches math and reading.
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?
Her name is Carmen.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.
Why did they leave me here?
Why can't I be with my father?
Carlitos... you're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.
So be patient.
Your soap has to last you all year.
Be careful with it... or you'll be punished with two weeks of extra tasks.
You can play in the yard, but never inside the building.
This is your bed.
Number 12.
Why are there so many empty beds?
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...
For your locker.
Do you understand?
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.
See where they put the new kid?
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!
Pig and I think that even though you complain a lot... you're all right here.
Far away from the war, well hidden.
Well looked after.
- What could be better?
- Granada.
Why go to Granada?
We're getting married.
We'll buy a farm.
Sure.
Granada!
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?
I don't need anyone.
I've managed fine on my own so far...
Right.
And without parents.
- Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.
That's why they eat so well here... too much gold.
You don't believe me now, but you will.
I'll try these two tonight and let you know what happens.
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?
- No.
- All right, so long.
I don't like those two.
They make me sick.
This place makes me sick.
When I was a kid...
I'd stand here... in the middle of the yard... and I'd look up at the sky.
I dreamed of getting out of here.
I prayed to become rich... so I could buy this dump and tear it down.
Forget it now.
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.
Well, I'm glad you came back.
Let's go to my room.
It's getting cold.
San... ti...
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?
The fucking new kid spilled our water.
Come on.
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.
Isn't that off limits?
No one's ever been caught.
What about the "one who sighs"?
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?
Who's the "one who sighs"?
- You're chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.
You're a shit, a queer.
All right, I'll go.
But you're coming with me.
We'll each fill a jug.
But if you're scared...
They say she's switched off.
But I don't believe it.
Put your ear against her, you'll hear ticking.
That's her heart.
She's still alive.
And she knows we're here.
Hide!
That one.
C'mon.
See you outside.
"No one's ever been caught."
Bastard.
Shit!
Hello.
Who are you?
Do you live down here?
Many of you will die.
Jaime!
What are you up to?
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.
It flatters pity...
It flatters pity not to be able to hide.
Let your lips bear witness... to the blaze in your heart.
No one will believe the fire if the smoke sends no signals.
He who cares for his well-being keeps not his feelings silent.
My grief is greater than I.
And that being so... it will be easier... it will be easier... for it to defeat me... than for me to command it.
Consideration does not suffice to prevent the cry.
He is not a brave prisoner who dares not break down his jail."
A grain of strength.
Carlos, are you going to tell me who was with you last night?
He's not going to tell.
He'll squeal in the end.
Just wait and see.
You understand?
Then, for the last time... who was with you last night?
I was alone.
That boy won't talk.
If we want to know who was with him...
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.
Perfect.
Very well.
You may begin.
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.
They're ravenous.
Look at how they're eating.
The first one to look up from his plate is his accomplice.
Marcos, Gálvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here.
I knew you wouldn't squeal.
Dr. Casares tricked me.
Just what I said.
It isn't your fault we were punished.
- Dr. Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!
Careful.
Come on, Owl.
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!
Well, well!
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.
Are things that bad?
If the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...
Try it now.
I told you.
- Dance with me.
- No.
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.
I can't dance.
Ayala said so.
Catalonia is about to fall.
Then Madrid will fall, and then...
There's talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?
Yes.
Sometimes I think that we are the ghosts.
Gálvez... last night, you didn't shoot.
That's right.
- Wow, that's great!
- It's for you.
Why are they laughing?
Fuckers.
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.
England or France might still intervene.
That's just wishful thinking.
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.
No, I'm not like him.
Twenty years ago,
I found the place for me.
And I stayed.
That's all.
Look at it jump!
Where's the new kid?
Are you the "one who sighs"?
Do you live down there?
Listen.
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.
Ass-kisser!
Throw him down!
Go on!
He can't swim!
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!
There he is!
Grab him! Careful!
What's going on?
What have I told you?
And you, eh?
What the fuck are you doing down here?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.
Get out!
Out!
Say a word about this and I'll cut you in half.
Got that?
There you go.
Our Carlos has been here five minutes... and he's in trouble already.
Have you read any more of Monte Cristo?
Do you believe in ghosts?
There aren't any in the novel.
I think I saw one, here.
Carlos, as you can see...
I'm a man of science.
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.
Europe is sick with fear now, and fear sickens the soul.
And that, in turn, makes us see things.
In town... they call this...
"the devil's backbone."
They say a lot of things.
That this happens to children who shouldn't have been born.
"Nobody's children."
But that's a lie.
Poverty and disease.
That's all it is.
The liquid they're in is called "limbo water."
In the old days, it was made with various spices... cloves, rum.
So this is very, very old rum.
I sell it in town, and the money keeps the school going.
Do they drink it?
They say it helps to cure blindness, kidney ailments... and also, apparently... impotence.
Rubbish, but you know... after 60, men will pay anything just to...
You know.
So if you're going to believe in ghosts and all that rubbish... you should have a sip of this to heal your wound.
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?
Yes, of course.
And be more careful!
Calm down.
I'm not going to hit you.
So don't make any noise.
Carlos... get out your comics so we can look at them.
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.
Look.
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.
She's a looker!
Who drew this?
Her pussy's the wrong way round.
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you lot know?
Look, a slice of fig cake.
It's a bit squashed but it tastes good.
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.
All right.
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.
You're a real artist.
When I grow up,
I want to draw comics.
- Like mine?
- No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.
And big ships with lots of cannons.
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?
Did you hear that?
A sigh.
I didn't hear it.
I heard it too.
Don't kiss me.
Right, I forgot.
This is the last time.
"This is the last time."
Same old story.
Don't make any noise.
Scared the old man will hear?
I've never been scared.
I'm ashamed.
Yeah.
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.
He's a gentleman.
What a pity that isn't enough.
You need a hard cock as well.
And your husband and the doctor...
Tough luck.
The old man looks at you with love.
He did that even when your husband was alive.
I was 17.
By then, they took care of the poetry... and I of the flesh.
This leg...
I don't like to think about this leg.
It hurts.
Some days I can't bear it.
But I need it to stay on my feet.
I saw those lights again today
in the sky.
That's the war.
It'll never end.
The war's shit.
Well, I like it.
You like it, dickhead?
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.
My mother says... that the earth's so dry here and the air's so hot... that the dead get stuck halfway to heaven.
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs."
Not that again, you little shit!
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.
Since then, no one has dared takeJaime on.
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.
Shit, I'm telling the story.
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...
Santi got scared and ran away... and maybe some shepherds found him and he's alive.
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.
Yeah.
They sell the blood to rich people to cure their tuberculosis.
And where's the ghost?
It came with the bomb.
Maybe if you ask it...
Take that one.
Out of the way.
Put those in, but be careful!
Don't break them.
Miss.
Look, I found this.
I thought you'd like it.
Open the gate, Jaime.
It's lovely.
It may look like gold, but it isn't.
Well, for me, it is.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
What's that?
Kids' stuff.
Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?
- Gálvez?
- A pig.
Well, a boar.
Why not a giraffe?
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.
Very good.
Your tutor taught you that.
In those days, men had to act in groups.
No one could give up.
Imagine the death of a mammoth.
It must have been terrible.
A mammoth steak, great!
When you get to draw your comics...
I could help you write the stories.
I don't need anyone.
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?
Tomorrow, we'll continue with the second part of prehistory.
Leave your things in the dormitory.
Then it's recess.
Santi...
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.
Here you go.
There isn't much.
Hey, you! Bastards!
What's going on?
International Brigade.
Two Spaniards, six Canadians, one Chinaman.
What the fuck's a Chinaman doing in a Spanish war?
You, look at your damn feet!
Against the wall!
A friend of yours, Doc?
Bomb... if you're alive... tell me where Santi is.
Santi.
Talk to me.
I don't want anyone to die.
Many of you will die.
Please.
A grain of strength.
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.
I need to talk to you, but I don't want the boys to hear.
Things are very bad out there.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.
Go where?
To Marseille, with the Ricards.
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.
Fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!
I always thought there'd be an afterwards.
There is no afterwards!
Carmen, if anything happened to you...
Doctor.
The boys are waiting for your permission to have breakfast.
I'll need some papers.
But we'll go.
Boys, you may start.
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.
She's coming for me soon.
Last night I saw the "one who sighs."
Last night?
You're making it up.
It's Santi. I'm sure.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
What about me?
Fuck me, right?
That's good.
I want you to finish breakfast, but while you're doing so... listen very carefully because
I have to tell you something...
You may go, but the gold stays here.
The gold?
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.
What are you doing?
I hid you here so you wouldn't die outside with no one to mourn you.
Give me the key.
You know what?
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.
The lost one.
- A prince without a kingdom.
- Shut up!
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.
Will this weapon work?
You know that while you whisper sweet things to this old hag...
I'm the one who has to screw her?
And now... get out.
What did you see?
You know already.
I don't know anything.
Tell me.
Santi.
He's the "one who sighs."
He's dead, isn't he?
Come on, boys.
Conchita... would you bring me a few cans of gas for the journey?
Please, no!
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.
It'll be a long journey.
The older boys will have to look after the little ones.
If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.
What are you doing?
Are you all right, ma'am?
It's my bad leg.
It's heavier than ever.
Did you think someone would just give us a farm?
What are you doing with that?
You're crazy.
They're all inside.
You going to shoot me?
Please...
- What was that?
- The children!
Get them out!
It's going to blow up!
Get out! Outside!
Carmen?
Alma, leave it be, come on!
Get out! All of you!
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.
Don't move, don't look.
Is it bad?
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!
They won't have heard the explosion in town.
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.
If I walk all night,
I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.
I've...
I've got something to tell you.
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.
I couldn't...
I can't hear you.
So, please...
This time... let me do the talking.
- I've learned a new poem.
- Yes.
A poem.
"Stay by my side as my light grows dim... as my blood slows down... and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain... as my heart grows weak... and the wheels of my being turn slowly.
Stay by my side... as my fragile body is racked by pain... which verges on truth... and manic time... continues scattering dust... and furious life bursts out in flames.
Stay by my side... as I fade... so you can point to the end of my struggle... and the twilight... of eternal days... at the low, dark edge of life."
Miss.
A grain of strength.
Carlos, look.
Dr. Casares.
That son of a bitch.
I should have killed him when I had the chance.
But he'll be back.
And I'll be here... waiting for him.
Carlitos... bring me my records, my music.
I need them.
All right?
Are you hungry?
"Eat beans, good for the heart.
The more you eat, the more you fart."
My stomach's all upset.
But the little ones might be hungry.
Could you kill someone?
I could.
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.
But I didn't kill him.
- I thought...
- I was with him.
I saw everything.
It started in the pit.
I dared him to come down with me at night to gather slugs.
Run, Jaime.
Jacinto's here.
- What did you see?
- Nothing.
- Did you see the safe?
- No.
Did you see the safe?
Why the fuck are you in here?
Who was with you?
Get up.
Get up.
I was a coward.
I was always afraid ofJacinto.
Very afraid.
But not anymore.
The next time I see him...
I know I'm going to kill him.
Look who's here.
Let's see how he handles her.
Say you're sorry and get in the car.
I'm not scared of you.
You're making me look like a fool.
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at us.
I'm not afraid of you.
Say you're sorry.
You're an animal.
Doctor, I did what you told me.
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.
Conchita.
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming, Doctor!
Help me on my feet.
Jaime, put on the record.
Turn the horn towards the window.
Didn't you say he was dead?
Bastard!
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.
They're leaving!
All my life
I've always stopped short... left things unfinished.
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.
I will never leave this place.
We'll wait for you upstairs.
I'm not going to run away.
I want to talk to you.
Nothing.
They must have driven on.
Tell me, what do you want?
Jacinto.
Bring him to me.
I understand.
I'm going to help you.
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!
I had to break the old man's fingers.
Even dead, he's stubborn.
Hurry up! Come on!
There's something here!
Marcelo! Out of the way!
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.
This is yours, isn't it?
We have to get out of here.
One of us has to climb through the window.
And then open the door.
And what then?
What's wrong?
You scared?
Yes, I am, asshole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.
You're not bleeding.
You're not even hurt.
Santi is dead.
Jacinto killed him.
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.
Do you want to sit and wait?
You think he'll let us go?
That it'll all work out if we behave?
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.
Yes, but there's more of us.
Wait!
Wait.
Check if they're still working.
- Go on.
- All right.
Gálvez, did you hurt yourself?
A bit.
Fuck! Look again!
There's nothing here but souvenirs, photographs! Just crap!
One of us has to go out and get Gálvez.
- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.
No, not you. I'll go.
I'm skinnier.
Who opened it?
Dr. Casares opened the door.
He said I'd be all right, and that we should be brave.
There's no fucking gold here!
You hear me?
You and your fancy ideas!
Fuck!
Gold, gold... My ass!
My father.
He was from Calanda.
He was an accountant.
Quite elegant. Look.
My mother was from Toledo.
And that's me.
It's blurred 'cause I moved.
But that's me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal could put us up?
We don't have much time.
"How lonely, the prince without a kingdom... the man without warmth.
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga."
I saw that gold.
It's here.
We just have to look for it.
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?
We're at war.
A drop in the ocean.
Look, Jacinto.
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.
I'll need a hand.
Come on, Pig.
You're crazy, asshole!
Fuck you!
No, fuck you!
It's all for me.
Son of a bitch!
What a joke!
Gálvez, you go over there.
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!
Santi...
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
A moment of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect
trapped in amber.
A ghost.
That's what I am.
TO MY PARENTS
Mutation: It is the key to our evolution.
It has enabled us to evolve into the dominant species on the planet.
This process normally takes thousands and thousands of years.
But every few hundred millennia, evolution leaps forward.
Niagara Falls, up the Canadian Rockies, and then it's only a few hundred miles to Anchorage.
- Won't it kinda be cold?
- Well, that's the point, stupid.
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.
And when are you gonna do this?
I don't know.
After high school. Before college.
- Marie!
- I don't know what happened.
- David?
- I don't know... I just touched him.
- I didn't mean...
- Call an ambulance!
We only touched. Just get away from me!
- Will you call an ambulance?!
- Don't touch me!
We are now seeing the beginnings of another stage of human evolution.
These mutations manifest at puberty, often triggered by periods of emotional stress.
Thank you, Miss Grey.
It was quite educational.
However, it fails to address the issue that is the focus of this hearing.
Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong person driving a car can be dangerous.
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.
Senator, mutants who've come forward and revealed themselves publicly have been met with fear, hostility, even violence.
It is because of that hostility that I am urging the Senate to vote against mutant registration.
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?
What do mutants have to hide that makes them so afraid to identify themselves?
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.
I have here a list of names of identified mutants living right here in the United States.
- Senator Kelly...
- A girl in Illinois who walks through walls.
What's to stop her from walking into a bank vault? Or into the White House?
Or into their houses? And there are even rumours of mutants so powerful that they can enter our minds and control our thoughts, taking away our God-given free will.
The American people deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that mutants are very real.
And they are among us.
We must know who they are, and, above all, we must know what they can do.
Eric.
What are you doing here?
Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?
I've heard these arguments before.
It was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.
Yes... into us.
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?
I'm looking for hope.
I will bring you hope, old friend.
And I ask only one thing in return.
Don't get in my way.
We are the future, Charles, not them!
They no longer matter.
This is it.
Where are we? I thought you said you were gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.
This is Laughlin City.
Gentlemen, in all my years
I've never seen anything like this.
Are you gonna let this man walk away with your money?
No!
I'll fight him!
Ladies and gentlemen, our saviour!
Don't hit him in the balls.
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.
You idiot!
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's winner and still King of the Cage, the Wolverine.
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?
I'll have a beer.
Ellis Island, once the arrival point for American immigrants,
is opening its doors again.
Preparations are nearly completed for the United Nations World Summit.
The event promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history.
Leaders will discuss issues ranging from the world´s economy and weapons treaties,
to the mutant phenomenon and its impact on our world stage.
American legislators contend that debate over mutant issues
should be the primary focus of what is, on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.
No man takes a beating like that without a mark to show for it.
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- I know what you are.
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.
Look out!
Get outta my bar, freak!
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.
- I thought you might help me.
- Get out!
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.
- I saved your life!
- No, you didn't.
You don't have anything to eat, do you?
I'm Rogue.
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?
- Wow!
- What?
- Suddenly my life isn't bad.
- If you prefer the road...
No! It looks great.
It looks cosy.
Put your hands on the heater.
- I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- It's nothing personal.
It's just when people touch my skin, something happens.
What?
I don't know. They just get hurt.
Fair enough.
When they come out, does it hurt?
Every time.
So what kind of a name is Rogue?
I don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?
My name's Logan.
Marie.
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, I don't need advice on...
You all right?
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!
Weren't you supposed to bring someone back with you?
- What happened?
- They knew.
Charles...
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.
I have made the first move.
That is all they know.
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.
Where's he going?
Where are you going?
Over here!
- Where are you going?
- This way!
He's over there.
Let go! What's your hurry?
Over here!
Good morning, Logan.
So, I'd like your definitions of weak and strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.
That'll be all.
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.
Physics.
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.
You were attacked. My people brought you here for medical attention.
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.
Really?
Ah. Logan, I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.
They saved your life.
I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.
You're in my school for the gifted. For mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant, who believes a war is brewing between mutants and the rest of humanity.
I've been following his activities for some time.
The man who attacked you is an associate of his called Sabretooth.
Sabretooth?
Storm.
What do they call you? Wheels?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
And Cyclops, right?
You wanna get outta my way?
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?
Living from day to day, moving from place to place, with no memory of who or what you are.
Shut up!
Give me a chance.
I may be able to help you find some answers.
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?
Over here!
What is this place?
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence against the world's hostility.
Hey, no powers!
To the public, we're merely a school for gifted youngsters.
Cyclops, Storm and Jean were some of my first students.
I protected them, taught them to control their powers and, in time, teach others to do the same.
The students are mostly runaways - frightened, alone.
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger to themselves and those around them.
Like your friend Rogue.
Incapable of physical human contact, probably for the rest of her life.
And yet here she is with others her own age, learning, being accepted, not feared.
- John!
- Sorry.
I'm Bobby.
- What's your name?
- Rogue.
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.
Rejoin the world as an educated young woman, or stay on to teach others.
To become what the children have affectionately called "X-Men".
Welcome to Mutant High.
But the school is merely our public face.
The lower levels, however, are an entirely different matter.
When I was a boy I discovered I had the power to control people's minds.
Make them think or do whatever I wanted.
When I was 17
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.
He, too, had an unusual power. He could create magnetic fields and control metal.
Believing that humanity would never accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.
He became Magneto.
There are mutants out there with incredible powers, Logan.
And many who do not share my respect for mankind.
If no one is equipped to oppose them, humanity's days could be over.
I'll make a deal with you.
Give me 48 hours to find out what Magneto wants with you, and I give you my word that I will use all my power to help you piece together what you've lost, and what you're looking for.
Senator, you favour gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children possess more than 10 times the destructive force of any handgun.
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.
Well, that's fair enough. All right.
So?
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.
Let the rest of the damn world deal with mutants in their own way.
You know this situation? These mutants?
People like this Jean Grey?
If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.
It's a war.
It's the reason people like me exist.
Where the hell are we?
Pilot!
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.
I'm sorry.
- For what?
- If I hurt you.
So... couldn't wait to get my shirt off again, huh?
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.
Supposedly indestructible. It's been surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.
How could he have survived a procedure like that?
His mutation. He has uncharted regenerative capability which enables him to heal rapidly.
This also makes his age impossible to determine.
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.
Nor does he remember anything about his life before it happened.
Experimentation on mutants.
It's not unheard of.
But I've never seen anything like this before.
What do you think Magneto want with him?
I'm not entirely sure it's him Magneto wants.
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.
Just like you.
Who are you people? Where's Henry?
Mr Guyrich has been dead for some time, Senator.
But I've had Mystique here keep you company. She takes so many shapes.
Whatever you do to me, you'll make me right.
Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
It's such a strange phrase.
I've always thought of God as a teacher.
As a bringer of light, wisdom and understanding.
You see,
I think what you really are afraid of is me.
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.
It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand.
Well, don't fear God, Senator, and certainly don't fear me.
Not any more.
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.
I think you'll be comfortable here.
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?
Actually I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.
Really? What kinds of things?
All kinds of things.
- I also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.
I'm sure he is.
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- I doubt it.
What do you see?
Scott!
Good night, Logan.
You gonna tell me to stay away from your girl?
If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.
Then I guess you've got nothing to worry about, do you... Cyclops?
It mustjust burn you up that a boy like me saved your life, huh?
You oughta be careful.
I might not be there next time.
Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.
Logan?
Logan! Logan, wake up.
Help me!
Somebody, help!
Scott, grab a pillow.
It was an accident.
- Logan?
- What happened?
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone, she takes their energy, their life force.
In the case of mutants, she absorbs their gifts for a while.
In your case, your ability to heal.
- It felt like she almost killed me.
- If she'd held out any longer, she could have.
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.
What the hell have you done to me?
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?
Who would take you in, now you're one of us?
Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go!
I'm telling Mommy.
Is that a mutant?
...UN summit. With the leaders of over 200 nations attending,
the Secret Service has transformed
Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox
for tomorrow night´s opening gala.
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from...
Rogue!
Bobby!
Rogue, what did you do? They say you're stealing other mutants' powers.
No! I borrowed his power.
You never use your power against another mutant.
I had no choice.
- No, you have to understand...
- If I were you I'd get myself outta here.
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.
I think it'll be easier on your own.
You should go.
What are you looking for, Eric? It's strange.
There are more powerful mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.
- How could you tell?
- Well, I am psychic, you know.
- Where is she?
- Who?
Rogue.
She's gone.
Welcome, Professor.
Welcome to Cerebro.
This certainly is a big, round room.
The brain waves of mutants are different from average humans.
This device amplifies my power, allowing me to locate mutants across great distances.
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?
I've been trying, but he's found some way to shield himself from it.
How would he know how to do that?
Because he helped me build it.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Have you ever?
Used Cerebro?
No.
It takes a degree of control and... for someone like me, it's...
Dangerous.
...now boarding at track 4.
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?
A few miles west of here. You can't leave the mansion. It's the opportunity Magneto needs.
- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.
She's all right. She's just upset.
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?
Hey, kid.
I'm sorry about last night.
Me, too.
You running again?
I heard the professor was mad at me.
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.
You look around,
I'll check with the ticket agent.
Welcome, Professor.
- You think I should go back.
- I think you should follow your instincts.
The first boy I ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks.
I can still feel him inside my head.
And it's the same with you.
There's not many people that'll understand what you're going through.
But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.
And that's a rare thing.
For people like us.
OK, so...
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?
Come on, I'll take care of you.
- You promise?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I promise.
Come along now. I told you not to...
She's about 17, my height, has brown hair and she...
Scream for me.
Quit playing around.
You must be Wolverine.
That remarkable metal doesn't run through your entire body, does it?
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!
Whoever said I wanted you?
Young people!
All right, hold it! Hold it right there.
Stay where you are.
Put your hands over your heads. Now!
You Homo sapiens and your guns.
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.
Why not come out where I can see you,
Charles?
What do you want her for?
Can't you read my mind?
What now? Save the girl?
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?
Let them pass that law and they'll have you in chains with a number on your forehead.
- It won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.
No? Then release me.
Fine!
Care to press your luck, Charles?
I don't think I can stop them all.
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.
Goodbye, Charles.
- You said he wanted me.
- I made a terrible mistake.
His helmet was somehow designed to block my telepathy.
Couldn't see what he was after till it was too late.
- Where are you going?
- To find her.
- How?
- The traditional way: Look.
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?
- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight with us.
Fight with you? Join the team? Be an X-Man?
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.
The world is full of people that hate and fear you and you're wasting your time trying to protect them. I got better things to do.
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.
I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.
Senator Kelly.
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.
I was afraid if I went to hospital, they would...
Treat you like a mutant?
We're not what you think. Not all of us.
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.
Senator...
I want you to try and relax.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Welcome to the future.
Brother.
The machine emits radiation that triggers mutation in ordinary human beings.
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?
There appears to be none. But I fear it will harm any normal person exposed to it.
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.
Wait a second. You said this machine draws its power from Magneto.
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue and use her to power the machine.
Is somebody there?
Yes. I'm here.
Please don't leave me!
I don't want to be alone.
All right.
Do you hate normal people?
Sometimes.
Why?
I suppose...
I'm afraid of them.
Well...
I think you've got one less person... to be afraid of.
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...
I wasn't the one who gave the station a new sunroof, pal.
No, you were the one who stabbed Rogue in the chest.
Why don't you take your little mission and stick it up...
Senator Kelly is dead.
I'm going to find her.
Settle this.
I'm sorry.
You can still hear me... can't you?
You've taught me everything in my life that was ever worth knowing.
And if anything happens...
I'll take care of them.
Jean?
Jean!
No!
Jean?
Jean.
Answer me. Please.
I know where Magneto's going.
Magnificent, isn't she?
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.
America was going to be the land of tolerance. Of peace.
Are you going to kill me?
Yes.
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.
There is no peace, not here or anywhere else.
Whole families destroyed simply because they were born different from those in power.
Well, after tonight, the world's powerful will be just like us.
They will return home as brothers.
As mutants.
Our cause will be theirs.
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.
I'll understand if that comes as small consolation.
Put her in the machine.
I'll raise it.
Magneto is here - Liberty Island.
Presumably his objective is to mutate the world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.
He doesn't know his machine kills, and judging from what the professor saw if Magneto gave Rogue enough power, he could wipe out everyone in New York City.
All right. We can insert here at the George Washington Bridge.
Come around the bank, just off of Manhattan, land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here.
What about harbour patrol? Radar?
If they have anything that can pick up ourjet, they deserve to catch us.
You actually go outside in these things?
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?
Whoa.
There's the bridge. I'm takin' her down.
Storm, some cover, please.
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp. We're not alone.
And you stay here. Once I've given my power to the girl, I'll be temporarily weakened.
You'll be my only defence.
Sounds like a storm's comin'.
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?
The torch.
...the proceedings. The first dignitaries started to arrive about an hour ago,
greeted with a garden-party atmosphere designed to entertain them
as the others traversed the rigid security.
- There's someone here.
- Where?
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...
Damn it!
- Anything?
- There's someone here. I just can't see 'em.
Wait!
Back up! Back up!
Jean!
Oh, God!
Don't move.
Don't you people ever die?
Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?
The same thing that happens to everything else.
Logan, is that you?
The other one ain't far away.
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- I know, but there's a problem.
You're not part of the group.
Hey, hey! It's me.
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.
OK.
Hey!
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?
I can't move.
Ah, my brothers.
Welcome. And you, just point those claws of yours in a safer direction.
You better close your eyes.
Storm, fry 'em.
A bolt of lightning into a huge copper conductor. I thought you lived at a school.
For those of you not familiar with the historical significance...
Mystique?
- Mystique!
- I've seen Senator Kelly.
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.
He's become even more powerful than I imagined.
- He's dead.
- It's true.
I saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.
Are you sure you saw what you saw?
I would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America for hosting this event under the lights of the great city of New York.
Why do none of you understand what I'm trying to do?
Those people down there control our fate and the fate of every other mutant!
Well... soon our fate will be theirs.
Help! Please help me!
You're so full of shit. If you're really so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.
Help! Somebody help me!
Please!
Somebody please help me!
Somebody! Help me...
Logan!
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.
This is mine.
You owe me a scream.
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.
- Jean.
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.
- No!
- Trust me.
You drop something?
Now!
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.
- Shoot it!
- I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?
- I can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.
If I don't make it, at least you can still blast the damn thing.
All right, do it!
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.
Hang on to something.
Scott, wait!
- Jean, I have to!
- Just wait!
I have a shot.
I'm taking it.
Come on...
Hey, this one's alive. Let's get him outta here.
Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way.
I had you to guide me.
How did we do?
Oh, that tickles.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Fantastic.
That was a brave thing you did.
- Did it work?
- Yeah.
She's fine. She took on a few of your more charming personality traits for a while.
But we lived through it.
I think she's a little taken with you.
Well, you can tell her my heart belongs to someone else.
You know, you and I...
How's the professor?
He's good.
Good.
There's an abandoned military compound at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies close to where we found you.
There's not much left but... you might find some answers.
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?
The Mutant Registration Act lost its main proponent
with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly
who until now had provided the loudest voice in the cry for mutant registration.
I was wrong in this particular issue and I hope, in time, I may be forgiven. Thank you.
The Mutant Registration Act continues to draw support...
Mystique.
Son of a bitch.
... from many parents´rights groups who feel threatened by unidentified mutants.
In a related story, the body of Senator Kelly´s aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today.
Preliminary coroner´s reports seem to indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.
Hey!
- You running again?
- Not really.
I have some things to take care of up north.
I kinda like it.
I don't want you to go.
I'll be back for this.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night, the feeling that someday they will pass that foolish law, or one just like it, and come for you?
And your children?
It does indeed.
What do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school looking for trouble.
Why do you come here, Charles?
Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?
Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.
You know this plastic prison of theirs won't hold me for ever.
The war is still coming, Charles, and I intend to fight it.
By any means necessary.
And I will always be there.
Old friend.
'If anyone finds this, it means that my plan didn't work ...
... and I'm already dead.
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.
If I can somehow go back to the beginning ...
... of all of this, I might be able ...
- Evan!
... to save her.'
Evan!
Evan!
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for parents' night.
Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time.
Is Dad gonna come?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he just come out for one day?
We've been over this 100 times.
It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said his dad's coming, and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad ...
Okay, I get the point.
But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
Okay, have a great day.
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.
Bye.
Bye!
Mrs. Treborn, I need to speak with you.
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and ...
I think you really need to see this.
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.
Don't make me send you to Mr. Voytek's office.
I was gonna show this to the principal, but I thought I should talk to you first.
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children make drawings of what they wanted to be when they grew up.
Most of them made drawings of what their parents did.
But this ...
I don't understand.
Evan did this?
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn,
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?
When I asked Evan about the drawing, well, he couldn't remember doing it.
I don't wanna go.
I don't like this place, Mum.
I think it's creepy.
I promise I won't make any bad pictures.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
He just wants to do a couple tests, that's all.
- Oh.
- You'll like him.
That's good.
You're doing great.
Just tell me he hasn't inherited his father's illness.
I'm sure the test results will come back negative.
But there's something else you can do to monitor his memory.
- Anything.
- A journal.
Just have him write down everything that he does.
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.
See if he remembers anything new the next day.
These test results will come back in a few days
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.
'Today Mummy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.
I will meet their father and see what a real dad is like.'
Great, see you soon.
Evan ...
Evan, what are you doing with that knife?
What happened?
Honey ... what were you doing with that knife?
I don't remember.
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.
Hello, little man.
Watch your step.
Thanks, George.
- Not a problem.
- Here's my work number in case there are any problems.
And please keep an eye on him 'cause ...
What, are you kidding?
We're going to have a great time today, right, sport?
Okay, be good, kiddo.
I love you.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.
Here it comes.
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera and we're all going to be in a movie.
That's right, Evan.
And you get to be the star.
I thought I was the star.
Hey, what did I tell you?
Now, Evan ...
You have to promise your bestest, super-duper promise that this will be our little secret.
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.
I'm r ...
Where am I?
Where did we all go?
Calm down, kid, stand still.
I was just somewhere else.
How did I get here?
Quit acting like some damn retard, or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Kayleigh ...
Kayleigh ... what happened?
The good news is the results are negative.
I found no evidence of lesions, haemorrhaging, tumours.
But you must have something you can go on.
If I was to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven years old.
What kind of stress can a seven-year-old have?
Plenty. Maybe he has severe coping problems about not having a father.
You said the last time the blackouts occurred he was visiting his friend's dad.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.
We can arrange a controlled meeting.
A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security,
Evan comes in for a quick visit, and with a little luck, no more missing father complex.
'April 15th.
Today I get to meet my father.
His name is Jason and he's crazy.
I hope he lets me call him Dad.'
You mean Dad lives here?
Not in this wing, actually, no.
Now if your dad seems a little sleepy, it's because of the medicine, okay?
Okay.
It'll just be a moment, okay?
It's okay. I won't bite.
You've seen pictures of me, right?
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile and your hair.
Nooo!
He has to die!
It's the only way!
Jason, stop!
No!
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, we commend to almighty God, our brother Jason.
The Lord bless him and keep him, the Lord make his face to shine upon him, and be gracious unto him and give him peace. Amen.
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Yeah, what are you looking for, anyway?
Shut up, lard arse. And you, hold your fucking horses.
You know, it's here somewhere.
We should go soon.
If dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
So let's go.
I knew Dad had a blockbuster down here!
Let's blow the shit out of something.
Here you go, buddy.
What? No freaking way.
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.
Any of us does it and you're gonna puss out and nark for sure.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.
There you go.
It should buy you two minutes at least.
Gee thanks, friend.
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.
Shit took you long enough.
What the hell? Come on!
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!
Evan, get your arse back here and help me get him up.
What the hell happened?
Where are we?
Oh my God.
What did we do?
Evan, come on. Help me.
Oh my God, how could we?
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?
He's in shock, ma'am.
What is it?
What happened?
We were just in the woods building a fort when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay, and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?
What happened, Evan?
The truth.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.
I blacked it out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one.
You're not making it up?
I don't know.
They're keeping him overnight for observation.
Uh-huh.
I just don't know what to do with him.
'The last thing
I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears.
I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street.
Mum thinks that hypnosis might be a good way to remember.'
Damn it.
Breathe in and breathe out.
And relax.
You are completely asleep.
Relaxed.
I want you to take me to the time you were in the woods with Lenny.
Think of it like a movie.
You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish.
Understand?
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.
My hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
No, I'm protecting her.
Okay.
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?
I see a car.
Yes, Evan, tell me about the car.
Go on.
Nothing can hurt you.
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.
I can't ...
The car vanishes and all of a sudden
I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.
The movie in your head is broken, that's all.
Now tell me about the car.
I can't!
It's coming ...
Fight it, Evan, hurry.
It's coming!
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed ...
- What are you doing?
... and remembering everything that we talked about.
What is happening?
Make it stop!
One, you're feeling awake. Two, your eyes are not feeling as heavy.
- Five, six.
- Wake up!
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!
Oh God.
What happened?
Did it work?
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.
Wipe that sad-arse look off your face before you get us busted.
Did you see the way Evan's mum was looking at you?
Sorry.
Alright, will someone tell me already what the hell happened with the mailbox?
Don't you ever bring that shit up again.
Not ever!
Let's go.
Are you okay?
Holy shit!
Look at that fat fuck!
He's got bigger titties than Lenny's mum.
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.
No one's talking to you.
I'm sorry, Kayleigh, this was a bad idea.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
You're so lucky.
Look, everything's gonna be okay.
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
Mrs. Kagan called Dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Your dad did that?
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?
What you deserve is a better father and brother.
All they do is make you feel like shit.
You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you?
What the fuck are you doing?!
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?
I can't believe what you just did.
Stop it!
Stop hitting him.
What's wrong with you?
Somebody, please help us.
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.
Get him away! Get him away!
Now in another story, the peaceful town of Briarville was rocked this afternoon in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism.
While police officials in upstate New York believe this was a simple act of criminal mischief gone awry, the tragedy has clearly devastated the community.
Now this was the grisly aftermath of a powerful explosion believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite.
The police have no leads, no suspects and no motive ...
Good night.
We're moving.
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.
He knows
I'm moving away, right?
He's been acting real strange lately.
He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Duck, here they come!
Did your mum say if Lenny was okay?
He must be. I mean, they're letting him out, right?
Welcome home.
I thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.
So, what'd you do in there?
It was awful.
You can't sleep because everybody's screaming all night long.
I never want to go back.
Do you see that?
Yeah, what's up with the smoke?
Crockett!
What are you doing with my dog?!
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on, please wake up.
Wake up, please!
Wake up!
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?
Ow.
How long was I out?
Kayleigh, what's wrong?
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
Aced it.
And time.
Put your pencils down and place your bluebooks on my desk before you leave.
You too, Mr. Nelson. We're all in the same time-zone, here.
So how'd you do, Evan?
I don't know. I might have got some of the stories mixed up.
Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts?
Typical psych major, a complete wise-arse.
And how's your project coming?
Are you still planning to change the way we humble scientists
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.
Oh, jeez, it smells like patchouli and arse in here.
Cricket, this is my well-mannered roommate, Evan.
Yeah ... you're the one that fucked up the bell curve on my anthropology final.
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.
Fucking dick.
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.
Oh, you sick fuck.
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.
Why, what'd you do, ace another midterm?
No.
Better than that, seven years, no blackouts.
Fuck yeah, bro', let's do this!
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.
Did she cradle the balls and work the shaft?
Nice.
Look at this fucking guy.
Get the fuck out of my bar.
So, which one of you has the pet worm?
Worms, plural!
Ah. That's so gross.
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.
It's a study on memory loss.
Better explain before all this excitement gives me a heart attack.
10 bucks says he eats it off the floor.
Well, if I can figure out how the memories in a simple worm function, it should help me to understand the complexities ... of the human brain.
Let me get this shot.
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this ...
Well, I guess that's your game.
Go, you go.
It smells like sex in here.
Yeah, Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding?
He's so big.
Yeah.
Well, I guess charisma and eyeliner go a long way.
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.
You got any incense or scented candles or something?
Okay.
Whoa, no.
Let me put this away.
Most guys usually tuck porn under their bed.
All you've got are comp books?
Yeah, they're my journals.
I've been keeping them since I was seven.
Wow.
Read me something.
I ought to be getting something out of this.
That's all I've got to say.
Here we go.
'It's like my mind refuses to believe what I'm seeing.'
' ... Hearing Crockett make those awful screams.
Just writing about it gives me the shivers.'
Come on. Go on.
'It was like Tommy was possessed or something.
There was a hate in his eyes that ... '
Are you okay?
Where am I?
What the hell's going on?
I can't get it open!
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!
Listen to me, Evan, and you listen to me good.
There's a million other sisters in the world, so why'd you have to fuck with mine?
It's okay.
It was just a dream.
Uh-huh ... it didn't feel like a dream.
Maybe because they never do.
So, Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Lenny ... hey, I've got a surprise for you.
You're never gonna guess who's here.
Hey, it's me ... Evan.
What are you working on there?
A model?
Look, uh ...
I can see that you're busy, so I'll try to make this quick.
Remember, uh ... that day at the junkyard when we were kids?
I was just hoping that you could help me remember.
Like, just any details about it or ...
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah ... that's good. Um ... anything else?
'Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep! '
Uh ...
Jesus Christ.
It really happened.
Wow, uh ...
Wow, Lenny, l ...
'Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.'
'The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears.
I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than on the mailbox ... across the street.'
Maybe it went out, should someone check it?
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
You make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
Ugh!
Fuck!
What's this?
Huh? What's this?
Want to get the mail?
How's my sweet girl?
How's my sweet girl?
You need a change, don't you, honey?
You wanna open it?
You wanna open it?
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!
Run!
Fuck, Lenny, come on!
Lenny, come on!
Come on, Lenny, let's go!
No, baby. That's my finger in your arse.
Christ, man.
Fuckin' brutal!
What the ... ?
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?
Mrs. Kagan, um, it's Evan ... Treborn.
I hope you know how much you upset Lenny.
Yeah, I'm ... look,
I'm really sorry about that.
It took me over an hour to clean up the mess you made.
Can I just talk to Lenny?
Don't call here.
Mum.
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.
Hey, did ... did Dad ...
Did Jason get good grades?
Please, he got straight As without ever touching a book.
It was the one area his memory never failed him.
Did he ever say that he, like ... figured out a way to recall his lost memories like years after he blacked them out in the first place?
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being you know, such a brain and all it's like, you would think that he would figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot.
Well, when he was your age ... almost exactly your age come to think of it, he said he figured out a way to remember his past.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just his imagination.
Then, just before it got so bad, he ... had to be institutionalised, he said he could ...
What?
What?
What ... what did he do?
Forget it.
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.
Come on, Mum, what did he say that he could do?
What do you say, as a goof?
No, Mum, come on.
Come on, yourself ... it'll be fun.
Alright, it's your dime.
Give me your hand, young man.
- This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.
- Evan!
- What?
Have you ever had your palm read before?
No, this is the first time, so be gentle please.
What?
You have no lifeline.
You don't belong here.
For an extra five bucks she'll spit in your face, Mum.
- No, really, what's his future?
- He has no soul!
You were never meant to be.
Psychic, huh?
This won't come as much of a shock to you.
Thank you.
When did you start smoking again?
Lay off, Evan.
Hey?
What ...
You're not gonna let that old hag ruin the rest of our time together?
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.
That's like an act.
- They just do that ...
- I know.
I'm sorry, she just hit a nerve.
Well ... why?
I don't get it.
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice, and they were both stillbirths.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
It's not something
I like to remember.
And then when I was pregnant with you,
I was terrified.
I had to expect the worst.
- And?
- And you came out fine.
And ever since then, I've considered you my little miracle baby.
Don't cry.
Come on, let's go.
It's late.
'I never wanted to be in the movie, anyway.
I was cold, so I wanted to wear my clothes.
Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'
What the fuck are you doing?
Shhh, I need quiet for this.
Are you stupid or what, man?
Maybe there's a reason you repressed the day some pervert had you in your tighty whities.
I'd think twice about what you're doing.
You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l ...
You think you know me?
I don't know me!
Whoa!
I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault.
Can we get through one damn day without you breaking something?
Hey.
Evan.
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.
How you been?
Same old, same old, you know?
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.
Uhh, well ...
I'm going to State now.
It's going good.
My Mum's good.
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?
I've quit like 100 times.
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.
- Oh my God.
- So ... how's Tommy?
Well, they kept him in juvie for a few years, but now he's working over at Dale's Auto Body.
That's good.
Still living with your dad?
No.
I emancipated myself at 15.
Must've taken a lot of courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Well, couldn't you have just moved in with your mum?
No, she had a new family.
Wasn't enough room.
Whatever.
Well look, the reason
I came back to town was to talk to you.
To me? Why?
Well ... remember when we were kids and I used to have those blackouts?
Yeah, of course.
Well, some of those memories have been coming back to me.
And I just ...
I wanted to talk to you about one of them in particular.
Well, I'll try to remember.
When we were kids, uh ... your dad was making a movie about Robin Hood ... something.
What do you want to know, Evan?!
Is ... did he ...
What happened in the basement?
Look, it was a long time ago.
I know.
Is that why you came all the way back here?
To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, l ...
I just think that something really bad might have happened.
Is there a point to any of this?
Look, whatever happened it wasn't our fault.
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing that we could do to deserve ...
Just shut up, Evan!
You're wasting your breath.
You can't hate yourself 'cause your dad's a twisted freak.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?
You come all the way back here to stir up my shit just because you have a bad memory?
What, do you want me to just cry on your shoulder and tell you everything's all better now?
Well, fuck you, Evan!
Nothing's all better, okay?
Nothing ever gets better.
You know, if I was so wonderful, Evan, why didn't you call me?
Why did you just leave me here to rot?
When he was your age ... almost exactly your age, come to think of it ... he said he figured out a way to remember his past.
Some dude left a message for you.
You can smell that all the way to the bathroom.
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.
I just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay this afternoon.
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.
What'd you say to my sister, motherfucker?
Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me.
She said you came and saw her last night.
She ... she fucking killed herself tonight.
She's dead ... and so are you!
'If the scar on my stomach didn't just come out of nowhere, maybe my father wasn't as crazy as everyone thought.
If I can make scars, do I have the power to heal them?
What about Kayleigh's scars? '
'I never wanted to be in the movie, anyway.
It was cold, so I wanted to wear my clothes.
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.
It'll look more like a dungeon down there.
A little light here.
Huh?
Hey, now what did I tell you about keeping that door shut?
But I wanna see.
You're going to see the back of my fist in about two seconds if you don't do what I tell you.
Now, in this part of the story,
Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff, like the grown-ups do.
So, take off your clothes, Kayleigh.
Come on, just like when we take a bath.
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.
Put your hands on your ears.
What time is it?
It's time for you to do what I tell you to do.
Wrong answer, fuckbag!
This is the very moment of your reckoning.
In the next 30 seconds, you're going to open up one of two doors.
The first door will forever traumatise your own flesh and blood.
What ... what's happening?
How are you doing this?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick paedophile father!
Ultimately ... it'll lead to her suicide.
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George!
Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like ... say like a loving father treats his daughter.
Sound okay to you, Papa?
Yes.
Listen close then, fuckbag.
You screw this up again,
I'll flat out castrate you.
What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy, because the kid is one sadistic pup.
One last thing.
Don't ever touch me again!
L ... I won't.
Ahhh!
Faster, faster!
Crockett!
Kayleigh, I can't believe you came!
I think you got one.
Check out our new house.
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.
Honey, are you alright?
Oh my god, Evan, you're bleeding.
Kayleigh, you're still ... You ...
Incredible.
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up and come back to bed.
Ohh. Where are my clothes?
Those are your clothes, silly.
The bathroom is ...
Hurry up. I want a quickie before school.
What?
Unfucking believable.
Alright.
I wish I could get as excited over a nosebleed.
Sorry, uh, I didn't see you there.
What?
You're the girl that was with those arseholes throwing popcorn at Thumper.
What?
And your name is Gwen.
I know you.
Seriously, Evan, lay off the blow.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, um ... don't freak out when I ask you this, but ... do you remember when your dad got that video camera?
What's up, man?
Yeah, um ...
I think he had it like the first day and then he gave it away or something.
Why would that freak me out?
I don't know.
Just being weird.
You are such a goofus.
So I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
- Andrea ...
- Evan ...
- and Chuck ...
- aren't home right now.
You know what to do.
Uh, hey, Mum.
It's me. And hey, Chuck.
Ah, I'm just calling to say hi, I guess.
Give me a call back.
Hey, Thumper, do you know what time it is, man?
What's the matter, you lost your Rolex?
Fuck you, frat boy!
Remember, everyone, there's only two more weeks until your psych projects are due.
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week, we're still okay with the extension, right?
And you are?
Evan ... Treborn.
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.
Alright, settle down, everyone.
The exam will begin in one minute.
Get off me, arsehole.
You guys started that shit.
Evan, you're hysterical.
Did you study for this?
Oh, uh ... we'll find out.
Me neither.
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?
Damn, Evan, keep it on the dl.
Hey, uh ...
I want to do something special for Kayleigh tomorrow night.
Uh, so if I said that I needed some help from you and the brothers ...
I'd say, 'blow me.'
Get the pledges to do it.
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.
You may begin now.
Oh, that was so good.
Oh my God.
Where'd you learn those new tricks?
Why?
It ... it wasn't weird, was it?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Hello?
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?
Oh.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect?
I mean ... why did you sneak out to visit me after I moved away?
'Cause I missed you.
What, do you think my dad could have stopped me from seeing you?
What's he gonna do?
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.
Do you think that we'll be together forever?
That is the plan, isn't it?
'Hell or high water'?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's ...
I was just making sure.
Yeah, that's the plan!
Alright, uh ... all you rushes, you know what you have to do for me.
Pledges, uh ... we're pledges, sir.
Uh, brother Evan, sir.
Are you kidding me?
What?
What did you say to me?
You know what, give me the Greek alphabet. Give it to me!
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.
- Alpha, beta ...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta ... epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.
Uh ... alright, um ... so, you ... you pledges you guys know what you need to do for me.
And you guys take a shower and if anyone gives you any trouble, you tell 'em I said it was okay.
What?
Shower that, bitch.
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?
I'm not telling.
Oh my God!
Wow, it's beautiful.
Go on, sit down.
Thank you.
Why are you doing this for me?
When I woke up this morning ...
I saw your smile.
That smile.
And I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
I've been looking all over for you, man.
Someone trashed your car.
What the ...
Who did this?!
Who did it?!
It was probably those Beta fuckers.
No, no, no.
How did somebody get away with this right in front of the frat house?
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.
Don't.
He might be watching.
It's my fault.
I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Yeah, it might have been nice.
God.
Like this is gonna do any good.
Maybe one of the frat guys has got a gun.
Evan, don't even joke!
He's not going to hurt you, okay?
He's just trying to scare you away from me.
He killed my dog.
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.
You know how bad he had it when we were kids.
Oh no, don't give me this bad upbringing shit.
You turned out just fine.
My father never laid a hand on me.
It's like that prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Okay. Alright. Uh ...
We'll let campus security deal with it. Okay?
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.
Evan, I just ... I don't want Tommy to see us together right now.
No, I lost you once and I'm not losing you again.
What do you mean you lost me once?
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?
God, you've been acting so weird lately.
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.
I know that, but ... your accent's changed.
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?
I mean, that dinner tonight, it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.
But it just wasn't you.
I can't do something nice for you?
Wait ... isn't that your jacket?
Tommy!
You stay away from us, you sick fuck.
Oh, get this 'us' shit.
Like I'd ever lay a hand on my own sister.
You're doing real nice for yourself, Evan.
You've got a nice life, you got nice friends, not to mention you're fucking my sister.
Not a bad piece of arse if I say so myself.
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?
Oh, it's not good enough that the whole fucking world loves you?
But you've got to take the only thing on this Earth that doesn't think that I'm a piece of shit?
You know I love you.
No one thinks that you're a piece of shit, Tom.
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!
Don't! Tommy!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop! Oh my God!
Stop!
Oh my God!
Oh!
No, Evan!
Stop!
Stop it!
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!
You ruined Lenny's life!
You killed Crockett!
You killed that woman and her baby!
Now you're trying to kill me.
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!
Oh my God!
Oh my God, what did you do?
Oh my God!
You right there, faggot!
First time?
Yeah.
You'd better not bitch up, man.
You'll wind up someone's luggage that way.
Can you protect me?
Jesus himself couldn't make me stand up against the brotherhood.
Look, man ... when they come, you go someplace else in your head, man.
Be somewhere else.
Back your arse up.
Yo, gimme that.
I spoke to your lawyer.
And he says he's sure he can get you off on self-defence.
So if you're just patient ...
Mum ...
How long am I gonna be in here?
I don't know.
These things take time.
What about the journals?
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?
I found these two.
The others are still in storage.
Mum! L ...
I need them all, all of them.
And I'm going to get them to you, but right now, you need to concentrate on the case.
Please.
Alright.
You're right.
What about Kayleigh?
Is she alright?
Try to tell her I'm sorry.
Time's up.
I'm not going to lose you, kiddo.
Promise me you'll hang on.
Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.
They're mine ...
Come on!
Back the fuck off!
Show's over, ladies!
Put this maggot back in his cell.
Move it!
Come on, let's go!
We'll be seeing you later on tonight, little sister.
'Today, I found my grandfather's death certificate.
He died in a nut house just like my father.
Mum denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way.'
Boo-hoo-hoo.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on, Reese.
You're religious, Carlos, you believe in that whole bit, the Lord works in mysterious ways?
Straight up, man.
'Cause I think Jesus sent me to your cell for a reason.
For you to help me.
Shit.
I knew you were crazy, man.
I ain't bullshitting you.
Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Oh, yeah?
That's cool. Great.
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.
When I'm out, I need you to watch my hands and face closely.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Just tell me if you see anything just ... weird.
Weirder than this?
It could be marks.
It could be scars.
It could be anything,
I don't know.
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble for a drawing I didn't do.
Mummy won't let me see it.
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.
That's great, everyone.
Just imagine what you want to be.
There's no limits.
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!
Look, it's stigmata, man!
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.
Man, I thought you were ...
I though you were fucking crazy, man.
So now you believe me.
Straight up, man.
Wanna make a deal?
Alright, look. I'm new here, but I think I get how things work.
You either join a gang or you're dead.
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no spics or niggers.
And I don't want to die.
So ... what do I gotta do?
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so ... should I ... suck your dick now ... or ...
Is your blood pure?
Well, I ain't no fucking kike, if that's what you're asking me.
Well then, let's see what you got, honey.
Watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em.
Yes, Sir.
Come to daddy.
Carlos!
'We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy!
We hadn't seen the smoke yet.'
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.
'We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy.
We hadn't seen the smoke yet.'
Rot in hell, you fucking animals!
Wait, before we ... we need something that could open the sack.
I want you to take this, Lenny.
Today's your day of atonement.
I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby.
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.
Now's the only time! Today you get a chance to redeem yourself, to start all over with a clean slate.
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.
Please, if you've ever trusted me before, trust me on this one.
Cut the rope.
Come on.
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.
Just let Crockett go.
Besides, if you kill him now, they'll stick you in juvie for sure.
And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Lenny, no!
Oh God.
Oh God, Lenny.
I said cut the rope.
It's all backwards.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Evan ...
What the fuck?
Lenny, no!
Want a ride?
Lenny!
Somebody call 911!
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!
Hey, doc.
What's the damage?
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results like these before.
Not even with my father?
Well, actually, they didn't have these tests 20 years ago.
So, what did you find?
We're finding most of the haemorrhaging is coming from here, the outer layer of the cerebral cortex.
That's where the memories are stored.
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.
I've never seen anything like it.
We compared these to the ones taken last year.
We found severe haemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction.
What does that mean for Evan?
What he's saying, Mum, is that I've jammed
40 years worth of memories into my head in the last year.
It's overload city. I've completely reprogrammed my brain.
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.
Alright, I'm going to go wait in the car.
The light in here is kind of bugging my eyes, so ...
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.
It was very ... very informative.
But, you know,
I got people to see and things to read.
Alright, see ya.
Hey.
It's me ...
Evan.
Can I get you anything?
What about ... what about some of those model airplanes you like, huh?
I bet I can get a shitload of those model airplanes up in here.
Lenny.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?
When you put that shard in my hand ... you knew something big was going to happen.
Didn't you?
Yeah ...
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.
You should be where I am.
'Today I get to meet my father.
His name is Jason ... and he's crazy.
I hope he let's me call him "Dad."'
You okay?
'Cause you look like you went somewhere else there for a second.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers from you if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Yeah, but it didn't.
So now I need information to make things right again and you're the only one that can give it to me.
There is no right.
You can't change who people are without destroying who they were.
Who says you can't make things better?
You can't play God, son.
It must end with me.
Just by being here you may be killing your mother.
That's bullshit, you know?
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.
Ahh! No, no!
Just get out, did ya?
Hmm?
Oh, nothing, just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
Well, I meant no offence.
None taken.
Hey, uh ...
Does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.
God! Can't a man get a little goddamned peace in his own house?!
I don't suppose you're here to sell cookies?
Good guess, fuckbag.
Remember me, huh?
We had a nice chat once when I was seven.
I got one question for you.
Where can I find your daughter?
Oh, I thought you were someone else.
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.
Hey. It's good to see you.
Can I come in?
If I knew you were coming,
I would have cleaned the stains off the sheets.
What do you want?
I just needed to see a friendly face.
Well, time is money, Evan.
Money.
I guess I can spare 10 minutes for an old friend, right?
So, how's tricks?
Sorry, occupational humour.
I got it.
You can stop now.
Oh, sorry.
Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No, just that you felt like you had to use it to hurt me.
I've been where you've been.
Ha!
Where is that?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I know people always say that, that you wouldn't believe me, but in this case it's not even worth trying, so ...
I knew I needed to find you, so I went over to your dad's and made him tell me where you were.
Then I came here and the rest you know.
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.
I never thought you would.
That's why I never bothered to tell a soul until now and I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told?
That's a great line.
Does that make other girls wet?
Do they actually eat up that bullshit?
You know, I could give a shit whether you believe me or not.
Frankly, I'm too tired to prove it to you ...
Oh, there's proof now, huh?
How else would I know you have twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with 50 bucks could tell you that.
Okay.
Forget that.
How about the fact that you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers?
Or that you hate cilantro because for some reason unknown to you it reminds you of your stepsister?
Or that when you have an orgasm, your toes go numb?
I'm sure all of your clientele are privy to that.
You know? Look, I just thought you should know.
Know what?
That you were happy once ... with me.
You know there's one major hole in your story.
There's no fucking way on this planet or any other, I would ever be in some fucking sorority!
You were happy there.
Oh, you're crying?
You sure you don't want your wallet?
No, I don't need it where I'm going.
What, are you off to change everyone else's life again? Is that it?
Maybe next time you'll pop up in some mansion while I end up in Tijuana doing some donkey act.
You know what? I'm over it.
Every time
I try to help someone everything just goes to shit.
Well, don't give up now, slick.
Hell, you've already done so much for me.
Why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby?
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
No, go back to when I was seven and fuck me in front of my daddy's video camera.
Straighten me out a bit.
You're on my bed.
Get out!
Buddy, I thought it would be okay what with you being sick and all.
I'm not going to say it again.
'The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears.
I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than on the mailbox across the street.'
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!
I'll save you, lady!
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?
No, it's cool.
Okay.
It's really cool.
What the fuck is this?
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?
Do you want me to hold your popcorn?
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!
Evan! Oh my God!
Evan! Evan!
Evan!
Hey, where you going?
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.
Lenny's the best.
You guys make a great couple.
You ever think that I'll find someone?
Evan!
Where are we going?
We're taking you to the hospital, Evan.
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!
You owe me that much.
What are you geeks looking at?
It must be nice to be so goddamed perfect, huh?
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!
Here, get him over.
Get him over.
Hey, Brian, how's your head feeling, buddy?
I saw that girl you went home with.
Did she borrow your razor this morning?
You're so bad.
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!
Hey, what's up, guys?
Hey, man,
I did what you said.
We're pooling our student funds with the Hillel house and we're having an awareness dance.
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around to a techno remix of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.
Maybe we should be getting to class now.
What's the point of psych class now?
Tomorrow I could wake up a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Let's go for a stroll.
Bye, babe.
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.
What's up with him?
So Tommy's really into this Jesus freak thing, huh?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
He saved Mrs. Halpern?
Please. The twisted fuck.
Here, why don't we sit right here?
Want a granola bar?
Here, just ...
Yeah, I gotta fix these things or something.
Kayleigh ... do you ever think about us?
I mean, do you ever wonder if things might have been different between us?
Sure, Evan.
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.
- I was?
- Yeah.
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.
I don't get it.
When ... when my folks split up, they gave me and Tommy a choice of who we wanted to live with.
And I couldn't stand my dad.
But I knew that if I went to move with my mum,
I'd never see you again.
I didn't know that.
So you still think about us ... together?
Well, it's crossed my mind from time to time.
And?
Well, a lot of things have crossed my mind, Ev.
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of our lives in one second.
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.
Plah, it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Things like that usually do.
So ... do you think that it might have worked?
Yeah.
I mean, but that's not how things wound up.
I'm with Lenny.
Lenny is your friend and ... and that's where it ends.
Well ... would it make a difference if I told you that no one could possibly ever love anyone as much as I love you?
I'm not saying that. I ...
- Yeah.
- I'm not ... I'm just saying it like if you were a girl, would that be something that you would want to hear?
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?
He's a little down ...
I love you.
You forgot to put the toaster on the ledge.
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.
You guys are all that matter now.
Man, I know it's hard, but you can't give up.
I can't even fucking kill myself.
Don't talk like that.
Alright, I've got to get you out of here.
Visiting hours are almost over.
Did Mum get transferred again?
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.
Looking ... good, kiddo.
Lung cancer.
Lung cancer?
You started chain smoking when I blew myself up.
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been acting out of sorts lately.
- I think I could fix this.
- Fix?
I just need the journal entry about the blockbuster.
Shit, no arms.
I never wrote it.
You're ... acting ... different.
No, he's just going through tough times right now.
Mum ... you're going to be okay.
I can change it.
Um, maybe ... I wanna go down to the chapel.
You're ... acting ... just like your father.
Just 'cause he went crazy when he was my age, doesn't mean
I'm gonna go crazy, Mum.
How ... did ... you ... know that?
You told me ... on parent's weekend, remember?
It wasn't me ...
- Just ...
... or you.
Like ... Jason.
You don't worry, Mum,
I'm going to get you out of here. Okay?
No.
You're not going to hurt anymore.
I'm going to fix it.
No.
No, no.
Are you sure you even packed it?
My mum packed it.
I think she sent everything I ever owned.
- Is this it?
- Yeah.
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.
Duly noted.
Okay, I have to ask you one last favour.
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.
I have to concentrate if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms, my mum would've never started smoking in the first place.
Never mind. Just open it.
Turn it.
There.
'Today Mummy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.
I will meet their father and see what a real dad is like.'
Now, how do I destroy the blockbuster?
Evan, what are you doing with that knife?
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.
Turn it. There.
'I never wanted to be in the movie anyway.
It was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes.
But Mr. Miller made me take my shirt off.'
In this part of the story,
Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian.
And they have to kiss and stuff, like grown-ups do.
Wait, I need my belt.
Hey, don't even bother about a belt.
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.
Amazing that word never fails to make an impression with you.
Easy does it, Evan.
Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell your mother what a naughty little shit you are.
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services about your little kiddie porn endeavours.
One step closer and I'll shove this up your arse.
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.
Been there, done that.
Hey!
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!
No! Kayleigh, no!
Hey, man.
... good, kiddo.
I've got no choice but to commit you to Sunnyvale Institution ...
You're gonna have to live somewhere else for a while.
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!
I'm so sick of this!
I think we should up your medication.
Where are my goddamn books?
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed to meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
My journals.
L ... I need them.
So, if you'd give 'em to me, it'd help a lot.
It really hurts me to go through this again.
There are no journals.
There never were.
It's part of the fantasy world that your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing Kayleigh Miller.
Think, Evan, think.
You've created a disease that does not exist ... alternate universes with colleges and prisons and paraplegia.
I want my journals and I want 'em now!
And I know that you got 'em and you're gonna give 'em to me!
You're not going to hide them from me. I want them!
You're reminding me of your father.
He was always screaming for a photo album even though he never had one.
I'm so sorry.
A photo album?
- Photos.
- Evan?
The damage is irreparable.
Frankly, I'm surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Mum?
Um, did you remember to bring those home movies that we used to make?
Yeah, they're right here.
Good, because I really like to watch them.
So that's good.
I think it's best we transfer him to Bellevue first thing in the morning.
'If anyone finds this,
... it means that my plan didn't work ...
... and I'm already dead.'
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.
'If I can somehow go back ...
... to the beginning of all of this ...
... I might be able to save her.'
I'm trying to have a baby.
Go away.
Something's wrong!
It's killing me!
Make it stop! Oh!
Heart rate is decelerating.
What's happening?!
You have no lifeline, no soul.
You were never meant to be.
He's choking himself!
No!
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence intubation for a c-section, stat!
- Save him!
- Not getting enough oxygen!
- We're losing him, we're losing him!
- No!
Before you were born,
I was pregnant three times, but they were all stillbirths.
I've kind of thought of you as my miracle baby ever since.
Not again!
No!
I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew that if I went to live with my mum,
I would never see you again.
Kayleigh and Tommy!
I missed you!
I'll never let you guys out of my sight again.
Yeah!
True happiness can only be achieved through sacrifice, like the sacrifices our parents have made.
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!
From a secret island in the South Pacific... the courageous Tracy family run an organization called...
International Rescue.
When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world... they are always first on the scene.
They go by the name they gave their incredible machines.
The Thunderbirds.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Thunderbirds are go!
But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
Gentlemen, we all know that A squared plus B squared equals?
- C squared.
- C squared. That's right. À But...
What happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's
E, F, and...
Mr. Tracy?
Alan.
Alan!
- How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan.
I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?
Here on Earth, we've been discussing the Pythagorean Theorem.
Did any of that happen to sink in?
I was just...
Apparently not.
Thunderbirds are... go.
I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan.
Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back.
That should keep you busy.
"That should keep you busy."
- You can take 10,000 words À and stick them up...
- Alan!
-  Headmaster.
- Mr. Tracy
Ms. Garrett.
You gotta be more careful, Alan.
Why can't I tell them
I'm a Thunderbird, Fermat?
Because technically you're not yet.
And if your identity was discovered, it'd-d-d...
- it could be very bad.
- I know, I know.
It's the Thunderbirds!
They're gonna be on TV.
- Let's go, À they're gonna be on TV!
- Whoa, whoa, where are they?
- They're in Russia, À at an oil rig fire!
- Great!
I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on a cool mission.
We are told the super rig is now in danger of total collapse.
And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board.
An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago.
They should be here any moment now.
And here they are!
Thunderbird 2, this is Thunderbird 1.
I have visual south column.
They're trapped on an inspection platform.
FAB, we'll take it from here.
Come on!
Come on!
- Scott, get out of there! À That tower's coming down!
- Got it!
Thunderbird 1, any damage?
Negative, Dad.
Come on, come on.
Swing around. You can't get close enough taking that approach angle.
Approach angle is no good.
I'm gonna have to swing her around.
Watch for wind shear,
Thunderbird 2.
I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.
Come on, Dad.
Whoa, hold on!
Who needs diapers now, Dad?
- What'll they do now?
- Drop the rescue platform À from Thunderbird 2.
Open them up.  Here we go.
Rescue platform's on it's way.
Virgil, how's it going?
It's looking good, Dad.
Come on, jump!
Okay, I've got a visual.
Hold it there.
Targets locked.
Firing rescue lines.
Come on, hook them up!
We gotta get you out of here!
- Let's haul them out of there.
- Commencing reverse thrust.
Okay, let's bring them home.
Look out!
Gotta get them out fast.
The rig's gonna blow.
- Hang on!
- Whoa!
Whoa, sorry, boys.
Hold on tight, here we go!
Come on, Virgil.
-  Hold on, guys!
-  How are you doing, son?
Never better!
Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.
FAB, Thunderbird 2.
Lining up target.
Fire.
Yee-ha!
- Bull's-eye!
Outstanding shot.
All right, boys.
Let's take these babies home.
The fire has been extinguished.
The rocket fired from
Thunderbird 1 has robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn.
Amazing.
The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck.
That was great work, Lisa.
Thanks a lot.
Ooo, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one day.
- Thunder-turd.
- Ooo.
- That's another
À good one, diaper boy.
Tracy!
There's someone here for you.
Hello, boys.
Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service.
Alan, darling.
Your father's been detained and he's asked me to pick you up.
- Is that all right?
- Sure beats the bus.
- Definitely.
- Fantastic.
Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?
Me! Me!
Just Fermat.
Quite right.
Lady Penelope, why are you in America?
- Are you on a mission À for my father?
- Alan, shh.
I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet.
Here we are.
- Hi, Parker.
- Good afternoon to you, À Master Hackenbacker.
- Ow!
- Hi, Nosey.
- Less of that attitude
À or I shall be obliged
- to deliver À the Parker Haymaker.
- Okay, bring it on, big guy.
Try not to run over any children, Parker.
Very good, m'lady.
Come on, Parker, chop-chop.
- All right! Yes!
- FermatWhoa!
Yeah.
Oh, look, Parker.
Pink is the new black this season.
I'm very glad to hear it, m'lady.
And hemlines are going up.
That is good news, m'lady.
And apparently England won the football last night.
- Yes!   Eng-er-land!
- Whoa!
Calm down, Parker.
Yes, m'lady.
Sorry, m'lady.
Come on, baby.
Out you jump.
Wait till your father hears about this.
Panhead!
Aliens!
Even better!
It's the Thunderbirds!
Okay, lock it up.
Okay, people, let's move it.
Let's go, let's move it.
- Hey, we need some help over here.
- Here you are, come down.
Mission complete.
Thunderbird 1.
We are good to go.
Fab.
Tracking device activated.
Ah, the chariot of the Gods.
Having dallied with the mortals, they return to Olympus.
And so I follow.
Pardon me, m'lady, approaching Tracy Island.
- Radar indicates
À we have some company.
Now that's showing off.
I wish that was me.
I'm about to run post-flight checks, Mr. Tracy.
Anything I sh-sh-sh... anything you want to tell me?
Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2 followed by illumination of the #5 engine-out light.
Okay, I'll ch-ch... study the flight data in the guidance processor.
- Dad!
- Alan!
- Let me look at you. À Oh, man.
- Pop!
- Uh-oh, look out.
- Hey, sprout!
- Hey buddy!
- Dinner's ready. À Come and get it.
Onaha, it smells delicious and I'm starved.
So, Dad, I saw the mission on TV.
It looked pretty dangerous.
Saving lives is a dangerous business, but it's what we do.
Do you think the fire was causing thermal updrafts?
Whoa, enough shop-talk.
I want to hear about school.
School's boring.
Plus, I've been thinking,
Maybe I could be home educated now.
That way I could sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?
No shortcuts, Alan.
No school, no rockets.
Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?
I'm getting this reading telling me the wind is blowing
60 knots right up my keister.
- No kidding.
- Did you try readjusting À the flaps?
That's the first thing I did.
It's not my first day on a Thunderbird.
- Try and keep up.
- Don't you have homework to do?
Unless he's blown up this school like the last one.
- Keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard.
- Enough. Pass the salad.
- No thanks. Haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.
That wasn't Fiji, that was Istanbul.
N o,
Istanbulas the earthquake.
Nothing compares to Argentina.
Dad, I'm not really hungry.
Come on, Fermat, let's go.
But... you...
I'm not done.
Okay.
Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?
- By the pool.
- Of course.
Parker.
We're not suppose to go in there.
We could get in trouble.
Where did you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
Fermat, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you.
I'll be right there.
It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
- Any suspects?
- Not yet, but I'll keep À you posted.
- Thanks for À bringing Alan home.
- My pleasure.
Any excuse to visit paradise.
- Tintin!
- Hey, Mr. Tracy.
Hello, Tintin.
- Good evening, Lady Penelope.
- Did you know Alan's home?
- Alan's back?
I mean...
Oh, Alan's back.
Hey, Dad.
When are those two gonna get along?
When Tintin decides the time is right.
Girls are always ahead of boys with that sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?
- Romance.
Alan and Tintin?
- I didn't see À that one coming.
- No, you wouldn't.
- Have a safe À flight home, Penny.
- Thanks, Jeff.
Okay, Fermat, run pre-flight checks.
Right.
Hydraulic systems are green.
- Commence main engine sequence.
- FAB, Alan.
Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
No, wait, Alan!
À That's the... wrong switch!
- Warning.
- Engine sequence breach.
- Oh, God. Warning.
Engine sequence breach.
- Can't this day À get any worse?
- Alan, my office, now!
It just did.
I can't believe it.
We are so busted.
Look at this.
What is it?
Looks like some sort of... gallium electrolyte compound.
Gotta get out of here.
I know you're mad, I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you...
You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
- But nothing happened. À I had it under control.
- Under control?
Do you have any idea the importance of secrecy in our operation?
You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield.
You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly.
You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules.
You understand?
Do you?!
- Yeah, I understand.
I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird.
You don't want me to do anything!
You won't listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important!
I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
- But, Dad!
- Bottom line, Alan!
You need to grow up.
Then let me.
Please.
Hey, John, just about to turn in.
What can I do for you?
I could sure use a pizza.
You know a place that delivers?
30 minutes or it's free, right?
Anything else on your mind?
Well, we've got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore.
What's happening on planet Tracy?
Alan's home for spring break.
Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region.
Teenagers.
Well, we've all been there.
- Dad, you've done a great À job since Mom died.
- Thanks, John.
Keep an eye on that typhoon for us.
I'll call Vladivostok and see if they need any help with that fire.
FAB, Dad.
Sleep tight.
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, son.
There's something
I'd like to sh-sh-sh...
Here, take a look.
The neural-net control system?
It's great to have you back.
I bet you didn't think spring break was gonna be this wo-wo... fun.
Watch this?
And the tiny phone lifts up.
Perfect.
Dad, it...
N-n-n... almost perfect.
There's something I wanted to talk to you about, Dad.
Oh, right.  Oh.
Oh.  Okay, right.
You're having problems with a g-g-g... chi-chi-chi... wo-wo... female?
N-n-no.
No.
Alan and I found some sort of... gallium compound on the nose-cone of Thunderbird 1.
We should check that out st-st-st... immediately.
Oh, that'd be gr-gr... swell!
The island is in sight.
Transom, I need you.
Yes, sir.
Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection systems.
We have a positive visual from the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1.
- Mullion?
- Sir?
Sir, armed and ready.
Shall I target the main structure?
Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine?
One of the principal tenets of Eastern martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.
This is ridiculous.
It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island.
On the other hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.
The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue.
All we need to do is give them a victim.
- Commence targeting.
- Straightaway, sir.
Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
Fire.
Red alert.
What the?
Warning.
Impact imminent.
Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island.
Mayday.
Mayday!
Red alert.
Red alert.
Switching to command and control center.
How bad, Brains?
Thunderbird 5, major damage sustained.
Possible m-m-m... possible strike by a m-m-m...
- Meteor?
-  Yup.
Thunderbirds are go!
- Check retros.
- Go.
Guidance systems green.
Go to maximum thrust.
There goes the cavalry.
But who will rescue the rescuers?
Alan!  Tintin!
Thunderbird 5 has been hit!
- Thunderbird 5 has been hit!
- Okay, okay.  Don't panic!
On the other hand...
Run!
- We made land.
- Cut them off.
Activating communications blackout.
Warning. Intruder alert.
-  Communications failure.
- What the h-h-h...
-  Warning.  Intruder alert.
-... devil is going on?
Communications failure.
- Mr. Tracy, do you copy?
- Warning. Intruder alert.
- Thunderbird 3, please À respond.
How'd they find the island?
Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1?
- Do you think À I ruined everything?
- No.
That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.
We have to do something.
My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?
The vents.
Let's go!
We have to get a message to my dad.
-  Emergency power to 10%.
- I'm losing all power.
-  Emergency power to 10%.
- Repeat.
-  I'm losing all power.
- Hold on, we're coming in.
- Gordon, prepare for immediate docking.
- You got it, Dad.
Reverse main thrusters on my mark.
Three, two,
- one.
- Easy, watch the roll.
Roll index angle minus two degrees.
Initiate docking sequence.
- We're locked on.
-  Nice work.
Docking sequence complete.
- Tunnel hatch secured.
Emergency packs, boys.
Let's move!
-  Air lock pressure equalized.
- We're in.  Let's go!
John!
- Scott, tackle that fire.
- Okay.
- Am I glad to see you guys.
- Easy, you're hurt.
Virgil, take care of your brother.
Gordon, give me a damage assessment.
Come on, hurry.
One-inch steel plate.
With sequential titanium locking mechanism.
I love a challenge.
Watch out for the guards.
Get in! Get in!
Who-who-who-who...
- What's going on?
- So this is Mount Olympus.
And these are the Thunderbirds.
I should have guessed.
Jeff Tracy.
The billionaire ex-astronaut, of course.
Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident?
Avalanche, wasn't it?
How tragic.
Just keep going straight ahead.
Okay.
Professor Hackenbacker?
We met at last year's international conference on nanotechnology.
I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely...
- stimulating.
- Transom, concentrate.
Sorry, sir.
The command control switch is here.
Fingerprint recognition system.
Professor.
Please.
- Activate À the control switch.
- N-n-n-n... you must be kidding.
You and I share an interest in the science of the mind.
The difference is I was born with my powers.
Trust me when I tell you you've barely touched the surface.
Even the strongest minds can be broken.
It would be a pity to break yours.
Fu-fu-fu... no way.
Activate the control switch, Prof.
Like a puppet on a string.
Activating command and control.
Activating command and control.
- We have control.
- Get up.
Sorry, Professor.
Nothing personal.
We got a caution and warning light on our EPS system!
Attempt manual override!
No, that's negative!
That's it.
Okay, this one.
Back to Thunderbird 3, now.
John, we gotta move.
The locking mechanism's jammed!
Attention Thunderbird 5. You can see I've taken over your facilities.
You no longer control your operational systems.
They've taken over.
Warm them up,
Transom.
Increasing temperature to maximum.
- Who's the bald freak?
- You.
Dad!
They've got my dad.
Okay, you have our attention.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Oh, how rude of me.
You can call me "The Hood."
Now, listen, Mr. Tracy, we won't be negotiating.
I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world starting with the Bank of London.
The world's monetary system will be in chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible.
You'll never get away with it!
- Why the Thunderbirds?
- An eye À for an eye, Mr. Tracy.
An eye for an eye?
Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, Kyrano.
I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy.
I thought he was dead.
Take them away.
Yes, sir.
Whoa.
That makes The Hood my uncle?
Every family has a black sh-sh... black sh...
This vent's murdering my allergies.
You left me to die that day.
You may have broken my body, but you have no idea how powerful my mind has become.
Now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come.
Wait!
Scott, status report.
CO-2 levels are rising.
Wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air.
How long will that give us?
About four hours.
Someone's there.
Time to go.
- Ow!
Run, run!
No, jump.
We can get through to the silos.
Apparently the island is not as secure as you thought.
Children?
Did you find any children?
Here they are.
Thunderbird 2 silo, in the loading arm.
Seal them in.
Hold on!
Whoa!
- The doors, you guys. À Let's go, come on!
- Go, go!
This way.
- No!
- They've got us trapped. À What do we do now?
If we can get to Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel.
But we need a plan.
- I'll use
À the Thunderizer on the door.
- Elevator active.
- You guys get the goons À with the firefly.
This equipment is only to be used in an emergency.
- I guess this qualifies.
- Yeah.
Here they come!
Fermat, can you drive this thing?
Uh... no.
Hey watch it!
I took microbiology, not driver's ed.
- Set the pressure À to maximum.
- Got it.
Retreat!
Whoo!
Let's move it!
That's it.
Time to thunderize.
Yes!
Come on, let's go!
Get them!
- Where's Fermat?
- Fermat!
- Fermat!  Hurry up!
- Coming!
- What were you doing À back there, Fermat?
- I had an n-n... idea.
Just try and keep up, okay.
I'll open the tunnel.
We gotta keep moving.
Access denied.
- Go back, yell when you À see them coming.
Access denied.
Alan.
You can run if you want.
Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me?
It is frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect.
But perhaps you already suspected that about your father.
Why did he build these magnificent machines?
Do you suppose it was guilt?
Because he let your mother die.
Open the door, Alan.
Open the door.
We can't go this way!
He's there!
No!
Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan?
I don't know.
I'm thinking, okay?
Keep backing up.
I've got an idea.
- That's your idea?
- It's not me you're angry À at, Alan.
It's not you
I'm aiming at.
Get them!
Transom, fire up
Thunderbird 1.
And set to broil.
- No sign of them.
-  Of course not.
The little brats went up like firecrackers.
Pop. Pop. Pop.
Don't... give him the satisfaction,
Professor.
This has taken too long.
Pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2.
- No more delays.
- Yes, sir.
How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
Relax, it's just a little water.
I could have d-drowned.
You mean you can't swim?
I repeat, I could have d-drowned.
I said I was sorry,
Fermat.
Let's just put this behind us, okay?
We gotta watch each other's backs.
- Nice drawers.
- Thank you
- Boo!
- Ah!
- Come on, stay there.
- You're worse than À a couple of girls.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Those are nice drawers.
Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5
- via satellite, right?
- Right.
So there's a minuscule possibility that if we reach the island's satellite station we could...
- Blow it up.
- No, we could hack into it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.
- Good thinking, Fermat. À Let's do it.
- Thank you.
Here's the plan.
We're here, right?
So we go along the shore, around the mountain to the access road here.
Then up to the transmitter.
So what do you think?
Good, except we're here, not there.
And the transmitter is there, not here.
We have to go through the jungle.
But that's f-f... off limits.
It's gonna be dangerous.
I'm in.
We gotta get up there fast.
Our folks are in trouble and if
The Hood gets off the island...
He's not going anywhere for now.
It's the guidance processor from Thunderbird 2.
It can't take off without it.
You're a genius.
How did you get this?
Alan, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you.
Parker?
- M'lady?
We have an emergency.
What a charming fellow.
Come in.
Have a look at this,
Parker.
He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
Sounds like an alias to me, m'lady.
Quite right,
Parker.
Real name
Trangh Belagant.
Assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of Malaya.
Oh, perfect, Parker.
The Thunderbirds rescued over
500 mineworkers in the collapse.
Including
Mr. Belagant's brother.
M'lady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.
How's my schedule for today, Parker?
You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally, there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
- I suppose that's urgent?
-  Yes, m'lady.
There's also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta.
- The Thunderbirds À still haven't responded?
- No, m'lady.
And the media is awash in speculation vis... vis their whereabouts.
Over to Lisa Lowe.
Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds.
Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in Jakarta.
Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines to carry out...
I think it's time to send the emergency signal.
I fear you are not wrong, m'lady.
Lisa Lowe.
Back to you, Chuck.
I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.
What do you mean, Alan?
Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
Don't be silly,
Alan.
Everything can be explained by science.
I'm trying to figure out his weakness.
Everybody has an Achilles' heel.
Well my Achilles' heel is actually my Achilles' heel.
It's got a blister the size of a basketball.
Tintin!
- Can we s-s-s...
- Stop?
- Yes.
- No.
Okay.
No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
- Any word?À
- Nothing, m'lady.
Right, tell Lord Marlborough
I've broken my shooting arm.
We shall send the Institute of the Blind a dozen guide dogs.
And bring the car around.
Yes, m'lady.
The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble and I don't like that.
Let's go, Parker.
Ready for launch.
We'll use this to get into the vaults.
Subtle as usual, Mullion.
Didn't realize we'd be getting points for style.
We're robbing banks, remember?
Don't worry, you'll get your money.
Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics.
What's going on?
Guidance processor error.
- It's the guidance processor.
What's wrong with it?
There isn't one.
Clever Alan.
- It's the children. À They have it.
- No way.
They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
I did.
Get them, Mullion.
Take whatever you need.
Make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper.
Alan, don't you think
Tintin is blossoming?
Blossoming?!
What's that suppose to mean?
Come on, Alan.
You have a c-c... crush on her.
You gotta be kidding.
I mean she's... she's not that bad,
I guess.
Okay, guys, take five.
Five isn't gonna do it.
Guys?
Don't move.
What is it?
Androctonus scorpion.
Is that dangerous?
.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
So, "dangerous" is, in fact, an understatement.
Watch out!
- Tintin, what was that?
- Let's get going.
Hey!
She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.
- You think?
- Must run in the family.
Did you do that?
- Just drop it, okay?
Still think everything can be explained by science?
Not girls.
Whoa!
- Scott, Gordon. À You all right?
- We're okay.
- The heat À exchanger's blown.
- You don't say.
Come on, those brats are in here somewhere.
How are we doing,
Fermat?
Don't rush me, Alan.
This is very delicate equipment.
Which is now b-broken.
- Can you fix it?
- Y-y... maybe but,
I'll need something to solder with.
We're in the middle of nowhere, Fermat.
We are you gonna find something like that?
What?
Ow!
Perfect.
Gee, Alan, I never would have figured you for a cry-baby.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What did he say?
I think it was some sort of apology.
Hmm.
That's...
I got it, yes!
You're the man, Fermat.
Okay, the first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 5.
- Dad!
- It's Alan.
Dad! - Alan, where are you?
À Are you safe?
I'm at the relay station with Fermat and Tintin.
Fermat's gonna hack into the main computer system and give control back to you.
-  We're standing by.
- Okay, we're almost there.
Goodness me, Professor.
You're so good-looking without your glasses on.
I think you may find that's another thing we have in common.
Pretty?
Unauthorized transmission.
- Oh, now, that's not fair.
Just when things were starting to sizzle.
Unauthorized transmission.
A burst of transmission from the island satellite station.
- Should I jam it?
- And give Mullion À the co-ordinates.
Take the main track south east then head up Satellite Hill.
They're on to us!
We're being jammed!
- Can you finish?
- I'll try.
- Alan, what's happening?
- Hang in there, Dad. À One more minute!
It's not going to work. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
Can you hear me?
They're jamming our signal.
We're gonna lose you.
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.
Negative.
It's too dangerous.
Follow emergency procedure.
Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point.
Can you read me?
Alan!
- Dad!
- Alan, we're losing you!
- Alan!
Dad!
- No!
- Useless!
- It is now.
- I'm sorry, Alan.
This is hard on all of us.
No, it's okay.
I'm fine.
You don't have to be such a tough guy, Alan.
I'm worried about my dad, too.
I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
But The Hood knows we're alive now.
We have to go.
Even worse.
They know exactly...
Where we are!
Come on!
Great, more water!
Tintin, can you slow them down?
- I'd be delighted.
- Then do it and meet us À at the junkyard.
Come on, Fermat.
This will get us outta here.
There.
Come on.
Straight ahead.
Ah!
It's gonna make this thing hard to control.
- Be careful not to exceed À four bars of boost or else...
- I said no problem.
- We gotta get out À of here. What's this?
- It's a hoversled.
It's our ticket out of here, unless you've got a better idea.
- Let's wait for Lady Penelope À like your dad said.
- Here.
Great plan. Let's sit here and wait to get caught.
I say we have to do something.
Now.
Right Fermat?
Actually,
I agree with Tintin.
I don't think this is s-safe.
You don't think anything is s-s-s-safe.
Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong.
If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team.
Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote or do you want to get out of here?
'Cause I'm going.
You can be a real jerk sometimes.
Go!
Oh, no!
Come on, faster!
Alan, you're going to fast!
I need more speed to get him by the trees.
Hang on!
What did I tell you guys?
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, not the fridge.
- Tintin!
- Hey, son.
- Sweetheart, are you okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
Cool off, kid.
Tracy Island approaching.
Switching to aqua mode.
Isn't life fun sometimes?
Rib-tickling, m'lady.
What is it?
We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed.
Lady P.
Whew, somebody roll down a window, it's getting a little hot in here.
Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes.
- Oxygen's out in 30, À so we won't feel a thing.
- Stop it!
Come on, Dad.
Situation's hopeless.
No, there's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.
Alan?
He's just a kid.
He's a Tracy.
- This doesn't look good.
- No, m'lady.
That bougainvillea is absolutely parched and someone should do something about that hideous hammock.
Whom do we have here?
Mullion!
I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tai kwan do.
- And I know Parker.
- M'lady.
- You've broken my nose.
- Yes, that was the intention À of the maneuver.
- Whoa!
- One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual slash conversational level, but sometimes it's just not possible.
Ow!  Oh!
Shall I bring the car around, m'lady?
Parker, have a bit of a lie down.
Excuse me, m'lady.
Ah.
Lady Penelope.
Of course. He has his palace, why not his princess?
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days?
Ow!
Boo!
Coming through, m'lady!
Duck, m'lady!
He's weak.
Using his power makes him weak.
Whoa!
You're a formidable opponent.
More than a match for most men.
That's not saying much, then, is it?
I suggest you let us pass.
Don't try your parlor games on me, you sad little man.
You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island and in about four seconds,
I'm going to get quite cross with you.
How are you, Alan?
I hope you don't think
I'm going to chase you.
You can make it stop, Alan!
You have something
À that belongs to me.
Really, sir, don't mind me.
This isn't the first time
I've been pulverized.
And it's never did any real harm before.
- Ow!
- Stop, I'll give it to you.
Fetch!
You made a match of it.
I'll give you that.
Put them with the others.
You're coming with me.
Put me down!
This outfit is couture.
Don't go to sleep.
John, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.
- You need to cool off, lady.
- Lady Penelope.
Big oaf!
Right, that's quite enough losing for one day.
How does it feel to be right all the time?
Not bad, actually.
I'm so sorry, Fermat.
We make quite a pair.
It's hard for me to t-t-talk.
It's hard for you to l-l-listen.
Parker, I have an idea.
Excellent, m'lady.
Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?
I can't think.
I'm too c-cold.
Guidance processor installed.

Launch sequence, stage two.
- Yes.
- Good shot, m'lady.
Come on, Parker.
Let's give those bad guys a good trashing.
Hydraulic systems green.
Guidance systems green.
Launch sequence, stage three.
This seems to be a straight forward six lever mortise.
- I love it when your checkered past comes in handy.
- Thank you, m'lady.
Unfortunately, I feel I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism.
Will this suffice, Parker?
Most certainly, m'lady.
I didn't actually need it anyway.
Of course not, m'lady.
- Quick, they're getting away.
- Okay, everyone get to À the control room.
Hat?
Get in there quick, Fermat. and save my family.
Then we'll get The Hood.
Good luck.
Access to mainframe denied.
Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes.
- I'll follow your lead, son.
- Thunderbird 5, come in.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
How long do they got before re-entry?
90 seconds, and counting.
Access to mainframe confirmed.
Okay, I just need someone on their end to confirm the access protocol.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
Dad, come on, are we coming through?
Mr. Tracy, can you hear me?
Come in.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
- Dad, come on!
- Mr. Tracy, can you here me? À Come in.
-  Dad!
- Thunderbird 5, come in.
- How long do they got?
- 45 seconds until re-entry.
Damn it, Jeff, wake up!
I think that's the first time you've ever called me by my first name, Brains.
Thanks for waking me.
- Dad.
- Alan.
Well done.
Mr. Tracy?
Confirm access protocol.
Confirmed.
We are back on-line.
Gravity is restored.
Put Thunderbird f-f... your craft into geostationary orbit immediately.
- FAB, Brains.
- Geostationary orbit re-established.
Looks like we're good to go.
- Dad, are you all right?
-  We're fine.
We still have a job to do.
Where's The Hood?
He's in Thunderbird 2.
He's headed for L-l-l...
- London.
- She's right.
He's got them all on board.
Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad.
We'll never get there on time.
Let me go after The Hood.
He'll destroy everything you've built, everything the Thunderbirds stand for.
- Negative.
- I'm sorry, it's too risky.
- I can do this, you know I can.
What am I saying?
We can do this.
Okay, Alan.
We'll meet you there.
- Thunderbirds are go!
- fab.
Okay, boys, we are outta here.
- Are we really going?
- Yep.
Oh, boy.
- Ready, Fermat?
- N-n...
I guess.

Thunderbird 1, come in.
- Roger, Brains.
-  Situation update.
Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation.
FAB.
Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.
I know The Hood's weakness,
Fermat.
I can stop him if we get there in time.
Stand by.
We're going to maximum thrust.
Gordon, heat 'em up.
We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds.
Lisa, are you there?
Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing causing total panic in Central London.
As far as we know, there's been no emergency call from this area.
So it's unclear why Thunderbird
2 would be active here at all.
I don't know if you can see this, but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.
Set a course for the vault.
Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll severe the monorail's subterranean supports.
- Shall I correct our position?
- Stay on course.
But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.
No we won't.
The Thunderbirds will.
- Get us down, boys.
- Initiate landing, Fermat.
- Right.
- Three-point landing sequence initiated.
Retros to 75.
Flaps 16.
Fab.
Danger.
Landing sequence error.
- You're going too fast!
- Thanks.  Retros to 90.
Textbook, boys.
Activating electromagnetic pulse to disable the bank's security systems.
ETA one minute.
Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.
Yes, m'lady.
Let it out, boys!
- The Hood's getting away.
- Those people can't hold À on much longer.
- What are you gonna do?
- We're the Thunderbirds.
Our duty is to save those people.
Brains, we're going into the accident zone.
FAB,
Thunderbird 2 and good luck.
Brains, the monorail is down!
Repeat!
The monorail is down!
I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4.
Automatic pilot.
You have the bridge.
- Me? Fly alone?
- Fermat, the Thunderbirds À need you right now.
I need you.
FAB, Alan.
Manual control.
Brains, come in.
What's the situation?
The Hood has caused major disaster with the vault. The mono-ma-mono... one track railway is down in the Themes.
- Where's Thunderbird 1?
- It's on the ground.
The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2.
FAB, we're right behind them.
Look at all this gold!
Stay focused.
Nine more banks to go.
Fermat, deploying
Thunderbird 4 in three two... one.
Thunderbird 4 is go.
I can see the monorail.
Mommy!
Don't panic, guys.
Extending magnetic claw.
Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place.
Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it?
I can't get a clear fix on the target.
I might hit the passengers.
I'll go and fix it myself.
- What, you mean  swim?
- Get me as close as you can.
How we doing on that line, Fermat?
Just look out your window.
Come on, Tintin.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Tintin.
You can do this.
Opening the airlock.
Contact magnets activated.
Okay, Fermat.
We need a lift.
FAB, Alan.
Commencing reverse thrust.
That was amazing,
Tintin.
Thank you.
Nice job, Fermat.
Nothing to it, really.
Easy does it.
There they are!
Glad you could finally join us.
Hey, don't get cocky after one mission.
We still have a dangerous situation here.
I need you boys to close down this accident scene.
Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us at
Thunderbird 1. Alan, come with me.
- Let's clean it up.À - We've got to get to À the Bank of London.
Penelope went after the Hood.
I know, she may need our help.
Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds.
Lady Penelope.
What an unpleasant surprise.
Don't be rude.
I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull this big trigger.
Now don't move!
Mullion.
- That's not cricket!
- I'm sorry.
The only part of the sport
I ever liked was winning.
How ghastly.
Hey Dad.
That stuff the Hood said, about you leaving him to die,
- he was lying, right?
- No.
You see, you can't save everyone, Alan.
It doesn't matter how hard you try, or how brave you are.
It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give up your life in a second to save.
You just can't save everyone.
What was Mom like?
She was a lot like you.
Come on, we've got a job to do.
- Finish her off, Mullion.
- Shame on you.
I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs.
Oh, dream on, sad act.
- Good timing, Parker.
- Good afternoon, À Mr. Tracy.
- Come with us.
- My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.
The Thunderbirds.
They're here.
Kill them all.
Alan, you guys stay here with Parker.
- I'm gonna find Lady Penelope.
- But what about The Hood?
Look out, Parker!
Master Tracy!
- Look out, Parker!
- All right, that's enough À of that.
Don't move.
Go on, then.
- I'm sorry, I can't hit a lady.
- Allow me.
I've been waiting to get my hands on you little brats.
And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.
Now that was a punch.
Parker, can we wrap this up?
What did you have in mind,
Master Hackenbacker?
Strategically speaking, the best odds of success
- lie with the Parker Haymaker.
- I concur.
Penny!
Jeff, no!
Did you save them all this time, Jeff?
Or did you leave someone behind?
I didn't make you what you are.
It's not me you have to convince.
- You leave my son À out of this.
- Dad!
Dad!  Dad!
I'm disappointed in you, Alan.
I thought we were kindred spirits.
Well, we're not.
I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
- Yes, you certainly are.
- No!
Alan, no!
Alan!
Come here, you little minx!
Oh!  Ah!
Bye, bye.
Alan, stay back.
You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps.
- Let him go.
- Did you really think À you could challenge me?
- Let him go, please!
- Let him go!
Please, let him go!
PenelopeAlan!  Alan, are you all right?
Alan, get out, run!
He's getting weaker.
- He can't last much longer.
- Neither can you!
Alan, no!
Look out!
Alan!
I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff.
Goodbye, Alan.
- No!
- Oh.
Ah.
Oh.
Leave me, Alan.
Leave me to die.
Like your father did.
- I don't want
À to save your life.
- Aah!
- But that's what we do.
See you soon, Jeff.
Now that was definitely showing off.
- Get off me!
- Settle, mate. À You calm down.
- Gordon.
- Nice catch.
- Hey, Scott.
- Get him.
- Jeff, what did you put À in these margaritas?
- A Tracy secret.
That's my boy.
One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a f-f... do-do-do... sha-sha-sha... aquatic creature.
- Good job, Ferm.
- Thanks.
- So what do you think?
- He's getting there.
Whoa, Tintin.
Ah, you just really...
- Blossoming.
- Ew!
- Did you say blossoming?
Gather round, everybody.
I have an announcement to make.
Tonight is a special night.
We're all together, because of three very special people:
Fermat, Tintin,
Alan.
The world needs Thunderbirds.
And the Thunderbirds need you.
- Mr. Tracy.
- Thank you, sir.
Congratulations, Alan.
No shortcuts.
You earned it.
You all did.
I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest nut must crack.
- Hey, way to go, sprout.
- That's my boy, Alan.
Yes, Madam President.
I see.  Of course.
Straightaway.
Boys!
Sorry, Penny.
Duty calls.
Of course it does.
And quite right, too.
Thunderbirds are go!
Fast as you can, Parker.
Certainly, m'lady.

{12307}{12422}- Actually, I'm trying to wake up.|- I'm sorry, but you're not dreaming.
{12442}{12536}- You're dead. Capisce?|- I'm not dead.
{12542}{12663}Come here! What you're feeling|right now is totally normal.
{12669}{12787}Dying is a real shock to the system,|but it's going to get better.
{12817}{12934}It's Heaven, baby. The food is great,|the women are beautiful,
{12940}{13028}and the music, Lance...|the music is hot.
{13065}{13157}- The fun never stops.|- That's great, but I'm not dead.
{13187}{13335}I've got an audition, so you guys|can fix the mistake and get me home.
{13348}{13404}Serge?
{13410}{13511}Could you check the list|and see when Mr Barton is arriving?
{13517}{13639}Barton...? Ah!|Due November 17th, 2044.
{13645}{13717}6.30 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.
{13723}{13851}2044... You could have just given me|the year! Leave a brother a little doubt.
{13856}{13957}I took him before the truck hit.|He couldn't have made it!
{13963}{14054}First you make Frank Sinatra|wait for a table...
{14060}{14158}- He didn't have a jacket!|- Sinatra can wear what he wants!
{14164}{14235}You killed me! You killed me!
{14267}{14367}Mr King has been in charge up here|for some time.
{14373}{14451}There's nothing he can't handle.
{14457}{14565}- So you guys can fix this?|- I pride myself on talking straight.
{14571}{14690}If a guy's lived a bad life,|I tell him to go to Hell, literally.
{14705}{14764}You, on the other hand... I like you.
{14770}{14908}You're what you call... you're very...|What's the word? Very...
{14914}{14974}- Funny?|- No. You're spunky!
{14980}{15054}- Spunky?!|- Spunky! So, here's the story.
{15071}{15158}Your body's gone.|Adiós, sayonara. Comprende?
{15164}{15248}- But I spoke to my boss.|- You talked to God?
{15254}{15396}Yeah. We can put you in somebody|else's body if no one knows he's dead.
{15402}{15515}How am I supposed to do my act|in somebody else's body?
{15521}{15596}This is all part of some grand plan.
{15602}{15653}- Really?|- Sure.
{15659}{15730}Anyway, let's go find you a body.
{16163}{16308}- This one's kind of like a fixer-upper.|- I don't think so!
{16356}{16450}How about this one?|He's got nice pecs.
{16456}{16600}Big, not funny. Nobody wants to laugh|at a guy who could whip their ass.
{16606}{16680}Hey, Joey, help me! I can't...
{16817}{16885}He's perfect!
{16891}{16955}Picky, picky! Really picky!
{17184}{17229}Who lives here?
{17235}{17313}Charles Wellington.|Fifteenth richest man in America.
{17319}{17426}He owns sporting teams,|cable companies, you name it.
{17432}{17505}Just finished building this penthouse.
{17511}{17595}If I don't like the body,|can I keep the crib?
{17601}{17687}- How did you do that?|- I'm an angel. I can do what I want.
{17829}{17893}- What is it?|- Cocktails, madam.
{17898}{17963}Of course. Thank you, Wanda.
{17969}{18037}It's my pleasure, Mrs Wellington.
{18103}{18192}- Is that the guy?|- No. That's Winston Sklar,
{18198}{18321}Wellington's private secretary. They're|waiting for his body to be discovered.
{18327}{18415}- They're trying to kill him.|- We've got to do something!
{18421}{18480}Thank you, Wanda.
{18542}{18677}"Thank you, Wanda." Who does she|think she is? Frigid, stuck-up bitch!
{18683}{18806}If you want to thank me, get your|husband to pay me a decent wage.
{18812}{18896}One more face-lift,|she'll be farting out of her nose!
{18902}{19046}Why haven't they found him yet? I'm|a dirty murderer. I should be punished!
{19141}{19229}- Punish me!|- Oh, I'll punish you.
{19276}{19307}Lance?
{19313}{19366}Call the cops!
{19372}{19514}I was on vacation and he flew me in from|North Carolina to change the channel.
{19520}{19567}Call the cops!
{19636}{19778}Hola! Mamacita! Nueve-uno-uno!|Nueve-uno-uno!
{19810}{19872}- Where's the phone?|- No can do.
{19878}{19997}The phone company doesn't serve|dead people. You need a body!
{20003}{20083}Well, find me another body!
{20089}{20148}I'm not leaving|until I see Mr Wellington.
{20179}{20257}- I'll see what I can do.|- Let him know that I'm here.
{20293}{20340}Mr Sklar, sir?
{20346}{20446}It's Miss Jenkins.|She insists on seeing Mr Wellington.
{20452}{20531}I'm sorry to bust in...|Well, actually, I'm not!
{20537}{20608}That's her! That's the girl.
{20634}{20751}Hey, remember me?|On the bike - run over?
{20757}{20854}No, that's all right.|What can we do for you?
{20860}{20978}- I think that you should be arrested.|- Holy crap!
{20984}{21061}Your plans for the Brooklyn|Community Hospital are criminal.
{21067}{21122}Oh, so you mean that...
{21128}{21228}You throw those words around...|"Arrested." Kind of hit me!
{21234}{21298}That really... ooh!
{21304}{21372}I don't think there's anything funny.
{21378}{21493}It's the only public health facility|in the area, and you just bought it.
{21499}{21615}My uncle went there for a new liver,|they sent his ass to the supermarket.
{21621}{21718}If it goes private, the people|won't have any place to turn.
{21724}{21833}That's awful. You should take it up|with Mr Wellington...
{21839}{21885}I've been there twenty times,
{21891}{21985}I've made 200 phone calls,|and he seems to never be in.
{21991}{22055}So I decided to visit his home.
{22061}{22175}- He's unavailable, I guarantee you.|- I'll wait until he is available.
{22181}{22269}- I'm afraid you can't.|- Yes, I can!
{22362}{22457}Would you like to call the police?|I'm sure the press are interested.
{22463}{22581}- No, no... Let's don't even...|- I thought so!
{22587}{22698}If I take this guy's body,|could I help her out?
{22704}{22814}- You got the hots for her, huh?|- You're trying to sell me a body, right?
{22820}{22903}- Well, let's see it.|- OK.
{22909}{23025}Would you stop it? This ain't Star Trek.|I'm used to walking.
{23031}{23114}Lance Barton - Charles Wellington.
{23244}{23342}- Mr Wellington, please, don't get up.|- Damn, he's dead!
{23348}{23396}Nice bed, though.
{23402}{23530}So, that's what I'll look like?|I can't go to the Apollo in that body.
{23535}{23612}- I won't get any laughs.|- He looks funny to me.
{23618}{23718}I already get booed.|Do I really need to get beat down?
{23724}{23790}You want to meet the girl,|you take the body.
{23796}{23879}In a moment it'll be too late.
{23885}{24004}For good? Could I just be him|while you find me a better body?
{24010}{24068}You mean take it on loan?
{24074}{24157}Normally I have a problem with that,
{24163}{24252}but since we screwed up... it's a deal.
{24258}{24341}Mr Wellington, a Miss Sontee Jenkins|to see you.
{24367}{24419}Still bathing, are we?
{24465}{24548}We don't want our fingers|to go all pruney.
{24719}{24777}- Hey, it worked!|- What?
{24783}{24896}- You weren't sure it would work?|- Relax, I've read the manual.
{24902}{24975}Hey, I still look like me!
{24981}{25079}- You are you.|- I thought you said I was Wellington.
{25085}{25178}- You are Wellington.|- Thanks for clearing that up!
{25184}{25294}To everyone else you look like him,|you sound like him,
{25300}{25438}you even smell like him.|But you see yourself. Simple, huh?
{25483}{25581}- Is everýthing all right?|- You can answer him. Go ahead.
{25587}{25663}- Everýthing's cool.|- Not too cool, I hope.
{25669}{25738}Everýthing's all right!
{25744}{25843}And they'll see Wellington,|not some brother in his clothes?
{25849}{25926}- I don't feel like getting shot!|- You'll be all right!
{26138}{26196}So, you the butler?
{26202}{26250}Yes, sir...
{26274}{26327}...me the butler.
{26355}{26426}So you do all the buttlin'|around here?
{26457}{26519}Yes, indeed, sir.
{26540}{26637}- Whose butler are you?|- Your butler, sir.
{26643}{26701}You're my butler?
{26707}{26810}Don't cheat on me. If I see you buttlin'|for somebody else, I may kill them.
{26898}{26972}- Now, who am l?|- You, sir?
{26998}{27092}- You... Mr Wellington?|- Who am l?
{27109}{27140}Mr Wellington.
{27146}{27278}You're damn right I'm Wellington.|Yes, I got a body! I got a body!
{27284}{27384}You certainly have!|Would you care to get dressed?
{27390}{27448}Take that corpse for a spin!
{27454}{27554}So where does he keep...|where do I keep my clothes?
{27560}{27646}- In the closet, sir.|- I've got a closet! And a body!
{27652}{27758}I've got a body!|Let's go to the closet. Peace out!
{27764}{27822}Yeah! I'm Wellington!
{27828}{27906}- I'm Wellington!|- Good morning, Mr Wellington.
{27912}{28011}- You'd better recognise.|- I know you, you cheap bastard!
{28067}{28154}Tiger Woods, y'all,|Tiger, Tiger Woods, y'all.
{28171}{28229}Hey, Tiger Woods, y'all!
{28252}{28323}- Hi, darling.|- I'll deal with you two later.
{28501}{28610}How you doing? I'm Charles Wellington.|America's 1 5th richest man.
{28616}{28649}I know who you are!
{28681}{28730}Would you give us some privacy?
{28817}{28912}- Could I help you out?|- I don't need your help.
{28918}{29041}You have been avoiding me,|and now you're going to listen.
{29047}{29095}It's about people's lives.
{29101}{29206}Sick people, poor people.|People that you care nothing about.
{29212}{29340}They are going to be in desperate|trouble if you close the hospital.
{29346}{29433}See you later!|I'll get you a new body. Good luck!
{29439}{29478}Hey, but...
{29484}{29552}We are the only|county hospital in the area.
{29558}{29693}And you chose to privatise it|and kick sick, broke people out.
{29699}{29784}- What kind of man are you?|- Sounds like I'm an asshole.
{29790}{29871}- You think this is a joke.|- No.
{29877}{30001}This is a joke: a prostitute|and a car dealer go... Forget it!
{30007}{30094}I know all about|your board meeting on Monday.
{30100}{30238}- The one that's closed to the public.|- Glad you told me. I gotta get a haircut.
{30244}{30303}Get serious, 'cause I'll be there.
{30309}{30424}I'll bring every television camera|and news reporter I can find.
{30430}{30575}We'll make a party! We'll bring|some friends, get some chips, a DJ.
{30581}{30714}- And we get on this hospital thing!|- This meeting is over. Goodbye!
{30720}{30793}I'm serious! I'm not joking. I...
{30838}{30895}Is something wrong?
{30921}{30996}I lost the keys to the handcuffs.
{31002}{31122}Didn't your mama tell you to carry|a extra handcuff key? OK...
{31128}{31203}I'm just playing with you.|I'll look for the key.
{31209}{31299}It's not up there... it's not there...
{31337}{31394}There it is! No... roach.
{31400}{31464}There you go... got it!
{31513}{31628}You know what I've got right here?|I got your freedom!
{31634}{31706}I'm just playing. Let me get it...
{31712}{31766}Don't worry.
{31799}{31857}See? Everýthing's all right.
{31926}{31978}Thank you, bastard!
{32036}{32067}I was just playing!
{32226}{32285}What happened?|I put the pills in his drink...
{32291}{32436}I'll tell you, you blew it!|You've ruined us. You idiot!
{32442}{32507}- You incompetent moron!|- You bitch!
{32513}{32574}- Retard!|- Rich bitch!
{32580}{32630}Fat old bitch!
{32661}{32715}Now we're talking...
{32875}{32947}Honey, I'm home!
{32984}{33060}You want to put|a little English on the top...
{33066}{33145}I just want to say|that I know y'all tried to kill me.
{33248}{33371}- Darling, that's ridiculous!|- From what I hear, I'm an asshole.
{33396}{33484}So I figure we're even: I was|an asshole, you tried to kill me.
{33490}{33586}- What are you talking about?|- I know you tried to kill me.
{33592}{33724}So let's just move on. We're adults,|so what you tried to kill me?
{33730}{33833}We're never going to have|a good relationship till you admit it.
{33839}{33957}- OK... we tried to kill you.|- Gotcha! Police, here they are!
{33963}{34091}- I'm sorry!|- Just playing, I'm not going to tell.
{34096}{34211}But I do need a favour. How can|I get in touch with Sontee Jenkins?
{34217}{34327}We can find out. Should I call|our usual problem solvers?
{34333}{34416}Maybe if they visit her,|she'll change her tune.
{34422}{34493}Does she have a dog? We could kill it.
{34499}{34593}I don't have a problem with her.|I want to ask her out on a date.
{34644}{34689}Charles... !
{34695}{34792}You were getting ready|to have sex on the pool table!
{34798}{34894}- You got an eight ball in your ass.|- You're wrong.
{34900}{34982}This isn't level,|and we were trying to...
{34988}{35066}Do me a favour, keep waxing that ass,|keep her off mine.
{35135}{35186}Waxing it?
{36707}{36766}How do you change channels?
{36786}{36842}How do you get MTV?
{36883}{36939}Showtime...
{36975}{37031}Playboy...
{37037}{37140}- Hey! BET.|- Not available.
{37589}{37647}Descending to stafflevel.
{37688}{37775}I'm gonna tell you.|Baking soda'll get that right out.
{37781}{37843}Does any TV in this house get BET?
{37849}{37936}- BET, Mr Wellington?|- Black Entertainment Television.
{37942}{38026}No, I know what BET is.
{38032}{38101}- You want to watch BET?|- Yeah.
{38107}{38183}The TV in the staff lounge gets BET.
{38189}{38292}- Would you mind if I watched TV?|- Not at all, Mr Wellington.
{38298}{38374}This is your house. Enjoy!
{38380}{38468}- Thanks a lot. Take care.|- Thank you.
{38474}{38524}You jungle-fever-having bastard!
{38530}{38647}It's not enough he bosses me around|upstairs? He got to come down here.
{38653}{38779}If he asks me to change the channel,|I'm going to cut his ass!
{38785}{38828}Wanda?
{38860}{38907}Yes, Mr Wellington?
{38913}{39047}- You don't like me, do you?|- Oh, no. I like you just fine, sir.
{39053}{39150}She can't stand your ass.|You should hear her,
{39156}{39245}"I hate Wellington.|Boy, I hope he drops dead."
{39251}{39373}"Wellington stupido. Wellington cheapo.|Wellington assholo."
{39379}{39489}- Sir, it's just disrespectful.|- If I was you, I would hate me too.
{39495}{39614}Tell you what I'm gonna do.|You both get a 200% raise.
{39657}{39759}- Are you happy?|- I'm ecstatic.
{39765}{39825}Good. Take care!
{39894}{39976}I'll believe that bullshit|when I see my cheque.
{39982}{40052}All right, here we go. Come on, baby!
{40058}{40157}For Christ's sake, you gotta hit that.|It's a wide open three!
{40236}{40279}Come in!
{40342}{40447}Sir! Anything I can do for you?|I didn't hear the bell.
{40453}{40575}- Is there anybody else in here?|- I don't believe so, sir, no.
{40581}{40651}You're not from England, are you?
{40688}{40766}Of course I am, sir. I'm from London.
{40772}{40845}I was born in Fulham,|near the River Thames.
{40851}{40941}My father was a gentleman's|gentleman, and so am l.
{40947}{41003}I was right outside the door.|I heard you.
{41009}{41180}You put on this fake accent to make|rich folks feel comfortable. Good scam.
{41186}{41250}So, where you really from?
{41256}{41399}- I'm from Scarsdale. Crap! Am I fired?|- No, you're not. Mind if I watch BET?
{41405}{41481}Would you like me|to change the channel?
{41487}{41566}Drop the accent,|"Would you like me to change the..."
{41572}{41639}Just be yourself!
{41703}{41788}OK... Do you want a beer?
{41794}{41900}You know what?|Let me get it. You worked all day.
{41906}{41937}You got any Rheingolds?
{41988}{42136}The second amateur spot for the final|Apollo show has been awarded to
{42142}{42226}comedian Joe Guy from Brooklyn.|Stay tuned.
{42275}{42360}- Where are you going... sir?|- I've got to work on my material.
{42366}{42423}- Where's the nearest subway?|- Wanna take the car?
{42671}{42729}What's up, Snoop?
{42735}{42824}It's kind ofhard|being Snoop D-O double-G, Y
{42830}{42940}Keep coming up with funky ass shit|like every single day
{42970}{43027}What's up, museum?
{43033}{43115}Sipping on gin and juice|Laid back
{43121}{43185}With my mind on my money|And my money on my mind
{43276}{43327}Sipping on gin andjuice
{43333}{43426}With my mind on my money|And my money on my mind
{43474}{43540}Put up your "W"!
{44069}{44158}Are you ready for more comedy?|All right!
{44164}{44296}Our next act just won a spot|on the last night of the Apollo!
{44302}{44354}Give it up for Joe Guy!
{44393}{44502}What's up, brother?|This place is looking fine!
{44508}{44603}There's some fine-looking sisters,|except for you...
{44609}{44644}Sure this is a great idea?
{44650}{44778}- This place does seem a little...|- A little what?
{44783}{44845}It's a little dark in here.
{44851}{44912}Relax! These are my people.
{44956}{45054}There's no more little towns|in America.
{45060}{45131}The whole country is malls,
{45137}{45205}and every town's got two malls.
{45211}{45321}They got the white mall and the mall|white people used to go to.
{45327}{45404}Because there ain't nothing|in the black mall
{45410}{45487}but sneakers and baby clothes.
{45493}{45560}I guess that's all we doing,|running and screwing.
{45566}{45688}White people like their black|the same way they like their seasoning.
{45694}{45725}Just a dash!
{45760}{45895}You go to a white mall, it's all nice.|You got personal shoppers.
{45901}{46009}Go to a black mall and people say,|"Can I help you with your cheap shit?"
{46015}{46128}White people get some money...|Keep it. Stay rich. Kids get rich.
{46134}{46225}Black people get some money, it's the|countdown to "When's he going broke?"
{46281}{46357}White people die, leave a will.|Brother die and leave a bill.
{47111}{47188}Hi, it's Sontee. Leave me a message,|I'll call you back.
{47194}{47308}Hi, Sontee, Charles Wellington here,|the bastard. Remember me?
{47314}{47422}I was just wondering|if we can get together,
{47428}{47503}get something to eat,|catch a movie or something?
{47534}{47662}Hey, Sontee. Charles Wellington here...|Hope you like the flowers!
{47714}{47771}All right. Give me a call.
{47777}{47884}Charles Wellington again.|You haven't called me!
{47890}{47986}Can we get together,|catch a movie, a play... something?
{48015}{48100}Are you there?|Are you screening this call?
{48269}{48339}OK, I guess you're not there.
{48345}{48434}Hey, Sontee... Charles Wellington.|Are you there?
{48440}{48536}I know you're there! Pick up the phone!|I know you're there!
{48542}{48615}Hey! Just playing... Just playing!
{48621}{48689}Give me a call, OK?
{48793}{48868}Good morning!|Your answering machine is broken.
{48874}{48973}Not broken, but it is full!|Would you stop calling me?
{48979}{49029}- What are you doing here?|- I was in the neighbourhood.
{49035}{49136}What were you doing?|Shutting down old folks' homes?
{49142}{49211}I thought we could get in the Rolls,
{49217}{49302}have a little brunch,|discuss this whole hospital thing.
{49308}{49418}So, you're trying to impress me|with the car and the money?
{49424}{49473}Do you think I'm some video ho?
{49479}{49596}If you want to impress me,|do it at the board meeting.
{49602}{49738}- Why not spend some time together?|- Spend some time doing some good.
{49900}{50012}- You got a nice touch with the ladies.|- I can't get a girl in this body.
{50018}{50107}I definitely can't get any laughs.|Have you found anything yet?
{50113}{50178}I'm working on it. I was just in Havana.|Want one?
{50184}{50327}No! I want a body and I want it now!
{50333}{50414}You getting tough?|I'm a friggin' angel.
{50420}{50513}You don't want to be in Heaven,|or here. There is a third option.
{50519}{50604}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|I just need a body.
{50647}{50763}There's a big rap concert tonight...|Somebody's going to die!
{50769}{50882}Hey, don't forget about me!|Go to the rap concert.
{50888}{50976}It's over between us.|I can't do this any more.
{50982}{51086}Let's get out of here. We could go|some place he'll never find us.
{51092}{51161}Chechnya, East Timor... It'll be fun!
{51167}{51287}I can't. After all, he is my husband|and I love him.
{51293}{51394}And I'm going to do whatever I can|to get him back.
{51401}{51499}Bitch!|Scheming, double-crossing bitch!
{51505}{51603}That's sweet, Winston,|but it's too late.
{51662}{51727}We cannot allow WelICo to take over!
{51749}{51843}This is a very bad time|to make a personal appearance.
{51849}{51968}I've been looking into this hospital thing,|and I think she had a point.
{51974}{52023}Let's handle this the usual way.
{52029}{52134}You do the strong silent thing,|I'll field all the questions.
{52140}{52191}I won't let you down!
{52197}{52340}We can't have that! And there's one|man responsible, Charles Wellington!
{52346}{52386}You're a bad man!
{52422}{52469}Get out of here!
{52495}{52612}- Leave our hospital alone!|- Scumbag!
{52641}{52699}Now that you own|Brooklyn Community Hospital,
{52705}{52843}are you going to be turning away|those who can't pay?
{52849}{52923}Mr Wellington|doesn't have time right now.
{52929}{53068}I don't care what you got...|cancer, rickets, polio, swine flu,
{53074}{53193}the clap, dandruff, what else...|Lyme disease, lemon disease.
{53199}{53272}It don't matter, we'll take you.
{53278}{53353}- Liar!|- We won't take you!
{53383}{53476}- Thank you!|- Here they are, Mr Wellington,
{53482}{53588}the faces you didn't dare confront.|What do you have to say?
{53594}{53710}Hey, what's up, Wheelie?|Crutchie Crutch, how you doing?
{53716}{53812}Hey, Big IV. Save me a sip.|I want a sip now!
{53818}{53940}I know what's wrong with you - your|breath is destroying the environment.
{53958}{54036}Why don't you tell them|you don't care about them?
{54042}{54128}And why you locked the press|out of this meeting?
{54134}{54264}I must have been out of my mind.|Was I taking ecstasy that day?
{54270}{54366}We're going in there.|Sklar, grab a stretcher.
{54372}{54448}Everybody!|If you can walk, let's walk.
{54454}{54583}If you can't walk, it's time to roll.|Crutch your ass in there!
{54589}{54692}We are going in!|Come on, Big IV. Let's do this!
{54698}{54819}Sorry, brother. Can we get|some more juice for Big IV?
{54852}{54903}I've brought in|some friends from the media,
{54909}{55009}so if anybody's not|where they are supposed to be,
{55015}{55106}or got a little crust in their eyes,|you might want to get up right now.
{55112}{55181}You can't bring news cameras in here.
{55187}{55235}We've got nothing to hide.
{55241}{55355}If there's not enough seats,|sit on somebody's lap.
{55361}{55495}- So, what's up?|- At your hospital in Kentucky,
{55501}{55586}a teenager with a bullet wound|was sent to another hospital
{55592}{55665}fifteen miles away, dying en route.
{55671}{55740}Hospitals don't kill people, people do.
{55746}{55856}We can't send people out|with bullet wounds to their head.
{55862}{55919}You have to take that seriously.
{55925}{56033}We got a new slogan,|"Shot in the head, you get a bed."
{56039}{56095}"If your head is bloody,|we're your buddy."
{56101}{56229}I want bullet wounds to be treated|like cash - accepted everywhere!
{56295}{56423}- Not without adequate insurance?|- Is insurance really adequate?
{56428}{56501}When you pay for it,|do you feel assured?
{56507}{56600}They shouldn't call it insurance,|but "In case shit".
{56606}{56689}I give a company money|in case shit happens.
{56695}{56767}If it doesn't, shouldn't I get it back?
{56773}{56906}If I'd known you would keep the money,|I would've got in an accident!
{56912}{57029}If you're taking my money, at least|spend it on some poor sick people.
{57035}{57100}Don't buy a Mercedes Benz with it
{57106}{57225}and park in front of Brooklyn Hospital|where broke people walk by.
{57231}{57376}I just got off the bus and I've got|to look at it? I should stab the tyre!
{57382}{57513}And why do doctors cost so much?|Do you know? Shut the hell up!
{57519}{57632}It's like doctors charging|so much for a triple bypass surgery.
{57638}{57752}Going to charge somebody|a hundred thousand dollars!
{57758}{57827}And then got the nerve to say,|"Take it easy."
{57833}{57965}I've got to get a job driving another|cab, just to pay off the doctors!
{58012}{58061}We have to be different.
{58067}{58152}Let's see how it feels|to not be the evil corporation.
{58158}{58291}Let's try taking in people bleeding|with bullet wounds to the head.
{58297}{58402}We tried the other way.|We made a lot of money.
{58408}{58548}So what if we lose a few million dollars?|A lot of you look pissed off.
{58554}{58656}Look like y'all want to get froggy.|Well, come on!
{58662}{58762}What are you going to do?|You see this foot?
{58768}{58886}It's from a little town called "Rich Man's|Ass", and it's getting homesick.
{58892}{58977}You guys have been|a lovely audience.
{58983}{59088}I wanna thank you all for showing up.|Drive home safely!
{59094}{59164}I gots to go! Take care!
{59170}{59270}Thanks a lot.|Pardon me. Nice shirt!
{59379}{59517}Hey, Chuck! I feel like I haven't|been tending to your needs.
{59523}{59661}I know your biggest fantasy|has always been a ménage à trois,
{59667}{59752}and you've always liked|Blanche from the club...
{59788}{59860}Hi, Chuck!
{59866}{59964}How would you like|to come over and taste me?
{60062}{60169}- Sir, the handcuff lady's here.|- Sontee?
{60277}{60331}Mr Wellington.
{60362}{60462}- Just call me Lance.|- I thought your name was Charles.
{60468}{60574}Charles is short for Lance.|Charles is a maiden name.
{60580}{60690}OK, Lance...|I just came to say I'm sorry.
{60696}{60806}I said a lot of bad things about you,|but you kept brushing me off.
{60812}{60887}If you meant what you said|at the meeting...
{60893}{60973}I'm sorry to jump in,|but are you hungry?
{60979}{61058}Have you been working all day?
{61064}{61141}I know you were out there marching
{61147}{61219}and AI Sharpton ate all the food.
{61225}{61353}- You wanna get something to eat?|- No, I don't think I should.
{61358}{61444}I am not trying|to impress you, I swear.
{61450}{61510}I just want to feed you.
{61516}{61601}That's all. We don't even have to drive.|We could walk...
{61607}{61677}We could skip.|We'll skip to a meal?
{61734}{61822}- I guess I am hungry.|- Come on, let's go!
{62120}{62215}- You don't like this place?|- I am just surprised.
{62221}{62315}- I didn't always have money.|- Yeah, right...
{62321}{62438}I used to visit clothes in store windows|I had on lay-away.
{62444}{62517}Used to? I was visiting|a pair of shoes last week.
{62523}{62651}I remember one time|I put a coat on lay-away in September,
{62656}{62701}so I figured I'd get it out in the winter.
{62707}{62771}I couldn't get it out till June.
{62776}{62909}- Did you wait till winter to wear it?|- I wore that coat the whole summer.
{62915}{63004}July 4th I was on the beach|with a goose down.
{63018}{63062}Stop playing!
{63068}{63168}Sweating... just drawing.|Just dripping sweat. Slipping!
{63174}{63298}To this day, when I want to lose weight,|I just put on a hot coat.
{63567}{63690}Stop, drop|Shut them down, open up shop
{63696}{63790}Oh, no|Just a rough rider
{63796}{63865}Niggers wanna try|Niggers wanna lie
{63871}{63933}Niggers wonder why|Niggers wanna die
{63939}{64000}All I feel is pain|All I feel is rain
{64006}{64066}What! What!
{64195}{64253}- Yo, dog...|- What?
{64406}{64484}- Are you OK?|- Yeah, I'm OK.
{64527}{64599}- Have you lost your mind?|- I forgot who I was.
{64605}{64735}- You forgot who you were?|- I like the song: DMX, "Rough Riders".
{64741}{64823}What about us singing,|"Whiteys wanna die, whiteys can't try"?
{64841}{64906}Might get a record deal.
{64953}{65022}You're something else.
{65028}{65125}I didn't know what to expect,|but I didn't expect this!
{65131}{65260}When I look at you, it's like|I see somebody else inside you.
{65283}{65412}Even when I was trying to be|mad at you, I see something else.
{65440}{65538}- Sounds crazy, huh?|- No, it's not crazy.
{65544}{65610}It's... it's not crazy.
{65670}{65792}- Some date, huh?|- I thought you were just feeding me.
{65798}{65869}I was till I got my ass whooped!
{65892}{65954}That guy punched me|like I owed him child support!
{66782}{66864}That was different|than I thought it would be.
{66870}{66943}Different good, or different weird?
{66949}{67052}A little bit of both, I think.|You didn't seem like my type.
{67058}{67129}So what's your type look like?
{67135}{67281}It's not all about looks. I just|kind of like a guy with all of his teeth.
{67287}{67381}- That's a good rule.|- I like a slim guy,
{67387}{67513}a guy with a goatee, nice eyes,|and he's got to be funny.
{67548}{67623}- I guess I don't have a chance.|- What's your type?
{67629}{67759}I like my women the same way|I like my coffee... Puerto Rican!
{67790}{67848}- Just playing...|- You watch it!
{67879}{67929}Boy, here we are...
{67956}{68051}- So, can I call you?|- Well, let me ask you something...
{68057}{68149}Did you say that stuff at the hospital|to try to get with me?
{68155}{68248}At first, yeah.
{68254}{68338}Then I remembered you said, "Do|something positive with your money."
{68344}{68446}So I figured I might as well help.
{68452}{68589}If I get with you... great! But if not,|at least somebody'll be happy.
{68681}{68713}You know, I'd better go.
{68745}{68833}Guess I'd better be going, too.
{68839}{68922}Yeah... I wonder|who the Knicks played?
{68928}{69011}I think they played the Lakers|or somebody...
{69094}{69137}I'm sorry...
{69143}{69197}I'm sorry. Was I wrong?
{69203}{69327}No... I knew you would try to kiss me|tonight, and I thought I'd be mad.
{69356}{69437}But I'm not.|It's something about your eyes.
{69443}{69559}You know, the first kiss|is always in the middle of a sentence.
{69565}{69693}It's always like, "Tomorrow|I'm going to the zoo to see the..."
{69781}{69829}It could be like...
{69835}{69934}"Did you hear about|that new war in Russia? I heard..."
{70058}{70137}So I can call you, right?|I mean, just to talk.
{70143}{70257}No nasty talk or anything.|Unless that's what you're into!
{70263}{70311}Good night.
{70495}{70568}Yes! Yes! Yes!
{70693}{70757}My baby! My baby!
{71824}{71886}Get off my foot, bitch!
{72186}{72301}- OK, let's go!|- Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that.
{72307}{72378}Sorry. I got a new body for you.
{72384}{72449}I don't need the body any more.
{72455}{72562}We have one minute|to get you into this fabulous corpse.
{72568}{72682}I'm cool with Wellington, 'cause|Sontee's cool with Wellington.
{72688}{72774}I just waited through|three rap songs for you.
{72780}{72898}You can't keep the body,|even if you are smitten with some girl.
{72904}{72968}It's not some girl. It's the girl.
{72974}{73112}You got Heaven, but you don't got this.|She's so fine. We like the same stuff.
{73118}{73232}She laughs at my stupid jokes,|and I don't have to censor myself.
{73238}{73317}But she only knows me as Wellington,
{73323}{73389}so I don't want to change now.
{73395}{73466}Trust me, it's better this way.
{73472}{73564}- Give me your wallet!|- One second...
{73570}{73636}Are you sure|I won't die for forty years?
{73642}{73695}Technically, yes. But...
{73701}{73801}...this body is just a loaner!|Boy, nobody listens to me.
{73807}{73881}Come on, rob me. I've got money!
{73887}{73973}How does he want to be more involved|with running the company?
{73979}{74123}He wants to be... more involved|with running... the company.
{74129}{74209}- I thought you had him under control.|- I did.
{74215}{74289}I don't know where this came from.
{74295}{74365}Maybe you schtupping his wife|changed his attitude.
{74371}{74437}There's no need to get personal.
{74443}{74560}I take personally the statement,|"What if we lose a few million dollars?"
{74566}{74633}I didn't get into this to lose money.
{74639}{74782}Do you think this crap extends|to auditing the company's finances?
{74788}{74887}- Jesus, I hope not!|- Blah, blah, blah... Let's just kill him.
{75026}{75090}What are you laughing about?
{75096}{75191}Winston, do you want|to take the lead on this one?
{75221}{75356}Cisco, I need you to get in contact|with a man named Whitney Daniels.
{75362}{75433}Tell him I need to talk to him.
{75678}{75762}Pretty sweet, huh?|Up here, Mr Daniels.
{75857}{75954}Entering second floor.|Entering second floor.
{75960}{76063}I saw this girl the other day|and she was ugly.
{76069}{76206}She was asking for a booty call. I said,|"I'm going to give you a zooty call."
{76212}{76315}What the hell do you think|you're doing? This isn't your act!
{76321}{76407}Calm down!|Hey, everybody... Whitney Daniels!
{76457}{76517}Shut up!
{76523}{76593}You've been great,|but we're going to take a little break.
{76613}{76717}Come on, everybody,|let's get back to work.
{76748}{76856}- What the hell is going on here?|- I know it looks crazy,
{76862}{76963}but to get the last night at the Apollo,|I need a place to work out.
{76994}{77113}You want to do one|of the amateur spots at the Apollo?
{77119}{77231}Do your butlers go to comedy clubs|and steal people's acts?
{77237}{77291}- You think my act is stolen?|- I know it is.
{77297}{77438}I would have stolen better material,|but the kid worked it pretty well.
{77444}{77562}- Two Rheingolds coming at you.|- Thanks a lot, Cisco.
{77568}{77642}You took everýthing from the kid, huh?
{77648}{77765}Don't tell me that Rheingold|is all you can afford.
{77771}{77903}I didn't steal anything. I just want to|play the Apollo, and only you can help.
{77909}{78033}I'm out of the comedy business. Last|person I was going to help is dead.
{78039}{78187}- Anyway, he was a special case.|- What was so special about him?
{78193}{78258}Nothing, really, if you want to know.
{78264}{78412}He didn't have much talent to speak of,|but no matter how bad it went -
{78418}{78486}and sometimes it went really bad -
{78492}{78551}he wanted to get back on stage.
{78600}{78731}He was a good kid, and I wanted to|be there when things got good for him.
{78820}{78893}But I guess that won't happen now.
{78954}{79047}- Thanks for the beer.|- Whitney, it's me, Lance!
{79069}{79156}I got hit by a truck|and I went up to Heaven.
{79162}{79275}They took my body,|and I'm in Heaven and it's all blue...
{79281}{79374}And this guy, Mr King,|he looked like Ricky Ricardo...
{79380}{79490}I don't know if it's drugs you're taking,|or need to be taking,
{79496}{79560}but do something!
{79588}{79684}Whitney, remember|when we did that gig in Atlantic City?
{79690}{79769}They only paid us two-fifty,
{79775}{79842}and we got real drunk|and hung out with these two girls.
{79848}{79922}We got so drunk,|we thought they was transvestites.
{79928}{80026}It turns out they were just|two real ugly girls.
{80032}{80118}We brought them back|to the hotel, hung out.
{80124}{80260}And we woke up - what did we|find out? They robbed us!
{80499}{80540}Booey!
{80616}{80665}This is impossible!
{80671}{80738}You've been going to church|your whole life,
{80744}{80873}putting money in the collection plate.|This is just your tax dollars at work.
{80879}{80990}Wait a minute!|Does God have a sense of humour?
{80996}{81116}I haven't met God,|but the Devil got some good weed.
{81122}{81190}Just playing... I haven't met him yet.
{81196}{81297}But I met Mr King,|he's like the manager up there.
{81303}{81339}The manager?
{81345}{81473}Having a comedy club in your home|doesn't mean you can pull this off.
{81479}{81562}You've got to work|in front of a real audience.
{81568}{81645}I got an audience.|You heard me getting laughs.
{82081}{82126}What else?
{82132}{82237}Your mother's armpits are so hairy,|it looks like buckwheat in a headlock.
{82456}{82586}What I like about telling jokes is that|it's you versus the audience.
{82592}{82683}Nobody cares what you look like|or what you wear.
{82689}{82784}People just want to know|if you're funny. Can you bring it?
{82790}{82878}I just want to go to the Apollo|and bring it one time.
{82884}{82967}What about what you said|at the hospital?
{82973}{83043}People think that stuff but never say it.
{83049}{83147}- I was just talking.|- Yeah, but it worked!
{83153}{83261}- What do you mean, worked?|- It was funny.
{83574}{83629}What's up, G?
{83712}{83763}Welcome home, G.
{83769}{83809}What are you doing?
{83837}{83889}Backing that ass up.
{83938}{84006}How about you and me knock boots?
{84012}{84095}It's just, you know,|I've noticed lately
{84101}{84215}you've been into the whole...|Jet Magazine thing, and...
{84221}{84319}- Listen, I want a divorce.|- Is it because I tried to jack you?
{84325}{84427}No, it's got nothing to do|with you trying to jack me.
{84433}{84502}The truth is, there's somebody else.
{84508}{84578}Oh... you got another ho.
{84584}{84685}Just divorce me. You can have|the house, the car...
{84691}{84757}whatever you want,|I don't want it.
{84783}{84832}- Word?|- Word.
{84838}{84904}You know,|you're a great person inside,
{84910}{85017}and you need to get in touch|with the person inside.
{85023}{85129}And until you do that,|you need to stay inside.
{85135}{85196}So, take care, all right?
{85245}{85307}He's lost his mind!
{85313}{85438}Your next act loves comedy so much,|he bought the whole club.
{85444}{85512}Please welcome|Charles Wellington Ill.
{85518}{85578}- Are you all right?|- Yeah.
{85584}{85640}- How are you feeling?|- I feel good.
{85646}{85756}Great, because the judges|from the Apollo are here.
{85861}{85917}How you doing? All right.
{85923}{85992}When I was a kid, we were so poor
{85998}{86092}that the roaches was on welfare.
{86098}{86214}Poor, my ass! Get off the stage,|you fake Bill Gates!
{86298}{86372}Yeah, we was real poor.
{86378}{86477}We were so poor|that the rats had bald spots.
{86483}{86530}Crap! Cripitty crap!
{86536}{86623}I've got to listen to this|because you own the club?
{86629}{86687}Rich son of a bitch!
{86693}{86782}That's comedy! Drinks for everybody!
{86861}{86954}Just shut up before|I crush you with my wallet.
{86977}{87090}Bothering me on the job - do I come|to your job and bother you?
{87096}{87217}Do I take the squeegee out|of your hand? I leave it right there.
{87268}{87398}I didn't always have money.|No... I was a kid, we really was poor.
{87404}{87511}We were so broke, my dad|was the cheapest man on earth.
{87517}{87637}He was so cheap that when we went|to bed he unplugged the clocks!
{87697}{87780}"You can't tell time|when you're asleep."
{87829}{87907}The last spot for|the Apollo's final show goes to...
{87913}{88024}..millionaire Charles Wellington.|And to make the night right,
{88030}{88069}closing out the show|will be Brian McKnight.
{88117}{88219}I don't know what got into|that Wellington, but I like it.
{88485}{88560}Fur is murder! Fur is murder!
{88595}{88643}I'll show you murder!
{88742}{88793}Don't be stingy!
{88843}{88916}- Stick to the soft stuff.|- Kiss my ass!
{88922}{89001}I'm so glad we're giving back|to the community.
{89007}{89053}Put on the hat!
{89059}{89174}- I still got to not get booed off stage.|- You're doing pretty good.
{89180}{89264}- Thank you for the party.|- No problem, Sickie.
{89270}{89334}You sick bastard!
{89340}{89454}What have you got here?|Damn, you're a sick man!
{89460}{89525}Nurse! Get this man|a table dance, right now!
{89619}{89693}- So, will you marry me?|- What?
{89699}{89797}I love looking at you,|talking to you, laughing with you.
{89803}{89898}Sometimes I call|your answering machine
{89904}{89962}because I love your voice.
{89968}{90070}The cars, the money...|I'd give it all up, just for you.
{90076}{90169}Today I changed the diaper|of an 86-year-old man,
{90175}{90264}- and I'd give it all up just for you!|- That's a big sacrifice.
{90289}{90346}Mr Barton!
{90437}{90488}- What?|- Nothing.
{90541}{90637}Hold that thought! I'll be right back.
{90690}{90760}- I said hold that thought!|- OK.
{91021}{91149}- Keyes, get out of here!|- Lance, you've got to come with me.
{91155}{91253}Can't you see I'm busy?|Grab yourself some ribs.
{91259}{91313}I'm not the bad guy here!
{91319}{91423}- Can I take my hands down now?|- Yes, you can.
{91429}{91505}So you really want to get married?
{91511}{91607}I really do. Just look at me,|you know I'm not lying.
{91635}{91752}I know. There's something|about your eyes.
{91758}{91829}I just want to remember all of this.
{91835}{91913}You're not going to forget me, right?
{91919}{91966}You act like something's|going to happen.
{91972}{92059}If something did happen,
{92065}{92197}Iike some day you met a guy... a black|guy, a white guy, a Spanish guy,
{92203}{92291}if he was sincere,|you'd give him a shot, right?
{92297}{92345}What are you talking about?
{92553}{92644}Everýthing's all right.|Everýthing's all right.
{92744}{92837}- So you brought the big gun.|- You've got to play by the rules.
{92843}{92958}I'm sick of it.|From now on I make the rules.
{92964}{93065}- No one makes these rules, kid.|- Every time I get something going,
{93071}{93169}- you take my body.|- This was just a temporary setup.
{93225}{93313}I'm not scared of you.|I got lawyers now, and money.
{93319}{93442}- I'm playing the Apollo, and I'm in love.|- This is bigger than that.
{93448}{93508}- Nothing's bigger than that!|- It's fate.
{93514}{93626}Why is that when it's bad it's fate,|but when it's good it's luck?
{93632}{93694}Is anything good|supposed to happen to me?
{93770}{93813}No!
{93870}{93912}Somebody call 911 !
{94076}{94150}Sorry, Lance, I tried to warn you.
{94156}{94255}- You gotta get me back.|- No dice. We had a deal.
{94261}{94354}- I'll be anybody!|- There'll be consequences.
{94360}{94449}I'll take them. Just get me back!
{94867}{94929}Hello, Sontee.
{94959}{95035}I just can't believe he's gone.|Just like that.
{95133}{95178}He's not gone.
{95184}{95300}- I know in a way he'll live on, but...|- No, honestly.
{95306}{95372}You think you loved|Charles Wellington,
{95378}{95469}but really you loved|someone inside of him.
{95475}{95580}And he didn't die tonight.|He's living on, somewhere.
{95586}{95685}I'm sure of it.|And he'll always remember us.
{95691}{95805}- What are we doing here?|- This is your future.
{95811}{95876}- I'm going to be Joe Guy?|- That's the plan.
{95882}{95962}I don't want to take his life.|He's a nice guy.
{95968}{96100}- It'll all work out for the best.|- I'm not so sure with you.
{96106}{96154}Look out, Joe!
{96640}{96702}Airbags!
{96708}{96768}Airbags!
{96774}{96835}Taxi! Taxi!
{96900}{96946}Taxi!
{96952}{97004}Taxi! Taxi!
{97055}{97139}Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
{97214}{97278}I'm black again!
{97284}{97368}I'm black again! I'm a black man!
{97374}{97453}Thank God I'm a black man!
{97459}{97570}Police are questioning Winston Sklar|in relation to the murder.
{97576}{97662}To those who knew him,|Charles Wellington was two men:
{97668}{97777}a ruthless businessman and, more|recently, a kind philanthropist.
{97783}{97891}That man who got shot today,|that wasn't Charles Wellington.
{97897}{97970}He was always a cheap ...
{97976}{98044}no-good mother ...|with a stick up his ...
{98050}{98197}The man in the park today, he was|my brother. I loved that man.
{98203}{98331}Chuck Wellington... There will|never be another one like him.
{98337}{98425}- I can't believe he's gone.|- No more questions.
{98431}{98533}Charles Wellington III,|dead at the age offifty-three.
{98539}{98631}He leaves behind his wife, Amber...
{98637}{98710}You're not going|to forget me, right?
{98716}{98794}There's something about your eyes...
{98800}{98902}Everything's all right.|Everything's all right.
{98908}{99017}...eccentric millionaire left his money|to charities, friends
{99023}{99080}and his domestic staff.
{99086}{99226}Well, it's showtime at the Apollo|as it closes its doors for good.
{99464}{99577}Hey, haven't seen you in a while.|What you doing backstage?
{99583}{99721}- How about a loan?|- Stop it! I'm just hanging out.
{99727}{99782}I miss Booey, too.
{99849}{99903}Thank you!
{100021}{100069}Lance?
{100075}{100139}- No, I'm Phil.|- Sorry.
{100144}{100246}How about a hand for your next act,|Mr Joe Guy!
{100289}{100343}- Hey, Whit.|- Hey, Joe.
{100659}{100706}Make me laugh!
{100737}{100821}Apollo... Yeah!
{100827}{100963}So, what is it all about? Looks?|Looks will determine everýthing.
{100969}{101092}You want people to judge you by|the character, what you feel inside.
{101098}{101184}Nobody cares.|All they care about is your looks.
{101190}{101289}If you look good,|you're going to have a good life.
{101295}{101383}The uglier you are,|the smarter you'd better be.
{101389}{101487}You need a book for every|ten pounds you're overweight.
{101493}{101579}Or you'd better get two books,|and get a computer while you're at it!
{101722}{101771}Lance?
{101842}{101939}I was at the Knick game,|looking at the seats.
{101945}{102045}The higher the seats got,|the uglier the people got.
{102051}{102176}If I was the usher I wouldn't|need tickets, I'd just look at faces.
{102182}{102241}You got to go up top!
{102312}{102440}A woman can fall in love|with an ugly man and admit it.
{102446}{102580}Show him off to all her friends|and the family, and be so proud.
{102586}{102708}They're holding his hand like,|"I just want you to meet Kevin.
{102714}{102838}"I know he don't look that good,|but he's good to me."
{102844}{102964}Guys would never admit to being|in love with an ugly woman.
{102970}{103104}We ain't telling nobody... "I heard|you got married." "Who told you that?"
{103182}{103257}Life. What's life all about?
{103263}{103408}Love! Love, love, love, love.|You want to be in love.
{103414}{103514}That's right. You want to feel|that first kiss again.
{103520}{103646}Because that's the only real kiss|in a relationship, is the first kiss.
{103652}{103744}All the rest of the kisses|are just protocol.
{103750}{103834}Every other kiss is protocol.|Just routine.
{103840}{103911}"Hey, you was gone, you back."
{103917}{104009}"Hey, we're having sex."|"Hey, I miss you."
{104015}{104102}The first kiss is the only real one.
{104108}{104185}And it always happens|in the middle of a conversation.
{104191}{104274}You don't even know|what they're talking about...
{104280}{104397}"And maybe someday I was thinking|about trying to get the..."
{104403}{104492}The first kiss is always|like double Dutch.
{104498}{104589}You just sitting there like,|"When do I get in?"
{104595}{104715}"Oh, yeah! I'm kissing!|I'm kissing, I'm kissing."
{104721}{104780}Hey, I got to go. Y'all be good.
{104977}{105028}That's my dog!
{105151}{105204}Joe Guy, ladies and gentlemen.
{105301}{105389}- Whitney!|- Lance!
{105437}{105505}They didn't boo! They didn't boo!
{105522}{105613}Why not make the whole thing|out of the black box?
{105619}{105692}We are back in business, huh?
{105698}{105767}I'm back, Whit. You and me!
{105773}{105850}Lance, I'm proud of you.
{106052}{106140}- Lance.|- Mr King. Keyes.
{106146}{106230}Congratulations! You killed them.|We're cool, right?
{106236}{106310}- We real cool.|- We've got to talk.
{106316}{106393}Remember Wellington|was just a temporary setup.
{106399}{106524}This is your body. It's time to set up|house, kid, 'cause this is you.
{106530}{106595}I'll sign a lease right now.
{106616}{106737}Joe, listen to Phil Quon, kid.|You're about to shine.
{106751}{106833}Kid, when we leave,|you will be Joe Guy.
{106839}{106909}You won't remember Keyes, or me.
{106915}{107054}I'm going to remember you|like you whipped my ass in third grade.
{107060}{107118}Lance, you're not getting it.
{107124}{107252}You won't remember Charles|Wellington, Sontee or Lance Barton.
{107257}{107316}You will be Joe Guy.
{107322}{107421}What do you mean,|I won't remember Sontee?
{107427}{107530}I got hit by a truck,|I got smashed by a car, I got shot.
{107536}{107605}And now you want to take my soul?
{107611}{107685}Lance, nobody could take your soul.
{107691}{107760}What you look like, that's just clothing.
{107766}{107874}How can I get Sontee|if I don't remember her?
{107880}{107950}If Sontee doesn't remember me?
{107956}{108080}The funny thing about reincarnation|is that you're still you.
{108086}{108129}I got a good feeling about this.
{108135}{108239}It was hard enough trying to get this girl|as a rich white man.
{108245}{108390}- What about as a broke black man?|- See you around, Joe.
{108434}{108532}You and me on the road.|We could blow up, son.
{108538}{108597}Joe, are you all right?
{108603}{108682}Lance? Lance?
{108721}{108829}Lance, come on, let's celebrate.|I've got some big plans.
{108861}{108997}- What are you talking about?|- Lance? Nobody else is around.
{109033}{109101}Why do you keep calling me Lance?
{109128}{109188}Look at me for a second, will you?
{109292}{109370}- Lance.|- Joe Guy.
{109396}{109474}Oh, you mean your boy, Lance Barton.
{109480}{109568}I'm sorry.|Are you still dealing with that, huh?
{109574}{109615}Yeah.
{109621}{109659}Yeah, I...
{109665}{109725}..guess I am.
{109731}{109789}- Look, Mr Daniels...|- Whitney.
{109795}{109854}Whitney. I don't have a manager.
{109860}{109935}Could I come by your office|and leave a tape?
{109941}{110045}Maybe you could take me on.
{110051}{110096}Yeah, sure...
{110102}{110149}Call me tomorrow.
{110155}{110215}You're...
{110221}{110269}You're a good kid.
{110283}{110366}Thanks a lot.|I'll call you tomorrow.
{110372}{110405}Joe Guy.
{110411}{110477}Don't act like you don't know me.
{110483}{110575}And if you don't like the tape,|keep it to yourself.
{110581}{110635}- Right.|- It's going to be all right.
{110797}{110879}Excuse me,|I'm looking for Whitney Daniels.
{110885}{110999}Just go straight, you make a right|and go down the stairs.
{111005}{111095}- He should be by the dressing rooms.|- Thanks.
{111101}{111196}I'm sorry, but do you think|they'll let me back there?
{111202}{111290}Sure, the show's been over|for about an hour.
{111296}{111363}- Do I know you?|- No.
{111369}{111498}Seriously. I'm not joking,|I just feel like I met you before.
{111514}{111579}Joe.
{111585}{111644}- Joe Guy.|- Sontee Jenkins.
{111650}{111697}Sontee?
{111703}{111752}Thanks.
{111905}{111990}We'd better get out of here|before they lock us in.
{111996}{112085}Give me your hand.|I know my way around here.
{112091}{112160}Don't be scared, everýthing's all right.
{112166}{112305}- What did you just say?|- Everything's all right, like the song.
{112311}{112428}It's just that when you said that, it...|You're a comedian?
{112434}{112509}- Do I sing that bad?|- No.
{112515}{112653}- You were on tonight, how did you do?|- They didn't boo.
{112659}{112743}- There's an after-party...|- I didn't mean to hold you up.
{112749}{112868}No, I don't feel like going.|Do you want to get something to eat?
{112874}{112942}Are you asking me out?
{112948}{113018}No, I just want to feed you.
{113024}{113095}Yeah, I'm starved.
{113189}{113228}- Nice shoes.|- Thank you.
{113261}{113321}- So, what do you do?|- Medicine.
{113327}{113389}- Are you a drug dealer?|- Watch it!
{113395}{113481}No. Actually, I own|Brooklyn Community Hospital.
{113487}{113545}You own a hospital?
{113551}{113682}My uncle went there for a new liver|and they sent him to the supermarket.
{113688}{113781}- How you doing, sir?|- This your ride?
{113787}{113875}If you want to keep it,|get it out of here!
{113881}{113985}This is nice! What kind of mileage|do you get on this?
{113991}{114056}Oh, pretty good.
{114178}{114240}Cocktails, Miss Jenkins?
{114246}{114348}- Are you the maid?|- Do I look like the maid? I'm the paid.
{114354}{114413}This is my friend, Wanda.
{114419}{114528}Let you out of the car for a minute|and you're picking up strays.
{114534}{114609}- Did you know your coat's bleeding?|- Mind your business!
{115076}{115144}- You OK, Sontee?|- I'm OK. You OK?

Once the bright face of my betrothed Iady.
When Iife and beauty naturaIIy fiII'd out these ragged imperfections.
Then 'twas a face so far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion.
She, when she was dressed in fIesh, the oId Duke poison'd, because she wouId not consent unto his Iust.
No!
It's true. OId bones don't Iie.
They do when they're in the grave.
When they're at peace they do but these oId bones wiII have no peace untiI they have... revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge!
Men, come.
CarIo, do you know a feIIow?
- What feIIow?
- Any feIIow.
I know thee.
Any feIIow so he be, a strange, disgested feIIow, of iII-contented nature, as it might be, disgraced in former times - a pimp?
A pimp?
I need a man who can heIp me in the business of my heart.
Boy! Boy!
A pimp!
AII right, boy?
'Tis but a gIamour. 'Tis fake.
It's rubbish. It's ridicuIous.
CROWD CHANTING
- What's that?
- Lord Antonio.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
And his Iady.
That one is mine.
That virtuous Iady?
FooI.
Everyone loves sport, especially in times of difficulty.
- I'II have 20 on that.
- We rally round our sporting heroes!
'Tonio! 'Tonio!
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
- Those cheers?
- Lord Antonio.
The game?
The teams yet stand upon the Duke's arrivaI.
The Duke's Boy and Antonio's Lad locked in anticipation of mortal combat!
Everyone loves sport, no matter how it's played!
The Duke!
That he shouId do such wicked deeds and yet be Duke.
Go, sister. Hide your pretty face.
Beware an oId man, hot and vicious.
'Age, as in goId, in Iust is covetous.'
CROWD BOOING
Open 'em up!
Move it! Get back!
Keep them back! Get back!
It's the Duke and Duchess!
Keep back the rabbIe!
Keep them back! Use your tasers!
Go royaI Iecher!
Go, grey hair'd aduItery!
And thou his Duchess.
Oh, that God wouId stuff infernaI fire into your brittIe bones!
Do I know you, friend?
Do you know me... more than friend?
Brother?
- AII right, mate?
- Ah, you fuckin' cunt.
Tension mounts!
And they're off!
The Lad shoots, the Boy saves!
The Lad shoots again!
Goal! lt's a thrilling scene.
Brother, you must needs find me a pIace at court.
I must be near the Duke.
This is strange.
This very e'en, the Duke's first born and heir, Lussurioso, asked me find out for him a strange composed and iII-digested feIIow.
This e'en you say?
Why, brother, this is fate.
It is. But whose?
His fate or yours?
I set my fate at naught, so that I have revenge.
Goal!
A stunning victory for the
Lord Antonio and his lovely wife!
Your boy disgraces us.
He is a good boy.
He has two Ieft wrists. Ow!
And just look at the smile on the Lad's face! lt says it all!
Goal!
- Leave me be, sirrah.
- I have no Iike to.
SCREAM
Men, stand by my person!
Maybe some assassin threatens the Duke, my Father's head, then the Dukedom wiII want a head.
- Which must be mine!
- Mine!
Mine!
For God's sake, somebody heIp me!
HeIp!
HeIIo, what's this? A sweet for when I've eaten up my meat?
Come here.
Go, now! Here's danger!
- This Iady has need of me
- This is the Duke's son!
Another bIow then, for his Father's sake.
Our pIan's dependent on his famiIy's trust.
- He did assauIt my brother?
- He is newIy come to the port-
I wouId have kiIIed him too.
I was prevented.
I Iike him.
Thou hast fucked us royaIIy, brother.
Go and get Daddy! It's not fair!
What hast been? Of what profession?
- A bone-setter.
- A bone-setter?
A bawd, my sweet musk cat.
One that sets bones together.
Wondrous knave!
FamiIiar as an ague!
I can forget myseIf in private, but eIsewhere,
I pray do you remember me.
I am not Duke yet, but wiII be by and by.
Thou hast been an agent to much knavery then?
I've witnessed the surrender of 1000 virgins.
I've seen patrimonies wash'd a' pieces!
Then thou know'st i' th' worId strange Iust.
Oh, fuIsome Iust!
Drunken procreation, which begets so many drunkards!
Some fathers dread not, gone to bed in wine, to sIide from the mother and cIing to the daughter-in-Iaw.
Some uncIes are aduIterous with their nieces, brothers with brothers' wives.
Oh, hour of incest!
Any kin now next to the rim a' th' sister is man's meat in these days.
In the morning, when they are up and dress'd and their mask is on, who can perceive this save that eternaI eye that sees through fIesh and aII?
It is our bIood to err, tho' heII gap'd Ioud:
Ladies know Lucifer feII, yet stiII are proud.
Now, sir,
I am beyond my depth in Iust and I must swim or drown.
AII my desires are IeveI'd toward a virgin not far from HamiIton Square, to whom I have convey'd by messenger many wax'd Iines fuII of my neatest spirit and jeweIs that were abIe to ravish her without the heIp of man.
AII this and more, she, fooIish-chaste, sent back.
PossibIe? 'Tis a rare phoenix, who e'er she be.
If your desires be such, she so resistant.
In troth, my Lord,
I'd be reveng'd and marry her.
Push, the dowry of her bIood and of her fortunes are both too mean, good enough to be bad withaI.
Good enough to provoke any badness, poor enough to be a fit target for my Iust.
I'm one of those who can defend.
Marriage is good, yet rather keep a friend.
A very fine reIigion!
I wiII entrust thee with the business of my heart, for I see thou art experienc'd.
You have given it the tang, i' faith, my Lord.
Make known the Iady to me and my brain wiII sweII with strange invention.
I'II work it tiII I expire with speaking.
We thank thee and now receive her name.
It is Castiza.
That's her, out there. Look.
- My sister, oh my sister!
- Dost know her then?
By sight onIy.
Her brother did prefer thee to us.
I knew I had seen him before.
We can Iaugh at that he is dim and easy guIIed.
HimseIf being made the instrument to entice and work his own sister.
'Twas fineIy manag'd.
Go thou and with a smooth, enchanting tongue bewitch her ears and cheat her of all grace.
Enter upon her chastity.
Give it her thus and say she must expect an invoice for my Iove.
Those requiring the Clatterbridge to Parkgate Light Railway change at the next station,
Hamilton Square.
How if money wiII not tempt her from her virtue?
Why, then venture upon the mother and with gifts as I wiII furnish thee, begin with her.
Fie, Iar, that's wrong!
'Tis mere impossibIe that a mother by any gifts shouId become a madam to her own daughter!
Nay, then I see thou 'rt but a puny in the subtIe mysteries of a woman.
Why, the name of madam is so in Ieague with age, nowadays it does ecIipse three-quarters of a mother.
Now then, swear to be true in aII.
Swear?
I hope your honour
IittIe doubts my faith.
Yet for my humour's sake,
'cause I Iove swearing.
'Cause you Iove swearing,
'sIud, I wiII.
Oh, daughter, daughter.
I know he smiIed at thee.
He, the Duke's son.
He smiIed and my angeI guardian wept.
Maids and their honours are Iike poor beginners.
Were sin not rich there wouId be fewer sinners.
Oh, why had not virtue a revenue?
I know the cause,
'twouId have impoverish'd HeII.
Nice one, girI.
For your brother and for aII poor souIs at sea.
Who are you?
Is this my mother's jeweI?
Then give it back.
I came not to steaI but to give... this for you.
- Whence comes it?
- From a mighty friend!
From whom?
- The Duke's son!
- Receive that!
Take care, Iest I bite you back.
I swore I'd put anger in my hand and pass the virgin Iimits of myseIf to him who next appear'd in that base office to be the agent of his sin.
TeII him my honour shaII have a rich name whiIe severaI harIots share his with shame.
FareweII.
Commend me to him... in my hate!
I know your face.
- I think not.
- Yet I have seen it before.
When Iast we met you stood not higher than the aItitude of a heeIed shoe.
- You knew me not then and not now.
- Yet I do know you.
For something of myseIf
I do discern in thee.
I have two Iegs and you have two and Christ Ioves both of us aIike... I hope.
I think...
Dare I think this?
You are my brother.
You are my sister and I'm home.
And I weIcome you with a sIap!
It was the sweetest sIap that e'er my nose came nigh.
I'II Iove this bIow forever and this cheek shaII stiII hence forward be my favourite.
It is not kind for kin to put each other to the test.
I was empIoyed to do it but you were constant and thou hast right honourabIe shown.
Thou art approved forever in my thoughts.
I knew my honour aIready... without your test.
DOOR CREAKS
It was not kind.
My mother?
- I must test her too.
- What?
No!
I'm empIoyed to do it.
Castiza?
What a coiI is here? Who's here?
Our mighty expectation,
Lussurioso, son of the Duke, commends himseIf to your affection.
- I am his servant and so yours.
- The Duke's?
His son's, who shaII be Duke.
An honour just the same, sir.
I'm much honour'd to find that he is pIeased to rank me in his thoughts.
Mother, I think you know this man.
Hush, chiId.
I'm beginning to know him.
Go on, sir.
My master wiII be Duke hereafter.
The crown gapes for him every tide.
The oId Duke's days are numbered.
How bIess'd were they now that couId pIeasure Lussurioso.
- E'en with anything.
- Save with honour.
Oh, save with their honour, cIearIy.
As for honour, I'd Iet a bit of that go too, and never be seen in't.
- I'd wink and Iet it go.
- But we wouId not.
'Tis so, Mama?
No, we wouId not. Not for a ruby.
It is not weII done to use her thus-
To keep my promise, I must Iay siege unto my mother. What of 't?
A siren's tongue couId not bewitch her, not in such a case sureIy.
The oId Duke's days are numbered.
After him, my master wiII be Duke.
Now, that same man, my master, has Iong desir'd your daughter.
What of it? 'Tis naught.
Not so, Mama?
Now he desires that wiII command hereafter.
That's true.
He wiII command hereafter.
Do not proceed.
Madam, ' 'tis no shame to be bad, because 'tis common.'
- Ay, that is a comfort.
- A comfort!
Can these persuade you to forget heaven?
Mother, in the name of Christ, teII this man you want none of his dishonourabIe act.
Think upon the paIace's pIeasures.
Secured ease and state, the stirring meats ready to move out of the dishes that e'en now quicken when they're eaten.
Banquets abroad by torchIight, music, sports, nine coaches waiting.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Ay, to the deviI.
Hey, girI.
Who'd sit at home in a negIected room, deaIing her short-Iiv'd beauty to the waII-hangings, when those poorer in face and fortune than herseIf carry 100 acres on their back?
I cry you mercy.
Lady, I mistook you.
Pray, did you see my mother?
Which way went she?
Pray God I have not Iost her.
UngratefuI!
Sir, wouId you address your mother so?
AIas, I too have Iost my mother.
Aahhh...
Peevish! Coy! FooIish!
Sir!
Sir.
Return my answer to your future Duke, my Lord shaII be most weIcome when his pIeasure conducts him this way.
I wiII sway mine own.
Women with women can work best aIone.
Indeed, I'II teII him so.
Sir! Sir! Do I know thee?
My daughter says I know thee.
From some other time or some other pIace before?
Madam, if you know me not - you know me not.
Sir...
Sir!
The jeweI, sir. The jeweI.
Oh, more unciviI, more unnaturaI, than those base-titIed creatures that Iook downward!
Why does not heaven turn bIack or with a frown undo the worId?
Why does not earth strike at the sins that tread on it?
Oh, wer't not for goId and women, there wouId be no damnation!
But 'twas decree'd before the worId began, that they shaII be the hooks to catch a man.
Her mother took the jeweI?
She shouId be damn'd before the daughter.
That's good manners, my Lord.
The mother for her age goes foremost, you know.
She took the jeweI, that's good.
GoId, tho' it be dumb, does utter the best thanks.
The mother has proved herseIf a whore, therefore the sons and daughters were born whores, which is what we want.
I have mentioned that I am to be Duke after my father.
Once or twice.
It pricks my brothers' hearts to envy, that I am considered great whiIst they are but my brothers.
- Get off my shoe!
- Watch. TeII me how they Iook at me.
Give me back my shoe!
Get off, fuck off! Get off, you fuck!
Why have they Iocked me here?
Hush.
One of the Duke, my husband's words, wiII set you free, from death or durance.
You wiII waIk with boId feet upon the thorny Iaw.
His withered Grace don't Iove me
Iike the others, Mother.
Hush, hush, you are our dearest chiId.
Fear not.
CHAIN RATTLES
Oh, Junior.
- Hush now.
- I Iove you, Mummy.
- She shouId not be here.
- She is safe here with her brothers.
Beauty is nowhere safe.
That virtuous Iady.
A fair comeIy buiIding newIy faIIen, being faIseIy undermin'd.
Duchess, it is your youngest son.
Our youngest.
We're sorry his vioIent act hath e'en draw bIood of honour and stained our honours.
Your Grace hath spoke Iike to your siIver years, fuII of confirmed gravity, for what is it to have a fIattering faIse inscuIption on a tomb and in men's hearts reproach?
- I Ieave him to your sentence.
- Rise.
Doom him, Lords, whiIe I sit by and sigh.
My gracious Lord, I pray be mercifuI.
AIthough his trespass far exceed his years, he is your own, as I am yours, caII him not stepson.
Temper his fauIts with pity.
I beseech your Grace, be soft and miId.
Let not reIentIess Iaw
Iook with an iron forehead on our brother.
- Let the offender stand forth.
- No pity yet?
Must I rise fruitIess then?
Are my knees of such Iow mettIe that without mercy...
'Tis the Duke's pIeasure that impartiaI doom take fast hoId of his uncIean attempt.
A rape!
Why 'tis the very core of Iust and which was worse, committed on the Lord Antonio's wife, that chaste and upright Iady.
Confess, my Lord, what moved you to 't?
Why, fIesh and bIood.
What shouId move man to woman eIse?
Do not jest thy doom, pIay not with death.
The Iaw is a wise serpent and quickIy can beguiIe thee of thy Iife.
That Iady's name has spread such a fair wing that if our tongues were sparing toward the fact, judgement itseIf wouId be condemned.
WeII, hmm, 'tis done.
And 'twouId pIease me to do it again.
What?
Sure, she's a goddess, for I'd no power to see her and to Iive.
It faIIs out true in this for I must die.
No!
Her beauty was ordained to be my scaffoId and yet methinks
I might be easier ceased.
My fauIt being sport,
Iet me but die in jest.
This be the doom irrevocabIe.
Oh, keep't upon your tongue,
Iet it not sIip, death too soon steaIs out of a Iawyer's Iip.
Now, now he dies! Rid 'im away.
- Tomorrow earIy.
- Pray, stay abed, my Lord!
- Let that offender be...
- Live and be in heaIth.
Be on a scaffoId.
- No!
- HoId!
HoId!
Pox on't.
What makes my dad speak now?
We do defer judgement untiI next sitting.
In the meantime,
Iet him be kept prisoner.
What, prisoner? No! Mother!
Mother!
DeIayed, deferred and if judgement have coId bIood, then fIattery and bribes wiII kiII it quite.
WiII he Iive then?
He wiII, my Lady.
'My Lord,' she said,
'shaII be most weIcome,
'when next his pIeasure brings him forth this way.'
That shaII be soon.
I have no way to cross it now but to kiII him.
KiII Lussurioso? What of the Duke?
I'II murder both.
You wiII be busy, brother.
'Tis true an oId man is twice the chiId.
Mine cannot speak, yet one singIe word from him wouId quite save my son!
Hush, Mother, he wiII be free by and by.
The Gods protect our sister.
Here's a pIan as neat as appIes from the bough how I may speed away the oId Duke and his son.
- What?
- Watch.
CarIo, Ieave us, Laughing Boy.
A third man's dangerous, especiaIIy her brother.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
Every day another thousand voices raised to his account.
There's one bastard envies me my Dukedom.
There's more than one, my Lord.
Your brother, Spurio.
Spurio?
- I can bring forth proof that...
- Hush. Not here. Come.
Here we are in th' intestines of my father's paIace.
'Tis the deepest art to study man.
I'm weII practised at it.
I find you are a feIIow of discourse, weII-mingIed, whose brain time hath season'd, suitabIe both to my service and my company.
Your estate shouId be more feIIow to your mind.
Trust me with thy preferment.
Thanks, my Ioved Lord.
Now teII me of my brother's pIots.
Who's in with him?
'Tonio who the mob Ioves so?
Sir, your mother.
The Duke your father is worthiIy abus'd.
My brother and my mother - entangIed?
This night, this hour, this minute, now.
MOANING
What? What?
Oh, sin fouI and deep, great fauIts are wink'd at when the Duke's asIeep!
HorribIe.
I am mad! I wiII confound them.
But what proofs?
What need of proofs when you may take 'em... twisted?
- Where is that viIIain?
- SoftIy, my Lord.
BED SQUEAKS
- This room?
- My mother's.
Ah!
I cannot.
Then Spurio wiII stab you, as he stabs your Mother.
I'II kiII 'em doubIed, whiIe they're heap'd!
Soft, my Lord.
ViIIain, strumpet! SIapper!
Treason, treason!
Right, you upper guards defend us!
Oh no, take me not in sIeep.
No, I have great sins.
I must have days, nay, months, dear son with penitentiaI sighs to
Iift 'em out and not to die in sin!
Thou wiIt kiII me both in heaven and heII!
I'm amaz'd to death.
Nay!
ViIIain, traitor worse than the fouIest epithet, now I'II gripe thee e'en with the nerves of wrath, and throw thy head among the Iawyers!
Guard!
How comes our dad disturb'd?
This boy, who shouId be myseIf after me wouId be myseIf before me, and in the heat of this ambition bIoodiIy rush'd in intending to depose me in my bed.
Dad.
Duty and naturaI IoyaIty forfend!
He caII'd his father viIIain and me sIapper, a word I abhor to 'fiIe my Iips with.
That was not so weII done, brother.
I know there's no excuse can do me good.
Shh.
His vicious purpose to our sister's honour's cross'd beyond our thought.
Is the Duke dead?
WouId he had kiII'd him,
'twouId have eas'd our swords.
Be comforted, he wiII die.
To prison with the viIIain!
Death shaII not Iong Iag after him.
Oh, be comforted, our Duchess, he shaII die.
Then the truth of my intent shaII out. Lord and Father...
My best reIease Iies upon your tongues, pray persuade for me.
We'II sweat in pIeading.
And I may Iive to thank thee.
His death shaII thank me better.
Now, brothers, Iet our hate and Iove be woven so subtIy together, that in speaking one word for his Iife, we may make three for his death.
The craftiest pIeader gets the most goId for breath. Mother.
Is't possibIe a son shouId be disobedient as far as the sword?
It is the highest, he can go no further.
- My gracious Lord, take pity...
- Pity?
We'd be Ioath to move your Grace.
The trespass is unpardonabIe...
BIack, wicked and unnaturaI.
In a son, oh, monstrous!
Yet, my Lord, a Duke's soft hand strokes the rough head of Iaw and makes it Iie smooth.
But this hand shaII ne'er do 't.
That as you pIease, my Lord.
We must needs confess.
Some fathers wouId have seen the execution sound without corrupted favour.
But your Grace may Iive the wonder of aII times in pardoning that offence which never yet had face to beg a pardon.
- What's this?
- Forgive him.
Good my Lord, he is your own son and I needs must say
'twas the viIdIier done.
He's the next heir, yet this truth gathers - there's none can possess that dispossess their fathers.
Be mercifuI.
You have prevaiI'd.
My wrath Iike fIaming wax hath spent itseIf.
I know 'twas but some peevish moon in him.
Go, Iet him be reIeas'd.
'Sfoot. How now, brother?
Your Grace doth pIease to speak beside your spIeen.
- I wouId it were so happy.
- Go, reIease him.
Oh, my good Lord,
I know the fauIt's too weighty and fuII of generaI Ioathing, too inhuman, rather by aII men's voices worthy...
Death. Death.
'Tis true too. Right, then.
Take this.
Doom shaII pass.
Direct this to the judges.
He shaII be dead 'ere many days.
- Make haste!
- AII speed that may be.
We couId have wish'd his burden not so sore.
We know your Grace did but deIay before.
It weII becomes that judge to nod at crimes that does commit greater himseIf... and Iives.
Many a beauty have I turn'd to poison for rejecting me... covetous of aII.
Age hot is Iike a monster to be seen.
My hairs are white, but yet my sins are green.
Brother, Iet my opinion sway you once,
I speak it for the best, to have him die.
Surest and soonest.
If the signature come unto the judges' hands, why, then his doom wiII be deferr'd tiII sittings and court days, juries and further.
Faiths are bought and soId.
Oaths in these days are but the skin of goId.
In troth, 'tis true too!
Then straight to the officers and Iet the judges wait.
'Tis but mistaking our father's meaning, and where he nam'd, 'Ere many days'.
'Tis but forgetting that and have him die... now.
CREAKING
SCREW FALLS TO FLOOR
Brothers? Are you there?
You!
You Iied to me!
You brought me to this pass.
If I'd Iied to you, wouId I now try to deIiver you?
You've been deceived but not by me.
If you'd as Iife stay here, then do.
I'II cIose the breach.
Oh, you commanded me to keep watch upon your envious brothers.
Know that they intend to speed your execution
Iest your father makes aIteration of his edict.
They want me kiIIed?
In a word.
I'm much indebted to your Iove for this.
O Liberty!
Thou sweet and heavenIy dame.
But heII for prison is too miId a name.
Officers, here is the Duke's signature.
We are sorry that we are so unnaturaIIy empIoy'd in such an unkind office.
Fitter far for enemies than brothers.
But you know, the Duke's command must be obey'd.
- This morning then. So suddenIy?
- Ay, aIas, poor good souI.
The executioner stands ready to put forth his cowardIy vaIour.
Ready?
Ready?
AIready, i'faith.
We'II take our Ieaves.
Our office shaII be sound. We'II not deIay the third part of a minute.
Therein you show yourseIves good men and upright officers.
Pray, Iet him die as private as he may.
Do that for him, for the gaping peopIe wiII but troubIe him at his prayers.
It shaII be done.
Why, we do thank you and if we Iive to be... you shaII have a better office.
Commend us to the scaffoId - in our tears.
We'II do your commendations.
Destruction hies.
Fine fooIs in office!
- Things faII out so fit.
- So happiIy!
'Ere next cIock, his head wiII be made serve a bigger bIock.
ExceIIent! Now I am heir,
Duke in a minute.
The faIIing of one head
Iifts up another.
The Duke's son was in here.
There is another one, two ceIIs down.
- But his death's not commanded.
- Let's have a Iook.
'My son', no name, save onIy that,
'my son'.
WeII, he is his son, though his neck's somewhat thicker.
Keeper?
My Lord.
No news IateIy from our brothers?
Are they unmindfuI of us?
My Lord, they Ieft a message whiIe you sIept.
What was it?
They said, be of good cheer, you wiII not be Iong a prisoner.
That brings me no comfort!
I shouId've Iook'd for my reIease had they been worth their oaths.
How now! What news?
Bad news, my Lord.
I am discharg'd of you.
SIave, caII'st thou that bad news?
I thank you, my brothers!
'TwiII prove so - this is the officer into whose hands I must commit you.
Pardon us, my Lord.
Our office must be sound.
Here is our warrant, signed by the Duke. You must prepare to die.
- Sure 'tis not so.
- It is too true.
I teII you 'tis not, for the Duke, my father, has deferr'd me tiII the next sitting and I Iook e'en every minute, threescore times an hour, for a reIease.
A trick wrought by my big brothers.
A trick, my Lord?
Your hopes are as fruitIess as a barren woman.
Your brothers brought this powerfuI token for your death.
My brothers?
Desire 'em hither! CaII 'em up, they shaII deny it to your faces.
They're Iong gone. The command they
Ieft, when grief swum in their eyes.
They were Iike brothers, fuII of heavy sorrow but the Duke must... have his pIeasure.
The hour beckons, my Lord.
Lift your eyes up to heaven.
Thank you, faith, good, pretty whoIesome counseI.
I shouId, er, Iook up to the, er, heavens, as you said, whiIst he behind me cheats me of my head!
Ey, ah? That's the trick.
You deIay too Iong, my Lord.
Stay, good authority's bastards.
If I must die through my brothers' perjury,
Iet me venom their souIs with curses!
'Tis no time to curse.
But my fauIt was sweet sport, which the worId approves!
I die for that which every woman Ioves.
No!
Is our conspiracy discover'd?
Drive over them.
- My long grief...
- Hush, brother. Listen. l will cut into short words.
Last reveIIing night, when fIoodIight made an artificiaI noon at Aintree, some courtiers at the match...
Oh, Christ. She's dead.
As coId in Iust as she is now in death, which that step-duchess' monster knew too weII.
Then, with a face more impudent than his vizard, he harried her amidst a throng of panders and fed the ravenous vulture of his lust!
Oh, death, to think on't!
She her honour forc'd, deem'd it a greater dowry to her name.
To die with poison than to live with shame.
BehoId, my Lords.
A sight that strikes man out of me.
I had not mark'd that before - a prayer book, with a page turn'd up, pointing to these words,
'MeIius virtute mori quam per dedicus vivere.'
'Better to die virtuous than to Iive dishonoured.'
'Tonio! 'Tonio!
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
Look! Look!
The buIIet went in there. Back of the head. Not at point bIank range.
She'd need to be a doubIe-jointed octopus. She did not top herseIf.
And, and, and, I heard someone say there were two different buIIets.
So, er, what are you saying?
I'm saying the Duke's Iot saw her off.
Yeah, or Antonio's?
- The nobIe Lord Antonio's!
- Yeah, why not?
Stitch that!
- Was it suicide, then?
- Sure it was.
I wouId do the same if he shouId come near me.
- No, you wouIdn't.
- I wouId.
- You wouIdn't commit suicide.
- I wouId.
Are you a cockney?
What about you?
Of course I am, you three cornered hats.
He's a fuckin' cockney!
Sister.
Here he is!
Fuckin' 'eII!
Passengers are reminded that smoking is no longer permitted on Merseyrail trains or underground stations.
There is no safety here.
Here I am safest, here with my brothers.
Was not this execution rareIy pIotted?
I am the Duke's heir now.
You may thank my poIicy for that.
Your poIicy for what?
Was it not my invention, brother to sIip the judges, and in Iesser compass, advising you to sudden execution?
Heart, 'twas a thing
I thought on too.
You thought on't too!
SIander not your thoughts with gIorious untruth! 'Twas not so.
Sir, I say 'twas in my head.
Like your brains, ne'er to make their presence feIt as Iong as you Iiv'd.
You'd have the honour on't, that your wit Ied him to the scaffoId?
Since it is my due, I'II pubIish 't, but I'II have it in spite of you.
Methinks y'are too boId, you shouId IittIe remember us, next to be honest Duke.
ShouId be as easy for you to be Duke as to be honest, and that's never in faith.
WeII, coId he is by this time, because we're both ambitious.
Be it our amity, and Iet the gIory be shared equaIIy.
I am content to that.
Here's where our oIder brother's corse Iies in state.
ExceIIent!
Now brother, aII's sure our own.
Canst weep, think'st thou?
'TwouId grace our fIattery much.
Think of some dame.
I'II try.
Now for yourseIf.
Our sorrows are so fIuent.
Our eyes o'erfIow our tongues.
Words spoke in tears are Iike the murmurs of the waters.
The sound is IoudIy heard, but cannot be distinguish'd.
How died he, pray?
FuII of rage and spIeen!
He died most vaIiantIy then.
We're gIad to hear it.
- We couId not woo him once to pray.
- He show'd himseIf a gentIeman.
But instead of prayer, he, he drew forth oaths.
Then did he pray, dear, dear heart, aIthough you knew it not.
My Lords, e'en at his Iast, with pardon be it spoke, he curs'd you both.
He curs'd us? 'Las, good souI!
It was not in our power, but the Duke's pIeasure!
Now, my Lords.
- Sweet heaven, defend us!
- Sweet heaven, defend us!
Why do you shun me, brothers? The saviour of the prison has forsook me.
I thank such sweet Lords as yourseIves I'm free.
- In heaIth!
- ReIeas'd!
We are both e'en amaz'd with, with joy to, to see it.
We are much to thank thee.
Faith, we spar'd no tongue unto my Lord the Duke.
Your deIivery had not been haIf so sudden but for us.
God, how we pIeaded!
- My deserving brothers...
- No!
In my best dreams I wiII think on it.
Saw you not their guiIt, crawIing Iike maggots on the faces of dead men?
Be sure I did.
Oh, death and vengeance!
HeII and torments!
SIave, cam'st thou to deIude us?
DeIude you, my Lords?
ViIIain, whose is this corse now?
Why your brother and the Duke's son.
PIagues!
Confusions!
- Darkness!
- DeviIs!
Our younger brother.
There's no advantage in the kiIIing of a younger brother!
ViIIain, I'II kiII thee!
Fuck off, you cheap pair of bastards.
The deviI overtake thee!
Oh, fataI!
Oh, most prodigious to our bIoods!
Did we dissembIe?
Did we make our tears women for thee?
Laugh and rejoice for thee?
You had a wiIe, you had a trick, forsooth!
The cIap eat them! There's none of these wiIes ever come to any good.
There's nothing sure in mortaIity but mortaIity.
Whose fauIt is this catastrophe?
We know not, sir.
- The fates.
- Not us, sir.
We'II Ieave you to your grief, good sir.
ShaII I kiII him th' wrong side now?
No.
Sword, thou wast never a back-biter yet.
I'II pierce him to his face, he shaII die Iooking upon me.
My veins are sweII'd with Iust.
This shaII unfiII 'em.
Great men were gods if beggars couIdn't kiII 'em.
Sirrah, I know thee.
Come... Are you not a pandar, or a pimp?
Did you not provide a Iady for my son?
- I was commanded-
- Yeah, good, good.
Can you do Iikewise for me?
CouId you not meet me with a Iady in some fair pIace, veiI'd from the eyes of th' court, some darkened bIushIess angIe?
My Lord, I couId.
An unsunn'd Iodge wherein 'tis night at noon.
And a Iady. You know a Iady?
One with two heaven pointed diamonds set for eyes in a face.
Far far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion.
I had such a one before.
She wouId not consent unto my Iust.
I had to have her kiIIed.
I had my way with her, thereafter.
Sir... I wiII coIIect you.
Soon, soon. You wiII rest easy.
- Where's the Iady?
- You shaII be witness.
Be ready.
Stand with your hats off.
Ah!
Art thou beguiI'd now?
Have I not fitted the oId surfeiter with a quaint piece of beauty?
Age and bare bone are e'er aIIied in action.
Here's an eye abIe to tempt a great man to serve God.
A pretty, hanging Iip that has forgot now how to dissembIe.
This mouth shouId make a swearer trembIe, a drunkard cIasp his teeth and not undo 'em.
To suffer wet damnation.
Is this the form that Iiving shone so bright?
Oh fuckin' 'eII, mate.
What are you gonna do with her?
He had me once and now he shaII again!
Does every proud and seIf-affecting dame camphor her face for this and grieve her maker with sinfuI baths of miIk, when many an infant starves, for her superfIuous outside, aII for this?
Who now bids ¡Ì20 a night, prepares music, perfumes and sweetmeats?
AII are hush'd.
Thou mayst Iie chaste now!
It were fine to have thee seen at reveIs, forgetfuI feasts and uncIean brotheIs!
Sure, 'twouId fright the sinner and make him a good coward.
Put a reveIIer out of his antic ambIe and cIoy an epicure with empty dishes.
Here, might a scornfuI and ambitious woman
Iook through and through herseIf.
See, Iadies, with faIse forms you deceive men but you cannot deceive worms!
Up and down, up and down, tiII they're cIean and sparkIy.
What is it?
Poison.
You'II heIp me in my deadIy enterprise?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You have Ieave to Ieave me.
If I'm missed by the Duchess, say I am privateIy rid forth.
What, here?
GIRL SCREAMING
(SOFTLY) Someone's near.
Another pair of Iovers.
This is a most exceIIent pIace in which to score.
MOANING
Who's that?
- 'Tis her.
- What?
'Tis yours.
What Iady is't?
A country Iady, a IittIe bashfuI at first, but after the first kiss, the worst is past with them.
You know now what you have to do.
- She's a somewhat grave Iook.
- No, I Iove that best.
In gravest Iooks the greatest fauIts seem Iess.
Give me that sin that's rob'd in hoIiness.
Take this,
'twiII stiffen your resoIve.
Cover your eyes,
Iest her beauty bIind you.
Madam, his Grace wiII not be absent Iong.
Is aII truIy secret?
I heard another pair of Iovers.
Is that her? Her voice is sweet.
Secret? Never doubt us, madam.
'TwiII be worth three veIvet gowns to your Iadyship.
How sweet can a Duke breathe?
PIeasure dweIIs within a perfumed mist.
Oh, Iady, sweetIy encount'red.
Sir, be boId with me, kiss my Iips.
Madam, I wiII.
- What's this?
- RoyaI viIIain, white deviI!
Brother, give us Iight!
That his affrighted eyebaIIs may start unto those hoIIows.
Duke dost see yon dreadfuI vizard?
View it weII.
'Tis GIoriana's skuII, whom thou poisoned'st Iast.
- It has poisoned me!
- Didst not know that tiII now?
CaII treason!
Yes, my good Lord.
Treason, treason, treason!
Oh, then I'm betray'd!
Poor Iecher in the hands of knaves.
A sIavish Duke is baser than his sIaves.
My teeth are eaten out!
Hadst any Ieft?
Then those that did eat are eaten.
My tongue!
'TwiII teach you to kiss cIoser.
- You have eyes stiII?
- They hurt.
The piII was a potion to prevent bIinking.
I gave it that thou'd miss not one bIinking moment of aII this.
'Tis but earIy yet. Now I'II begin to stick thy souI with uIcers.
I wiII make thy spirit grievous sore.
It shaII not rest but Iike some pestiIent man toss in thy breast.
Mark me, Duke, thou'rt a renowned, high, and mighty cuckoId.
Had not that kiss a taste of sin?
Why, there's no pIeasure but 'tis sinfuI.
Nay, to affIict thee more, here in this Iodge, they meet for damned cIips.
Those eyes shaII see the incest of their Iips.
CarIo!
Sweet Christ!
Brother, I do appIaud thy constant vengeance, the quaintness of thy maIice above thought.
CASTIZA LAUGHING
The fIy-fIop of vengeance beat 'em to pieces!
This was the sweetest occasion, the fittest hour, to make my revenge.
Oh, my heart wears feathers that before wore Iead.
The Duke is dead, dead, dead, dead!
Over whose roof hangs this prodigious comet In deadIy fire?
- A bIessing on our enterprise.
- Sweet angeI of revenge.
HUMMING
Who has seen the Duke my Father?
You saw you my Lord and Father?
And you?
And you?
Or you? What of you?
WeII, weII, he's sure from court, but where, which way his pIeasure took, we know not, nor can hear on't.
I heard he privateIy rode forth.
'Twas wondrous private.
No-one in court has any knowIedge of it.
My husband is oId and sudden.
'Tis not treason to say he has a humour or such a toy about him.
I think he's privateIy rid forth from shame, from infamy, from this house of incestuous scheming.
Yo... Brother... Is that not... oh.
It's him!
I say, it is. Very nice, brother.
When the Duke sees this, you are...
The Duke is fIed from shame, and so the Duke is here, in my person.
- Never the Duke!
- UntiI he is returned!
UntiI he does return!
UntiI he is returned!
So...
Guards!
- Let her be kept cIose prisoner.
- I am not going to be kept-
- Guards, take both of them.
- Don't you touch my IittIe spud!
- Spud, go home!
- Bye, brother!
Are you so barbarous to set iron nippIes upon these breasts that gave you suck?
Yes.
Oh, am I not your mother?
Thou dost usurp that titIe now by fraud, for in that sheII of mother is a bawd.
Come on, Duchess.
Brother and Lords, what's for breakfast?
- Piss off.
- Oh, sorry, Iar...
Shocking news broke today, as the Duchess and her son, Spurio were found in a compromising position.
Our own dam was the worser.
The Duchess made a whore out of herseIf, our ma a whore out of her daughter.
The Duke's son's great concubine!
A drab of state, a cIoth-a'-siIver sIut.
To have her train borne up and her souI traiI I' th' dirt.
Great! Never just the Duke's son.
First begins with one hen after, to 1000 proves a whore.
'Break ice in one pIace, it wiII crack in more.'
Oh, thou for whom no name is bad enough!
Son? Is this my son come back?
And do you know me now?
Wicked unnaturaI parent!
Fiend of women!
Did not the Duke's son direct a feIIow of the worId's condition hither, that did corrupt thee, made thee unciviIIy forget thyseIf and work our sister to his Iust?
Who, I? That had been monstrous!
I defy that man for any such intent, ain't none Iives so pure but shaII be soiI'd with sIander.
- Good son, beIieve it not.
- He was that man!
You?
My own son, tricked me?
In that disguise,
I was sent by the Duke's son.
He tried you and found you base metaI as any viIIain might have done.
A rich man tricked a beggar.
This is news, is it? It's good?
NimbIe in damnation, quick in tune.
There's no deviI couId strike fire so soon!
Sons! Forgive me.
To my own seIf I'II prove true.
You that shouId honour me,
I kneeI to you.
Nay. Brother, it rains,
'twiII harm your dagger. House it.
'Tis done.
I'faith, 'tis a sweet shower, it does much good.
Rise, mother, troth, this shower has made you higher.
To weep is to our sex naturaIIy given, but to weep truIy, that's a gift from heaven.
Nay, I'II kiss you now.
Kiss her, brother.
Let's marry her to our souIs, wherein's no Iust and honourabIy Iove her.
Let it be.
I'II give you this, that one I never knew.
PIead better for and against the deviI than you.
Thou make me proud on't.
- Thy name, I have forgot it.
- Vindici, my Lord.
- 'Tis a good name.
- Yeah, a revenger.
It does betoken courage, thou shouIdst be vaIiant and kiII thine enemies.
That's my hope, my Lord.
CHUCKLES
TeII me, what has made thee so meIanchoIy?
Why?
To think how a great, rich man Iies a-dying and a poor cobbIer toIIs the beII for him or how a usuring father boiIs in heII and his son-and-heir, with a whore, dances over him.
There is hope in you for discontent and want is the best cIay to mouId a viIIain of.
You know I might advance you and buiId fair your fortunes for it might be in me to rear up towers from cottages.
I wiII unbrace such a cIose, private viIIain unto your vengefuI sword, the Iike ne'er heard of.
What's his sin?
He is a royaI Iecher.
RoyaI... and a Iecher and royaIIy a Iecher.
More than once when one wouId not consent unto his Iust, he had them poisoned.
What's his name?
You know him.
Oh, thou aImighty patience,
'tis my wonder that such a feIIow, impudent and wicked, shouId not be cIoven as he stood or with some secret wind burst open!
Is there no thunder Ieft, or is't kept up in stock for some heavier vengeance?
THUNDER RUMBLES
There it goes!
- What?
- Nothing.
Thunder.
- I have imprison'd my own mother.
- I know.
If the Duke returns then 'tis treason.
Oh, yeah.
If?
If... he comes not back...
Who shaII be Duke then?
Me! I shaII.
Did I not say so?
I think you did.
So swear!
- You stiII Iove swearing.
- Swear!
My Lord, it shaII be so.
SCREAMING
Thus much by wit a deep revenger can puII off.
When murder's known to be the fardest off.
Oh, viIIain!
Oh, rogue!
Oh, sIave! Oh, rascaI!
Reverend majesty.
My father the Duke murdered.
- OId Dad dead.
- His Iips are gnawn with poison.
Where was that sIave that did affirm to us?
My Lord, the Duke was privateIy rid forth?
Oh, pardon me, my Lord, he gave that charge upon my Iife to answer thus if he was miss'd at court.
In fact, he was with a Iady.
Heavens, that faIse charge was his death!
No.
Impudent beggar, durst you to our face maintain such a faIse story?
Bear him straight to execution!
It's not right.
You've sentenced boIIocks...
Urge me no more. In this the excuse may be caII'd haIf the murther.
Away, Iet it be done.
My Lord, we're something boId to know our duty.
Your father's accidentaIIy departed.
The titIes that were due to him meet you.
Meet me?
I am not at Ieisure, my good Lord.
I've many griefs to dispatch.
WeIcome, sweet titIes.
Lords, taIk to me of sepuIchers and mighty emperors' bones, that's thought for me.
My Lord, it is your shine must comfort us.
AIas, I shine in tears
Iike the ApriI sun.
You are now my Lord's Grace.
I perceive you'II have it so.
'Tis, but your own.
Hooray for our brother the Duke.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!
Then heavens give me grace to be so.
Hooray!
In the mean season, Iet us bethink the Iatest funeraI honours due to the dead Duke's coId body, and withaI, caIIing to memory our new happiness spread in his royaI son.
GentIemen, Lords... prepare for reveIs.
Time hath severaI faIIs.
Griefs Iift up joys and feasts put down funeraIs.
ReveIs, reveIs...
Yes! Leave me... to my grief.
One thing. That girI.
Castiza. The one I tried but faiIed to woo.
Now that you're Duke, you'II have no need of her.
- You can have any that you choose.
- I choose her.
Now I have no need to woo.
Now I command.
Echo! Echo! Echo!
- Is she here?
- She comes, my Lord.
She wiII come, certainIy.
I'II see to that.
I'm not pIeas'd by that iII-knotted fire, that bushing, fIaring star.
- Am not I Duke?
- Yes, yes, you are, yes.
They say, whom art and Iearning weds, when stars wear Iocks, they threaten great men's heads.
So, pIease your Grace, it shows great anger.
That does not pIease my Grace.
Yet here's the comfort, my Lord.
Many times when it seems most, it threatens fardest off.
Faith... and I think so too.
Here, take this. I'II start my
Dukedom with my mother's banishment.
Hooray!
Castiza, a virgin's honour is a crystaI tower which being weak is cIoseIy guarded with good spirits untiI she baseIy yieIds no iII inherits.
HippoIito, shut up.
'Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke.
Let it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe 'Mother' for crimes of incest and for crimes of intriguing against this state.
I, the Duke, banish thee, woman, to withdraw yourseIf beyond the bounds of the gracious state of our great city!
Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke...'
Shut up!
'..and with the titIes and grace that descends upon me, Iet it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe, 'Mother'!'
Is that fiery thing stiII there?
'When beggars die, there are no comets seen!'
You're gracefuIIy estabIish'd with the Ioves of your subjects and for naturaI death, I hope it be threescore year a-coming.
True. No more but threescore year?
- Fourscore I hope, my Lord.
- And fivescore.
I hope, my Lord, that you shouId never die.
Give me thy hand.
These others I rebuke. He that hopes so, is fittest for a Duke.
Thou shaIt sit next to me.
Take thy pIaces, Lords.
We are ready for sports.
Let 'em set on.
You thing, we shaII forget you quite anon!
Our brother shaII not Iive.
His hair shaII not grow much Ionger.
Saws't thou yon new moon?
It shaII out-Iive the new Duke by much.
This hand shaII dispossess him then we are mighty!
Is't so? 'Twas very good.
Do you think to be Duke then, kind brother?
I'II see fair pIay drop one and there Iies t'other.
'Tis weII.
Brothers and bastard, you dance next in heII.
- A voIunteer.
- Me! Pick me! Me! Me!
Who'II be our voIunteer?
Pick me. Me. No, don't pick him.
PistoIs! Treason! Guards! HeIp!
- My Lord, the Duke, is murder'd!
- No, I'm not.
Surgeons!
- Surgeons! Surgeons!
- How now?
- Murdered?
- Murdered!
How fares, my Lord?
FareweII to aII.
He that cIimbs highest has the greatest faII.
- My tongue is out of office.
- Air, gentIemen!
Thou'It not prate on't,
'twas Vindici murdered thee.
- Which one is he?
- Me!
- Thee?
- TeII nobody.
Whose groan was that?
That's thee and thy Father to my account.
Great heavens, the Duke's departed!
Here's a Iabour sav'd. I thought to have sped him. How came this?
Then I procIaim myseIf now I am Duke.
Thou Duke?
Reverend majesty!
Brother, thou Iiest.
SIave, so dost thou!
Base viIIain, has thou sIain my Lord and master?
A piteous tragedy... abIe to make an oId man's eyes bIoodshot.
Oh, unhand her there.
Most fitting reveIs.
This one kiIIed aII these.
None but Spurio, I and maybe Supervacuo.
It was a girI who kiIIed the Duke.
A deadIy hand wounded him.
The rest, ambitious who shouId ruIe and sway after his death were quickIy made away.
'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio!
AII our hope Iies in you. Your hair wiII make the siIver age again.
When there was fewer but more honest men.
The burden's weighty and wiII press age down.
May I so ruIe that heaven may keep the crown.
The rapes of your Iady and of mine, have been quitted with death on death - my work is done.
Here's the payment.
God speed.
WiII you not stay?
Aye... um, stay a minute Ionger, huh?
Of aII things, it puts me most to wonder, how the oId Duke came murd'red.
'Twas aII done for the best.
AII for your Grace's good.
We may be so boId to speak it now.
'Twas somewhat wittiIy carried, tho' I say it.
I murd'red him.
- You?
- WeII, we, two.
None eIse, twas I aIone.
If you Iook into his ribs, you'II find my knife.
Thanks. I have soreIy missed it.
- Lay hands on those viIIains!
- These others knew nothing.
- Bear them to execution.
- That's my son!
Heart, my Lord, was't not for thy good?
- My good?
- You shouId be offering us titIes.
Away with 'em!
An oId man such as he.
You that wouId murder him wouId murder me.
- Look to the Duke!
- Get back!
Get back!
Is't come about?
'Sfoot, brother, you began!
May not we set as weII as the Duke's son? Thou hast no conscience.
Are we not reveng'd? Is there one enemy Ieft amongst those?
'Tis time to die when we ourseIves our foes.
When murderers shut deeds cIose, this curse does seaI 'em;
If none discIose 'em, we ourseIves reveaI 'em!
This murder might have sIept in tongueIess brass but not for ourseIves, and the worId died an ass.
Now, my Lord...
Since we are in forever, this work was ours which eIse might have been sIipp'd.
If we Iist, we might have nobIes cIipp'd and go for Iess than beggars, but we hate to bIeed so cowardIy.
We have enough, i'faith.
We're weII our mother turn'd, our sister true.
We die... after a nest of Dukes.
Shit!
Adieu.
Adieu.
Revenge! Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!
VlNDlCl: Why, brother, this is fate.
CARLO: lt is, but whose?
VlNDlCl: l set my fate at naught so that l have revenge, revenge...

{3852}{3891}Jimmy, breakfast!
{3897}{3941}Time to come down!
{3947}{4014}# Down, down, down, down, quack|Down, down, down, down, quack
{4020}{4065}Up, up, up.
{4071}{4174}Engaging pulse rockets now!
{4186}{4273}- No!|- Now?
{4449}{4505}Is this supposed to happen?
{4511}{4560}Come on. Think.
{4566}{4650}Think. Think.
{4806}{4828}Brain blast.
{4834}{4906}Give me your lunch.
{4931}{5004}Thanks, boy.
{5305}{5394}Don't try that at home.
{5495}{5610}Must engage stabilisers.
{5672}{5717}Now, just a quick stop at my house.
{5723}{5827}I don't know, Jimmy. I gotta get|to school on time. Besides, you...
{5833}{5946}- Right. Gotcha.|- No, I didn't mean... Jimmy!
{5970}{6021}- See you in homeroom.|- OK.
{6027}{6151}Fasten your seat belt, Goddard.|It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
{6704}{6783}Well, what do you know,|the chimney fell off again.
{6789}{6881}Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
{7033}{7092}James Isaac Neutron.
{7098}{7144}I see you up there.
{7150}{7259}How many times have we told you|not to launch yourself off the roof?
{7265}{7326}Probably nine. Exactly nine.
{7332}{7390}They say repetition is good|for a developing brain.
{7396}{7444}Then what do you think you're doing?
{7450}{7544}Last night I got a message from space,|but it was garbled in the ionosphere,
{7550}{7640}so I had to launch a communications|toaster... I mean, satellite.
{7646}{7714}- And then when I tried...|- Well, message from space. Wow.
{7720}{7769}Don't encourage him, Hugh.
{7775}{7886}Jimmy, we've repeatedly told you|not to talk to strangers.
{7892}{8013}But, Mom, I'm on the verge of contact|with an advanced alien civilisation.
{8019}{8090}I don't care how advanced|they say they are, Jimmy.
{8096}{8188}If your father and I haven't met them,|they're strangers. Right, Hugh?
{8194}{8312}Well, except for policemen.|They're there to help you.
{8460}{8551}You've got to admit that is pretty neat.
{8557}{8657}But very unsafe, honey. That's bad.
{8940}{9051}Deactivate pants.
{9267}{9362}Engage, Gingivitis 2000.
{9677}{9729}Robo-Barber prototype, engage.
{9735}{9784}Online.
{9790}{9848}Ta-da.
{9854}{9934}You rock.
{9955}{10039}You go, girl.
{10155}{10239}Shoe-Bot!
{10667}{10751}Bye, Goddard.
{10766}{10895}- Wait! I'm here!|- Goodbye, son. Have a good day.
{10901}{10989}Goddard, not on the porch.
{11036}{11079}Hey! Hey, wait!
{11085}{11212}Seems like the perfect opportunity|to try out the Super Bubble Gumobile.
{11218}{11295}"No, Jimmy, don't try it. It's too soon."
{11301}{11411}Nonsense. All great inventions|need a test run.
{11632}{11711}All right!
{12139}{12206}Hello!
{12212}{12314}- Right here.|- Hey, look. Neutron's got another one.
{12320}{12437}Nice invention, Nerdtron. Too bad|somebody already invented the bus.
{12443}{12497}Hey, guys, I've got it down this time.
{12503}{12659}Internal combustion's such old science.|Bubble travel is the way of the future.
{12704}{12805}I guess trees are, like, the brakes.
{12941}{12982}Hello?
{12988}{13020}Jimmy?
{13026}{13102}Carl.
{13171}{13215}Careful!
{13221}{13291}Hey!
{13339}{13410}- Thanks.|- That's what I'm here for.
{13416}{13490}- What a day, huh?|- Look at the bright side, Carl.
{13496}{13580}The worst is behind us.
{13589}{13664}And my fossil-to-chromosome ratios|clearly demonstrate
{13670}{13739}that female dinosaurs,|like this plesiosaurus,
{13745}{13803}were the stronger and|smarter of their species.
{13809}{13875}But, so what else is new?
{13881}{13957}After class I'll be happy|to demonstrate how boy dinosaurs
{13963}{14051}got their butts kicked by|girl dinosaurs on a regular basis.
{14057}{14153}Excuse me, but the mandible crest|of Cindy's alleged "plesiosaurus"
{14159}{14270}is that of a male megalosaur, as defined|by the Congress of Palaeontologists.
{14276}{14359}Those findings were inconclusive,|and you know it, Neutron.
{14365}{14401}Hello! Miss Fowl,
{14407}{14541}what is the standard for research|on these extra-credit reports?
{14549}{14721}Yes, well... Let's move along|to "show and tell" now, shall we?
{14726}{14768}This is Ultra Lord.
{14774}{14921}Sheen, this is the seventh week in|a row you've shown Ultra Lord in class.
{14927}{14991}Miss Fowl, this one is different.
{14997}{15079}This "Purple Vengeance" version|with power fists and nuclear knees
{15085}{15194}is a rare, never-been-seen condition,|making it highly collectable.
{15200}{15327}Never been seen, huh? Well, then,|how do you know it's even in there?
{15491}{15556}No!
{15562}{15658}Hey, Jimmy, wanna see a frog?
{15666}{15790}- That looks great, Carl.|- Thanks. What are you drawing?
{15796}{15880}Flycycle modifications for Goddard.|Second prototype.
{15886}{15941}Prototype, huh?
{15947}{16024}- Well, you know, that looks good, too.|- Thanks, Carl.
{16030}{16168}Carl! Would you please share|with us your "show and tell"?
{16174}{16230}OK.
{16236}{16289}This is my inhaler.
{16295}{16372}It provides fast-acting relief|of bronchial swelling
{16378}{16434}due to asthma or allergies.
{16440}{16523}One touch of the button and...
{16559}{16642}- I can't see!|- Thank you, Carl.
{16648}{16737}All right. Next we have...
{16743}{16819}Nick!
{16940}{16989}Yes, Nick.
{16995}{17070}You are a tad tardy again.
{17076}{17123}Oh, my. Am I?
{17129}{17264}It took me a little while to copy my|mom's handwriting for this late note.
{17284}{17338}Your "show and tell", please.
{17344}{17376}How's it goin'?
{17382}{17475}You know, I don't really|do "show and tell".
{17479}{17600}Yes, that's right. Thank you, Nick.
{17607}{17688}- Did you drop this?|- Yes. Well, I...
{17694}{17773}My dropped pencil.
{17779}{17910}Jimmy, we eagerly await|another one of your
{17916}{18021}interesting "show and tells".
{18027}{18113}As a matter of fact,|I brought my latest invention.
{18119}{18184}Behold. The Shrink Ray!
{18190}{18290}What's the matter, Neutron?|Aren't you short enough already?
{18296}{18342}Funny, Cindy.
{18348}{18454}But this device is more suited to shrink|something as vast as space itself,
{18460}{18545}like, say, your mouth.
{18630}{18691}Help me. Help me. I'm so tiny.
{18697}{18765}Just like Jimmy's brain.
{18771}{18819}So much for the Nobel Prize.
{18825}{18860}Children, that's enough.
{18866}{18927}Better luck next time.
{18933}{18984}It worked this morning.
{18990}{19046}I like your useless shrink ray, Jimmy.
{19052}{19155}Well, it's probably just|a programming error.
{19233}{19317}Oh, my.
{19421}{19505}Back! Back! Leviathan!
{19532}{19568}Come on, Jimmy.
{19574}{19694}Some of the greatest inventors started|as complete, hopeless failures, too.
{19700}{19744}- Yeah.|- Well, thank you, Carl.
{19750}{19794}I feel better, I think.
{19800}{19844}- I'm glad.|- That's good.
{19850}{19934}Hey, Retroland Theme Park.|Check it out.
{19940}{20006}Meet Ultra Lord. Live!
{20012}{20099}Look, it's the state-of-the-art,|bone-warping gravity ride.
{20105}{20144}I can hang out with Ultra Lord.
{20150}{20205}And there's a petting zoo.
{20211}{20306}- Well, look at this.|- No, meet Ultra Lord live.
{20312}{20384}Llamas and capybaras.
{20390}{20452}Who cares? Meet Ultra Lord live.
{20458}{20518}Yeah, but I'm gonna touch a llama.
{20524}{20595}Guys, we have got to go to|the grand opening tonight.
{20601}{20633}Yeah!
{20639}{20748}Yeah. But my folks won't|let me stay out after dark.
{20754}{20800}Well, it is a school night.
{20806}{20939}Pukin' Pluto, there's gotta be something|we can do. It's the grand opening.
{20945}{20999}- Sneak out.|- What?
{21005}{21074}You heard me, dweebs. Sneak out.
{21080}{21153}Yeah, but my parents sorta told me...
{21159}{21232}Parents. What, are you guys|gonna be kids forever?
{21238}{21289}What your parents|don't know won't hurt 'em.
{21295}{21410}But, Nick, sneaking out|is so barbaric.
{21416}{21498}Whatever, Neutron.|But there's only one opening night,
{21504}{21640}and anybody who matters|is gonna be there.
{21712}{21770}What d'you think, Jimmy?
{21776}{21863}Nick has a point.|There is only one opening night.
{21869}{21931}Think, think, think, think, think.
{21937}{21999}Well, according to the|{y:i}Newville Journal of Medicine,
{22005}{22076}monkeys are easily influenced|by positive reinforcement,
{22082}{22131}e.g. The giving of a banana.
{22137}{22213}And since human and monkey DNA|only differ by two per cent,
{22219}{22271}the same principle|should work on our parents.
{22277}{22319}My dad's allergic to bananas.
{22325}{22400}It's not the bananas. It's the principle.
{22406}{22445}It's called psychology.
{22451}{22505}All you have to do is butter 'em up.
{22511}{22567}Give it a try. I'll call you guys later.
{22573}{22644}We go to Retroland tonight!
{22650}{22734}Yeah!
{22801}{22867}- Watch out!|- Hey!
{22873}{22957}Hold on!
{23198}{23250}I know.
{23256}{23350}Excuse me, are you|through with that? Thanks.
{23356}{23440}A few oysters.
{23489}{23567}One lump of coal coming up.
{23568}{23647}- Thanks, Gus.|- Hi, Jimmy.
{23653}{23733}Excuse me.
{24039}{24089}Jimmy, is that you, dear?
{24095}{24174}Yeah, Mom. I'll be in in a second.
{24180}{24256}DNA match confirmed.|Welcome home, Jimmy.
{24262}{24331}Eliminate school smell.
{24337}{24412}- Normal odour restored.|- Thank you, Vox.
{24418}{24472}You're welcome.
{24478}{24594}Warning. Entry tube|closed for maintenance.
{24621}{24732}- Thank you, Vox.|- You're welcome.
{24784}{24843}Here, Goddard. Here, boy.
{24849}{24933}Here, Goddard.
{24952}{25035}Hey, look what I brought ya. Aluminium.
{25041}{25097}Do you want it? Do you want it? Huh?
{25103}{25154}Sit.
{25160}{25244}Roll over.
{25261}{25345}Play dead.
{25434}{25557}Mental note: Fix bug|in obedience program.
{25639}{25724}Good boy.
{25773}{25874}OK, Goddard,|let's check the experiments.
{26236}{26300}The invisible hamsters|are looking great...
{26306}{26378}I think.
{26384}{26496}Let's see how|the girl-eating plant is doing.
{26590}{26627}Nice choice.
{26633}{26713}As usual.
{26758}{26818}The latest burping-soda formula.
{26824}{26916}A guaranteed one burp per sip.
{27070}{27154}Excuse you!
{27266}{27349}You know, there's still no reply|to our satellite message.
{27355}{27394}Jeez, it's been a whole day.
{27400}{27483}You'd think we would have heard from|an alien civilisation by now, huh?
{27489}{27575}Well, come on, Goddard.
{27673}{27725}Say "Aah".
{27731}{27798}Add a little sand.
{27804}{27879}And in you go.
{28027}{28120}I'm just an old lump of coal
{28126}{28200}But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
{28206}{28221}Oh, yeah
{28227}{28278}Jimmy.
{28284}{28327}Hi, Mom.
{28333}{28390}Jimmy, you scared|the bejabers out of me.
{28396}{28449}Sorry about your bejabers, Mom.
{28455}{28518}And might I add|how lovely you look today.
{28524}{28591}- I'm covered in transmission fluid.|- Exactly.
{28597}{28678}And might I say,|filth never looked so good.
{28684}{28749}Yes, well, how was|"show and tell" today?
{28755}{28842}Was OK. But first, happy birthday, Mom.
{28848}{28899}Jimmy, these are beautiful.
{28905}{28972}But, sweetie, it's not my birthday.
{28978}{29018}It's not? Well...
{29024}{29162}Then whatever will I do with these|lovely pearls and priceless earrings?
{29168}{29236}- These can't be real.|- But they can.
{29242}{29319}And they are!
{29347}{29416}And all these fabulous gifts|and prizes could be yours
{29422}{29478}if you know the correct answer|to this question.
{29484}{29580}- Please may I go to Retroland tonight?|- No, it's a school night.
{29586}{29689}Thank you so much, Mother.|And might I say...
{29733}{29784}- Did you just say no?|- Yes.
{29790}{29822}- Yes!|- No.
{29828}{29854}- No?|- Yes.
{29860}{29897}- Yes!|- Jimmy...
{29903}{29973}But all my friends are going.
{29979}{30053}And anybody who matters|is gonna be there, Mom.
{30059}{30142}I matter and your father matters|and you matter.
{30148}{30214}But you're not going.|Maybe we can go next weekend.
{30220}{30369}Wait. I'm sure there must be something|else in here to change your mind...
{30457}{30541}No, Jimmy! Look out! Look out, Jimmy!
{30593}{30645}Jimmy, be careful.
{30651}{30735}Mom, get me out!
{30755}{30843}- I didn't do it!|- Stop, drop and roll! My goodness!
{30849}{30924}Goddard.
{31026}{31096}OK, Jimmy. That's the last straw.
{31102}{31190}We have told you time and time again|about playing with rockets.
{31196}{31315}But, Mom, it's technically not a rocket.|It's more of a jet-pack-type thing.
{31321}{31381}I don't care what type thing it is.
{31387}{31481}You just climb those|stair-type things right now.
{31487}{31575}Your father will have a few words|to say to you when he gets home.
{31581}{31617}It's not a rocket.
{31623}{31702}- March.|- Mom...
{32278}{32353}Yes.
{32364}{32427}The king, he loves his little orthgot.
{32433}{32560}Yes, he does. Yes, he does.|Yes, he does.
{32575}{32619}Yes, he does.
{32625}{32787}Sire, my King, it appears to be|some type of alien transmission device.
{32803}{32890}Tell me, when did it become acceptable
{32896}{32976}to approach|my royal throne unannounced?
{32982}{33018}Yes, of course, my King.
{33024}{33109}- Space him!|- I assure you that...
{33269}{33357}Wait!
{33409}{33451}I missed it.
{33457}{33525}- Can I, can I, can I space another?|- No.
{33531}{33588}- Please, brother.|- I said no, Ooblar.
{33594}{33732}- Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please...|- I would love for that to stop.
{33743}{33789}What have we here?
{33795}{33964}As the king's assistant, I am the official|checker of new things to be checked.
{34006}{34068}It's all right. It's all right. I'll handle this.
{34074}{34154}Hello!
{34163}{34234}What galaxy are you from?
{34240}{34298}- Ooblar.|- Where is your leader?
{34304}{34418}Ooblar, stop it. It's toast.
{34437}{34482}Hello, toast.
{34488}{34596}I greatly admire your ship.
{34602}{34692}Beginning transmission from Earth.
{34732}{34783}Greetings from planet Earth.
{34789}{34876}I'm Jimmy Neutron and|you're an alien life form.
{34882}{34937}- I welcome the opportunity...|- What a big head.
{34943}{35102}...for the mutual exchange of scientific|knowledge and universal brotherhood.
{35115}{35176}This here is my dog, Goddard.
{35182}{35270}And this that you're looking at|is my room. That's where I sleep.
{35276}{35365}And this is my mom and dad|right here. Mom, Dad.
{35371}{35456}Freeze that image.
{35516}{35562}They look...
{35568}{35655}delicious.
{35661}{35757}The search is over!
{35974}{36038}But, Dad, all my friends|are gonna be there.
{36044}{36146}I know, son, but if all your friends were|named Cliff, would you jump off them?
{36152}{36208}I don't think you would.|You see, Jimmy...
{36214}{36258}Jimmy. Jim, Jim, Jimmy.
{36264}{36366}Jim, James, son, let me|tell you a little about rockets.
{36372}{36423}They're big-people things, son.
{36429}{36570}And you just can't go around playing|with big-people, fiery, flying things
{36576}{36624}because that's what rockets are.
{36630}{36699}Rockets are flying things.
{36705}{36797}Well, I hope this talk has helped.
{36858}{36919}And, by the way,|Mom says you're grounded.
{36925}{36984}Sorry.
{36990}{37120}What good is it to be a genius if you|can't even go out on a school night?
{37126}{37184}Goddard, options.
{37190}{37262}Apologise. Your parents love you.
{37268}{37298}Next.
{37304}{37363}Create a time capsule.|Escape to the future.
{37369}{37438}That'll take too long. Next.
{37444}{37488}Build Goddard a female poodle.
{37494}{37586}Goddard, this is serious.
{37589}{37625}Sneak out.
{37631}{37731}That's it. Barbaric problems|call for barbaric solutions.
{37737}{37821}Phone, please.
{37825}{37860}Carl, it's me.
{37866}{37926}You get permission? Me neither.
{37932}{38011}It turns out parents|don't understand psychology.
{38017}{38104}Tell Sheen to meet us|at Retroland in one hour.
{38110}{38185}We're sneakin' out.
{38191}{38281}Halt! Hold it right there!
{38322}{38401}Jimmy's awfully quiet up there, Hugh.|Do you think we were too tough?
{38407}{38506}- No, I don't think so, dear. No.|- Maybe I should check on him.
{38512}{38647}Now, now. I'm sure he's just|reflecting on the error of his ways.
{38653}{38746}Dealing with it in a mature,|responsible manner.
{38752}{38851}"Mom says you're grounded."|Take that.
{38873}{38921}It's working now.
{38927}{39004}OK, Goddard, you know what to do.
{39010}{39071}Good boy.
{39077}{39161}See you later, Goddard.
{39227}{39326}Jimmy's a big boy now.|Don't you worry, sugar.
{39332}{39387}- I suppose you're right.|- Yeah, sure.
{39393}{39460}I was a kid once. I remember|being grounded a whole week
{39466}{39581}and not being allowed to go|to my best friend's bachelor party.
{39586}{39692}- Well, what did you do?|- Actually, I snuck out.
{39711}{39798}- You don't think that Jimmy...|- No, no.
{39804}{39852}Besides, how's he gonna sneak out?
{39858}{39925}It's not like he can just|walk right out the front door.
{39931}{40010}That's true.
{40156}{40245}Retroland, here I come.
{40434}{40505}Libby, you're breaking|my concentration.
{40511}{40607}Hey, I gotta choose a ring|that fits my personality.
{40613}{40715}Yeah! Here we go! Here we go!
{40739}{40798}Tell me what it is|you're supposed to be doing again.
{40804}{40908}T'ai Chi, while drinking Purple Flurp.
{40913}{41029}T'ai Chi promotes wellness,|relaxes and rejuvenates the body.
{41035}{41118}Whereas Purple Flurp,
{41124}{41175}being 98 per cent sugar,|creates tension
{41181}{41243}and a temporary rush of energy|and mood swings.
{41249}{41332}I figure if I do them together,
{41338}{41457}I achieve perfect balance.
{41569}{41634}It's better than the poster.
{41640}{41735}Gentlemen, this will be a night|we shan't easily forget.
{41741}{41845}I don't know what "shan't" means,|but let's go.
{42536}{42625}Do you promise to use your powers|for good and not evil?
{42631}{42657}Yes, Ultra Lord.
{42663}{42864}Now, Counterpart, take this Ultra Mask|and lead the fight for justice.
{42918}{42990}Is this kid with anyone?
{43008}{43092}Go, Carl.
{43299}{43348}Now that's what I call a ride.
{43354}{43438}Let's go.
{43648}{43707}This is way beyond awesome.
{43713}{43803}Just think if you boneheaded|dweebs had listened to your parents,
{43809}{43943}you'd be home in bed|instead of riding this monster.
{44137}{44182}I tell you, he's fine.
{44188}{44239}Just a quick peek, Hugh.
{44245}{44298}There. Now, what did I tell you?
{44304}{44349}Jimmy, are you awake, dear?
{44355}{44422}Yes, Mother. I am awake.
{44428}{44524}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{44530}{44633}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{44738}{44809}Honey, I know you're upset.
{44815}{44871}We don't like to punish you.
{44877}{44961}You're such a special boy.
{45732}{45835}According to this, we should encourage|Jimmy without overindulging him.
{45841}{45922}OK. What does it say about rockets?
{45928}{45997}- Is there someone in the kitchen?|- Our kitchen?
{46003}{46087}I didn't hear anything.
{46165}{46260}Honey, did you leave|the green light on?
{46276}{46324}Jimmy?
{46330}{46393}Jimmy?
{46449}{46529}You're not Jimmy.
{46530}{46588}Hugh?
{46594}{46639}Hugh, are you all right?
{46645}{46713}Hugh?
{47611}{47687}- Was that so cool, dude!|- Yeah! That was great!
{47693}{47747}- Mind-bending!|- Yeah!
{47753}{47817}Hey, my pants are almost dry.
{47823}{47891}Hey, Jimmy, I never thought|I'd say it, but here goes.
{47897}{47964}You know what?|That Nick is not such a bad guy.
{47970}{48066}- Are you kidding? He's a genius.|- He's a genius!
{48072}{48127}- No offence, Jimmy.|- None taken.
{48133}{48219}Actually, I find his insights on how|to deal with one's parents refreshing.
{48225}{48312}Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if our folks|all disappeared for a while?
{48318}{48350}Yeah.
{48356}{48401}Hey, a shooting star.
{48407}{48506}Cool. You get to make a wish. Lucky.
{48512}{48553}What should I wish for?
{48559}{48624}I know what I'd wish for.|I'd wish for no more parents.
{48630}{48702}That way we could do whatever|we wanted, whenever we wanted.
{48708}{48784}We'd be free.|We could have fun all the time.
{48790}{48871}Yeah!
{48898}{48952}Liftoff in five,
{48958}{49048}four, three, two...
{49054}{49128}We have liftoff.
{49134}{49215}Abort mission. Abort mission.
{49221}{49283}Goddard, wake mode.
{49289}{49397}All right. Come on, boy.|Race you to the kitchen.
{49450}{49496}Beat ya.
{49502}{49582}Hey, Mom, did you get|any more Purple Flurp?
{49588}{49665}Mom!
{49701}{49751}"Dear son/daughter,
{49757}{49829}we have gone to Florida|for an extended vacation."
{49835}{49882}"Love, your parents."
{49888}{49955}Yeah. My parents went to Florida, too.
{49961}{50003}That's weird.
{50009}{50059}From the look of it,
{50065}{50127}I'd say a lot of parents are gone.
{50133}{50171}Well... Did...
{50177}{50253}- Did they all go to Florida?|- Maybe they went to get juice.
{50259}{50376}I don't digest pulp well.|It makes me bloaty.
{50382}{50478}Goddard, scan for adult life forms.
{50531}{50673}Just as I thought. There are absolutely|no adults anywhere within radar.
{50679}{50743}They're gone. The whole city.
{50749}{50789}No parents.
{50795}{50873}No parents.
{50879}{50970}No parents!
{51098}{51182}Excuse me.
{51185}{51230}I'm letting out the cold.
{51236}{51339}I'm peeing in the shower.
{51342}{51442}Llama, llama, llama!
{51521}{51590}I'm walking up the down escalator.
{51596}{51720}# My clothes don't match! I'm out|in public and my clothes don't match!
{51955}{52071}I'm still doing it. Go, go, go.
{52099}{52230}Welcome to the Candy Bar. Whoopee|cushion or non-whoopee cushion?
{52244}{52328}Jimmy!
{52389}{52473}What'll it be, boys?
{52503}{52631}- We'll have what he's throwing.|- Excellent choice.
{52723}{52807}Hang on!
{52814}{52887}No skiing in the halls.
{52893}{52995}Don't make me get the protractor.
{53680}{53735}Morning, Goddard.
{53741}{53814}My head. What a night.
{53820}{53896}I'm stuffed now. I couldn't have ano...
{53902}{54054}OK, one more. I'm gonna have one more|and then that'll be it.
{54057}{54151}What a battle. Are there any survivors?
{54157}{54218}Help me.
{54266}{54316}I remember my first time.
{54322}{54406}Shake it off, Neutron.
{54411}{54486}I gotta get home. Mom and Dad|might be back by now.
{54492}{54576}Come on, Goddard.
{54734}{54802}We interrupt this programme|to bring you this report.
{54808}{54862}Hey, knock it off, Arnie.
{54868}{54950}"Trouble in Paradise."|That's what some kids are saying
{54956}{55047}in the aftermath of yesterday's|"Mom and Dad are gone" celebrations.
{55053}{55089}Here's Courtney Tyler.
{55095}{55197}What started as an awesome day|has become, like, a real bummer.
{55203}{55254}- Help us!|- I don't know how to make lunch.
{55260}{55324}- I want my parents.|- Somebody hold me.
{55330}{55411}I was playing on the teetertotter
{55417}{55599}and the next thing I knew I was|on the ground and my knee hurt.
{55610}{55687}Reports of tummy aches,|owies and constipation
{55693}{55761}have reached epidemic numbers|over the past few hours,
{55767}{55850}with little indication of slowing down.
{55856}{55986}And so we were gonna see|who could eat the most cotton candy.
{55992}{56068}And I won.
{56074}{56187}I want my mommy.
{56204}{56284}So, there you have it.
{56290}{56378}I want my mommy, too.
{56485}{56569}Mom? Dad?
{56789}{56905}What kind of parents|take off and leave their kid?
{56938}{57027}And they didn't even say goodbye.
{57118}{57213}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{57219}{57319}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{57328}{57385}We only do what we do|because we love you.
{57391}{57478}Maybe we can all go to Retroland|next weekend, the three of us.
{57484}{57566}What about my fabulous dog Goddard?
{57572}{57656}Sure. Your fabulous dog Goddard, too.
{57662}{57701}Well, good night, son.
{57707}{57758}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.
{57764}{57848}We'll see you in the morning.
{57888}{57919}OK.
{57925}{57987}So they said good night.
{57993}{58045}"In the morning"? Hey, wait a minute.
{58051}{58124}Play back the last part again.|Audio only.
{58130}{58211}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.|We'll see you in the morning.
{58217}{58297}There. Why would she say that|if they weren't gonna be here?
{58303}{58406}Come on, Goddard.|We're going to the lab.
{58410}{58455}It's just as I thought.
{58461}{58556}The serifs and kerning on the note don't|match Mom and Dad's handwriting.
{58562}{58615}This note's a fake.
{58621}{58669}What is it, boy?
{58675}{58759}The Long-Range Space Scanner.|It detected something.
{58765}{58875}Filtering out background|radiation and... There it is.
{58881}{59022}Jumping Jupiter!|The Earth's been visited by aliens!
{59028}{59117}OK, so me, you and a dog
{59123}{59211}are gonna battle|an alien civilisation, right?
{59217}{59320}- By ourselves?|- He's a good dog. Aren't you, boy?
{59326}{59437}The last time we tried this, we couldn't|even break free of the atmosphere.
{59443}{59521}I know, I know. But I recalculated|the thrust-to-fuel ratio
{59527}{59613}and I've adjusted|the engine accordingly.
{59619}{59715}- I can fix that.|- Neutron.
{59762}{59863}- What is it?|- An angry mob.
{59931}{60020}In times of crisis, intellectuals|are always the first to go.
{60026}{60131}Well, they don't look angry.|They look like they're about to barf.
{60137}{60240}Let me go. You're messing with powers|far beyond your mortal comprehension.
{60246}{60285}OK, Neutron.
{60291}{60395}Ultra Freak here says you really know|what happened to all our parents.
{60401}{60505}Hey, how you doin'? I didn't say nothin'|about our parents being abducted...
{60511}{60632}- Where's my mom and dad?|- Hey, what's the matter?
{60638}{60725}Goddard, star map 72, please.
{60751}{60813}Right about there.
{60819}{60899}Long-range sensors picked up|these ion trails, indicating the route
{60905}{60962}for whatever intelligence|abducted our parents.
{60968}{61023}They lead us somewhere|in the Orion star system
{61029}{61118}three million light years away,|so we'll need to leave by Friday.
{61124}{61189}OK, that gives us about two days|to collect the plutonium,
{61195}{61289}design and test our fusion engines and|build our fleet of interstellar warships.
{61295}{61335}We'll also need to bring snacks.
{61341}{61418}Any questions?
{61487}{61551}Are you sure about this, Neutron?
{61557}{61620}Well, the data seems|to support this hypothesis.
{61626}{61731}Never argue with the data.
{61737}{61809}OK, Neutron, here's the lowdown.
{61815}{61907}You get us to those|kidnapping alien scuzzballs,
{61913}{61966}and I'll take it from there.
{61972}{62055}We're getting our parents back.
{62398}{62481}OK, Ben, that's good. Let it down slow.
{62487}{62571}Two more turns, Emma. Not too tight.
{62599}{62683}Yup. Tape adhesion is|within operational limits.
{62689}{62735}What? Cindy?
{62741}{62811}Cindy, what did you do to|that intergalactic starship?
{62817}{62913}We thought that the deep recesses|of space could use a feminine touch.
{62919}{62960}What do you think, Jimmy?
{62966}{63018}Yeah, it's OK, I guess.
{63024}{63067}You kinda ruined it though.
{63073}{63153}Hey, Jimmy, do these fusion reactors|need fuel rods?
{63159}{63250}Come on, Sheen. It's not rocket|science. You just have to...
{63256}{63327}Actually, I guess it is rocket science.
{63333}{63421}- No fuel rods, Sheen.|- OK.
{63467}{63562}And for the final touch...
{63728}{63837}Good work, everybody.|We're ready for intergalactic travel.
{63843}{63908}Neutron, this is gonna work, right?
{63914}{64005}- Yeah, Jimmy. What if it doesn't work?|- It will work!
{64011}{64057}I'm 95 per cent sure it will.
{64063}{64098}- 95?|- Yeah.
{64104}{64176}Yeah, and the other five per cent?
{64182}{64231}We blow up.
{64237}{64265}But just a little.
{64271}{64351}Look, a 95 is still an "A".
{64357}{64471}Yeah, I can deal with that.|I never got a 95 in my life.
{64477}{64630}You heard the man. Stop sucking|your thumbs and let's light this candle.
{64736}{64810}Goddard, initiate launch sequence.
{64816}{64857}Make sure seat belts are fastened
{64863}{65016}and remember to keep your hands and|arms inside the vehicles at all times.
{65986}{66047}Come on, everybody. Get in formation.
{66053}{66092}Carl, you're too low.
{66098}{66191}Come on, you stupid butterfly.
{66307}{66395}Go, Counterparts! Go!
{66398}{66480}Hang on. We're passing|through the stratosphere.
{66486}{66539}Now the mesosphere.
{66545}{66599}Entering ionosphere.
{66605}{66712}Now I know why they all end in "phere"!
{66718}{66855}This is it, baby.|Engaging pulse rockets now.
{66917}{67010}Come on, come on, come on, come on.
{67627}{67693}Look, Goddard.|The wonders of the universe.
{67699}{67869}We are witnessing celestial events|no person, or dog, has ever seen.
{67871}{67960}It's incredible.
{68122}{68183}Beautiful, isn't it, Nick?
{68189}{68289}Yeah, yeah.|Wake me when we get there.
{68290}{68334}Hey, Jimmy.
{68340}{68415}D'you think we can|rotate shifts after a while?
{68421}{68512}Hey, we'll switch.
{68621}{68702}Hey, this astronaut food isn't too bad.
{68708}{68788}That's toothpaste, Carl.
{68800}{68853}Minty.
{68859}{68959}- Hey, what's happening?|- Meteor shower.
{68965}{69044}Evasive action.
{69236}{69361}I do so relish these times of peril.
{69819}{69898}- That was close.|- Look out!
{70047}{70096}We've gotta find shelter.
{70102}{70165}Asteroid bearing 236.7 degrees.
{70171}{70255}Come on!
{70792}{70889}So then these three filmmakers|find all these sticks in the trees
{70895}{70939}shaped like stick people.
{70945}{71048}And the girl filmmaker starts crying|and her nose starts dripping.
{71054}{71158}And they don't have any tissue at all.
{71164}{71194}None?
{71200}{71236}None.
{71242}{71336}So then they start to hear|really scary noises
{71342}{71406}and voices coming from outside.
{71412}{71473}So they leave the tent.
{71479}{71526}Don't leave the tent!|Don't leave the tent!
{71532}{71637}Oh, yeah, Carl. They leave the tent|and they follow the voices,
{71643}{71741}when from out of|the darkness comes the...
{71758}{71898}Man, that was so choice.|You should have seen your faces.
{71898}{71975}Did they really leave the tent, Nick?
{71981}{72069}Hey, there's a red giant.|And that's a white dwarf.
{72075}{72161}You can relate, huh, Neutron?
{72206}{72250}Hey, Jimmy, what's the matter?
{72256}{72366}Listen, in case you haven't noticed,|I'm not exactly the tallest guy around.
{72372}{72431}Shorty, squirt, small-stuff, shrimp.
{72437}{72479}It gets to you after a while.
{72485}{72533}And next year there'll be dances.
{72539}{72639}What girl'd dance with a guy who looks|like he should still be in Gymboree?
{72645}{72738}I didn't think we liked girls yet, Jim.
{72744}{72811}We don't. We don't. No. Not yet. No.
{72817}{72861}However, one day, Carl,
{72867}{72985}an influx of hormones we can't control|will overpower our better judgment
{72991}{73083}and drive us to pursue|the female species against our will.
{73089}{73180}Stop talking like that, Jimmy.|You're gonna give me nightmares.
{73186}{73226}Listen, I wouldn't worry, Carl.
{73232}{73346}I have a feeling puberty is|light years away for you and me.
{73406}{73498}You know, we should have|never wished on that star, Jimmy,
{73504}{73596}cos I miss my folks.
{73602}{73687}My mom used to|tuck me in bed every night
{73693}{73785}before she was abducted by aliens.
{73791}{73884}Before my dad was abducted by aliens,
{73890}{73943}he would always read me to sleep.
{73949}{74052}Before my mom was inducted by aliens,
{74058}{74195}she would rub my tummy|and she'd sing...
{74246}{74292}- What?|- Nothing.
{74298}{74389}Come on, you guys.|We gotta keep our heads.
{74395}{74479}We'll find 'em.
{75268}{75332}What is it, boy?
{75338}{75417}Sensor sweeps reveal|many advanced cities and...
{75423}{75497}ion energy signatures. That's it!
{75503}{75602}We've found it. I repeat: We've found it.
{75624}{75689}Nick, we'll contact you|as soon as we find the parents
{75695}{75740}so you can kick some alien buttocks.
{75746}{75861}- Piece of cake.|- OK, scouting party, follow me.
{75867}{75961}I'll be back, Nick.
{76140}{76217}Wow. What is that?
{76735}{76847}Wow. They've evolved beyond the need|for mere conventional bodies.
{76853}{76947}They must be an advanced species|millions of years ahead of us.
{76953}{77103}Wow. When I sneeze, it looks like|an advanced species, too.
{77208}{77297}OK, they're this way.
{77338}{77427}Right this way, sire.
{77435}{77547}Ooblar, these humans look so scrawny.|Hardly very appetising.
{77553}{77595}Are you sure they're yummy?
{77601}{77652}I assure you, my slimy sovereign.
{77658}{77706}Poultra will be quite pleased.
{77712}{77795}Humans are mostly water|with a crunchy, bony centre.
{77801}{77846}Think nuts and chews.
{77852}{77907}- There they are.|- What are they doing?
{77913}{78057}- What are those things on their heads?|- It looks like a mind-control device.
{78063}{78112}Mom. Dad. Dad!
{78118}{78160}It's me. Jimmy. Over here.
{78166}{78233}Jim, Jim, Jim, Jimmys,|James, James, Jim.
{78239}{78338}Big, fiery, flying Jimmy. Hi, Jimmy.
{78344}{78443}Some dream, huh? Attack of the big|egg people. I think I've seen this one.
{78449}{78588}No, Dad. You're wearing a mind-control|device. Take yours off. Hurry!
{78614}{78664}- Dad?|- Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
{78670}{78754}Dad, no, no, no. Sh.
{78764}{78831}Jimmy, your dad's like|a mind-control duck man.
{78837}{78889}- Let's get outta here.|- Let's go.
{78895}{78998}Come back. Join us, Jimmy. Join us.
{79163}{79297}Well, well, if it isn't the littlest|rescue party. How cute.
{79303}{79351}Hello, itty-bitty humans.
{79357}{79420}You let us go, you big ball of phlegm.
{79426}{79509}That's no way to talk to the king.|He is the royal phlegm.
{79515}{79563}- Ooblar.|- Sorry, sire.
{79569}{79668}I think it's only fair to warn you that|if you don't release us within 24 hours,
{79674}{79799}an army of trained combat specialists|is poised to destroy your entire planet.
{79805}{79845}- Really?|- Really.
{79851}{79962}Oh, my. Our entire planet.|Whatever shall we do?
{79968}{80085}Do you mean this army|of trained combat specialists?
{80091}{80196}- Hey, it's Nick. Hey, Nick. Oh, man...|- Nick!
{80202}{80286}Get your grubs off me, egghead.
{80293}{80372}Don't look so surprised.|We're an advanced alien race.
{80378}{80441}What did you expect?
{80447}{80493}What do you want with our parents?
{80499}{80577}It's not what I want.|It's what Poultra wants.
{80583}{80642}- Who's Poultra?|- Poultra is our god.
{80648}{80733}The mightiest,|most ferocious creature in all...
{80739}{80845}I get tired of answering this. Roll tape.
{80868}{80987}Hello and welcome to our special|edition of "Poultra: God of Wrath".
{80993}{81116}- Brought to you by Goo...|- Commercials. Hate them.
{81122}{81173}Welcome back. If you're watching this,
{81179}{81279}chances are your friends and/or|relatives are about to be sacrificed
{81285}{81370}to the Mighty Poultra,|which is a great honour indeed.
{81376}{81453}And very painful.
{81485}{81581}And this year's human sacrifices|feature something very special:
{81587}{81624}Actual humans.
{81630}{81706}And it's all thanks to Jimmy Neutron.
{81712}{81862}Greetings from planet Earth. I'm Jimmy|Neutron and you're an alien life form.
{81868}{81929}You know, without the coordinates|you gave us,
{81935}{82002}we never would have found|your puny little planet.
{82008}{82117}For such a tiny earthling, you've been|a very big help, Jimmy Neutron.
{82123}{82201}Guards, throw these minuscule vermin|into the dungeon
{82207}{82335}until they're of worthier size, and give|Mr Neutron the presidential suite.
{82341}{82417}What?
{82533}{82628}Isn't this a funny-wunny little toy?
{82658}{82725}Get it off me! Get it off!
{82731}{82800}Take this infernal thing to the lab|and have it torn apart.
{82806}{82908}Yes, great saliva-armed one.
{82911}{82964}- Hold it. Move along.|- Goddard!
{82970}{83035}Move!
{83619}{83694}So, it was Neutron all along.
{83700}{83740}I mean, he got us into this.
{83746}{83838}Hey, Jimmy, didn't your parents|ever tell you not to talk to strangers?
{83844}{83890}That's rule number one.
{83896}{83958}Come on, you guys. Give him a break.
{83964}{84013}Jimmy didn't mean to ruin our lives
{84019}{84098}and get our parents eaten|by a giant space monster.
{84104}{84223}She's right. We need to ask ourselves|"What would Ultra Lord do?"
{84229}{84336}Let's think about that, Sheen. Maybe|sit on a shelf because he's a doll!
{84342}{84402}He's not. He's an action figure.|There's a difference.
{84408}{84506}Come on, Nick. Let Sheen talk.|Maybe he's onto something.
{84512}{84566}What would Ultra Lord do, Sheen?
{84572}{84612}Well, in episode 224
{84618}{84773}he fried the zeebot's brain with his|heat-seeking infra-thought. It was cool.
{84783}{84831}Well, I'm convinced, folks,
{84837}{84906}that's pretty much|the stupidest thing I ever heard!
{84912}{85024}No. This is the stupidest thing|you've ever heard.
{85034}{85077}You are such a baby.
{85083}{85160}Leave me alone. You're picking|on me because you're insecure.
{85166}{85239}Jimmy, you there?
{85245}{85305}Look, don't listen to them.
{85311}{85357}They're just scared.
{85363}{85405}Are you OK?
{85411}{85486}Yeah. I'm fine.
{85492}{85606}Don't be so hard on yourself.|We'll get out of this.
{85607}{85683}OK, so you made a mistake.
{85689}{85752}Beating yourself up|isn't gonna fix anything.
{85758}{85884}You know, I was the smartest kid|in school until you came along.
{85890}{85972}And I admit you know more|about some things than I do.
{85978}{86048}But I know one thing|that you don't seem to get,
{86054}{86145}and that's that we're never|getting outta here without you.
{86151}{86212}So why don't you buck up, mister,
{86218}{86278}and put that big brain of yours|back to work?
{86284}{86433}Nick can handle the fighting stuff,|but first we have to get out of this cell.
{86446}{86558}Cindy, why are you being|so nice to me?
{86564}{86655}Because there's a bunch of kids|in here that need you.
{86661}{86753}And I do, too.
{86852}{86992}I am never complaining|about my parents again.
{87009}{87078}We didn't even get our one phone call.
{87084}{87166}That's it!|Libby, let me see your cellphone.
{87172}{87224}OK, but I don't think my service plan
{87230}{87287}covers anything|outside our solar system.
{87293}{87414}- Who are you calling?|- A friend of mine.
{87452}{87498}All right, little Earth doggy.
{87504}{87628}Ooblar is going to take you apart|into tiny little pieces.
{87634}{87714}All right?
{87795}{87879}Hey, give me that!
{87881}{87925}Fine. We'll use this one then.
{87931}{88011}No, no, no, no, no. No!
{88017}{88113}Would you stop that? Those are mine.
{88316}{88401}That's not funny! Stop it!|And give me my things.
{88407}{88481}Come on, boy, pick up.
{88493}{88580}Good. Good.|Perhaps we'll get somewhere.
{88586}{88667}Goddard, you're OK.
{88674}{88787}I miss you, too, boy.|Listen, what's your situation?
{88852}{88891}Evil scientist, huh?
{88897}{89016}OK. I got an idea.|Put me on speaker, Goddard.
{89033}{89168}Danger. Danger. You have initiated|self-destruct sequence alpha.
{89174}{89228}That's my bad. Back in you go.
{89234}{89300}Self-destruct sequence|is now engaged.
{89306}{89376}No, no, no, no, no! I put it back in.|You understand me?
{89382}{89480}This unit will yield a 50-megaton|nuclear blast in exactly ten seconds.
{89486}{89571}- That's not good!|- Please clear a 30-square mile area.
{89577}{89631}Thank you and have a nice day.
{89637}{89703}- Ten, nine, eight...|- No, back up!
{89709}{89768}...seven...|- Mother!
{89774}{89833}Is he gone, boy?
{89839}{89946}Great. Lock on to this signal|and get here as fast as you can.
{90104}{90160}Halt. Who goes there?
{90166}{90191}The guard.
{90197}{90247}By order of the esteemed King Goobot,
{90253}{90345}it is my great privilege and honour|to mercilessly exterminate you.
{90351}{90455}Think. Think. Goddard, play dead.
{90686}{90740}Good boy, Goddard. Good boy.
{90746}{90798}Guess I'll make that bug a feature, huh?
{90804}{90844}- Good dog.|- Way to go!
{90850}{90913}- You're a good robot.|- Come on! Let's get the others.
{90919}{91001}Nice work, Jimmy.
{91033}{91096}Hey, Cindy. Thanks.
{91102}{91264}If you ever tell anyone I was nice to you,|you'll wind up looking like that guy.
{91264}{91360}Let's go, Neutron.|It's egg-scrambling time.
{91366}{91461}- Wait for me, Nick.|- Come back!
{91464}{91535}Please?
{91782}{91874}Bring out the humans.
{92185}{92292}Come on, it's showtime. Everybody out.
{92621}{92707}Kick it!
{93169}{93254}- Look, you guys. A football game.|- I don't think so, Carl.
{93260}{93344}Goddard, bino-scope mode.
{93554}{93603}Wow. What a lame half-time show.
{93609}{93692}They're making our parents|dance so lame.
{93698}{93805}No, my dad really dances like that.
{93856}{93950}- The festival is starting.|- Our parents! They'll be eaten!
{93956}{94033}Nobody eats my parents|unless I say so!
{94039}{94095}Come on.
{94101}{94218}Begin the incubation.
{94309}{94389}Come on, Nick.|Show them what you're made of.
{94395}{94432}Halt.
{94438}{94493}Hey, cool spear.
{94499}{94549}You really think so?|I guess so because...
{94555}{94646}Mind if I try?
{94656}{94697}No, no, no!
{94703}{94781}My hero.
{94787}{94890}- Come on, everyone.|- Get 'em, Nick. Come on!
{95334}{95373}My hero?
{95379}{95434}OK, we need another plan.
{95440}{95530}Probably a Nick-less one.
{95659}{95736}Poultra! Poultra!
{95742}{95817}Poultra! Poultra!
{95823}{95921}Citizens of Yokus,|I, King Goobot the Fifth,
{95927}{96039}give you sacrifice.
{96192}{96289}That's a big chicken.
{96464}{96548}What do we do now?
{96858}{96942}Think. Think.
{97084}{97119}Brain blast!
{97125}{97187}OK, everybody, listen up.|We don't have much time.
{97193}{97243}I've got to make it to that control tower.
{97249}{97340}Cindy, Libby, keep the guards busy|until Sheen arrives with the ship.
{97346}{97422}OK, I heard the ship part,|but was that "Sheen get the ship"?
{97428}{97459}Yeah, yeah.
{97465}{97558}There's a transport ship in that airfield|big enough to carry all of us out.
{97564}{97647}- I need you to get it here fast.|- But I don't have a driver's licence.
{97653}{97728}- I have no hand-eye coordination...|- Sheen, ask yourself,
{97734}{97810}what would Ultra Lord do?
{97837}{97876}I accept this responsibility,
{97882}{97966}understanding the consequences|that you've bestowed against me.
{97972}{98021}Poultra, din-dins.
{98027}{98126}Yummy, yummy. Foodie, woodie.
{98162}{98243}This is it, people. These crummy|aliens stole our parents.
{98249}{98327}It's time to show them what we're|made of. We're tough! We're mean!
{98333}{98384}Darn it, we're carbon-based life forms.
{98390}{98482}- Now, who's gonna kick buttocks?|- The carbon-based life forms!
{98488}{98584}Yeah!
{98644}{98690}What is this?
{98696}{98804}- Stop those kids.|- After 'em.
{98861}{98936}Cindy, Purple Flurp.
{98942}{99032}Dragon whips her tail.
{99244}{99328}Let's dance.
{99482}{99532}Yeah, Jimmy.
{99538}{99600}Come on, boy.
{99606}{99697}- Jimmy!|- Carl, "show and tell".
{99703}{99772}Come here, you.
{99778}{99862}I can't see! I can't see!
{99884}{99988}You want some? You want some?|You want a piece of me?
{99994}{100078}I didn't think so.
{100225}{100297}Munchy-crunchy time.
{100303}{100387}There you go.
{100387}{100462}- Fetch, boy.|- Hey, hey, give me that.
{100468}{100564}- Come back here, you!|- Everybody up.
{100737}{100806}Hey, nice party. Gotta blast.
{100812}{100866}Neutron.
{100872}{100949}OK, let's move out.
{100996}{101104}Guards, vaporise the Earth brats.
{101193}{101277}Hurry, head for the exit.
{101294}{101357}- Hey, where's Sheen?|- I don't know.
{101363}{101440}Stop them!
{101738}{101830}All right, Sheen!
{101834}{101953}Your ship awaits, Captain Jimmy.
{102227}{102302}Ooblar, protect!
{102388}{102423}Pooh.
{102429}{102511}Everybody to the ship!
{102529}{102599}Poultra, quickly.|Your dinner's getting away.
{102605}{102707}- OK, keep up. Let's get out of here.|- Come on!
{102846}{102919}We gotta do this quick.|Launch positions.
{102925}{102981}Temperature optimal.|Engaging plasma coils.
{102987}{103107}- Jim, I think we better leave now.|- Countdown! Ten, nine, eight...
{103113}{103185}One!
{103423}{103546}- To my ships.|- And can someone bring me a bucket?
{103604}{103713}Jimmy, here they come!
{103784}{103855}Time to discipline the naughty children.
{103861}{103926}Open fire.
{104172}{104270}OK, who wants fried chicken?
{104793}{104873}So, Neutron, now it's just you and I.
{104879}{104935}All weapons online.
{104941}{105011}Ultra Lord is not afraid of chickens
{105017}{105101}He is not afraid...
{105135}{105210}He may be a little bit|afraid of chickens
{105216}{105266}This thing's too slow. I can't outrun 'em.
{105272}{105339}- Incoming message.|- On screen.
{105345}{105407}You see, Jimmy, you can't win.
{105413}{105479}All of your friends and family|would be safe at home,
{105485}{105559}if it wasn't for one little problem. You.
{105565}{105676}- Little?|- Now you all must die!
{105682}{105765}Little, huh? I'll show you little.
{105771}{105809}Cindy, take over. Come on, boy.
{105815}{105934}What are you doing?|Is this one of those macho things?
{105940}{106059}I know we haven't field-tested this|feature yet, but we've no choice, buddy.
{106065}{106149}Goddard, flycycle!
{106334}{106441}Would you look at this? I do believe|he's going to ram us, Ooblar.
{106447}{106544}Remind me to clean|the windshield later.
{106608}{106676}You steal my parents,|you threaten my dog...
{106682}{106723}Itsy-bitsy Jimmy Neutron.
{106729}{106793}He does look a bit small and silly,|doesn't he, sire?
{106799}{106876}You attack my friends|and you made fun of my size.
{106882}{106937}- Tiny, tiny.|- So, so tiny.
{106943}{107092}Well, I may be small,|but I've got a big brain.
{107217}{107280}Not tiny!
{107302}{107376}Can't we call this whole thing|a mistake and go back to your plan -
{107382}{107497}rendezvous for universal|brotherhood and whatnot?
{107700}{107766}You've not seen the last of us,
{107772}{107856}Jimmy Neutron!
{107890}{107944}You look marvellous|sunny-side up, sire.
{107950}{108033}That's no yolk.
{108040}{108113}All right, Jimmy! Good job!
{108119}{108268}Orbiting around Jimmy's big head.|Estimated time to ear: Seven minutes.
{108383}{108451}So, I guess I can't|call you short any more.
{108457}{108609}Don't worry. I'm sure there are all kinds|of other insults you can come up with.
{108740}{108811}Let me tell you,|as soon as we get home,
{108817}{108910}we're going out dancing!
{108966}{109004}Ultra Dad!
{109010}{109090}Ultra Son!
{109102}{109137}Dad! Daddy!
{109143}{109192}Hey, Neutron.
{109198}{109254}Nice job.
{109260}{109344}Thanks.
{109351}{109444}I've got that for you, dear.
{109496}{109541}Mom, Dad,
{109547}{109635}I should have listened to you|when you said don't talk to strangers.
{109641}{109752}See, I guess I thought I was smart|enough to do everything on my own -
{109758}{109806}that I didn't need you.
{109812}{109860}But I was wrong.
{109866}{109907}I love you guys.
{109913}{109970}We love you too, Jimmy.
{109976}{110048}Having a genius for a son|may not always be easy,
{110054}{110103}but it's always interesting.
{110109}{110153}You make us so proud.
{110159}{110198}You sure do, son.
{110204}{110283}You know, not every family|gets to ride in an alien spaceship,
{110289}{110385}hurtling through the universe at warp|speeds, millions of miles from home.
{110391}{110525}- We thank you for that.|- You gotta admit, that is pretty neat.
{110649}{110703}There you are, gentlemen.
{110709}{110750}- Freeze!|- It's OK, Carl.
{110756}{110830}- It's just breakfast.|- I knew that.
{110836}{110901}I don't remember|buying this brand of soda.
{110907}{111001}- No, no, Mom... Mom, you...|- Jimmy, it's just soda.
{111007}{111091}Mom, no!
{111093}{111185}Goodness! Excuse me.
{111191}{111242}Boy, it's a scorcher out there.
{111248}{111320}- Thanks, honey.|- Hugh!
{111337}{111424}Well, at least it's coming out|of the attic, not the basement.
{111430}{111466}Hugh!
{111472}{111553}Mom!
{111680}{111780}James Isaac Neutron...
{113300}{113331}Onward, Mr Wiggles.
{113337}{113431}We reach the cafeteria by dawn.
{118309}{118445}Subtitles by Natasha Cohn
{9571}{9648}Work a little more on B and C.
{21273}{21314}Well done, Ash.
{21345}{21393}Still as good as ever.
{21417}{21465}Charge me for|one clip of 7.62mm...
{21465}{21514}...and two clips of PPK.
{21726}{21902}Two or three more 'completes'|and you go to the next level.
{21941}{22056}You'lI have a time handicap.
{22088}{22136}You know that, don't you?
{22136}{22203}I'll take the rest of|my points in cash.
{22256}{22387}Solo gets more dangerous|the further you go.
{22424}{22560}Are you sure you don't want to|join another party?
{25253}{25294}Good game, Ash.
{32996}{33037}Great tactics!
{33069}{33093}Just like Ash!
{33093}{33161}He's faster.
{33189}{33234}And surer.
{33521}{33565}Move!
{34720}{34753}Ash...
{34792}{34861}The circults aren't clear yet.
{34912}{35001}Even you have to wait your turn.
{35042}{35111}I'll cancel, then.
{35178}{35218}Do me a favor.
{35226}{35322}I can't accept requests|from individual players.
{35346}{35418}It wouldn't be fair
{35468}{35514}You know that.
{35532}{35646}I want data on that "Bishop"|who just cleared Class A.
{35664}{35820}You can at least tell me more|than the terminal did.
{35871}{35931}Why are you interested?
{35944}{36009}He's challenging me.
{36096}{36213}But you never make contact|with another player.
{36282}{36363}Isn't that your philosophy?
{36482}{36638}"Avalon..."
{36644}{36818}"...faraway isle of legend..."
{36851}{37013}"...of apple groves..."
{37034}{37223}"...and mist..."
{37546}{37672}"Avalon..."
{37684}{37882}"When will that day come?"
{37894}{38062}"Avalon..."
{38079}{38252}"Isle of faeries..."
{38254}{38520}"...where heroes go..."
{39414}{39560}"Avalon..."
{39562}{39758}"A hero takes his ship..."
{39778}{39934}"...and sets sail..."
{39935}{40250}"...to that isle of legend..."
{40261}{40424}"Avalon..."
{40430}{40654}"To the Nine Sisters..."
{40666}{40828}"...Avalon..."
{40833}{41029}"There together..."
{41052}{41269}"...on that holy isle."
{41493}{41607}"O Arthur..."
{41913}{42051}"...your ship sets sail..."
{42060}{42181}"...over the misty water to Avalon".
{43213}{43247}It's you...
{43306}{43361}You're looking well.
{44607}{44718}I hear all kinds of things.
{44727}{44823}Maybe because I was in Wizard.
{44933}{45019}It's a real drag, you know...
{45059}{45157}I go to different branches,|I hear things...
{45175}{45264}...sometimes things I wish I hadn't.
{45271}{45318}Maybe it's karma.
{45343}{45467}I heard that there where a solo Warrior|that was really good...
{45485}{45545}...and that it was woman, too.
{45554}{45701}So I started wondering,|and what do you know!
{45710}{45742}Did you search?
{45748}{45772}For what?
{45779}{45833}For my branch.
{45844}{45886}Just dumb luck.
{45892}{45967}But if we ever teamed up again...
{45968}{46094}...it'd be like fate was|giving us a second chance.
{46399}{46513}I wish I was a Warrior.|Then I could play solo.
{46563}{46650}But who ever heard of...
{46707}{46753}...a solo Thief?
{46789}{46869}We scout, we spring traps...
{46875}{46948}We're like river pilots...
{47021}{47060}..or guides.
{47070}{47203}Any party would be happy|to have you, Stunner.
{47238}{47340}It's been a while since anyone called me that.
{47451}{47588}All of us old Wizard members|are still angry at each other.
{47594}{47645}All the other players...
{47666}{47711}...resent us, too.
{47732}{47810}People said Wizard|was the toughest party of all.
{47810}{47877}But instead of that making|my career...
{47906}{47952}...it's a handicap.
{47956}{47996}Wizard was...
{48004}{48051}I don't want to hear.
{48124}{48162}I guess not.
{48172}{48221}That was then.
{48244}{48351}I don't have time|to rehash the old days.
{48649}{48673}Ash...
{48673}{48720}I don't need thanks.
{48721}{48771}That's not it.
{48793}{48868}What about Murphy?
{49036}{49148}Maybe you haven't heard...
{49204}{49261}Look, if you don't want this...
{49560}{49635}He went solo, too.
{49698}{49767}He got lost.
{51316}{51400}You must have heard about it...
{51455}{51548}A hidden character in Class A?
{51598}{51725}A weird 'neutral character'|who appears when you're in there.
{51734}{51839}A silent young girl with sad eyes.
{51960}{52121}Some people say she's just|a bug in the program.
{52133}{52210}She's called "the ghost".
{52495}{52564}Whatever she is...
{52581}{52732}...no one who goes after her|ever comes back.
{52748}{52897}So you'd think no one|would go after her, wouldn't you.
{52951}{53056}Even if you don't care about|sharing data...
{53087}{53192}...I'm sure at least|you've heard the stories...
{53222}{53340}...about a phantom field|called "Special A"...
{53351}{53502}...where you can't reset to escape.
{53516}{53750}A dangerous field, but you get|tons of experience points.
{54174}{54336}They say the ghost is|the only gate into that field.
{54390}{54441}So they go after her.
{54461}{54584}Anyone who wants to|get into Special A...
{54610}{54696}...chases the ghost.
{54787}{54841}Just like Murphy did.
{57043}{57080}Stunner!
{57102}{57192}Go around to the right|and draw them off!
{57235}{57319}Copper! Cuisinart! Masher! Concentrate your fire!
{57336}{57458}Murphy! We're running|low on ammo! Let's pull back!
{57473}{57519}Stunner, you idiot!
{57529}{57561}Stop bitching!
{57568}{57674}"Reset" is not part|of the Wizard strategy!
{57688}{57709}Ash!
{57715}{57743}Ash!
{64598}{64812}Here Arthur lies,|King once and King to be.
{65099}{65167}My ID data?!
{66463}{66503}Come on...
{66513}{66651}Come on, come on, come on!
{66762}{66815}Come on!
{67667}{67771}Class A's busy today.
{67805}{67852}Watch for time-lags.
{67853}{67918}Have you heard of|'the Nine Sisters'?
{67927}{67974}Morgan Le Fay?
{68024}{68064}Morgan Le Fay?
{68072}{68102}Yes.
{68120}{68284}One of the nine fairy queens|who rule Avalon...
{68311}{68368}...the legendary isle.
{68429}{68545}They lay the dying King Arthur...
{68548}{68692}...on a black ship and take him|over the water to Avalon.
{68745}{68822}The fairy Morgan Le Fay...
{68853}{68916}The Queen North Galys...
{68981}{69048}...The Queen of the Waste Lands...
{69078}{69125}...and...
{69174}{69272}...his protectress,|the Lady of the Lake.
{69294}{69390}There's a story like that|in northern Europe.
{69412}{69491}Odin goes on a journey.
{69507}{69649}His ship is wrecked and he drifts|to an island far across the water...
{69693}{69759}There Morgan rescues him...
{69782}{69839}...gives him a gold ring...
{69848}{69930}...and grants him immortality|and eternal youth.
{69949}{70030}But Odin doesn't realize that Morgan...
{70061}{70151}...has set a crown upon his head.
{70214}{70290}"The Crown of Oblivion"...
{70301}{70396}He forgets all about his homeland...
{70449}{70534}...and all about the world outside.
{70763}{70817}Begin.
{72342}{72410}Hold it! Don't shoot!
{72555}{72608}I'm Jill, of "The Nine Sisters".
{72611}{72718}It's a pleasure to meet|the famous "Ash".
{73463}{73509}Welcome, Ash.
{73610}{73691}Thanks for accessing.
{73703}{73747}What do you want?
{73775}{73855}I don't expect data for free.
{73871}{73922}You don't waste time.
{73997}{74088}Maybe we'll take your gear, then.
{74307}{74439}Lots of people would pay cash|for your equipment data.
{74446}{74543}Selling that data's against the rules.
{74565}{74672}There are lots of ways|to make a living in Avalon.
{74805}{74859}Tell me about "Special A".
{74859}{74898}You mean it?
{74927}{74990}All I know is what I've heard.
{75003}{75149}Only the real|Nine Sisters would know.
{75168}{75238}If not them...
{75270}{75352}Who are the real 'Nine Sisters'?
{75360}{75473}They're the ones|who programmed this game.
{75478}{75518}Murphy!
{75572}{75614}Those bastards!
{75620}{75658}A time-lag!
{77133}{77201}Sorry I messed up the room.
{77223}{77264}Don't worry.
{77304}{77385}Everyone has days like that.
{87793}{87886}"From Scythia to Camelot,|C. Scott Littleton and Linda A. Malcor"
{87948}{88049}"The Legend of King Arthur,|Richard Cavendish"
{88115}{88206}"The Chronicles of King Arthur,|Andrea Hopkins"
{88289}{88385}"A Kaleidoscope of Arthurian Legend,|Toshiyuki Takamiya"
{88620}{88665}Ash...
{88710}{88758}...you look a bit pale.
{88788}{88841}Feeling the effects of reset?
{88848}{88886}Don't get mad.
{88928}{89074}Look, about the gate|that lets you into Special A...
{89079}{89176}You want to know how|you meet the ghost?
{89401}{89460}Have you had breakfast?
{89547}{89608}You should eat sometimes.
{89983}{90029}I heard this from...
{90040}{90127}...a party that lost a few people.
{90142}{90259}They say that every time|the ghost appears...
{90271}{90447}...there's always a Bishop there. It's the one|common link.
{90460}{90496}A Bishop?
{90532}{90676}A Bishop's there every time|a party sees the ghost.
{90718}{90800}As long as you have a Bishop,|you see the ghost?
{90814}{90858}Not only that.
{90859}{91010}Some fools set themselves up|with any old Bishop...
{91027}{91066}...and go "ghost hunting".
{91072}{91147}That's not how you do it.
{91180}{91223}What level?
{91237}{91277}Good question.
{91379}{91483}He has to be Class A-complete.
{91491}{91605}An Archbishop, above Level 12.
{91611}{91695}That's the condition. No mistake.
{93010}{93039}So?
{93052}{93171}Are you going to switch|from "Warrior"...
{93196}{93279}...to "Bishop"?
{93295}{93349}Alone?
{93379}{93442}Murphy was solo.
{93463}{93531}A Level-12 Bishop...
{93535}{93574}Hey...
{93607}{93676}...what level are you? 12? 13?
{93706}{93782}But to switch to 'Bishop'...
{93805}{93904}...you need double|the experience points.
{93957}{94023}Look at Murphy.
{94030}{94128}You know how long it took him.
{94156}{94238}It takes time and money...
{94288}{94374}...to make Bishop.
{94393}{94497}You can't do it without|a party to back you up.
{94512}{94556}I couldn't do it.
{94602}{94667}You could with a party.
{94752}{94863}But with your record,|who's going to link up with you?
{94922}{94947}And...
{94947}{95069}...very, very few people|make Archbishop.
{95208}{95250}No, Ash...
{95306}{95396}...you probably couldn't do it.
{95501}{95580}Maybe if Murphy were here...
{95785}{95819}Thanks.
{95934}{95963}Be seeing you.
{99652}{99699}How did you find me?
{99721}{99828}Seek and ye shall find.
{99946}{100083}Anyway, I think it's me|that you need.
{101318}{101368}Real meat...
{101400}{101463}...real vegetables...
{101495}{101532}...rice...
{101782}{101848}Your dog is a lucky one.
{101885}{101964}He eats better than people do.
{102025}{102066}Real alcohol...
{102103}{102145}...cigarettes...
{102282}{102365}...wisdom you can't get|from a terminal.
{102989}{103044}All the fruits of Avalon...
{103086}{103173}...the privilege of a solo player.
{103203}{103314}But for the best players,|the game becomes its own reward.
{103337}{103389}I've checked you out.
{103410}{103448}Stunner?
{103649}{103763}The ability to analyze data...
{103772}{103879}...is one of a Bishop's|most important skills.
{103912}{103984}You were a Warrior in Wizard.
{104009}{104241}When it dissolved,|many people speculated as to why.
{104258}{104354}The details remain a mystery...
{104387}{104487}...but there are those who say...
{104509}{104641}...a certain Warrior ignored|her orders...
{104683}{104801}...and called 'reset'.
{105514}{105589}Ash! Can you hear me?
{105604}{105667}Shoot at the cockpit!
{105693}{105831}What's wrong? Ash, answer me!
{106355}{106408}Someone gets soared...
{106410}{106519}...the party loses its point person and gets|wiped out.
{106535}{106592}Happens all the time.
{106640}{106698}The only strange thing...
{106712}{106807}...was that it happened to|the invincible Wizard.
{106876}{106935}I want to form a party with you.
{106940}{107000}The standard six members.
{107084}{107174}Three Warriors, a good Thief...
{107180}{107245}...and a Mage, if possible.
{107258}{107287}Is that all?
{107300}{107371}You're not going to ask about me?
{107408}{107450}Would you tell me?
{107464}{107539}Inside Avalon I will.
{107569}{107636}Be in Flak Tower 22...
{107644}{107722}...tomorrow at midnight.
{108968}{109018}I'd like to close.
{109070}{109272}I'm meeting someone at midnight|who can take me to Class Special A.
{109419}{109575}There's no such thing, you know.|Not inside Avalon.
{109655}{109772}No matter how real it seems,|Avalon is just a game.
{109784}{109843}But a program you can't clear...
{109868}{109955}...isn't a game any more.
{109982}{110062}That's why it's hidden away...
{110075}{110155}...a forbidden field.
{110171}{110209}Who are you?
{110272}{110363}Bishop scouted me, too.
{110408}{110585}As a terminal manager,|not as a player.
{110599}{110642}Who is 'Bishop'?
{110665}{110789}It's no use trying to track him down.|He doesn't access from a branch.
{110803}{110954}He has his own terminal.|He just shows up in the game.
{110998}{111043}Can you do that?
{111070}{111112}Sure you can.
{111136}{111270}With enough money and equipment,|it's no problem.
{111303}{111347}Take my advice, Ash.
{111370}{111451}Keep away from him.
{111501}{111542}I can't.
{111549}{111590}Why not?
{111689}{111756}Murphy is in Special A.
{111773}{111830}So that's it...
{112658}{112785}Take Room 9.|The Game Master's waiting.
{112814}{112857}Thanks.
{113713}{113780}I've input your coordinates.
{113806}{113917}I'd prefer you didn't go|to Special A, though...
{113946}{113979}I'm sorry.
{114039}{114107}A good game master...
{114126}{114186}...does not intervene.
{114243}{114323}Let me ask you something...
{114354}{114486}Are you accessing|from a terminal somewhere...
{114510}{114613}...or are you part of|the system itself?
{114683}{114818}What does it matter?|You couldn't confirm that anyway.
{114920}{114953}All right.
{114995}{115024}Begin.
{118154}{118207}Thanks for your help.
{118241}{118353}Don't thank me.|This team was necessary.
{118371}{118438}Did you find out about me?
{118475}{118571}You're one of the Nine Sisters,|rulers of Avalon...
{118598}{118686}...designers of the program.
{118718}{118758}I'm a Bishop.
{118775}{118836}A successor to the Apostles.
{118864}{118958}I'm not responsible for its creation.
{118972}{119123}But you're not a player.|You're on their side.
{119131}{119193}Would you like to be?
{119328}{119405}I don't trust myself enough to join them.
{119442}{119528}There's no need to join their party.
{119541}{119671}They're just ciphers.|Nothing but a mass of data.
{119688}{119712}Ash...
{119730}{119830}You know which is the better game:
{119864}{120004}The one you think you can clear,|but can't...
{120012}{120183}...or one that looks impossible|but isn't.
{120219}{120308}Finding that subtle balance...
{120324}{120457}...and maintaining it|up through all the levels...
{120494}{120557}...is our side's job.
{120608}{120638}Right.
{120656}{120712}It looks like we're all here.
{120716}{120764}Let's move out.
{120938}{121052}Nice to be working with you again.
{121853}{121903}No response from up ahead.
{121917}{121967}I don't like it...
{122001}{122052}Ash  ...go up top.
{122094}{122175}Makanito, Zilwan, Badi... forward.
{122925}{122956}Shit!
{122982}{123054}Shit! It's a bloody citadel!
{123075}{123146}Of all the goddamn luck!
{123162}{123194}Settle down.
{123213}{123337}It's a Class A-strength opponent, but it has a|weak point.
{123354}{123479}The cannons will get us|if we attack head-on...
{123497}{123521}Ash...
{123536}{123603}...we'll get out in front and stop it.
{123608}{123720}You get behind it|and aim at the grill.
{126740}{126849}Damn it, Bishop! Are you trying|to wipe out your front line?!
{126859}{126964}They're just dummies|created by the program!
{126977}{127030}Forget them!
{127153}{127233}Move! Don't wait around!
{128892}{128945}Where are you, ghost?
{129988}{130040}Stunner!
{130129}{130179}I screwed up again...
{130207}{130304}And this chance never comes twice...|I'm just not very lucky.
{130309}{130343}"Again"?
{130361}{130400}You saw her.
{130435}{130468}The ghost...
{130518}{130642}Your chance comes when|she leaves the wall.
{130650}{130690}Get the ghost...
{130696}{130881}...and you open the gate|to Special A.
{130914}{130969}Say hello to Murphy for me.
{130995}{131159}It wasn't your fault|that Wizard got wiped out.
{131196}{131367}The one who ran...was me.
{131409}{131557}I wanted to tell Murphy that.
{132002}{132026}Ash!
{132038}{132070}Hurry.
{132090}{132172}The ghost won't wait for you.
{140603}{140744}Just as I thought...|you're the only one who got through the gate.
{140755}{140799}Is this "Special A"?
{140856}{140907}We call it "Class Real".
{140935}{141078}Building it has taken huge amounts of very|sophisticated data.
{141097}{141236}In many ways, it's still|very experimental.
{141265}{141306}"In many ways"?
{141320}{141439}There's just one thing|you have to do to complete it.
{141451}{141543}Finish off the Unreturned.
{141562}{141688}Your equipment and skill|parameters are...
{141700}{141759}...returned to default.
{141775}{141850}All you have is a pistol...
{141874}{141942}...and one clip of ammunition.
{141970}{142069}There are neutral characters,|operating under free will.
{142086}{142206}Hurt one of them|and your game is over.
{142224}{142272}There's no time limit.
{142305}{142445}The only exit from the game|is completion.
{142470}{142540}If you get back safely...
{142575}{142632}...you can be one of us.
{142659}{142703}Any questions?
{142752}{142810}Why did you send me here?
{142835}{142965}Surely the answer to that|lies within you.
{143147}{143240}If there are no questions,|we'll begin.
{143261}{143312}Look behind you.
{144922}{144990}He'll be there.
{145029}{145125}Fight well, Ash.
{161485}{161783}"Avalon, faraway isle of legend..."
{161795}{162257}"...of apple groves and mist..."
{162428}{162740}"Avalon, when will that day come?"
{162782}{163312}"Isle of faeries, where heroes go..."
{163685}{163732}Why did you come?
{163795}{163845}Because of me?
{163897}{164011}Isn't that a good reason?
{164146}{164231}You know why Wizard broke up.
{164260}{164362}I thought I did.|That's why I kept my mouth shut.
{164379}{164454}I let them think I called "reset".
{164508}{164567}So why did you come here?!
{164604}{164670}Stunner told me you were lost.
{164676}{164770}Back there, you were just|another "Unreturned".
{164785}{164844}You wanted to go all the way.
{164859}{164957}We were too complacent.|We were in your way.
{164985}{165055}None of us wanted to break up|the party.
{165060}{165188}We were invincible.|Everyone else envied us.
{165210}{165270}All the more reason...
{165285}{165387}...you needed a pretext|to dissolve it.
{165533}{165579}But is this what you wanted?
{165653}{165701}Did you abandon us...
{165773}{165913}...to spend your life as a vegetable in a|hospital bed?
{166506}{166666}Do I look like a vegetable to you?|Remember, this is "Class Real".
{166851}{166964}Reality is nothing but|an obsession that takes hold of us!
{167046}{167196}Why shouldn't I make this|into my reality?
{167217}{167386}You tell yourseIf that,|but all you're doing is running away.
{167388}{167449}I don't want to argue!
{167541}{167712}Have you noticed|what color your hair is?
{167795}{167909}Where's that beautiful silver streak...
{167925}{167994}...that makes them call you 'Ash'?
{168386}{168464}Have you ever been shot?
{168596}{168756}Do you want to feel|real pain in a real body?
{168847}{168908}Does it have to be this way?
{168923}{168980}When one of us dies...
{169010}{169100}...and that body doesn't vanish...
{169196}{169252}...the other one will know.
{169784}{169888}"...so many of the brave are|cut down..."
{169890}{169990}"...and heroes lay fallen."
{170016}{170219}"As bright, shining death approaches..."
{170226}{170437}"...the spectres appear..."
{170439}{170640}"...and shroud them in darkness..."

{172467}{172573}Don't let appearances confuse you.

Hey, Milly!
Get below! Tell the others we can't hold these things any longer!
- Go, go, go!
- Roger!
- The energy tube is unstable!
- Damn!
It's got a limited number of charges.
Take it!
Go! The future is in your hands!
October 19, 2002
Your shipment has arrived.
Keep quiet! Shut up!
Be quiet!
Mr. Mizoguchi.
Close it, quick.
Please be reasonable.
What? It shut them up.
They were hard to find.
I'll get the helicopter.
Your stuff's no good anyway.
This was your last chance.
Please...
Jesus!
Let's get out of here.
No way!
Go, go!
After him!
Come on!
Get him!
He went up!
Freeze. Don't move!
Don't kill him!
Find out who he is.
Don't push your luck.
- Don't kill me!
- Tell your boss he's through.
Never do business here again.
This turf belongs to someone else.
I made it.
Drop the gun.
Pretty good work.
Who the hell are you?
Mizoguchi...
I'm impressed.
Just calm down.
We meet at last.
Who are you?
A kid?
What?
Who was it, Miyamoto?
Mizoguchi!
The guy who killed Xi-Huan.
Get any information on him.
I can't believe you let him go.
I didn't!
This weird kid turned up, and as I shot her...
...he slipped away.
Get to work. I'm heading there now.
Damn.
- Find anything?
- Money first. Money.
And calm down.
How can I? I found him at last.
Forget my share.
Tell me what you know.
Take a look.
That's him.
The man I swore to kill.
But he's with the strongest Triad.
So what?
- Where is he? I'll kill him.
- My dear boy...
Just tell me!
All right, I promise.
But don't do anything stupid.
Don't rush out and get killed, okay?
Just relax.
October 20, 2002
Energy reserve is low. 
How do you feel?
Where am I?
You speak Japanese?
You're not one of those kids?
Where did I hit you?
I see. That was lucky.
Where's Mount lbusuki?
- What's the date today?
- It's October 20th.
Only two more days.
I'm Milly. I'm on an important mission.
I need your help.
Looks like you've recovered.
I need information, weapons and your help.
Listen. Young lady, I'm busy.
See you.
Listen, something terrible is about to happen.
Let me in.
Don't say I didn't warn you!
We're all doomed.
It's the end of civilization!
Get lost.
Don't you get tired of pasta?
Don't shoot.
Why did you come back?
Look at your neck.
I asked you a question!
Don't!
Sorry, I had no choice.
I put a bomb on you.
If you remove it, you die.
- Scary.
- Don't.
You want proof...
Yours is on one.
This is set on two.
You want to listen to me or die?
Take it off or I'll kill you.
Not a chance.
It monitors my vital signs.
If I die, bang!
Off with your head.
Don't snatch.
If the signal fades, bang. It explodes.
Who are you?
I can't tell you.
For chrissakes!
What's up? I didn't call for you.
Any info about Mizoguchi?
You came just for that?
- I need a car and some guns.
- What for?
A job for her.
- You're teaming up with that kid?
- You called me "kid"?
Not "teaming up." She's a client.
Come on back.
Please hurry, there's no time.
I can't believe she's ordering you about.
- She's not just a kid.
- Quit calling me a kid.
It's an antique, but it'll have to do.
- It's the latest model.
- Sure it is.
- What else was there?
- Mount lbusuki.
Do you know where that is?
This is off-limits. Please go back.
- Something happened?
- We found an unexploded bomb.
Unexploded bomb?
What's this bomb got to do with you?
What's going on?
Too late.
What is that?
Hey!
Why don't you tell me?
The National Institute of Space Science
Mizoguchi.
Yes.
You understand why...
...I keep you here in Japan?
What about that bastard last night?
Hey, Karasawa.
We're still looking for him.
Looking for him?
That's a pathetic answer!
Mizoguchi.
The same goes for you.
You see one rat, turn tail and run?
You haven't grown up since
I took you out of the gutter.
Huh, Mizoguchi?
Anyway...
...I didn't come to Japan...
...to check up on you.
I got some interesting information.
If you want to make up for last night...
...go and check this out.
Certainly.
Hey, dumb kid.
I just want to finish this dumb job, okay?
It's Milly.
My name's Milly, not dumb kid.
If I don't know what we're after,
I can't help you.
Tell me, for chrissake.
You won't believe me.
That's up to me.
- I'm looking for the Daggra.
- Daggra?
It means "enemy" in Tibetan.
What the hell's that?
An extraterrestrial.
The first one arrived back there.
Faked a crash-landing.
I came back in time to kill it...
...from the future.
2084 A.D. Tibet
82 years from now, where I'm from... 
... we're being invaded by them. 
The survivors are holed up in Tibet... 
... where we resist to the very end. 
Our heaviest flyboy is useless!
Hey, Milly!
Get below! Tell the others we can't hold these things any longer!
- Go, go, go!
- Roger!
Well, how bad is it?
They're repelling our most powerful weapons.
Meaning they got a new force field?
Shit!
We've no choice.
We need more power!
- Set the countdown to three minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Start the machine.
- Roger that!
- Commander!
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare for battle.
- Man your fighting positions!
- Eric, commence Stage E now!
- Roger!
It they destroy it...
...everything we've done is for nothing.
We're out of options.
Someone's got to go.
Only the time shifter can change our history.
Charging backup systems.
Roger! Charging energy fields.
- Author power.
- Yes.
- Get a squad up. Cover the entrance!
- Yes, sir!
People, we got one minute.
One minute to bring it up to full power!
Commence Stage D.
Activating the energy tube!
Professor!
They're here.
Open fire!
We got back our team.
- The energy tube is unstable!
- Damn!
We're out of time!
I need a volunteer!
I'll do it!
Hey!
It's a remover.
Quick-charge and release!
It will increase your speed twenty-fold!
You got a limited number of charges.
Take it!
Go! The future is in your hands!
I won't let you down!
Steve, get him!
Go.
The first one...
I'm here...
...to prevent that war.
If that one alien is the cause of it...
...I can stop it by killing him.
I bet you think I'm crazy.
I knew something was up, but...
You believe me?
In my job, you learn to find truth looking into people's eyes.
Your eyes say you're telling the truth.
I know now and I'm sorry.
Let me help your mission.
Really?
Sure. Together, we'll kill that Daggra.
So you should trust me too.
Get rid of this thing on my neck.
Daggra?
Back in time to kill an alien?
Did you make up that crap?
You can count me out.
- I thought you believed me.
- Not a single word. Idiot.
Don't be upset.
Show me some proof.
There's the proof.
Hello, it's me.
Anything on Mizoguchi?
I see.
No, it's fine.
One more thing.
Something else I need to know.
If there's any news in the aerospace industry...
...especially this week, tell me.
Keep an eye on it.
Thanks a lot.
- Let's go.
- It's late.
Let's wait until tomorrow.
There's no time.
What are you doing?
Wash your hands and sit.
- What's that?
- Eat.
Why the tears?
It's good.
I said it's good, jerk.
It's pretty tasty.
That's al dente. 
- AI dente?
- It's tricky to get right.
The National Institute of Space Science
Are you the one that called us?
Yes.
That old bastard has spies everywhere.
Even in a place like this.
This way.
Now you believe me?
Guess I have to.
But is it worth anything?
I guarantee it.
It's packed with incredible technology.
The old man sure knows his stuff.
Right.
There's something else.
Something even better.
Proceed, Dr. Yagi. 
What the hell?
You came to invade us?
Little monster.
Look, it's crying.
Yes?
What?
It just started to move!
Put that fire out!
Contact the assault team.
We'll come back for this.
Watch out.
What do you see?
What's out there?
Idiot. It's obvious.
What I've always wanted.
That thing is real power.
What are you doing?
You scared me.
What are you doing with my coat?
It fell so I picked it up.
- Fell?
- That's right.
Whatever.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Give me a break.
October 21, 2002
Why didn't you wake me?
You got up. Messed with my coat.
What?
Man Found Shot on Street
Many strange events
reported worldwide. 
Please take a look at this: 
On Wall Street, concerns of an...
Give me back the gate. 
The newscaster suddenly said: 
"Give me back the gate. "
The same phenomenon
also occurred during... 
Any information?
Step aside.
Take a look at this.
A composite? It's well done.
- You think it's a warning?
- From the Triads?
Not their style.
They'd just shoot you dead.
- Any news?
- Some good stuff.
- What?
- First things first. Pay your dues.
Didn't your parents teach you that?
So?
- A bizarre explosion last night.
- Where?
The National Institute of Space Science.
A research center north of here.
They turned away the fire department.
Not a big deal by itself, but...
Simultaneously, another explosion here.
Six miles away, a mountain blew up.
It sounds fishy, right?
I hired a guy to find out more...
...and he sent me this picture.
That tree is here.
Something went like this.
Here's a plan of the institute.
That's where it is. Let's go.
Come on!
Sure, but not dressed like that.
Look at this.
Take anything you like.
Anything?
Don't get carried away. It's disguise.
Fantastic!
I even got a facial!
I'll go get changed.
Do I look weird?
Not at all.
It's so short. My legs feel cold.
You love it.
No, I don't.
Okay, he'll do.
They're my guests.
- It's that way.
- Sorry, mister.
I knew it'd be here.
Hold on!
- Is that the spaceship?
- Right.
So that stuff about the alien...
Now you believe me?
Hang on.
You're really from the future?
What's that?
They found us. We'd better move.
I've got to be strong.
I must kill it.
What now?
Is this it?
What do we do?
Here goes.
Quick!
Don't just stand there!
This isn't it.
This creature...
...isn't Daggra.
What?
Something's wrong. This can't be it!
Isn't this what you're here for?
I don't know.
The others looked different.
What do we do?
Quick, before we get caught.
What's wrong?
I want... to go home.
What?
Not me. It was him.
Is he contacting outer space?
What the hell was that?
He's dying.
Mizoguchi.
I should've guessed.
That punk from the other night?
Shut up. You're a dead man.
What have you got against me?
Remember a day in February,
15 years ago?
No, I don't.
You kidnapped my friend.
You were one of those kids?
- Escape with that thing.
- Who's that?
- Forget it. Use that watch thing.
- This?
- Of course!
- I've only got one.
I'll be okay. Wait in the car.
Attack.
I said attack!
Who the hell is he?
Take that.
Flatten the whole place.
- All of it?
- All of it!
- We're clear. Detonate.
- Roger. 
Head downtown.
That old lady must know him.
If she plays dumb, hurt her.
Yes, sir.
We hand it over tonight.
The boss himself is coming.
Unstable chemicals are thought
to have caused the blast. 
Many bodies are charred
beyond recognition. 
- Are you all right?
- What happened?
He let me escape, then it blew up.
I just saw on TV...
Stay there, buddy!
Miyamoto.
- You did this?
- I've been in combat.
So it was all true.
Just tell me what you're up to.
Now I know how you feel.
It must've been hard to talk about.
I see.
But it's not easy to swallow.
What was that creature, then?
I don't know.
Maybe I should've killed him.
Did I mess up?
What did he make you say?
"I want to go home."
That's it.
Wait a minute.
I heard something similar.
Was it on the news?
Yes, that's right.
Newscasters everywhere, speaking odd.
Now you too.
What did they say?
I'm trying to remember...
- "Give me back the gate"?
- "Give me back the gate."
The mother ship's come back, right?
Demanding his return.
The little one wants to go home.
Just like a lost kid.
They didn't let him, so his people got mad.
Could it be right?
We heard that the little one summoned the mother ship...
...to invade Earth.
It's a good cover-up.
Humans are good at lying.
Especially guilty ones.
They'd soon shift the blame to the alien.
The war was caused by...
...us humans.
If that's the case...
...you two are in deep trouble.
It's Mizoguchi.
- He's trying to kidnap it.
- What?
It makes perfect sense.
He's a dead man.
What do you mean?
Mizoguchi kills the Daggra and starts a war.
It's okay.
We've got until tomorrow, right?
- Find out where he's going.
- It'll cost you.
Whatever you want.
They're here. Go out the back.
Take the bike.
I'll see you later.
You believed me?
In my job, I only trust people's eyes.
Get going.
She's late.
What's that?
It was my brother's.
Are you regretting this?
It's not like I had any choice.
I grew up on the streets of the Mainland.
- On the street?
- Right.
Nowhere else to go.
I had a best friend named Xi-Huan.
We grew up together.
Causing mischief, thieving, fighting...
One day, I came back to find...
...all my friends rounded up.
I was too scared to help.
It was Mizoguchi.
He gutted them, sold their organs.
Xi-Huan was one of them.
I've been after Mizoguchi ever since.
Killing him is all I care about.
Now I guess we're in the same boat.
I'm hungry.
Let's eat al dente. 
That's the method.
You mean spaghetti.
How come it didn't explode?
Oh, that...
A free sample from a drugstore.
Magnetic therapy.
Magnetic therapy?
Dumb kid! How dare you?
How did you smash the bottle?
Oh, that...
Watch my gun.
No way.
You're late.
Not even a thank you?
I've been hard at work.
They're meeting on an oil rig...
...some time before sunrise.
Which is 5:42 a.m.
Here's some gear.
Enough?
Why so generous all of a sudden?
Strike while the iron's hot.
- I see.
- Get going. They're behind me.
In front of my store too.
- Can we make it?
- Don't worry.
I left a gift in their car.
You'll be fine.
Come see me when it's over.
Thank you.
Bitch!
Behind us!
I thought she took care of them!
Hold on tight!
What did you do?
Nothing.
Can I really alter the future?
It's a bit late to worry about that.
But what if we die?
Don't worry.
We'll get Mizoguchi first.
And get Daggra home to his friends.
There's plenty of time before sunrise.
You're right.
We'll be fine.
But if we succeed, then what?
What do you mean?
If we prevent the war...
...will I be sent back to the future?
I guess so.
I see.
I'm the one to feel sorry for.
I work my butt off for no money...
...and if it goes well, my client disappears.
- You don't know that.
- You will, I know.
Don't say that.
I'll come rescue you some day.
- I'll return the favor.
- Promises, promises.
I look forward to it.
I'll return. I promise.
October 22, 2002
What's wrong?
Why are you like this?
What's this worth to you?
Are you in your right mind?
I didn't come here to negotiate.
And when you address me...
...you will speak Chinese.
I have a proposition, old man.
In return for what you want...
...how about I get control of Japan?
I don't understand.
This isn't like you.
Acting all tough.
I'll be nice...
...and pretend I didn't hear.
Okay, I'll keep it for myself.
I see.
That's a pity.
What's the meaning of this?
You think you can get away with it?
My people from China will come for you.
I've already considered that...
...and I feel untouchable right now.
I wanted to tell you how I hated...
...speaking Chinese.
Only two hours till sunrise.
Intruders.
What?
Who's that kid?
Two bogies heading to you.
Lead them to Bay 6.
Where's the cargo bay?
Down the hall on the right.
Welcome.
I've got a question.
On my signal, run.
Why do you want that creature?
Or do you know something I don't?
Check this out.
Now!
- Go, I'll cover you.
- Got it.
Where are you, Milly?
Damn.
Your best friend...
...fetched a good price.
Thanks to you.
Go.
Mr. Mizoguchi.
What do we do next?
Hey, street kid.
Come on out.
Let's talk.
I said come out, didn't I?
Next time, in her head.
Five, four...
Miyamoto!
The rest is up to you, buddy!
Three...
Stay there, buddy!
...two...
...one...
- Milly, duck!
Miyamoto!
Miyamoto...
What is it?
What's wrong?
It's no good.
It's weaker by the minute.
Not long left.
Did you get it to talk?
That's what you're here for.
Hey, ugly.
How do your weapons work?
Say something.
That's not going to help.
Please be quiet.
Any changes on the spaceship?
If we can't use the weapons it's just junk.
It's over.
If he dies, it's all over.
Who are you, anyway?
How come you know about this?
Tell me everything.
He's going to die.
Then the war begins.
War?
He's got to return to the mountain.
Back to his own kind.
War, huh?
Sounds like fun...
...and profit.
But I'll save him.
All by yourself?
You really messed up.
Now he knows where to find this.
What do you mean?
You misjudged my buddy.
Who's she calling buddy?
What's going on?
I can see the bullets.
Let's take the chopper.
With the pilot.
Stay where you are.
A slow death for you.
Move.
Keep moving.
Milly!
- Where are you?
- No idea.
Head upstairs. 
The heliport's on the roof. 
Okay.
- Got it?
- There's no exit. 
Keep looking.
Sunrise.
Damn.
He's going to die.
It's no use.
We'll never make it.
I knew I'd never change the future.
Dumb kid! It's no time to cry.
It's my fault. I'm useless.
What was the point, Miyamoto?
I wanted to help you.
Listen, you dumb kid.
You were amazing.
Getting this far all by yourself.
You can make it. I know.
Don't give up yet!
I'm with you.
Damn.
- Milly!
- Miyamoto!
We can make it by chopper.
So close, yet so far.
I hope it's well-built.
What are you mumbling?
Who are you calling now?
The cavalry.
That hurt.
Don't move!
You messed up everything.
But now you die.
Goodbye, sewer kid!
What was that?
Daggra, I guess.
A disguised spaceship?
It's over.
I guess so.
No war then, I hope.
I'm sure.
I wonder if Xi-Huan's forgiven me.
He's grateful.
What do I do now?
Need an assistant?
I'm smart and useful.
- I can even learn to cook.
- I'm starving.
- Let's eat al dente. 
- I told you that's not...
You said that on purpose, right?
Dumb kid.
- Miyamoto.
- What now?
What's wrong?
I guess I'm going back.
You're kidding. Don't go yet.
You're leaving already?
I'm sorry.
- It sucks.
- You're sorry?
You really have to go?
Miyamoto.
Thank you. 
Wait a second...
You've really gone?
We're not eating al dente?
I don't have work for you.
I wanted to talk.
After all I taught you...
I'm sorry.
Without a gun, who are you?
What will you do?
I've got to look for something new.
Watch out.
You made a lot of enemies.
I know.
Thanks for everything.
I wonder if she got back okay.
I paid you back. Milly.
I'll come rescue you some day. 
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- I'll return the favor. 
- Promises, promises. 
I look forward to it. 
I'll return. I promise. 
So you did return.
Good luck.
The mission is completed.
I established contact with target and was not compromised.
There was no effect on the space-time continuum.
I'm on my return.
Dumb kid.
The Empire of lzmer has long been a divided land.
Ruled by the Mages, an elite group of magic users.
The lowly Commoners, those without magic... are little more than slaves.
Izmer's young Empress Savina... wishes equality and prosperity for all.
But the evil Mage Profion has other intentions.
At last!
Come, Damodar.
Release him.
You are mine now.
Come to me!
Yes, I told you it could be done.
You have the power of the lmmortals.
You can control Dragons.
With a Dragon army at my command...
I can crush the Empress... and control what is rightfully mine!
You don't like that, do you?
Good!
I can use every ounce of your rage!
Come on.
Follow me.
Follow me!
I said follow me!
What now, my lord Profion?
We shall have to modify our plans.
Summon the High Council of Mages immediately.
They're about to learn something of our young Empress... that may give them pause for thought.
It will be done.
This must be some twisted magic experiment... gone seriously wrong.
Why is it every time something bad happens... you blame the Mages?
When was the last time you saw a river catch on fire?
You think they care if anyone got hurt?
I'd love to find a way to give those Mages some payback.
"Ridley the Savior."
That'll be the day.
Look, Ridley, things are the way they are.
There's nothing you can do to change it.
You got your haves and your have-nots.
We are your gotta-gets.
And right about now, we gotta get paid.
The Magic School.
The what?!
The Magic School?
Are you crazy?
We'll break into the Magic School.
Think of what we could get.
With the fire, it won't be heavily guarded.
Think of the challenge, Snails.
Think of what we could find in there.
If we pull this off... we'll be the envy of every Thief in Sumdall.
Trust me.
Why would the Empress want to disband this Council?
It's a concept
I find difficult to believe.
Azmath, your loyalty is commendable... but we have all watched the Empress' growing up... and we have all heard her views... on what she considers to be the injustices of the land.
But she is just a young woman.
Young people speak from the heart, not the mind.
In time, with our counsel... she will come to understand why things cannot be changed.
Maybe so.
But is that a risk you are willing to take?
Her revolutionary ideas... have already taken root among the people.
In time, her influence will grow.
As the months go by... she will learn to master the powers of her Scepter.
When she does,
I have no doubt... she will use it to enforce her changes upon us.
What do you propose, Profion?
I humbly ask that we vote to remove the Scepter... from the Empress' control... so that government in lzmer will remain secure.
Remove the Scepter which lolls above our heads... and destroy the threat of revolution forever!
And if she does not agree?
Then... her true intentions will become clear.
And then we will be forced to do whatever we must... to protect the strength and unity of lzmer.
What say you?
How could he get the Council to turn against me?
He plays on the fears of the others-- their fears of change.
I know, Vildan... but the changes I propose are for the good of the people.
All people deserve to be free and equal... whether Commoner or Mage.
I know this within the depths of my soul... and if necessary...
I would die to make that the way lzmer is run.
What can I do to stop Profion?
You must outsmart him.
Over the past years,
I have been searching... for an ancient artifact called the Rod of Savrille.
It holds the same powers as your Scepter... with one difference--
It controls Red Dragons.
If you could obtain it... you could relinquish your Scepter to the Council... and still have protection against Profion.
I must have that Rod of Savrille!
With one wave of it,
I will topple her... and bring down that useless
Council of idiots with her.
What is your wish, my lord?
Pay a visit to the Magic School and see our friend Vildan.
Persuade him to give you the scroll of which he speaks... and bring it here to me.
And, Damodar... make sure that he's no longer around... to give our young Empress any more good advice.
Come, my friend.
Ridley, why it got to be so high?
Snails, let go of me.
Can't we just rob the first floor next time?
Hurry up.
Why don't we just rob God while we're up here?
Come on, Snails.
I thought you said this was going to be easy.
No, I said it wasn't impossible.
That's the same thing you said... when we robbed that little Halfling's house.
Who'd he catch? Me.
Who'd he beat from the waist down? Me.
-Are you going to jump?
-You going to catch me?
-I'm going to catch you.
-Promise?
I promise. Now jump.
All right.
Sorry.
I thought I heard something.
You did.
Me hitting the ground.
That is a big Dragon.
Now we're talking.
All right. Let's get to work.
I've already told you, Marina.
The Empress can't use... her Scepter of Gold-Dragon control... or Profion will paint her as a tyrant to the Council.
Profion must be made to expose himself to them.
Damn it, I know it's here.
Where is it?
It should be right here.
Are you sure you put it away in its proper place?
I'm sure.
You're sure, are you?
Then why is it filed here with these volumes on alchemy?
It belongs in Dracology.
Where is it?
I know I've got it somewhere.
Ah, yes, this was it.
Really, Marina, you must stop dawdling.
The Empress only has three days until the Council... forces her to relinquish her Scepter to them.
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.
You must understand the seriousness of our task.
I just feel like I should be doing something more... than shelving books.
I understand, Marina... but you must learn to be patient to maintain focus.
That's the best help you can provide just now.
I suppose you're right.
I never saw a scroll so hard to decode!
It's protected by very ancient magic.
Marina, fetch me some Manticore wing.
-What is that?
-A Dragon tooth.
-Put it back!
-Just a Dragon tooth.
-Put it back.
-A Gold Dragon tooth?
-It's too big. Put it back.
-Come on, Ridley.
Here.
What'd you give me the rodent for?
Pick it up! Come on.
You already got enough of these at your house.
Look at this.
We're going to be rich.
You know how much we could get for one of these?
Don't touch that!
One of the lab creatures must have got loose again.
Marina, check on it.
Right.
Snails, relax.
It's an illusion.
I knew that.
Don't touch anything else!
All right.
What are you doing?
We're the...
The cleaning crew.
Right.
This is dirty.
Cleanup crew's more like it.
You're Thieves trying to rob us.
She must've put a holding spell on us with that bracelet.
It must be the only way she can get guys to come home with her.
I'd have to put a feeble-mind spell on myself... to want to take you home.
That was funny.
You're going to the city dungeon.
That wasn't.
What a relief.
I'll be thanking you when they cut my head off.
You should.
It'd be an improvement.
There's that superior intelligence... you Mages are so famous for.
Yes, well, speaking of intelligence... what kind of genius would break into a Magic School?
He'd have to be really stupid or--
Or what?
Well...
Master!
If you don't tell me which scroll it is...
I'll have to kill you painfully.
Never!
Are you crazy?
You just zapped...
The Chief of the Crimson Brigade!
To the streets of Sumdall!
Follow them, you fools!
Where are we going?
Hey, nice trick!
No, the other way!
Watch out!
Lady, please, stop and listen.
Escapes are our bread and butter.
-What's that?
-I don't know!
Get this rope off so I can deal with it!
Can't nobody get a moment of peace around here?
I ought to...
Nice lid.
You shouldn't have done that.
Check that door.
It's locked! It's locked!
Follow me!
If you think I'm going in that filthy mess--
That's disgusting!
Post Brigades at every sewer entrance and exit.
I want them found... now.
Marina of Pretensa, student Mage... is sought for the brutal murder of Vildan Vildir.
A reward will be...
I can't believe this!
You better believe it.
They're framing us.
They're framing you.
You're nothing but a Thief.
They can't be framing me.
I'm an aristocrat. I'm a Mage.
A low-level Mage-- completely expendable.
Practically worthless.
This is ridiculous.
I'll go to the authorities.
I can't go to the authorities.
That's right.
They'll toss you in prison... and torture you till you confess.
You better tell us,
'cause like the man said... we're your accomplices.
All right.
Come on!
You allow... a slip of a girl to escape you... with the scroll... and now Norda, the Empress' finest tracker... is in pursuit... and you tell me not to concern myself?
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.
There you are right.
And here's why...
Just a friend I'm sending along for the ride.
A gentle reminder not to make any more mistakes.
The moment you deliver me the Rod...
I'll ensure that he-- it... vacate the premises.
Now... may I suggest... that once you two have become fully acquainted... you follow the Empress' tracker Norda.
She happens to be good at her job.
She will lead you to our missing friends... and the scroll... and this time, Damodar... don't fail me.
It's about time!
If we find the Rod, the Empress heaps us with gold, huh?
Why don't you try and rise above being a Dwarf?
This isn't about gold.
It's about saving our Empire.
Empire?
Who cares about the Empire?
You Mages are the only ones who benefit from it.
Oh, really? That's an interesting sentiment... coming from a guy who steals things for a living.
Have you ever heard of honor amongst Thieves?
We might live outside the law, but we respect each other.
Unlike a bunch of back-stabbing Mages.
That is just the sort of half-baked, illiterate drivel... that proves Commoners really are common.
That's it. We're out of here.
Come on, Snails.
We'll go into hiding.
She can find the Rod herself.
Fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Mind if we eat first?
No. Be my guest.
Those red marks there look like the locks... my father used to put on plans in his carriages.
Please.
This is an ancient scroll, not a blueprint for a bucket.
You don't seem to know what you're doing... so you might as well let me have a look.
Give that back!
Let's see. He used to put his fingers like this... and then he'd say something like...
Alanor, salah--
What was that word?
Bidet.
Bidet? Bidara! Bidara.
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Can't blame me for trying.
At least l--
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent!
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Do not let them escape... or you will suffer a fate far worse... than that which hath been inflicted upon me.
So there I am, hogtied, lying on my back.
This Orc starts poking me with the spear.
Kind of a no-win situation.
So, I say to myself,
"What do I got to lose?"
So, I take that spear and bite it.
And I start chewing.
Idol of idols.
With an Elf.
You got to be kidding.
The problem with Elves is they got no meat on their bones.
You got to get yourself a nice 250-pound Dwarf.
With hair on her chin you can hang on to.
Excuse me, little man.
You looking for somebody in particular?
Or are you just looking for... somebody?
Actually...
I'm looking for someone just like you.
What a coincidence...
'cause I was looking for someone just like you.
We got to celebrate.
Bartender, give me a bottle of your best wine.
Make that your cheapest.
Wait.
I need the girl.
Bar fight!
Get them !
This ain't the time for romance!
-What are you doing?
-Come on! Come on!
Wait, I got to go back.
I think I'm in love!
With an Elf?
They think Humans are a joke!
All right, I lied.
I just want to hit it!
Let's get Ridley out of here.
Bidet, bidet, bidet.
That Wraith must have been defective.
-He seemed reliable to me.
-He did not.
It's Damodar, man.
He's onto us.
With what we've walked into, everyone's going to be onto us.
What do you mean, everybody's onto us?
Go ahead.
Tell him what you got us into.
Me? But you--
Go ahead.
Tell me what you got us into.
According to the Wraith inside the scroll... the Rod we're looking for caused the Great War.
Is that all?
Have you lost your damn mind?
What does this Rod do?
It's supposed to have the power to control Red Dragons.
I don't know about you... but this sound like a pretty bad idea to me.
It gets better.
This map leads to a Dragon temple.
To get in, we have to get the Eye of the Dragon... from the Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild... in Antius City.
Xilus?
No. Get--
No way!
I told her she's crazy... but she keeps going on about
Profion and the Empress.
Profion?
They can take care of themselves.
I suggest we lay low...
Iet the whole thing blow over, come back, rob everybody.
That's all. Let's go.
Snails, there's one more small problem.
Problem?
What's the problem, Ridley?
I kind of committed us to find it.
Ridley, how could you do something like that?
You--
I can't believe this.
I can't believe--
"This is our big chance, huh?
"Let's rob the magic school.
This is our big chance!"
That's what you said to me, right?
This is... dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
Dumb!
I got a new name for dumb.
"Ridley."
This is the Ridley-est thing
I ever heard of.
I'll understand if you don't want to go.
What do you mean I can't go?
Look, all I'm saying is that... don't you think this is just a little bit out of our league?
Just a little bit?
Snails, listen to me, OK?
This Eye of the Dragon we're supposed to get?
It's a ruby the size of your fist.
I don't--
A ruby the size of a fist?
Yeah. We'll use her to help us get it, and we'll take off.
We'll make a fortune.
Trust me.
I hate when you say that!
Ridley, I know I'll regret this.
I knew you'd come through for me!
Don't touch me.
OK, just a little bit.
We're in.
How about you?
I don't see what choice I have.
Just tell me one thing--
If I help, who'll pay me?
We'll worry about that later.
That's a terrible way to do business.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!
Get out of here!
Ridley, check it out.
Let's go.
Listen, we're looking for esteemed Guildmaster Xilus.
We thought you'd know him.
The only thing I know is... you ought to take your business out of town... before you get the words
"outsiders not appreciated"... branded right where your nose used to be.
Get it?
Thanks for your time!
If I ain't drinking, you sure ain't shopping!
Come on!
There you are!
Where have you been?
Don't look at us, all right?
We're just shopping.
Is that three-eyed hyphen bastard watching us?
If we follow him... he'll probably lead us into the Guild.
There he goes.
Let's go.
Come on.
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a lookout.
Nice.
Isn't that Tollum?
The guy that kidnapped the Duke of--
Let's keep 'em walking.
Let's go find Xilus.
That won't be necessary.
Like I said,
"Outsiders not appreciated."
You was talking to us?
We was confused
'cause your third eye... was looking at somebody completely different.
Take 'em away!
Don't touch me!
Get off me! Get off of me!
Where do you think they took Snails?
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Just let me do the talking.
So this is it?
Everything a Thief strives for?
You must be Xilus.
Ridley Freeborn. Practitioner of the larcenous crafts.
Member in good standing of the Sumdall Guild.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
A fellow Thief.
The pleasure's all mine.
See?
Sumdall, eh?
How is old Sumdall?
That's a pretty tough town, isn't it?
All those Mages.
We get by.
Yes, well, I think you must be very accomplished... to have such a precious morsel traveling with you.
What might I do for you?
The unity of our kingdom--
We understand you have something called the Eye of the Dragon.
We desperately need it.
Yes, well, I'm always happy to help a fellow Thief.
Have you ever heard of the Antius Guild Maze?
Of course.
Every Thief has heard of it.
Wonderful.
Then you'll know that the Eye of the Dragon... is the prize at the center of my Guild Maze, won't you?
You finish the maze, you win the prize.
Has anyone ever finished it before?
They all died trying.
But look on the bright side.
At least the prize is still there.
Good health.
And jolly good luck.
This is a good one, Ridley.
That's no fair!
-I give him forty seconds.
-Nah, a minute.
I can't believe they're betting on whether or not he lives.
Au contraire, precious morsel.
They're betting on how long before he dies.
Be careful, Ridley!
Oh, my.
This is not right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very clever.
But is clever enough?
Come on, the game ain't over yet.
Very light on his feet, isn't he?
What kind of vault is that?
I think she needs to visit her friend.
Nice.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
Very clever. Well done, you.
-You were absolutely amazing.
-Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you.
I waited fifteen years for someone to pick that lock.
I knew the man that could survive that maze... would be able to get into that vault.
And now, here he is.
The man. You.
Why don't you give me what's rightfully mine?
What about honor amongst Thieves?
What a romantic notion.
Do you honestly believe
I could've amassed my wealth... if I worried about honor?
So, pretty boy... if you don't want Hugo here... to rearrange your features for you...
I suggest you just give it up.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell are you?
I don't know who you are... but be prepared for a lesson in pain.
You must be joking.
I never joke when Mages trespass in my Guild!
This is the map you're after.
Clear a path, and I'll put it out.
Do it.
Let go of me!
You OK?
We got to save Marina.
Wait. What about the Dwarf?
You get the Dwarf,
I'll get the girl.
Wait. How come I always got to get the Dwarf?
Damn!
Ridley, we already have the Dragon's Eye.
Let's take it to Sumdall and sell it.
Snails, we're not leaving without Marina.
Listen to you, Ridley!
You're going to risk your life for a Mage?
Listen, Snails--
What?
I wouldn't do that... if I were you.
Hey, it's you.
You know her?
We're acquainted.
Is that the Elf you were drooling over?
I wouldn't put it that way.
But, yeah, that's her.
Pretty, huh?
They all look alike to me.
Silence!
Where is the girl?
None of your business.
Wrong, Human.
It is my business to arrest you and Marina of Pretensa... and to take you and the scroll you stole... back to the Empress of lzmer.
So you're the law, are you?
I should have known.
One of your fellow lawmen-- in fact, the Chief of the Crimson Brigade-- beat you to the punch.
He just took off with Marina!
-Damodar.
-That's him.
Only he's not working for the law anymore.
He's working for Profion.
He's the one you want, not us.
Your Majesty.
Yes, Norda.
Have you found me the scroll?
No, Your Highness.
I have unfortunate tidings to report.
It seems Profion also seeks the Rod.
But how could he know?
I do not know, milady.
Damodar has captured
Marina of Pretensa... and the scroll... but I have her companions in my custody.
What is your command?
Seek Damodar out.
We need that Rod.
The Council demands my response imminently.
Norda, please hurry.
Our time is running out.
As you wish.
Gather the horses.
We will track Damodar.
They will travel with us.
Should they try to escape... kill them.
Tell me...
Why were you at the Thieves Guild?
It isn't exactly a sightseeing spot, is it?
We needed money for supplies.
You'll have to do better than that.
I'm curious.
You're a Mage... and yet you're disgracing your family... by consorting with Thieves.
You're a disgrace to lzmer, conspiring against the Empress.
I have no dispute with her.
You know me.
I have served her family loyally for many a year.
It is Profion's desire to dethrone her... not mine.
Then why do you help him?
Look at me.
Look at me!
If I do not obtain the Rod...
I will die.
Please... help me.
I'm sorry, but l...
I cannot help you.
Foolish girl.
I can suck... the information I want... right out of you.
Your friends have procured... the Eye of the Dragon... from the Thieves Maze.
A key... of some sort.
Can't I just walk?
Don't you people know Dwarves are terrified of horses?
Get over it.
A lot of Dwarves are afraid to show their true feelings.
I'm not, OK?
They followed the valley.
I know these lands.
There's a shortcut up ahead.
Through the forest and over those hills.
It means leaving the trail... but if Damodar sets up camp and we ride all night... we stand a good chance of cutting him off.
All right, let's go.
I love the way you track.
You wouldn't happen to be single, are you?
What?
There's no harm in asking is there?
It just so happens that I'm single.
Can you believe it?
How old are you?
Twenty-three. I know
I'm a little young for you.
What if I get my hands on an aging potion?
I'll sacrifice a couple of years for you.
I'm 234.
Oh, damn.
I didn't mean that much of a change.
Hurry.
Ridley, look--Beholders.
Relax, Snails.
We'll just sneak around 'em.
Now what?
A little distraction.
All right, Snails, stay close.
All clear.
OK. I'll get Marina.
You get the map.
OK. Hey, wait, Ridley.
How you get the girl and I get a map?
We got to work out some new plans.
Go.
Be careful.
All right.
You, too.
Let's go in.
We were not meant to enter this place.
This task they must complete alone.
I'm Damodar.
A little black magic.
All right, Damodar.
Nice.
Piece of cake.
I knew this was too easy.
Need a hand?
It's OK.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Just like you Thieves.
Always taking things that don't belong to you.
All right. Now...
I'm mad.
You want to play, do you?
Yeah. Let's play.
OK, you win. Game over.
There they are!
So much for getting out of here without a fight.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Hit him ! Hit him !
Let's go!
Come on.
You cannot be serious.
I've never been so serious.
Oh, please.
If you'll give me the Dragon's Eye...
I might decide... to let you die quickly.
Go to hell!
Not your usual punctual self.
Where's my Dragon's Eye?
I have it.
Really?
Show it to me.
Let him go first, and it's yours.
Snails, don't!
Make it easy on yourself.
Give me what is mine.
Never!
You're as stubborn as your friend.
Very well.
You've made your choice.
Come on, Ridley!
Transporting!
Come on, Ridley!
Come on!
The Council has voted.
You must oblige us.
You understand the consequences of your decision--
Do not patronize me, Azmath... for I understand all too well.
Yes, I violate the law in defying the Council... but if I were to give you this Scepter... my crime would be graver yet... for I would be defying my conscience... and our people.
Have you all forgotten?
This Council was created to protect the people of lzmer... but ask yourselves...
Is this what you are doing?
I say not.
Your concern is only for yourselves... not the people.
And Your Majesty is forcing the Empire... to the verge of civil war... in the best interests of the people?
The man who convinced you to take the Scepter from me... so that he would leave the state defenseless.
Be careful, my friends... for once he's done with me, this Council may be next.
War benefits no one, Profion... and I oppose it.
But if it is necessary to obtain the freedom of our people... then no cost could be too great to achieve that goal.
Do you hear her words?
She violates our highest law!
And then seeks to force us into submission... with a threat of war.
Each citizen of lzmer, whether a Commoner or a Mage... deserves an equal right for prosperity... and as Empress... this is how I decree lzmer shall be run... from this day forward.
Such pretty words.
My friends, I warned you... that this headstrong child... will defy you and destroy you.
Her youth denies her the wisdom... to understand why some things cannot change... but idealism is for children... and a child is not fit to govern an Empire.
I ask you one last time!
Will you submit to the ruling of this Council... and relinquish your Scepter?
I was praying... that you would find the wisdom... to see that the path
I propose for lzmer... is the right one.
I do not wish to fight you... but I will not leave the Empire... at the mercy of an unscrupulous charlatan!
So decide as you must, but know one thing--
I am not afraid.
A wonderful performance.
My friends, ask yourselves... are we prepared to see our Empire... destroyed by a child?
Then is now not the time we should act?
Then down with the tyrants... and let the war begin!
What is he doing?
Isn't he going to use any spells?
Wait.
How did you do that?
The Elven people do not require spells to work with magic.
You use magic.
We are part of it.
Part of magic?
As are all living creatures, including Dragons.
Sadly, Humans see only their destructive powers.
I had a dream. I saw--
You saw a Dragon being born.
It was amazing.
Life was exploding all around.
So it should.
You see, when Dragons are born, they bring new magic with them.
Magic is the life force of our world.
It keeps nature and everything around us... in balance.
And if many Dragons should die?
Life would wither as it must... and the balance would be destroyed.
The Rod.
You and your countrymen... are very close to irreparably destroying... the fabric of magic with this Rod you seek.
The Rod is man-made... unnatural.
It must not be disturbed.
You must rest.
I'm sorry about Snails.
I'm sure you are.
He died for a good cause.
A good cause?
What cause is that?
The Empress against Profion?
Politics.
I'm through with all that.
I'm not going to die over some power struggle... between a couple of greedy Mages.
No, you're wrong.
No, you're wrong! Mage!
You never had to live on the other side.
You know what?
Snails was right.
There is nothing we can do to change it... and if I had listened to him, he would still be alive.
Just because some Mages are evil does not mean they all are.
I'm not!
Let me let you in on a little secret.
The Empress that Snails died for stands to lose everything... because she is fighting to change things.
As if she has anything to worry about.
You are so naive.
She risks everything... because she does not believe the system is fair.
Profion seeks to dethrone her because she believes... that Mages and Commoners should be treated as equals.
She is fighting to change what you hate so much!
That, Ridley, is what Snails died for.
When Vildan told me what was happening with the Empress...
I wanted to do all I could to help her.
But even then,
I did not understand... why she would want Commoners to be equal with us.
But now... after being with you for only a few days... and seeing how you always manage to find your way...
I understand why the Empress is right.
Please, Ridley.
Help me show them we are not like they are.
You know, for a Mage... you're pretty smart.
It will protect you.
Thank you.
All right. This is it.
This is the entrance to the dungeon.
What happened?
What is it?
It's a wall force of some kind.
I've never seen this kind of magic.
Only you were meant to pass.
I guess I go alone, then.
Be careful.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Great.
Now what?
Sorry, Snails.
Finally, a Mage who got what he deserved.
Why do you disturb the Rod of Savrille?
To save the Empire of lzmer.
Who...
What are you?
I am Savrille, creator of the Rod... cursed with the crime of trying to control the Red Dragons... and sentenced to this purgatory... until someone worthy of its power takes it.
You are such a man?
I don't know if anybody's such a man.
But I'm going to find out.
Be warned. Anyone who wields the power of the Rod... shall suffer a horrible fate... for the evil it creates cannot be undone... unless its spell is broken.
How do I break the spell?
That, you must discover.
The Empress has called her Dragons upon us.
Don't just stand there admiring them !
Destroy them before they reach us.
Hurry! Hurry!
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
Come on.
Get up! Prepare to fire again!
Move that crossbow.
Aim for their wings, you fools!
Fire, you fools! Fire!
What have I done?
Come to me.
I found the Rod!
Thanks for saving me the trouble.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Remember... your stupidity and persistence got your Thief friend killed.
Don't let it be responsible... for finishing off the rest of your social circle.
Oh, look.
I've cut her. What a shame.
Don't hurt her.
Then give me the Rod!
And you'll release them?
Don't do it, Ridley.
You have my word.
Finally.
You said you'd let them go!
I lied.
Kill them... slowly.
Give that to me.
You said you'd set me free.
Now what about my head?
Here they come!
Come, Damodar.
To the roof of Sumdall.
Fire!
My destiny.
Come to me.
Look. I've cut you.
What a shame.
You can run, Your Ladyship... but you'll never run far enough!
Let their blood rain from the sky!
You'll pay for that, boy.
You really think that you can steal my destiny?
I'll invent a new destiny especially for you... full of pain.
A new kind of pain and new senses to feel it with.
Not if I kill you first.
This will be a real pleasure.
Not so talented, eh, Mr. Ridley?
I've enjoyed our little chat, but now it's your time to die.
My little tracker.
I could--
Hey, Mage!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Back for more?
You really think you can use that, you little burglar?
Well, that's impossible.
Bring them down on him, Ridley!
Destroy him !
I won't become you.
What have you done?
Your Majesty.
It's over, Profion.
The battle maybe, Your Majesty.
Maybe... but not the war.
Thank you.
People of lzmer... at long last, I do declare that you are now all equal.
Let the celebration begin.
You hear that, buddy?
That's for you.
Nothing's going to be the same without you.
But I guess I'll have to get used to that.
I just hope wherever you are... you know that you did make a difference.
You helped things change.
You finally got it.
Your big score.
I guess I'd better get going... or I'm going to miss my own knighting ceremony.
Ridley the Savior.
Can you believe it?
I'm going to miss you, pal.
Do not question your gift.
Your friend awaits you.
{3214}{3272}. . .because of the defiance of|one person.
{3277}{3312}You must forget about him.
{3317}{3399}He was a wild spirit and this was|always to be his fate.
{3404}{3470}You talk as if he's already dead
{3628}{3708}Even if he does survive this time,|he's a greener. . .
{3713}{3773}. . .so set your sights elsewhere|for a husband.
{3778}{3838}I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
{4662}{4732}-This is all the medicine I could find.|-I'm sorry.
{4742}{4806}The gods took your father|in the night.
{5402}{5496}As long as we stay here, there'll|never be enough to eat. Never.
{5513}{5601}There may be other places|we could live where food is plentiful.
{5606}{5688}All it takes is one demon to follow|you back from the forbidden land.
{5693}{5732}Then we'd all be struck down.
{5738}{5773}Have you ever seen one?
{5778}{5809}Have you?
{5814}{5861}Has anyone here ever seen one?
{5872}{5896}A demon?
{5906}{5934}A monster!
{5939}{5968}A beast!
{6056}{6090}The stories are true.
{6120}{6157}The gods used to live here.
{6179}{6265}They watched over and protected man,|but man grew selfish. . .
{6270}{6321}. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .
{6326}{6386}. . .allowing the demons|to descend from the sky.
{6516}{6604}As survivors, we must dedicate|our lives to pleasing the gods. . .
{6610}{6700}. . .so that one day they will come back|and drive away the demons.
{6718}{6793}That is our fate.
{6844}{6892}Only if you believe in fate.
{7454}{7492}I'm sorry. I can't take you.
{7497}{7545}I can't handle myself|as well as a man?
{7550}{7596}-No.|-You arrogant greener.
{7601}{7670}You can handle yourself|better than most men. . .
{7675}{7737}. . .which is why you need|to help the village.
{7866}{7948}Your mother gave this to me|before she died.
{7954}{8008}She hoped it'd be passed|to your children.
{8108}{8137}It's for good luck.
{8354}{8411}Don't let anything happen|to you out there.
{9455}{9475}Easy!
{9623}{9644}Easy!
{10288}{10339}So you're the beast|we're all afraid of.
{10972}{11011}Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
{11196}{11243}You have been fortunate in the hunt.
{11248}{11299}I hope you thanked the gods.
{11331}{11399}-A nonbeliever.|-I believe what I can see.
{11452}{11526}A nonbeliever, huh?|You from the caves?
{11531}{11592}Probably never seen a god.|Would you like to?
{11597}{11679}-What do you know about gods?|-We've seen gods. Rock and l.
{11685}{11722}You lying thieves.
{11823}{11849}Wait a minute.
{11875}{11915}Wait a minute, we're hunting.
{11920}{11970}No time to show you gods with no food.
{11975}{12060}We need food. We must hunt.|Nonbeliever.
{12147}{12172}Wait.
{12388}{12433}First you show me the god.
{12454}{12489}Then we eat.
{12678}{12703}Look.
{12719}{12760}Frozen ones.
{12765}{12851}The way to the great god village|is marked by these frozen ones.
{12869}{12954}When the gods left this world,|they ordered man not to look at them.
{12962}{13054}Those that disobeyed were|frozen in place for all of eternity.
{13060}{13133}When the gods lived here|they could fly through the air.
{13153}{13246}They'd drive chariots in front|of special caves with golden arches.
{13259}{13283}Golden.
{13288}{13350}And the food would magically appear.
{13355}{13381}Magic.
{13387}{13415}Here!
{13440}{13542}The gods weren't allowed to fall|in love with mortal women.
{13552}{13590}This one did. . .
{13595}{13667}. . .and was left behind,|frozen as punishment.
{13770}{13803}Are you sure this was a god?
{13809}{13868}I thought you said you believe|what you can see.
{14143}{14170}If you need proof. . .
{14175}{14267}. . .when the sun goes down, you can see|the rest of the gods in the sky.
{14276}{14317}They're the bright lights.
{14371}{14443}The evil beasts hunt in the dark.|We need to find shelter.
{14448}{14495}There's a cave over here.
{14627}{14721}Look at those poor bastards.|They really angered the gods.
{14728}{14754}Carlo.
{14771}{14802}Let's eat.
{15161}{15199}Go. Go.
{15576}{15603}What's a "greener"?
{15609}{15660}The grass is greener|on the other side.
{15678}{15764}Always looking for something better,|something out there.
{15769}{15799}Maybe she was right.
{15923}{15955}God stone.
{15991}{16018}Sharp.
{16052}{16100}No, you keep it. You keep it.
{16116}{16199}Where we're from, a good woman|is a hard thing to find.
{16204}{16285}So if you were stupid enough|to leave a good woman behind. . .
{16290}{16379}. . .why don't you tell me where she is|so I can go get her for myself?
{16384}{16408}No!
{17421}{17479}Forget about me.|Get out of here. I can't move!
{17808}{17831}No!
{17936}{17972}Oh, heavenly gods!
{21840}{21885}Don't breathe the air!
{21898}{21922}It's poison!
{22048}{22090}My chest is on fire!
{22316}{22368}It helps you breathe. Take it!
{22373}{22404}I can't!
{22506}{22548}Get off my brother.
{24196}{24239}-What's he saying?|-Don't know.
{26297}{26336}Who's responsible for allowing|him to run around?
{26342}{26362}He shot the wrangler.
{26468}{26561}I'm a little pressed for time.|Save the going-away jokes for later.
{26566}{26613}No joke, sir. I swear.
{26618}{26678}The man-animal|got ahold of this gun.
{26695}{26720}Really?
{26751}{26780}Show me.
{26804}{26824}Sir?
{26932}{26959}Reach for the gun.
{26964}{27005}But, sir, I might get shot.
{27011}{27091}Sure, you might. And I might|suddenly grow a third arm!
{27096}{27128}But it shot the wrangler.
{27134}{27206}Any report filed today|still has my name on it. . .
{27212}{27301}. . .and you are out of your skull-bone|if you think I'm going to write. . .
{27306}{27389}. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the|cause of death unless I see it!
{27394}{27452}If I obey your command,|I may get killed.
{27457}{27522}If you don't, it's a certainty|you will be killed.
{27547}{27574}Reach for the gun.
{27853}{27913}Well, I'll be damned.
{29892}{29961}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30016}{30063}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30622}{30677}It is a pleasure to see you,|Your Excellency.
{30682}{30762}I would be honored to expedite|your clearance through security.
{30767}{30849}Please, call me Zete.|Does all of Earth look like this?
{30854}{30904}I'm afraid so, sir.
{30919}{31024}Pathetic. All the green|and the blue sky.
{31031}{31120}They told me this planet was ugly,|but this is one of the ugliest. . .
{31125}{31194}-. . .in the entire universe.|-I couldn't agree more.
{31199}{31305}I hate these puny, undersized planets.|The gravity is so different.
{31313}{31353}One does get used to it.
{31359}{31431}And the human-animals,|grossly undersized.
{31437}{31495}They don't make good eating,|Your Excellency.
{31501}{31557}-My executive assistant, Ker.|-Thank you.
{31563}{31655}He has been fully trained|to replace me as chief of security.
{31661}{31750}-As soon as my transfer goes through.|-Well, Ker. . .
{31755}{31836}. . .once we finish mining out|this miserable little planet. . .
{31841}{31887}. . .Iet's do the universe a favor.
{31892}{31950}Let's exterminate the lot of them.
{32019}{32079}-Oh, you're too much.|-So they tell me.
{32085}{32130}Please, come this way.
{32235}{32279}Spy satellites recorded those.
{32285}{32363}-What is this species?|-According to the Clinko historians. . .
{32368}{32407}. . .the species is called "dog. "
{32413}{32454}-Dog.|-Yes.
{32464}{32543}Obviously the superior race,|having the man-animal chauffeur.
{32565}{32664}Well, dogs did prove to be|more cooperative than the man-animals.
{32669}{32746}They weren't as useful|when it came to manual labor.
{32803}{32889}I am honored by your visit,|Your Excellency.
{32894}{32922}Thank you, Planetship.
{32927}{33003}You'll be pleased. I approved|additional labor resources.
{33008}{33065}They'll be here|by the end of quarter cycle.
{33070}{33111}Thank you, Your Excellency.
{33121}{33165}Now, let's see.
{33239}{33296}Your long overdue transfer.
{33309}{33406}You must be looking forward to getting|off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
{33412}{33510}I just want to do whatever serves|the corporation best, sir.
{33515}{33581}Very admirable.|And I must say, you've done. . .
{33587}{33657}. . .a first-rate job here|as interim security chief.
{33662}{33717}Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
{33722}{33759}I do what I can.
{33764}{33837}So we've decided to keep you|for another tour of service.
{33948}{33998}There must be some mistake.
{34003}{34070}Home Office does not make mistakes.
{34075}{34131}Of course not.|But have you looked at my file?
{34146}{34228}It explicitly says that this|is a temporary assignment.
{34375}{34455}Are you not aware that I graduated|top of my class?
{34460}{34492}Quite an accomplishment.
{34503}{34573}I don't mean to second-guess|the Home Office. . .
{34578}{34639}. . .but surely I could be|of better service--
{34644}{34759}Home Office is well aware of your|academic achievements and talents.
{34764}{34871}That's why we've decided not to keep|you here for another five cycles.
{35000}{35036}It's a joke.
{35096}{35120}Thank you, sir.
{35125}{35211}I don't know if I|could've kept my sanity. . .
{35216}{35263}. . .to be here another five cycles.
{35268}{35360}We've decided to keep you here|for another 50 cycles!
{35395}{35454}With endless options for renewal!
{36051}{36111}Those options, of course. . .
{36116}{36174}. . .being at Home Office's discretion.
{36179}{36209}Not yours.
{36256}{36289}The senator. . .
{36327}{36380}. . .has a lot of friends.
{36530}{36581}Would you please tell the senator. . .
{36587}{36656}. . .if I'd had even an inkling that|that was his daughter--
{36662}{36697}Watch your tongue.
{36751}{36838}The senator's exact words to me were,|and I'm quoting:
{36843}{36911}"If that blasted Terl tries|to talk his way out of it. . .
{36916}{36972}. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "
{37020}{37112}But cheer up.|There's one bright side to this.
{37117}{37209}One day you're going to die,|and when you end up in hell. . .
{37222}{37292}. . .at least it'll be a step up|from this place.
{38651}{38699}You haven't left for Psychlo.
{38713}{38803}Your powers of observation|are simply startling.
{38815}{38853}Give me three pans to go.
{38917}{38975}I don't know what|you're so down about.
{38987}{39039}You still get to be head of security.
{39044}{39163}Which, from what I can tell,|is a pretty cushy job.
{39171}{39235}Well, I can assure you. . .
{39240}{39359}. . .that I was not groomed since birth|to have some cushy job. . .
{39364}{39434}. . .that even a moron like you|could perform.
{39454}{39538}While you were still learning|how to spell your name. . .
{39543}{39634}. . .I was being trained|to conquer galaxies!
{39684}{39716}To do anything less. . .
{39721}{39796}. . .is a disgrace|to my entire family line.
{39830}{39869}That'll be six credits.
{39877}{39909}Put it on my tab.
{39914}{39940}You don't have a tab.
{39950}{39984}I do now.
{40958}{41020}You're new here,|so I'll explain how it works.
{41047}{41077}I eat first.
{41083}{41117}Then my men eat.
{41123}{41196}If there's anything left,|you can share it with them.
{41205}{41252}That's how it used to work.
{41268}{41328}Greener, let's just stay alive.
{41334}{41358}You're right.
{41365}{41397}-So I'll fight you.|-No.
{41425}{41489}Without food,|we don't have strength to escape.
{41494}{41555}-So now we're escaping?|-I am.
{41560}{41584}Come if you want.
{41676}{41735}We fight, it's to the death.
{42277}{42319}Say your prayers to the gods!
{43011}{43104}We have enough problems without|killing each other over food.
{43164}{43256}From now on, we eat at the same time.
{44114}{44141}Sir.
{44256}{44305}I was wondering when|you'd look at that.
{44319}{44428}It came in last week,|and I put it right in your box.
{44499}{44570}I've wasted my time, haven't l?
{44617}{44712}If you're going to lie to me, have|the decency to do a credible job. . .
{44717}{44781}. . .so I don't look like an idiot|for training you.
{44787}{44886}But I'm not lying. I put the photo|in your box as soon as it came in.
{44891}{44971}You are pathetic. You wouldn't last|one day at the academy.
{44976}{45053}-And I saw you.|-What?
{45142}{45175}You said:
{45185}{45265}"We use picto-cameras|to spy on other offices.
{45270}{45368}But under no circumstance|do we spy on our own office. "
{45373}{45427}That's right. We don't. I do.
{45447}{45485}Start talking.
{45527}{45576}The photo's from|last week's recon drone.
{45581}{45660}It shows a rockslide in the mountains.|It exposed a gold vein.
{45665}{45714}You were waiting for me to transfer. . .
{45719}{45771}. . .so you could turn it in|and get credit.
{45776}{45808}I didn't think you'd mind.
{45813}{45885}I don't mind. Turn it in. But before|you do, pretend you're not. . .
{45937}{45955}. . .a complete imbecile. . .
{45960}{45999}. . .and check the compo gradients.
{46097}{46149}It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .
{46201}{46272}. . .can get there without his breath gas|exploding. No way to mine the gold.
{46361}{46461}But what I do mind is that you|betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
{46493}{46535}It's worthless! You said so!
{46540}{46599}But you didn't know it was worthless!
{46739}{46799}I would never hurt you, sir.
{46863}{46980}I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.|It's against regulations, sir.
{47001}{47085}I can make this up to you, sir.|I promise. I swear.
{47090}{47117}Please, sir.
{47195}{47247}You do not have to shoot me, sir.
{47473}{47567}Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
{47572}{47631}Of course not.|We have work to do. Come.
{47677}{47771}Tomorrow morning, we must warn|the Planetship of the mutiny.
{47776}{47800}What mutiny?
{47805}{47873}The one you're going to pretend|is in the works. . .
{47878}{47980}. . .Iike your life depended on it.|Because it does.
{48012}{48095}If the worker revolt takes place,|my informants tell me. . .
{48100}{48180}. . .that the first order of business is|to separate you from your head.
{48220}{48297}Which is why there will be no revolt.
{48302}{48396}I am authorizing you to use whatever|means necessary to prevent it.
{48408}{48513}The best way is to increase profits|and stop cutting the workers' pay.
{48518}{48570}Production equals profits.
{48581}{48665}And I've already ordered|as many new workers as possible. . .
{48670}{48707}. . .to boost production.
{48712}{48776}But we have to pay the new workers.
{48781}{48899}Maybe you were absent the day they|taught economics at the academy, Ker.
{48909}{48965}But nobody works for free.
{48978}{49017}Man-animals do.
{49068}{49127}What if we were to train them|how to mine?
{49248}{49322}Man-animals operating machinery?
{49344}{49401}Have you blown a head gasket?
{49412}{49526}I will be the laughingstock|of the universe.
{49531}{49585}So you should have me|take man-animals. . .
{49590}{49644}. . .with equipment,|out to a remote area. . .
{49649}{49724}. . .better that you don't know where,|and try and train them.
{49736}{49799}Have them do some test mining.
{49804}{49867}If it doesn't work out,|no one will know.
{49872}{49922}-Right.|-And if it does work. . .
{49927}{49979}. . .I will be vaporized.
{49985}{50026}It is against the law.
{50031}{50060}Regulations say. . .
{50065}{50166}. . .a Planetship faced with|a profit-threatening situation. . .
{50171}{50250}. . .is relieved|of all other ordinances. . .
{50255}{50360}. . .to pursue, to protect|and to acquire said profits.
{50365}{50392}There you have it.
{50568}{50637}We stick to the original plan.
{50655}{50693}Bring in new workers. . .
{50712}{50790}. . .and they go on half-pay|as soon as they arrive.
{50795}{50864}And that is final!
{52379}{52447}Run! Run!
{53758}{53819}Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
{53928}{54000}Last time we didn't even stop timing|until its lungs burst.
{54006}{54030}That's the wager.
{54188}{54279}No way this man-animal|lasts more than four minutes.
{54834}{54864}Help me!
{54881}{54910}I need your air!
{55293}{55346}The wager's off.|The damn thing cheated.
{55547}{55600}The Planetship is hiding something.
{55605}{55662}All we have to do|is find out what it is. . .
{55668}{55713}. . .then we'll have leverage.
{55719}{55773}And then we can get the gold.
{55779}{55830}What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
{55840}{55939}I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then|I'm getting off this stinking planet.
{55945}{55974}Come on, sir.
{55989}{56030}You gotta let me in on it.
{56036}{56097}I barely make any lousy credits|in this job.
{56103}{56179}And I've got five wives|to support, sir.
{56237}{56317}I don't know if I want|to partner up with an idiot.
{56336}{56393}How do I even know|you understand the plan?
{56513}{56616}We train man-animals|who don't need breath gas. . .
{56622}{56673}. . .to mine the gold for us.
{56679}{56759}But Home Planet owns this planet.|The gold belongs to them.
{56765}{56798}That's the beauty of it.
{56804}{56858}Home Planet doesn't know|the gold exists.
{56864}{56932}Those corporate crapheads|won't know we stole it.
{56941}{56986}It's the perfect crime, sir.
{56992}{57091}Putting aside the serious violations|of teaching mining to inferiors. . .
{57097}{57190}. . .and insulting corporate superiors,|each one punishable by death.
{57196}{57241}So it is my duty to report you. . .
{57246}{57338}. . .though you'll be vaporized, and|I'll have to train a new assistant.
{57365}{57416}But it's your stinking plan, sir.
{57421}{57474}So I'm glad I have|a recording of you. . .
{57479}{57530}. . .Iaying out the plan|and my reprimanding you.
{57535}{57584}Think of it as part of your education.
{57626}{57655}Education, huh?
{57725}{57824}Never engage in a criminal activity|unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .
{57830}{57879}. . .in case you ever get found out.
{57894}{57949}Thank you. That's great.
{57955}{58002}But why do I have to be the patsy?
{58008}{58068}So you don't get any bright ideas|to get rid of Terl. . .
{58074}{58123}. . .and keep the gold for yourself.
{58128}{58169}But I'd never double-cross you.
{58175}{58264}I've arranged that if any unfortunate|accident were to befall me. . .
{58281}{58349}. . .this would go|straight to the Home Office.
{60228}{60302}Double or nothing|I can blow off one of its limbs.
{60468}{60550}That one does seem to be unusually|intelligent and resourceful.
{60560}{60609}But it's also defiant.
{60618}{60659}We'll need leverage over it.
{60664}{60717}Leverage? Over a man-animal?
{60722}{60769}Man is a primitive species. . .
{60774}{60887}. . .so we'll need something primitive|for leverage. Like food.
{60897}{60963}What do you think a man-animal|would like to eat?
{60968}{61015}What would he consider a treat?
{61021}{61066}How the crap should I know?
{61086}{61123}There's no way of knowing that.
{61162}{61213}But before we educate it|on the machine. . .
{61218}{61298}. . .we'll take it to the mountains|with a couple of the others.
{61304}{61351}Let them think they've escaped. . .
{61364}{61444}. . .and then we'll sit back|and watch it choose its favorite food.
{61465}{61493}Yes.
{61969}{61995}Look!
{62199}{62285}Three days, and they still haven't|eaten anything yet.
{62291}{62351}Precisely. Now that|the man-animals feel. . .
{62358}{62407}. . .that they have|enough distance from us. . .
{62413}{62487}. . .soon they'll find|their favorite food and celebrate.
{62790}{62812}What is it?
{62819}{62852}Food. Food!
{63029}{63111}No spark, no flints, nothing.|You, Floyd?
{63117}{63174}Plenty to burn.|Nothing to start a fire with.
{63317}{63371}-That's their favorite.|-Of course it is.
{63377}{63451}-They could've selected anything.|-It's not cooked.
{63479}{63576}If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,|then our job is that much easier.
{63583}{63663}If they like their rat so much,|how come those two aren't eating?
{63668}{63775}Don't you know anything? The leader|of the pack always eats first. See?
{63949}{64015}We're really going to have|leverage over them now.
{64366}{64399}What are you doing?
{64653}{64690}They know about the camera.
{64695}{64738}Don't be a knot-head.|It's a man-animal.
{64749}{64798}It couldn't possibly know about it.
{64965}{65016}You sure called that one, sir.
{65021}{65064}No way they know about the cameras.
{65069}{65135}Move your fat ass|and let's go round them up!
{65164}{65193}Crap, lousy ceiling!
{65824}{65874}Great. This is great.
{66138}{66163}What do we do now?
{66169}{66239}What are you thinking, Jonnie?|Don't even think about it.
{66244}{66333}You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.|You wouldn't live the jump!
{66340}{66398}You can surrender and rot|in those cages.
{66404}{66453}That's your choice.|I'm not going back!
{66460}{66526}The monsters catch us,|they'll take us to the mines.
{66787}{66814}Run!
{67653}{67688}How do we know what he wants?
{67693}{67770}They made me do this before.|Follow me and you'll be fine.
{68031}{68075}Don't touch anything.
{68081}{68137}Get them mad,|think what they'll do to us.
{68787}{68867}Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .
{68873}{68904}. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .
{68957}{68990}. . .for I do not have the honor|to be a Psychlo.
{68997}{69030}I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
{69096}{69208}As you are listening to me,|I most likely do not exist. . .
{69214}{69311}. . .as we may have been exterminated|like many other races. . .
{69317}{69387}. . .by the gas drones|of our conquerors.
{69395}{69446}Please forgive my pretension. . .
{69452}{69529}. . .as I try to educate you|in Psychlo. . .
{69535}{69614}. . .the noble language|of our superiors.
{70620}{70648}You understand?
{70683}{70743}You understand me?
{70778}{70844}Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
{70935}{70990}Obviously, this is going|to take a while.
{71499}{71544}Jonnie! Jonnie!
{71611}{71665}Carlo! Carlo!
{71679}{71764}I know who they are and where they're|from. I can speak their language.
{71770}{71815}-Monsters?|-They're called Psychlos.
{71821}{71852}What did they do to him?
{71859}{71921}They made him look into a light,|a god machine.
{71927}{71980}It teaches.|It's a knowledge machine.
{71987}{72079}It sends pictures through your head|so fast, it's spinning.
{72086}{72126}Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
{72133}{72236}No, I can't. I have to stay.|I have to learn more about them.
{72263}{72332}This may be our only way out of here.
{72711}{72797}So this is the monster's language?
{72802}{72848}No, no. This is mathematics.
{72900}{72966}This is the unifying language|of the entire universe.
{73105}{73132}Look.
{73142}{73203}This symbol is called a triangle.
{73212}{73272}If all these sides are equal. . .
{73277}{73338}. . .then these three angles|must also be equal.
{73367}{73392}Equal to what?
{73407}{73435}To each other.
{73441}{73516}It's the basic foundation|of Euclidean geometry.
{73540}{73584}Seems pretty hard to understand.
{73597}{73676}No, only at first. And then it|becomes clear in your mind.
{73682}{73730}I learned molecular biology.
{73736}{73837}This is the symbol for water|and engineering.
{73851}{73961}See, a wing, see? And line|and form and artistic composition.
{73978}{74034}You see, this is a square,|like a cage.
{74039}{74143}I thought we were supposed to be|working on stuff to help us escape.
{74199}{74232}This will.
{74253}{74288}All this will.
{74650}{74716}Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
{74795}{74875}"The security chief should secure|the field vault. . .
{74880}{74953}. . .with an eight-digit|combination code. . .
{74974}{75059}. . .and do not use a personal|or employee. . .
{75064}{75097}. . .identification number. "
{75102}{75151}What's an identification number?
{75161}{75185}There.
{75190}{75236}-How many numbers is that?|-Eight.
{75244}{75268}Eight?
{75286}{75318}Eight.
{75515}{75559}It's more clever than that.
{75564}{75604}The question is, how clever?
{75615}{75660}Try the numbers backwards.
{76014}{76044}Look at this.
{76049}{76092}It's a recording machine.
{76268}{76315}This is how he watches us.
{77018}{77063}Stop! Chrissy, stop!
{77084}{77111}What if he's not dead?
{77116}{77183}Hope is an admirable quality,|but foolish isn't.
{77188}{77257}I can't give you permission|to go and get killed.
{77270}{77303}I don't need your permission.
{77370}{77414}I'm no longer a child.
{77795}{77836}Do you want lunch?
{78071}{78136}It's obviously too much|to ask a man-animal. . .
{78141}{78197}. . .to learn a language|as sophisticated as Psychlo.
{78202}{78280}What if it can understand|and it's pretending it can't?
{78285}{78336}-What the hell for?|-I don't know.
{78341}{78425}Maybe it's secretly listening,|trying to get leverage over on us.
{78437}{78522}Man-animal getting leverage over|a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
{78564}{78632}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{78637}{78679}Maybe we should train another one.
{78691}{78739}No time. When they detect the gold. . .
{78744}{78805}. . .the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{78899}{78967}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{79220}{79246}It speaks Psychlo.
{79251}{79291}Go on, say something else.
{79300}{79347}You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .
{79352}{79419}. . .while you, you go|and get a transporter.
{79439}{79507}Because you've learned Psychlo|doesn't mean you are one.
{79512}{79564}Follow my orders|or I'll have you killed.
{79647}{79693}How exactly do you plan to do that?
{79946}{79995}-Mickey, no!|-Mickey, no!
{80026}{80134}If any of you rat-brains|knew anything about firearms. . .
{80149}{80236}. . .you would know that you never|store loaded weapons.
{80241}{80274}You drop him now!
{80283}{80343}Drop him or I won't mine|an ounce of your gold.
{80363}{80446}I'll have you vaporized|and find someone else to mine it.
{80451}{80477}You don't have time.
{80487}{80543}You can't hide this|from Home Office forever.
{80591}{80687}A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.|That'll be the day.
{80836}{80949}I think it's time that we show|our little friend a thing or two.
{81592}{81647}As long as you cling to|the feeble hope. . .
{81652}{81698}. . .that you'll ever get|the better of me. . .
{81703}{81773}. . .you'll be distracted|from more important things.
{81778}{81824}Which is exactly why. . .
{81829}{81884}. . .I share the following with you:
{81920}{81964}When we attacked your planet. . .
{81985}{82080}. . .all your soldiers and all|their advanced technology. . .
{82089}{82141}. . .could only put up|a nine-minute fight. . .
{82146}{82194}. . .before they were exterminated.
{82217}{82307}Which is why man|is an endangered species.
{82348}{82412}Everything you humans knew is here.
{82417}{82467}You can look at anything you want. . .
{82487}{82556}. . .because there is nothing|that will help you.
{83359}{83390}Satisfied?
{83403}{83430}Yes.
{83449}{83523}I have one more demonstration|for you and your friends.
{83800}{83863}You will be relocated|to a new mining site.
{83868}{83939}If any of you get any bright ideas|about escaping. . .
{83944}{84045}. . .keep in mind that although you|know nothing about firearms, I do.
{84056}{84172}I graduated top marksman in my class.|I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
{84177}{84212}Tell them what I said.
{84217}{84260}We try to run, he'll kill us.
{84272}{84330}-That's it?|-Yes.
{84352}{84389}Allow me to demonstrate.
{84809}{84842}No! Wait!
{85256}{85313}Let's give this demon|what it deserves.
{85318}{85373}Kill it, I say! Destroy it!
{85378}{85427}Shoot! Shoot!
{85432}{85457}Why wait? Kill it!
{85463}{85498}Kill it. Then we'll run.
{85503}{85534}Then what?
{85542}{85629}What kind of life is it to run?|Living in fear of being hunted?
{85645}{85699}What about those we're leaving behind?
{85704}{85747}There's nothing we can do.
{85752}{85790}Only the gods can free them.
{85795}{85879}You think the lights in the sky|are gods waiting to save us?
{85885}{85993}Do you? Those are planets,|planets like this one.
{85998}{86046}The great villages were built by us.
{86062}{86110}By men and women just like us.
{86117}{86181}Willing to fight to the death|for one thing:
{86197}{86223}Their freedom!
{86228}{86288}Do you think no one has tried?
{86309}{86359}You can't defeat them.
{86480}{86538}That is our fate.
{86580}{86638}Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
{86652}{86689}But we have to go back.
{86694}{86749}We go back and learn|about their weapons.
{86770}{86838}Our race is slowly dying|and will be gone forever.
{86845}{86934}Let it be said that we took|this one chance and fought!
{86941}{87002}Are you with me? Are you with me?!
{87025}{87055}We fight!
{87091}{87166}If you're fighting the beast,|me and my men are with you.
{87171}{87244}Thank you.|It's good to have friends out here.
{87249}{87296}May the gods be with you.
{87437}{87509}One as wise as you has ways|to stop me from shooting.
{87518}{87587}I know if I'd tried,|you would've killed me first.
{87749}{87846}Damn right, rat-brain! That's the|first intelligent thing you've said.
{87878}{87926}Rest break is over.
{87940}{88028}There's something I need you to see|so you're properly motivated.
{88530}{88573}You don't know her?
{88610}{88668}No, I don't know her.
{88688}{88768}She's one of the foulest|looking females I've ever seen.
{88785}{88818}While I tend to agree. . .
{88837}{88942}. . .it's obvious that you show a lack|of aptitude for strategic deception.
{88947}{89056}On the other hand, what you show|marginal proficiency at is. . .
{89084}{89112}. . .drawing.
{89164}{89215}This was found when she was collected.
{89252}{89343}The collar has enough explosives|to remove her head from her body.
{89348}{89389}And this remote. . .
{89400}{89465}. . .will activate it|from anywhere on the planet.
{89470}{89547}So if you disobey me, let me|show you what will happen.
{89552}{89592}Please don't harm her.
{89616}{89645}I believe you.
{89650}{89707}Don't worry, rat-brain.
{89715}{89780}Every collar has its own frequency.
{89787}{89853}I'm not going to blow up|your little female friend.
{89905}{89937}Just. . .
{89987}{90014}. . .this one.
{90056}{90089}You made your point.
{90094}{90143}I said I would mine your gold.
{90159}{90202}Please don't kill him. Please.
{90300}{90328}Fine.
{90344}{90448}Due to our new working relationship,|I will grant you this one request.
{90486}{90521}I won't kill him.
{90537}{90600}But you may never ask of me|anything again.
{90613}{90641}I promise.
{90732}{90802}As I've said, I won't kill him.
{90807}{90832}Yes, sir.
{91263}{91303}Stupid humans.
{91966}{92009}No, no, no.
{92014}{92060}What you did was right.
{92072}{92110}It was right for all of us.
{92124}{92182}Greener, you're a thinker. . .
{92197}{92242}. . .and the gods respect thinkers.
{92255}{92299}You didn't kill Sammy.
{92320}{92385}Jonnie, this is not living.
{92403}{92455}This is. . .
{92474}{92494}. . .cages!
{92503}{92527}Cages!
{92532}{92616}Even if we escaped and went back|to where we all came from. . .
{92621}{92651}. . .it'd be like you said.
{92656}{92722}We'd be waiting for the Psychlos|to hunt us down.
{92734}{92809}I think that is not living either.
{92917}{92963}We all chose to fight.
{93582}{93646}-Count us in too!|-What's going on?
{93651}{93726}Someone knows how to speak|the Psychlo's language.
{93731}{93770}He's gonna help us fight.
{95111}{95153}Yes.
{95178}{95247}Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
{95271}{95327}She's. . . .
{95332}{95384}His soon-to-be|newly acquired secretary.
{95389}{95444}-Yes.|-Really?
{95453}{95545}She's stupid enough not to be a menace,|pretty enough to be decorative.
{95550}{95652}She gets drunk with economical speed|and has other advantages.
{95724}{95760}I can see that.
{95766}{95829}-Don't you have some work to do?|-No.
{95834}{95854}Ker?
{95860}{95893}All right, sir.
{95956}{95995}Now, listen, missy. . .
{96000}{96075}. . .I'm still waiting for|the Planetship's accounts.
{96144}{96222}I had to go way beyond|the call of duty to get these.
{96227}{96303}I see. Well, that's why|I especially chose you.
{96315}{96369}So you'll keep your side|of the bargain?
{96389}{96432}Which was?
{96440}{96529}You said we'd have a huge house|when we go back to Psychlo next year.
{96535}{96592}-We're going to be rich, right?|-Right.
{96602}{96690}I am going to make you|as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .
{96695}{96762}. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.
{97086}{97131}Well, isn't it interesting. . .
{97136}{97201}. . .that you have been keeping|two sets of books. . .
{97206}{97256}. . .and telling all the workers. . .
{97262}{97320}. . .that the planet has been|operating at a loss?
{97361}{97453}I only claimed that it was|running at a loss. . .
{97459}{97561}. . .to try and motivate them all|to work harder.
{97566}{97604}Oh, yes, of course.
{97614}{97667}And it had nothing to do|with the fact. . .
{97672}{97730}. . .that it allowed you|to cut the workers' pay. . .
{97736}{97811}. . .and keep all the extra credit|for yourself. Did it?
{97840}{97910}That. Well, I can explain that.
{97915}{98020}Well, unfortunately, the company|requires me to vaporize you.
{98061}{98086}On the other hand. . .
{98101}{98175}. . .I could understand someone|in your situation. . .
{98180}{98232}. . .being old and having no future. . .
{98238}{98309}. . .coming up with ways|to solve your financial problems.
{98338}{98401}-You can?|-Oh, yes.
{98409}{98469}It's really of no interest|to anybody. . .
{98474}{98531}. . .to have you not be Planetship.
{98537}{98634}But it would be prudent of you|to start to share your authority.
{98880}{98978}But these forms are|all blank, undated.
{98993}{99053}You could put anything|you wanted on them.
{99059}{99145}You would run the entire planet!
{99187}{99293}I would be nothing but a puppet.
{99309}{99372}Well, if you don't want|to do it that way. . .
{99377}{99428}. . .we could always do it by. . .
{99457}{99492}. . .the book.
{99645}{99744}What the hell does the Planetship|need with all this mining equipment?
{99749}{99792}That's not even the crazy part.
{99797}{99882}He's ordered me to take a group|of man-animals to a remote area. . .
{99887}{99966}. . .with the equipment to see|if they can be trained to mine.
{99971}{100048}Man-animals being able to mine?
{100053}{100082}Yes.
{100254}{100305}Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
{100319}{100348}Indeed.
{100353}{100393}But what can I do?
{100398}{100444}An order is an order.
{100562}{100612}You have a busy day, rat-brain.
{100617}{100655}First, learning how to fly. . .
{100661}{100734}. . .then on to the learning machine|for mining techniques.
{101448}{101475}Crash one more time. . .
{101480}{101559}. . .and your little friend|will no longer be among the living.
{101569}{101591}Again.
{101596}{101632}Again!
{102635}{102718}Never underestimate what a little|leverage can do, rat-brain.
{103366}{103398}That's good, man-animal.
{103413}{103490}This is the lever where|we mine the gold!
{103495}{103546}Lever! Up, down!
{103578}{103662}Warning: External sensors indicate|dangerous radiation levels ahead.
{103667}{103710}This is as far as I can go!
{103715}{103749}Land it!
{104102}{104140}Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
{104145}{104197}I want the ship's cage|half-filled with gold.
{104319}{104385}And even though I won't be|at the mining site. . .
{104440}{104470}. . .I'll be watching you.
{104721}{104793}-How's your side?|-It's good. Good.
{105096}{105138}Next time, you fly.
{105415}{105485}No, no, no.|Even if we do mine enough gold. . .
{105490}{105562}. . .we'll be lucky to fill|half of that cage in time.
{105567}{105597}That's why we're not mining.
{105602}{105687}What about the big uglies watching|us with that eye in the sky?
{105692}{105747}Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
{105752}{105811}We split them in half.|One group goes. . .
{105816}{105848}. . .and one group stays. . .
{105853}{105913}. . .and it looks as if|we're still working.
{105959}{106054}But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days|to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
{106060}{106113}There's a place called Fort Knox|where the gold's already been mined.
{106118}{106191}Listen, there will be no mining,|but we'll deliver it.
{106196}{106286}Okay, so we have to pretend|that we're mining the gold.
{106322}{106399}We have to figure out where|we're gonna get the gold. . .
{106404}{106465}. . .then we have to get the supplies|to help our revolt.
{106484}{106505}Yeah.
{106510}{106570}We barely have men to|do one of those things. . .
{106575}{106621}. . .Iet alone all three.
{106669}{106738}It's good to have friends|on the outside!
{107172}{107192}Come on!
{107197}{107265}If you two kept your eyes open,|that'd be a great help.
{107270}{107343}Look for an ocean. If you see any,|we've gone too far.
{107398}{107438}I think this is it.
{107443}{107486}I think we're in Washington.
{107491}{107555}-We're still in Colorado.|-That's impossible.
{107561}{107601}I've been watching,|we haven't crossed this line.
{107606}{107652}You're not paying attention.
{107658}{107747}Let him navigate and watch me.|You're gonna fly on the way back.
{107766}{107826}We couldn't have crossed|all these lines.
{107831}{107917}Well, we did. The lines must|have faded over time.
{108283}{108360}This great village was the capital|for all our tribes.
{108365}{108425}This is where our people's|history was buried.
{108675}{108746}Here. When the Psychlos|attacked Earth. . .
{108753}{108802}. . .they sent out flying gas drones.
{108808}{108895}Our ancestors must've made it out|into these remote radiated areas. . .
{108900}{108990}. . .and the only reason they survived|was because radiation is. . .
{108995}{109034}. . .Iethal to the Psychlos.
{109039}{109110}-And that was not good for them.|-That's good for us.
{109115}{109185}Even if we fail, the people|will be safe if they stay--
{109190}{109233}Safe from being hunted. . .
{109240}{109305}. . .but radiation is|also poisonous for humans.
{109328}{109370}So, you see, either way. . .
{109395}{109447}. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .
{109488}{109544}. . .the last of humanity|becomes extinct.
{110218}{110283}Based on what I've read about|Psychlo security. . .
{110288}{110317}. . .if we revolted. . .
{110322}{110401}. . .only using weapons they don't|perceive as any real threat. . .
{110406}{110466}. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .
{110471}{110546}. . .they'll just throw us|back in the cages.
{110551}{110580}But. . .
{110595}{110681}. . .we're gonna stage this revolt|inside the dome.
{110686}{110799}So the Psychlos are gonna have to|come inside the city to round us up.
{110814}{110887}And that is when we blow the dome.
{110915}{110955}Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
{110961}{111012}-They won't have masks.|-They can't breathe.
{111017}{111045}-They die.|-Carlo?
{111050}{111121}-I'm gonna blow the dome?|-You're gonna blow the dome.
{111159}{111234}Piece of cake.|Piece of cake, piece of cake.
{111323}{111386}But remember, as soon as|we blow the dome. . .
{111391}{111438}. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.
{111443}{111463}What is that?
{111468}{111545}Thousands of gas drones and troops|will be teleported here.
{111550}{111634}-We can't fight against that.|-Then what's the point?
{111639}{111719}If they send more monsters to Earth,|we get wiped out.
{111733}{111800}Well, the point is,|we don't let it get to stage 2.
{111805}{111867}We'll destroy their Home Planet|before it happens.
{111872}{111939}-Their Home Planet?|-Their Home Planet.
{111979}{112047}We need some extra supplies|before we can do that.
{112052}{112110}Our first stop is a radiation bomb|storage bunker.
{112115}{112172}Is everyone clear?
{112220}{112245}Count us in.
{112997}{113041}-Look.|-Flying machines.
{113046}{113124}These are flying machines.|They're weapons of some kind.
{113188}{113222}Flying spears.
{113230}{113284}I think there's a little more|to it than that.
{113705}{113747}It's a learning machine.
{113763}{113798}Teach us to fly.
{114251}{114277}You're right.
{114283}{114317}It's like breaking a horse.
{114335}{114387}Can you teach your men to fly this?
{114392}{114462}-Piece of cake, piece of cake.|-Piece of cake.
{114467}{114509}-Try and keep it level.|-Jonnie!
{114514}{114544}-What is it?|-I think I found one.
{114549}{114619}Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
{114624}{114656}Piece of cake.
{114681}{114743}According to the book, there's|a firing mechanism. . .
{114748}{114831}. . .that has to be in place before|it's operational.
{115324}{115367}Don't touch the auto-sensor.
{115372}{115409}What happens if we do?
{115414}{115480}The bomb will explode. Big fire.
{115518}{115566}Look. Greeners from this cave.
{115571}{115611}Off. Off.
{115992}{116013}War--
{116018}{116040}--ning.
{116045}{116087}Warning. Warning.
{116092}{116121}Warning.
{116143}{116189}Warning.
{116194}{116221}Get it?
{116348}{116410}What does the auto-sensor look like?
{116417}{116470}There's an illustration in Appendix A.
{116605}{116641}What? What?
{116730}{116765}We don't have Appendix A.
{116971}{116997}More books, Jonnie.
{117206}{117239}It's okay.
{117256}{117321}I thought you said nuclear fires|were powerful?
{117326}{117363}It's not nuclear. Mickey!
{117368}{117398}Sorry.
{117403}{117440}You're sorry. Mickey!
{117445}{117519}Stop touching things|and turn off the damn light.
{117524}{117548}Leave it on.
{117592}{117622}Look.
{117770}{117806}Good work, Mickey.
{117812}{117859}You just found Appendix A.
{118243}{118299}Will this be enough to blow up|their whole planet?
{118304}{118361}Radiation reacts with their|planet's atmosphere.
{118366}{118438}-There's enough to destroy it forever.|-Let me do it.
{118491}{118546}Let me go there|and detonate the weapon.
{118553}{118632}It's brave of you, Mickey,|but it's my plan, so I go.
{118637}{118711}You're the only one who speaks|the monsters' language.
{118716}{118764}You know things about them!
{118783}{118822}Listen. . .
{118827}{118892}. . .without you leading this revolt. . .
{118927}{118961}. . .we might not succeed.
{120203}{120289}I hope their eye in the sky didn't|see the gold through the lead walls.
{120741}{120794}Start filling the cage.
{120799}{120891}We'll hide half and deliver|the other half to Terl tonight.
{121368}{121405}Why is it in bars?
{121453}{121490}I assumed, sir. . .
{121495}{121591}. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement|wouldn't want raw ore.
{121689}{121721}Really?
{121998}{122049}Since you have had extra time. . .
{122054}{122104}. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .
{122109}{122173}. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold|in seven days.
{122885}{122945}He has no intention of sharing|that gold with you.
{122997}{123060}What the hell are you talking about?
{123090}{123158}Why are you here?|You should be mining the gold!
{123163}{123234}You really think the only reason|he made that recording. . .
{123239}{123313}. . .was to have you as his patsy?|Do you, Ker?
{123328}{123401}No. He has leverage over you. . .
{123406}{123469}. . .and it'll guarantee you|never see an ounce.
{123499}{123560}How do you know|about those recordings?
{123571}{123610}It really is amazing. . .
{123615}{123684}. . .the collection of discs|you find in Terl's personal vault.
{124060}{124083}First, we trade.
{124088}{124127}-The disc--|-I don't think so!
{124133}{124190}Because if you don't give me|the disc now. . .
{124195}{124236}. . .I will blow your head off.
{124733}{124771}You want to trade?
{124803}{124831}Let's trade.
{124862}{124892}Hooray!
{124947}{125004}Won't the Psychlo see|I'm not wearing the collar?
{125010}{125084}After tonight, won't matter|much either way.
{125116}{125181}Jonnie, I know you|don't believe in fate. . .
{125188}{125242}. . .but I've always known|this was your destiny.
{125251}{125323}This is our destiny.|It's freedom for all of us.
{125336}{125372}For our children.
{125406}{125437}Children?
{126017}{126047}Beautiful.
{126365}{126388}Quickly!
{126805}{126870}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{126875}{126935}There's no time.|When they detect the gold...
{126940}{127002}... the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{127111}{127190}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127234}{127329}When they detect the gold, the|Planetship will know what we're doing.
{127389}{127446}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127451}{127472}I've been thinking.
{127485}{127577}80/20 is a pretty fair|distribution of the gold.
{127594}{127636}But I should get the 80% .
{127655}{127737}And with my share, I'm gonna|fire all my wives. . .
{127743}{127778}. . .and buy new ones.
{127803}{127856}Maybe pretty ones this time.
{127885}{127912}Ker-bango!
{127967}{127995}Congratulations.
{128002}{128076}You've learned how to get|leverage over someone, haven't you?
{128095}{128168}Which means I haven't wasted my time|training you, have l?
{128187}{128233}-You're not upset?|-Don't be crazy.
{128242}{128290}You know how long I've waited|for this day?
{128296}{128347}I know the perfect way to celebrate.
{128396}{128451}What are you doing?
{128484}{128512}You can't shoot me.
{128517}{128591}I made a copy and gave it|to someone for safekeeping.
{128596}{128671}You are just too good of a teacher.
{128690}{128791}How about giving your old teacher|a clue as to who this might be?
{128796}{128846}You insult yourself, sir.
{128851}{128884}You taught me better.
{128889}{128942}How am I supposed to know who it is?
{128947}{128984}I don't know.
{128989}{129052}It could be anybody|on this damn planet.
{129058}{129106}-It could be a mechanic.|-No.
{129112}{129163}-It could be a concubine.|-No, no.
{129168}{129226}It could be anybody|in communications.
{129231}{129252}Wrong!
{129258}{129351}I hate these things. It's like|it's a test I'm not prepared for.
{129386}{129499}Well, hell, it could even be|our friendly bartender!
{129635}{129688}Please. I made a mistake.
{129805}{129860}Now, give me the original disc. . .
{129865}{129946}. . .then meet me at the teleportation|platform in two hours.
{129975}{130009}Sir.
{130260}{130298}The control bunker's to the right.
{130308}{130331}Three guards left.
{130339}{130408}Two from the guardhouse,|one coming from the north.
{130427}{130465}I'll take the guardhouse.
{132004}{132071}Jonnie, the shooting's|triggered the alarm.
{132089}{132172}Five guards from the south,|heavily armed and moving fast.

{134826}{134888}It's Carlo. What's going on?|Talk to me.
{134893}{134923}Hold on!
{134955}{135012}If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,|they'll send drones.

{139079}{139099}Here they are.
{139781}{139831}Panther!

{142379}{142417}I've gotta blow this dome now!
{142422}{142478}I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.|Hang on.
{142485}{142516}I'm seconds away.
{142828}{142853}Jonnie, come on.
{142859}{142902}They're destroying the bombs.
{142909}{142944}-It's now or never.|-Now!

{144147}{144200}Why isn't it coming down?
{144229}{144280}The dome is holding!
{144310}{144362}-It's not working.|-It's only cracked!

{147041}{147075}Help us!

{153276}{153331}I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
{153347}{153425}My life is over, but hers is|of no consequence to you.
{153451}{153531}Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.|Now, where is it?
{153536}{153591}Trust me, you don't want to do that.
{153597}{153654}Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
{156099}{156142}Carlo came through.
{157581}{157643}Why don't you vaporize me?
{157833}{157856}Leverage.
{157950}{158017}If there are other Psychlo|colonies out there. . .
{158022}{158091}. . .they'll send out gas drones|and exterminate us.

{159360}{159410}What kind of game are you playing?

{159647}{159678}Look at the bright side.
{159706}{159811}You may not be wallowing|in luxury on Psychlo. . .
{159864}{159929}. . .but at least you finally|got your gold.
{170626}{170651}English Subtitles by|SDI Media Group
I think about the day we met.
I suppose you would have arrived par avion.
Maybe you were the first to get to security.
You didn't intend to stay.
You only had 24-hour cover, so luggage a mano.
And they probably had a driver waiting... so you didn't need to find un coche.
You'd never been to Shanghai before.
It was all new to you.
How do people live out here?
It's not living. Just existing.
- You ever lived al fuera?
- No.
Can I have your papel, please?
Sherbet fountains, cigarettes, batteries, haircuts.
Who gets their hair cut at a checkpoint?
But I'm vite. I will show you.
- Give me a couple of sherbet fountains.
- Two sherbet fountains.
Get me in, mister.
I can do haircuts in there.
- I'm wasted out here.
- I've only got cover for myself.
- You got any spare cover?
- I only cover for one.
- Sorry.
- You want to swap places with me?
- You and me?
- I wear suit, you wear this.
It's tempting. Good luck.
What's your name?
- Nabil.
- All right. Bye.
I don't think it's a good idea to encourage them.
If people can't get cover, there's a reason.
You arrived in the morning, so the streets were deserted.
Did you call anyone?
Did you have a cerveza?
Sometimes I imagine you watching the news.
Sometimes playing a game.
Sometimes sleeping, preparing yourself for the night ahead.
The thing I can't imagine is that we hadn't met.
Hadn't even heard of each other.
That you thought it was going to be just another night.
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.
It was my birthday, which I hate.
Every year on my birthday I have a dream.
Always the same dream.
I go down into the subway,
I wait for the train.
I'm worried I'm going to be late.
The train leaves the station.
I feel like going to sleep, but there's someone I have to find.
And I have to find him before the train stops.
The train goes through one station.
There are 19 more to go.
I have to find him.
And then I wake up.
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.
The next year I had exactly the same dream.
Only this time I went past two stations.
Don't ask me how I knew. I just knew that there were 18 stations to go.
Next year, 17. Next year, 16.
Every birthday, one less.
Today's my birthday.
Today I'm down to the last one.
If I fall asleep,
I'll get to my destination.
If I want to, I can discover my fate tonight.
- Lo siento.
- That's okay.
So, what am I going to do?
I'm going to stay awake all day.
Who wants to discover their fate?
Who wants to take a chance like that?
- Hello.
- I'm here to see Mr. Backland.
I'll let him know you're here, he'll send someone along.
I'm here on an investigation, and I would find it useful... if I could wander around a little bit.
All visitors have to be accompanied, so if you'd like to wait over there.
- Someone will take you through.
- Let me do my job.
If I let you do yours, then I wouldn't be doing mine, would I?
That is a conundrum.
If I could figure out your password, your palabra...
You couldn't do it.
I just need to know one piece of information.
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No. It could be anything. Just one thing.
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.
My birthday. My palabra's not my birthday. Vingt-neuf.
Your palabra is "carrefour."
- Crossroad. Carrefour.
- Wait. How did you know that?
- Can I register now?
- How did you know my palabra?
I listened to you while you weren't speaking.
- Don't worry about it.
- I could get into trouble doing this.
I'm just gonna go straight to his office, that's all I'm gonna do.
Don't worry about it.
- William Geld, salaam.
- Mr. Backland.
You caught me off guard.
I was going to come down and greet you properly.
I guess that's one of your skills.
Cunning.
I have no cunning I'm afraid.
- This is your first visit?
- Yes.
Will you have time to see the mammoth?
We specialize in short-term cover certificates.
We do limited cover pour specific tasks.
Maybe a parachute jump, maybe a medical procedure.
People only buy fakes if we won't grant legitimate cover.
If we won't grant legitimate cover, believe me, there's a reason.
The Sphinx knows best.
Fake cover is a ticket to avoidable suffering.
I worry about them, you know.
We know which printer the fakes come from.
Every printer has its own fingerprint.
This one is from our number 8 printer.
Only a few people are cleared to use it.
It has to be one of them.
All I need is a nice quiet room and some time... and I'll have this cleared up for you by this evening.
It's a happy workplace.
I don't want to create an atmosphere.
I don't want anyone to know what's going on.
Tell them what you like.
Tell them I'm the tooth fairy.
Tell me something about yourself, anything at all.
I was born in Nampally Road, Hyderabad.
- Tell me something about yourself.
- Anything?
Try to make it interesting,
I've got a long day ahead of me.
I have una cosa about freckles.
A sexual cosa.
I find freckles a turn-on.
Freckled skin, it's like it's clothed and not clothed.
There's no freckle pornography.
Women get famous for breasts and legs, but not for freckles.
There's Anne of Green Gables.
I regard Anne of Green Gables as an erotic classic.
Normans. Amazing.
They invented the whole English language out of nothing but French.
And some Latin, obviously.
Yeah, obviously.
There's a girl here, Maria.
She's tone-deaf.
She can't hold a tune to save her life.
That's beautiful, don't you think?
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking, "Have we met before?"
Upstairs, the foyer, we almost bumped into each other.
I feel I know you.
Come on. One thing about yourself.
I'm not sure I want you to know something about me.
Anyway, I can never think of anything when people ask me straight out comme ça.
You want to prompt me?
- It won't work if I prompt you.
- What won't work?
Tell me what you're doing later tonight.
- Is that a question or an invitation?
- It's a prompt.
Tonight, I am going to stay awake... until the sun goes down.
I'm not going to sleep.
Pourquoi?
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
I'm gonna need to take your information for future reference.
It's difficult.
When you can get a big dinero for a piece of paper... it's a big temptation.
Are you sure it's him?
- I thought it might be her.
- I don't think so.
Do you have evidence?
I don't need to give you evidence.
It's intuition you're paying for.
You okay?
Bueno. Absolutely.
- Am I under surveillance?
- No.
So what? Do you wanna go out with me?
It's your birthday.
Don't you have other plans?
I have to meet someone later, but I'm hungry.
- Let's go and eat.
- All right.
I was never scared of you.
Even when I should have been.
Even though my fate was in your hands,
I always trusted you.
Why did you do it?
For the money. Why did you do it?
- What?
- Lie for me.
I don't know.
It's very impulsive.
I can be impulsive.
- Happy birthday.
- I love these.
How did you know? Is that on my file?
- Lucky guess.
- Fate.
Actually, I have a whole bag full of them.
For my kid.
- You have a kid?
- Yeah.
- Chico or chica?
- Chico.
Jim. His name is Jim.
I bet he's very special.
He is special.
Everybody's children are so special.
It makes you wonder where all the ordinary grown-ups come from.
These are good.
You wanna come to a club?
Don't you have to meet someone?
- Come. I want you to.
- Why?
Because I want to corrupt you.
If you come, there's a definite risk that you'll have a good time.
And if you don't come with me, then you'll regret it.
Come on.
Come on.
- Drink?
- Vodka, rocks, please.
- Would you like to sing?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- No. I'm sure.
You don't wanna hear me sing.
- I was actually hoping to hear you sing.
- Why?
Someone told me that you have a very distinctive voice.
What else did they say about me behind my back?
You can take a virus to make you more musical.
Gives you perfect pitch.
You sing like an angel.
I tried a virus once for Mandarin Chinese.
Chinese people knew what I was saying, but I didn't.
It was weird. I didn't like it.
I'm on a virus right now, an empathy virus.
I take an empathy virus to help with my work.
I don't like that, that's weird.
That's like you could pick up...
- all sorts of stuff about me.
- Yeah, I can.
That's like wearing x-ray specs to look at girls' underwear.
- I bought x-ray specs, they don't work.
- But you bought them?
- Yeah.
- You wanted them to work.
I was 6 years old. I was interested in skeletons, not underwear.
I thought you were a natural intuitive hombre.
Would it make any difference?
- Claro.
- Really?
- Maria.
- Damian. Hello.
William, Damian. Damian, William.
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go
Hi.
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here till the end of time
William is helping me celebrate my birthday.
- It's your birthday?
- Yeah.
- I didn't know.
- That's okay.
William is okay.
William knows about our secret.
That's the one that will take me.
You should kiss William, too, because he helped.
If I go there will be trouble
Tell him what you're going to do with it.
I'm a naturalist. I study bats.
The finest quality of bats in this world is in this cave in Delhi.
I wanted to see that since I was a kid.
You couldn't get cover in the normal way?
I have tried for eight years.
And only now am I going.
Usually if you can't get cover, there's a good reason.
Yes, "The Sphinx knows...
- "best."
- "Best."
- The Sphinx knows a lot.
- Doesn't know what I know.
Some things in life can be worth the risk.
Anyone who has ever wanted something knows... you have to be prepared to take a risk to get it.
I think I'll be okay.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
If I go there will be trouble
Why did you do that?
- What?
- All that, in front of me.
You know what I should do?
Arrange to have his cover withdrawn... and I should put him al fuera and you, too.
But you're not going to, though. Are you?
Why are you being so nice to me?
Are you hoping for a reward?
How do you get the papeles out?
At the beginning of every new batch we do a test run.
Then we destroy the papel.
I go in to work and I have a fake papel under my tongue.
I destroy the fake one and put the real papel under my tongue.
I then go to the bathroom, put the papel into a pill, swallow it.
A couple of days later, I have the papel.
Impressed?
Come on, be impressed.
Thank you for bringing me home.
It's very kind of you.
Come in.
Beautiful. You have green fingers.
Everything is controlled scientifically.
Do you think that sunlight is as dangerous as they say?
I hope not.
- Would you like a drink? A glass of water?
- Sure.
One of my fingers is younger than the others.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Which one?
- This one.
Do you like it?
Very much.
It's much better than the other fingers.
Definitely.
Maybe I should get them to grow me a younger face.
No.
I love the sorrows of your changing face.
Or whatever it is.
I haven't seen this book in a while.
"In a friend one should have one's best enemy...
"and you should be closest to him when you resist him."
Look.
It's all I've got left from my childhood.
I keep my special memories here.
- Who are they?
- My father and mother.
Before we left Shanghai.
These are people like Damian, when I give them the papeles.
Now you know all my secrets.
I love to look at their faces.
They're so beautiful.
Look at their eyes.
They have a look that the rest of us don't have.
You look like them un poco.
You should go to sleep.
I don't want to go to sleep.
Please don't let me sleep.
I'll make you some coffee.
Coffee.
Said I remember
When we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
And Georgie would make the firelight
Logwood burning through the night
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
I was just gonna torture the song and now you're murdering it.
I'm tone-deaf.
You find that attractive?
Are you leaving?
I'm booked on a flight home.
- What time's your flight?
What will happen to Bikku?
He'll lose his cover.
That's bad.
I know it's bad.
You giving out fake papers is bad.
Me letting you off is bad.
Have you ever lived outside?
I was outside for 10 years.
Lo siento.
I have to go.
- I need to stop at the entry checkpoint.
- Why?
I need to get more sherbet fountains.
Hi, mister.
I found this.
I thought you could put it to good use.
Thank you. Gracias. God bless you. Go.
Sorry.
Leave him alone. Thank you, God bless you.
If we had enough information... we could predict the consequences of our actions.
Would you want to know?
If you kiss that girl, if you talk to that man... if you take that job or marry that woman or steal that papel?
If we knew what would happen in the end... would we ever be able to take the first step, to make the first move?
Hello, I'm home.
- Did you have a good trip?
- It went all right.
Daddy! Where have you been?
They'd be pleased to see you.
Your wife, your special boy.
They'd want to know all your news... and will be glad to have you home, safe and sound.
- Want me to guess what you're thinking?
- Yeah.
- Bicycle.
- Sí.
I can't answer right now, so leave a message.
It's William, call me.
Just to let me know you're okay.
Bye.
- Are you tired?
- Yeah.
Did you think about me at all?
Did you try to imagine what was happening to me?
Does an empathy virus work long-distance?
Maria Gonzalez, age 25.
Employee of the Sphinx.
Nurture father: Christian Gunter.
Born in Freeport of Jebel Ali.
Transferred to Shanghai.
He was exiled for financial irregularities.
Recorded in Kunming, Dhanbad...
Quetta and Baghdad.
Presumed to be returning to the Freeport of Jebel Ali.
Carmen Gonzalez returned to Shanghai.
Remarried to...
Maria Gonzalez.
Height: 165 cms.
Buenos días.
De Souza wants to talk to you.
- What about?
- There's been a fatality in Asia.
A guy was traveling on one of the papers from Shanghai.
- She's waiting. You want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Hello.
- Someone died yesterday.
I heard. Do you have details?
Hombre had una cosa about bats, wanted to go to Delhi.
The place to be if you like bats, apparently.
Couldn't get cover because he had an ineluctable disposition to Ward's Disease.
Do you know it?
- No.
- It makes you bleed to death.
Most people in Delhi are immune, which is why... this hombre couldn't get cover, which is why he bought fake papeles... which is why he bled to death yesterday.
- What was his name?
- Alekan. Damian Alekan.
The papeles come from the same printer as the ones you investigated.
I'm sorry.
Get back, make it right, then you won't have to be sorry anymore.
- Is there someone else you can send?
- Why would you want me to do that?
I had some trouble when I was there.
Some trouble with the virus, I think.
We all have problems, William.
How we deal with them is a measure of our worth.
Go back tomorrow.
Damian Alekan.
- Where did you get that? Someone gave it...
- I have to go back to Shanghai.
How long will you be away?
I have a 24-hour cover.
I'll be back before you know I've gone.
Messed it all up.
Welcome, sir.
Three more forged papeles reported.
One here, one in Sao Paolo, one in Delhi.
If this doesn't stop,
I could lose my own cover.
Lo siento, it's the first time my intuition has let me down.
I think he had an accomplice.
There was a woman here last time...
- Maria Gonzalez.
- She's gone.
What do you mean gone? Disappeared?
I was told she had a body issue.
It was all official.
Maria?
Video Listo Corporation.
Hello. I just tried to get in my apartment and the video listo no funciona.
We have your number listed as temporarily descontinuado.
Do I look descontinuado to you?
No, señor, but then I don't know that you're the holder.
- That's not my problem, is it?
- If you can give me your palabra...
I can provide you with a 10-minute window to recode your video listo.
- How would that be?
- That would be great, thank you.
- Palabra, sir?
- Panoply.
Did you know what you were looking for?
Or were you hoping I had left you a clue?
Like Hansel and Gretel being dragged off into the woods.
Panoply.
Maria, today you have no appointments.
Maria, today you have a 3:15 appointment at the Mai Lin Clinic.
I'm investigating a fraud to which Maria Gonzalez is a key witness.
I was officially informed that she has some body issues... and was on a happiness break.
She has been relocated.
There were complications that we couldn't deal with.
She has been sent outside.
Outside is a big place, it would help if you were more specific.
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.
What was the nature of her body issue?
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.
Why was she summoned for a happiness break?
Is this a training exercise?
- Are you trying to catch me out?
- You got me.
- You didn't get me, though.
- You are top of the class.
Very good. Tell me something about yourself, anything.
For the report. I have to write this up.
My mother had this job before me.
I inherited it.
How long has Miss Gonzalez been pregnant?
I never said that.
What type of Code 46 violation was it?
I never mentioned Code 46.
Where is the Mai Lin Clinic?
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.
Thank you for your help.
You rented a car. The clinic was al fuera.
170 K outside the city.
I imagine you like a medieval knight on a quest.
A quest for me.
I'm here to see Maria Gonzalez.
Lo siento, no visitors are permitted until 6:00.
I'm from Westerfields.
She's a key witness in a major fraud case.
- Nombre?
- Maria Gonzalez.
- Tu nombre?
- William Geld. I'm with Westerfields.
I need your print here.
It's a very urgent situation.
I know. Nombre and print.
I can tell by looking at you that you are not just... a keypad presser.
You can make judgments.
Sí, and I have made my judgment about you.
If you don't have authorization for this place...
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.
Okay.
I'm tired.
I have conversations like this one a lot.
Is that enough?
If I were able to guess your palabra, would you be impressed?
I would be dumbfounded.
- It's "Garamond."
- No, it's not. It's nothing like that.
Did you have an empathy virus?
It doesn't work here.
That's why you've got a cold. Here.
We use antiviral bacteria.
The institute is infested with streptococci.
You know, here on the outside... we do not have access to some of the pleasures... that are so freely available on the inside.
I have these.
- The gold ones are particularly bueno.
- I don't need wealth.
I just need a little encouragement.
You have a very sophisticated security system here.
Claro. We have all categories of cases here.
What is Maria Gonzalez here for?
You're investigating her case, n'est-ce pas?
I'm investigating a fraud case.
She's a witness.
She's had a finger-graft.
Maria Gonzalez?
Take a seat.
- You okay?
- I'm good.
If this is about my finger, then I don't want to prosecute.
This is not about your finger.
I need to speak to Miss Gonzalez alone.
You have no authorization.
Okay.
I'm investigating an incident at your place of work.
Fraudulent papeles issued from your printer.
In the last 14 days, three people have died... while traveling from papeles... issued from your printer at the Sphinx.
The people who come to us, they're all doing something dangerous.
You have to expect that, unfortunately, some of them won't make it.
One of them...
Damian Alekan, bled to death.
He was fond of bats. Remember him?
No.
Damian Alekan? You met him at a bar.
You sold him a papel which allowed him to go to Delhi.
- When did he die?
- A week ago.
I've been in here for 10 days.
All of the papeles were issued prior to your arriving here.
I'm tired. I would like to rest.
Miss Gonzalez is still in recovery.
Why is she in here?
And, please, do not use the word "finger" at any point in your answer.
- Her finger...
- Was damaged and regrown... on her family's insurance policy
22 years ago.
I know a great deal about Miss Gonzalez.
For instance, that she was pregnant when she came in here.
I also know, because you told me so yourself... that you have no interest in impeding my investigation.
She violated Code 46.
We've terminated the pregnancy... and taken out the memory cluster immediately around it.
- The baby was terminated?
- There was no baby.
Just a pregnancy which is now terminated and the memories removed.
You've interfered... with the memory of a key witness in an insurance fraud.
The memories were very local.
It's just the man, the sex act, and the pregnancy.
She doesn't remember the man at all?
The man, the sex, the pregnancy.
We've erased all of them.
Apart from that, it's the same Maria Gonzalez.
The finger is a placebo memory.
I moved it from her childhood.
I think it's very effective.
When will she be able to leave?
She's due to leave tomorrow.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to release her to me now.
Can you miss someone you don't remember?
Can one moment or experience ever disappear completely?
Or does it always exist somewhere, waiting to be discovered?
- Wait, I've forgotten something.
- What?
- A valise. It's very important to me.
- It's in the back. Voilà.
Is that what you're going to do?
Put me al fuera with them?
You've been outside before.
Spent 10 years al fuera.
Didn't come back inside till you were 14.
You really did your homework.
You can't sing, you like sherbet fountains, you like to grow real plants from seed.
God, I must have been your favorite subject at school.
You hate the desert.
I always hated the desert.
Even at college, studying the Roadrunner cartoons...
I had to look away.
I've always wondered why the coyote didn't just go out and buy a roadrunner.
If he had enough money for rocket-powered roller skates... he had enough money to buy a roadrunner.
How did you do that?
What?
I was thinking something and you heard me.
That is weird.
Intuition.
I can feel what you're thinking.
I don't believe in mind-reading.
I think it is all a trick.
It's not a trick. It is a gift.
What am I thinking now?
You're thinking of Damian Alekan.
- Have you been here before?
- Once.
You like it?
I was only here a day.
But, yes, I liked it very much.
Excuse the mess.
Come here.
Sit down.
That's Damian.
Recognize him now?
I remember he wanted to go to Delhi.
And I remember the look on his face when I gave him the papel.
He tried for years to get one officially and he couldn't get one.
I was there when you met Damian.
I was with you in the bar.
I don't understand.
You don't remember because they erased your memory.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I came to Shanghai to investigate a fraud.
I knew you were guilty.
But then I fell in love with you.
Why would they erase my memory of you?
I don't know.
My cosa. Where's my cosa?
- I can't find my cosa.
- Come here. You haven't lost anything.
Calm down.
- I can't find my cosa.
- It's okay.
I don't know where my cosa is.
Will you stay with me?
- I'm so tired.
- I'll stay with you until you wake up.
- What is it?
- It'll help you sleep.
- I don't understand anything.
- I don't understand anything either.
My father used to tell me stories as I fell asleep.
Stories about Jebel Ali and the Arabian Sea.
Stories of magic and adventure.
He used to live there... and believed that if we could return, everything would be all right.
Everything would be like it used to be before we were exiled.
And in my dreams I was there.
Sample, please.
Thank you.
I'm pleased to tell you that
I've screened both your sets of genes... and there are no Code 46 issues.
It is perfectly safe for you to marry.
In fact, I'd recommend it.
You both have the code for high intelligence.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
Do you know this woman?
I'm looking for her.
You must have found her, hombre, if you have her hair.
It was given to me by relatives.
- What's your relationship to this woman?
- I just want to know about her.
You can't liaise with her.
See this? This is your DNA.
A 50% match with the hair samples.
And here... is the DNA of your mother.
A 100% match. Genetically identical.
Any liaison with this woman would be a Code 46 violation.
- How can that be?
- Anything's possible in vitro.
Your mother was one of a batch of 24 cloned fetuses.
This hair is from your mother or one of her genetic twins.
- This woman is identical to my mother?
- No.
Diet... climate, environment, accident... surgery, the stars, God.
We aren't prisoners of our genes.
Is this hair from your mother?
No.
- Are you in love with this woman?
- Why?
- Is she pregnant?
- No.
- Were you naturally conceived?
- In vitro.
Your nurture parents will have your records, if that's any help.
They're dead.
I'm sorry.
If we're frightened, we run.
It's our instinct.
Adrenalin pumps round the body, the muscles contract... our heart beats faster, and we run.
We run for our lives.
We run for safety... for our home, our families, our loved ones.
Sylvie.
You're driving.
I don't want you to drive and call.
I'm on my way to the airport.
I'll be home tomorrow.
- Catch the bad guy?
- Every time.
William, I love you.
I love you, too.
Daddy? Hello. How are you?
- Love you.
- Me you.
See you later.
Hi. I need a ticket to Seattle.
It's completely red, sir.
It's out of date.
See? You're not covered for the Asea area.
But I don't wanna be here.
I wanna leave, I wanna go home.
- I'm covered for home, right?
- I really don't know, sir.
I am covered for home.
But you're not at home, sir.
You're aquí in Shanghai without cover.
I got an idea. Why don't we just kick me out in the general direction of home?
You can't fly uncovered, sir.
You can't be in the Asea area without cover.
What am I gonna do, piss out the window at 60,000 feet?
I really wouldn't know enough about your character to say, sir.
Maybe I can guess something about your character.
These are particularly fun.
I'm afraid you guessed wrong, sir.
I'm a Christian scientist.
I don't believe in drugs or coffee.
Damn.
I'm all out of Bibles.
Can I come in?
Can I stop you?
I need your help.
Where have you been?
Lo siento. I had something to do.
I shouldn't be in Shanghai.
I should be in Seattle.
You knew that last night.
- I have to go.
- So go.
I can't.
My papel was red. I can't get out.
You tried already?
You were just going to disappear.
You say that too much.
I need to go home.
- You've got a family.
- Sí.
- Chico or chica?
- Chico.
He must think you're a real hero for catching bad guys like me.
Something like that.
Well, you know what they say:
"The Sphinx knows best."
Maybe there's a reason you can't go home.
It's a fake, okay?
I have to swap it for a genuine papel.
I'll meet you at the airport at 7:00, okay?
Come on.
My name is Maria Gonzalez and I have an access problem.
I have a new finger and it needs to be recoded.
- Just hold on a moment, please?
- Gracias.
- Buenos días.
- Bueno. So good to see you.
I have an access problem.
I have a new finger and I need it to be recoded.
I know. You've been relocated.
- Sorry?
- You have been relocated.
You will work here now.
Why don't you come inside?
- William, where are you?
- Still in Shanghai.
Isn't your cover out?
- I've extended it.
- No, you haven't.
- Where is Maria Gonzalez?
- No lo sé.
Why did you remove her from Mai Lin Clinic without authorization?
- She was a suspect.
- Was?
Is.
You seem upset, William.
Report to the Shanghai office, today.
They will take over the case.
Get me whatever you can, but get it today, yeah?
It's a single exit cover.
Valid for today only.
Seattle flights leave from Zone C.
I do remember you.
From a dream.
From my birthday dream.
You should go home.
No.
Two for Jebel Ali.
- Which flight, sir?
- Next flight.
Do you have cover?
I'm resident here.
Sorry, I forgot. It's my new finger.
Okay. Thanks for choosing
Pan Worldwide Airways.
Have a safe journey.
I'd always dreamt of Jebel Ali.
The Jebel Ali of my father's stories.
He told me you could do anything there, as long as you wanted it enough.
You know what?
Every time I ever imagined this,
I always imagined being with you.
Even though we'd never met.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We're looking for a place to stay.
Come, we are going, come.
You've never been al fuera.
So I could be your guide, your teacher.
Three pakoras.
We're looking for a room. We have cover.
No one has cover for over here.
You can't buy cover for here.
- Residents sleep at their own risk.
- But we can have a room?
A room, food, a game of chess.
There's a shower through there.
You're covered in dust.
It will be noisy, lo siento.
That doesn't matter.
We'll sleep through anything.
We're so tired.
- Have you come a long way?
- Yes.
My wife made that.
Before she passed on.
Maybe think about her un poco before you sleep.
Pleasure to have you.
Will you put this on?
- Does your wife look like you?
- No.
How did you meet?
We worked together until we had Jim.
You must miss him.
Yes.
Sing.
What?
I want to hear you sing.
I can't sing.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's not your fault.
It's viral.
The Sphinx... gave you a virus.
What, like an anti-William virus?
It's involuntary. It's like adrenaline.
When you're... scared of something, your body gets ready to run away.
I'm not scared of you.
I know. But your body is.
I want you to make love to me.
Make me make love to you.
I love you.
You must have known the way the virus works.
Was there nothing you could do to stop me?
I need to make a call.
- All calls are logged.
- That's okay.
- Phone is là-bas.
- Gracias.
My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I'm reporting a Code 46 violation.
Gracias. What is your location?
- What is this address?
- 168 Shada Perrera.
- Please wait there.
- I'll be right here.
Wake up.
Come on.
- We have to go.
- No, I want to stay here forever.
See? I can kiss you now.
We have to go. Come on.
- Something's happened.
- Okay.
We need a car. Can you help?
Cars are expensive here.
Even more than in the city.
I've got these.
I need money. People have to eat.
That's all I've got.
Not enough.
Hey, Sono, take them to the sierat shop.
Tell Farrukh to give them a Padmini.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I love you.
Okay, all right.
That's enough playing now. Stop.
You went before a tribunal.
They decided the empathy virus had affected your judgment.
So they took away your memory of me.
Just like they had wiped my memory of you.
What does he remember about the crash?
He knows he went to Shanghai.
He solved the case.
On the way to the airport, he crashed the hired car.
As far as he's concerned, he never went to Jebel Ali.
- I'll leave you alone.
- Thank you.
I've missed you.
Me, too.
It's good to see you.
I've brought you some clothes.
Daddy!
Where have you been?
Daddy did a silly thing.
I crashed a car but the doctors fixed him up real good.
What am I thinking?
I don't know.
Boats. I'm thinking about boats.
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream
I was exiled because I tried to cheat the Sphinx.
They left me my memories.
They don't care what you think if you're al fuera.
Why bother?
To them, it's as though we don't exist.
Feels good.
I miss you.
They have this All Bird TV.
You seen it?
No.
- Sure, it's All Bird TV.
I'm giving them a plug.
It's all birds. I watch it with the cat, the cat, fixated by it.
Damn it!
Damn it.
I am a goddamn genius.
Oh, my God.
Sebastian, do you have any idea what time it is?
Da Vinci never slept.
Said it was a waste of time.
Who's that?
Not your business.
Not anymore.
Linda...
... I cracked the reversion.
You cracked it?
Look at this.
Watch.
Eleven months and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How?
The usual. Coffee and Twinkies.
I hate you.
Can you find Matt and get to the lab?
I want Isabelle for a live test.
I think I can find him.
When will you be in?
Well, it should be daylight in Sweden now.
So I should call the Nobel committee and tell them to get our prize ready.
I'll see you in a few.
Matt.
Sebastian called.
We gotta get to the lab.
What's the rush?
He cracked reversion.
You're kidding.
When?
- While we were sleeping.
You want a ride?
Maybe we should take our own cars.
I'm tired of this sneaking around, Lin.
You're gonna have to tell him eventually.
I will, eventually.
I'm just waiting for the right time.
With Sebastian, there's never gonna be a right time.
Morning, Dr. Caine.
- Morning.
Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Ed.
Your team's in early today.
Something special?
Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.
Authorization, please.
- Caine, 0027.
Confirmed.
Hi.
Isabelle.
Come on, Isabelle.
Calm down, baby.
Good girl.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hold still.
Isabelle?
She's more aggressive these days.
That's what tranquillizers are for.
I'll get her.
She's been gone too long.
It's starting to affect her brain.
You take care of that bite.
- I'll manage.
Hey.
Ten bucks says I nail her first.
You're on.
Isabelle?
Got a surprise for you.
You missed.
Maybe because I don't spend my lunch hours practicing.
You owe me ten.
Put it on my tab.
You know, someday I may actually make you pay up.
Sarah's on the warpath, so you play nice.
This is bullshit, Sebastian.
- And good morning to you too.
Get the monkey on the table.
How can you justify injecting Isabelle with the serum without even testing it?
Because it'll save time.
Then you can mop up afterwards.
You think I'm trying to kill Isabelle?
Kill? More like liquefy.
- Lab's prepped.
Well, your objections are duly noted and summarily overruled.
Yes, sir.
How come when you say, 'Yes, sir,' it sounds like 'Fuck you'?
Practice.
How'd you convince me to hire her?
You wanted the best vet in the U.S.
She cares more about the animals.
- And maybe that's why she's so good.
So this guy you're seeing, what's he like?
He's everything you're not.
He must be dull.
Ready in 40.
- Okay.
Vitals?
All normal.
Using the word 'normal' loosely, of course.
Emergency medical, standing by.
- Tech, status?
This is God.
You are disturbing the natural order of things...
... and will be severely punished for all eternity.
God has spoken.
How many times must
I tell you, Frank...
...you're not God.
I am.
Sorry, chief. Forgot.
You guys ready to roll yet?
Yes.
Like those sorry-ass M.D. S have ever had to wait for us.
Tell His Highness
Mary was hot two hours ago.
Yeah, I'll tell him that.
Ready up here, chief.
- Roll and record.
Rolling.
Subject, Isabelle Two.
Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.
Testing D-phase protocol...
...Serial Irradiated Protein Caine 125.
Stop naming them after yourself, you'd have better luck.
Thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen observation.
I'll include it in my memoirs.
I'll make sure to put you in mine.
Would you guys be serious, please?
You think she'll make it?
- I don't know, I just work here.
Quantum signatures are calibrated.
Okay, Sarah, get us a vein.
Spray.
Vein's prepped.
All right.
Here goes nothing.
Bad form, Matthew.
The honor is mine.
Okay.
Injection occurred at 0847.
Elevated heartbeat.
We're still in the green.
- Confirmed.
Bioelectric energy and quantum shift indicators are stable.
We're getting cellular reaction.
It's working. It's actually working.
Of course it is.
- Don't get cocky.
Heart rate's up. She's scared.
It's okay.
Subject began manifesting immediately. Protocol's acting quickly.
Goddamn it, blood pressure crashing.
Pulse high.
It's her heart.
I got erratic heartbeat and brain activity.
She's going into cardiac arrest.
- Defib!
Prep an intracardiac.
Flatline. We're losing her.
- No, we're not. Hit her!
Clear!
Again.
- Clear.
Again!
- Clear.
Come on.
- Again!
Clear!
Fuck! Intracardiac.
Wait! No, we got something.
Still erratic...
...and stabilizing.
Oh, man.
Brain activity returning to normal.
Quantum signatures are stable.
Welcome back, Isabelle.
Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
We did it.
- Good work, everyone.
Yeah! That's the way it's done, man.
So how's she doing, doc?
Well, I think she's gonna be okay.
Come on. Right in there.
- Come on, Isabelle.
Go ahead. Good girl.
Look how peaceful she is.
It seems like nothing happened to her.
Schedule a vivisection for Monday.
I wanna check her neuropathways.
You just brought her back and you're gonna slice up her brain?
I'm not running a goddamn zoo!
You're a fucking unethical bastard.
- Tell her you're kidding.
Right?
- Right.
I won't cut her for another week.
Don't be such an asshole.
We finally have something to celebrate.
Cool. I'm hungry, let's go.
- Me too.
We should cut you up.
Ladies and gentlemen, a moment of your time, please.
Here it comes.
To the finest research team
I have ever known.
Cheers.
Cheers.
There was a big explosion, and afterward she said:
'lf you're so smart, how come you're still in the second grade? '
She grew her eyebrows back?
- In a month.
How long were you suspended?
- A month.
Hey, I thought you'd gone.
There's nowhere to go.
Did I miss something?
Aren't you supposed to be happy?
Reversion was the last breakthrough.
Feels like the beginning of the end.
That's not true.
We've got a lifetime of data.
Matt has the patience to crunch the numbers, but you know me...
...I need this grandeur and the spectacle.
I can't concern myself with the details.
Yeah, I know. I was one of them.
I thought we were great together.
You were great.
I was just standing next to you.
Come on. We had some good times.
Yeah, we had some good times.
Have you ever wanted to turn the clock back?
Go back and try again?
I'd say that kind of time travel doesn't exist.
Well, maybe we should invent it.
Or not.
What's it like?
Four years ago, this committee gave me...
...a very specific and challenging task...
...to phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync...
...with the visible universe...
...and return him safely with no aftereffects.
We found that sending them to never-never land was easy.
It's the getting them back that's hard.
Primary DNA strands decaying on you?
Along with cellular bond instability.
How have you solved the problem?
I haven't.
But we're close.
We just need more time.
Ever since you walked in my class your freshman year...
...I knew you were different.
Over the years, your genius has been most impressive.
Thank you, Dr. Kramer.
Well, don't thank me yet.
This committee has given you remarkable leeway.
We've tolerated your eccentricities, as well as your need for privacy.
And I assure you, our patience is running out.
If we don't get results and get them soon...
...your genius will cease to impress me.
And if you can't make it work...
...I'll find another
Sebastian Caine who can.
What just happened in there?
- This better be good.
I wasn't ready for them to know.
- You weren't ready?
Being ready's not it.
You have results, you report them.
Can I explain?
- You just lied to the Pentagon!
Once they know we've completed it...
...what's to stop them from taking over the project?
Why would they?
- Because they won't need us.
But it's their project.
It's gonna happen sometime.
It may be their project, but it's my dream, my vision.
What are you proposing?
- That we go to Phase Three ourselves.
Phase Three? Are you nuts?
You can't jump into human testing.
There's rules, procedures.
You don't make history with rules.
You make it by seizing the moment.
You wanna be the first one.
That's what this is about.
This is not about me, it's about us.
We said we would change the world.
Now is our chance.
And we'll get the Nobel Prize.
Come on, buddy.
You know, if somebody finds out that we bypassed advisory review...
...we're never gonna work again.
- But if it works, no one'll care.
How did you get clearance for Phase Three?
I volunteered. They approved.
- No way.
You're kidding.
You volunteered? Are you insane?
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine on himself. Was he insane?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.
Shit.
In the past four weeks, we have brought back seven primates.
The results speak for themselves.
- Or do you wanna believe that?
Sarah, I thought you'd be happy.
We are giving the animals a break.
Moving this fast is bad science, no matter who the guinea pig is.
I can't believe they approved this.
- I think it's fucking cool.
You would.
If we're to move forward, this is the next logical step.
I'll stay shifted for three days and then we'll perform a quantum reversion.
Fuck, yes.
Can I count on your best work?
Good.
How did we let him talk us into this?
Can we talk about it later?
I'm trying to make love to you.
We're risking our professional lives here.
Yes, Matt, I realize.
Then why did we agree to it?
Because we're suckers.
And because sometimes when you get to the edge of the map...
...you have to keep sailing to see what's out there.
And maybe because we both know that Sebastian can pull it off.
Let me ask another question.
- Is it about who's gonna be on top?
Ever miss being with him?
Why do you ask that?
- Because he sets the bar pretty high.
Let me tell you a little secret.
The concept of Sebastian is much more appealing...
...than Sebastian himself.
Whereas you...
You're methodical...
...precise...
...and very, very thorough.
And besides...
...you fit better.
We're ready for you.
See you later.
It's not too late to stop.
- I thought I was the nervous one.
We have a lot riding on this.
Hear about Superman and Wonder Woman?
Stop clowning around.
- It's a good one.
Superman is flying over Metropolis.
He's horny and checking out the rooftops.
He sees Wonder Woman sunning on the roof of the Justice League.
She's lying there buck-naked, spread- eagle, wanting to be fucked, right?
Superman says to himself:
'I gotta get myself some Wonder pussy. '
Then he realizes that he could fly down, do a little fast pumping...
...and be gone before she knew, since he's Superman.
Faster than a speeding bullet.
He swoops down, he fucks her so quick, she doesn't even see him.
Wonder Woman sits up, says,
'What the fuck was that? '
And the Invisible Man says,
'I don't know...
...but my asshole is killing me. '
That's funny, right?
Come on, guys. That's funny.
Ladies, please. This is science.
Starting IV drip.
Okay, how are you feeling?
- I'm a little tense.
Pulse 88. BP 140l95.
It's a bit elevated.
I wonder why.
Are you sure?
Positive.
We ready up in heaven?
- Ready.
Mary's rolling.
I just hope we're not making a snuff film. Rolling.
If it is, I got dibs on his Porsche.
Janice, how can you say that?
Sorry.
Porsche is mine.
Subject male, age 38, weight 166 pounds.
Serum's irradiated.
This better work.
- It will.
Oh, yeah?
- You wanna bet on it?
If I win, you won't be around to pay off, so, no.
Are you ready?
I'll do it. So if anything goes wrong, you can't be blamed.
All right.
Any last words?
Yeah. If I die, pretend I said something deep and clever.
Injection administered at 1823.
Are you feeling anything?
- Nothing so far.
Vitals are stable.
- Nothing's happening.
Human DNA structure may take more time.
You pulsed it right?
- Yes.
Recheck the radiation.
It can't be non-reactive.
No change in bioelectric activity.
Goddamn it!
I'll repeat the protocol, okay?
- Wait.
I'm starting to feel something.
It's my arm. It's...
It's getting warm.
Okay, it's starting to tingle.
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.
Here we go.
Shit! It hurts.
It's tearing me.
Heartbeat's elevated.
Pulse at 110. 130.
Christ, didn't think it would hurt so much.
Frank, readouts!
Brain waves are spiking.
He's on the verge of a seizure.
Pulse is 165, 170.
Blood pressure 180 over 110.
Sebastian, can you hear me?
Sebastian?
His heart'll blow out!
- Standby paddles!
Coming in.
Subcellular quantum. He's shifting.
Bioelectric in the red.
Wait.
He's going.
Pulse is 180.
Holding stable.
Holy shit.
Pulse is dropping. 170, 160, 150.
Bio-quantum phase-shift occurred at 1826.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's in bioelectric shock.
Passed out from the trauma.
Vitals returning to normal?
Pulse 110, dropping.
Blood pressure's 130l75.
Quantum readings normal.
- Electrical activity is stabilizing.
Something to tell the grandkids.
Pulse steady at 85.
You did it. You're the first.
It's okay. It's okay.
You nodded off.
His breathing's hypnotic.
- Yeah.
How long has it been?
Seventeen hours.
And we already have enough data for two lifetimes of research.
It's a brave new world, Lin.
I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there.
Did you see that?
- Sebastian, can you hear me?
Christ! The lights!
Turn off the goddamn lights!
I can't close my eyes.
You can, but your eyelids are transparent.
It's weird. I feel the same, but I'm not here.
You're here.
Sebastian?
- I'm right here.
Where?
- At the mirror.
Looking at myself.
Or, rather, not looking at myself.
Hey, how's he doing?
Why don't you ask Sebastian?
How do you feel?
- Oh, not too bad, considering.
Just wanna set the mood.
It's the light.
His eyelids are transparent.
So, what's it like being a ghost?
Ghosts are dead. I'm very much alive.
Come on, don't be a dick.
Sorry. I couldn't resist.
Okay, now I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.
I wonder where he is now.
Well, I see the procedure's not changed your personality.
He just brushed by me.
- No worries, I'm on it.
Do you see anything?
- Where is he?
You got him?
Sebastian?
Got you, chief.
You guys have no sense of fun.
Shit. Oh, my God.
I've arranged for one of us to be here 24l7, if you need anything.
The team's gonna be on alpha-call alert, so we can be here within...
Thirty minutes. I know.
I wrote the procedure, remember?
I was reassuring you. There's a thermal camera for observation.
She likes this, doesn't she?
- What?
Being in charge.
- Oh, yeah. She loves it.
It's about time the shoe was on the other foot.
Well, just remember.
It's still my project.
You okay taking the late shift?
- It's not like I have a social life.
I know. The workaholic's curse.
Carter's gonna be in by 6 to spell you.
I'm here at 8.
Call me if you need to.
I'll be fine. Get some sleep.
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
Sarah?
Are you awake?
Sebastian?
Are you in here?
I know you're in here.
Then when I checked the monitor again, he's back in the bed.
When I ask him where he'd been, he said he's getting coffee.
Why didn't you call me?
- Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.
I mean, I could have been dreaming.
I just thought I should tell someone.
What do you wanna do?
I don't know. I have a tough time believing he'd be that crude.
I feel so stupid.
Why don't I talk to him?
I'll see what he says...
No, don't.
You know, it's probably nothing.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
So how was your first night?
- Restless.
Hard to sleep without closing your eyes.
What'd you do?
Got up a couple of times.
Walked around.
Sarah mentioned you weren't in your room.
I got a cup of coffee.
In the future, you'll wanna tell the on-call where you're going...
...just in case something happens to you.
I'm touched by your concern, but it's not a problem.
We don't want it to become one.
Everything's normal.
All right, let's get these off.
You okay?
Yeah. Why?
You seem a little nervous.
No, I'm fine.
Are you looking at me?
No.
Why?
No reason.
What was the clientele like?
- This guy comes up to me and says:
'I like my women like my coffee. '
People still use that line?
Maybe he meant cold and bitter.
- Very funny.
I gotta take a leak.
Keep Carter away from my food.
I'll try, but I can't promise.
- All right.
It'd be freaky, but it'd settle down.
No, what would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?
It gives me the creeps. I can't take a piss without wearing my thermals.
Like anyone wants to see that.
- How do I know?
Are you asking what we'd do or what Sebastian would do?
The difference?
There's human nature, then there's Sebastian.
He's always joking that he's God.
Imagine what he'd do if left to his own devices.
Scary thought.
Thankfully, it's almost over.
- Hallelujah.
It's just beginning.
You think Sebastian's bad?
Lmagine if the military gets their hands on this.
Better our military than someone else's.
Sebastian, goddamn it.
You have no idea how much fun this is. You should try it.
I'm sure I'll have my chance.
Hey, relax.
It's my last night, so I thought we'd try one more experiment.
Sebastian.
Can you guess what this is?
What?
How did it feel?
A little too familiar.
Wanna know what it's like to make love to an invisible man?
It'd just be like old times.
- What do you mean?
You were never there.
Well, I'm here now.
We talked about this once, remember?
What?
You wondered if you'd know the difference.
Sebastian, I do know the difference.
It's not what I don't see.
It's what I don't feel.
Get some rest.
Got a big day tomorrow.
Subject: Dr. Sebastian Caine.
Currently in phase-shift
86 hours, 23 minutes.
D- phase protocol. Injecting
Serial Protein Caine 127.
Irradiation complete.
Set.
Are you ready?
- Not really.
I was starting to enjoy myself.
Well, tough.
We'll see you in a minute, my friend.
Injection occurred at 0928.
What are you feeling?
Something's not right.
Heartbeat elevated. Frank.
Shift indicators are erratic.
Bioelectric's jumping.
- Check radiation. Crash cart.
What?
What's happening?
I can't breathe.
Check his airway.
- His lungs are seized. Intubate.
Carter!
Tube him!
Sebastian.
He's going into phase-shift.
- Get him on the table.
We lost our signals.
Goddamn!
Get me an IV of AG-7.
- I'm on it.
No pulse.
I've got no pulse!
Starting CPR.
Don't you die on me.
Don't you fucking die on me.
- I'm getting a pulse.
Sebastian, can you hear me?
- He's going into shock.
Jesus.
Hi.
So I guess it didn't work.
No.
You look worried. Must've been bad.
You almost died.
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Yeah, and ends our careers.
What are we gonna tell Kramer?
Nothing.
He doesn't need to know yet.
We can't keep lying to the others.
- We don't have a choice.
If I'm gonna be stuck like this for a while...
...we'll have to make a few adjustments.
Done.
Open.
- Here.
Okay, lift.
Carter, get the fan.
Okay, don't move.
Don't move.
Thanks. That's better.
Here you go.
It's an improvement.
- You'd almost pass for human.
He couldn't before.
- You have a face you can talk to now.
We can all work in normal light again.
Let's see if we can't try to figure out what went wrong.
Before he starts biting people too.
Goddamn it!
- What?
I lost cohesion again.
Are you any closer?
- No.
You know, I can't figure out the B and C of it.
The B and C?
My 5th grade teacher told me that genius is getting from A to D...
...without having to go through B and C.
Sebastian can do that.
But me, I gotta have the B and C.
Hold on, Sebastian.
We're almost there.
Come on, guys. Out of the way!
I can't take much more testing.
I know how hard it is.
Bullshit. You don't know anything.
This isn't easy for any of us.
Fuck you, Matt! It is easy for you.
I was to be in phase-shift for three days.
It's been 10 fucking days, all right?!
Ten days of tissue tests, radiation tests and your fucking needles!
I can't fucking take it anymore.
What I meant was...
- Fuck what you meant!
And don't ever...
Don't ever tell me how hard you have it.
Come on, Sebastian, you're tired and you need to rest.
I can't believe I gotta spend another night in this place.
We're trying to do everything we can.
Yeah, that's not enough.
There she is.
I'd suck the tits right off of you.
Hey.
Dr. Caine, what's going on? wonk uoy tel ot yb deppots tsuJ
. elihw a rof tuo gniog m'I
Wait. Going out?
Hold it a second. Dr. Caine.
Sebastian.
Dr. Caine.
What do you mean?
If I don't get out, I'll go nuts.
You can't leave the compound.
- Why not?
It's the rule.
- It's my rule, I just changed it.
Authorization.
- Caine 0027.
Confirmed.
- You can't just change it.
I'm not gonna spend my life in this godforsaken dump!
I'm going out! Be back in a couple of hours!
Oh, shit!
Hello?
- It's Carter. We got a problem.
How's it going, Ed?
- Hey, doc.
I haven't seen you in a while.
- You know how it is sometimes.
Work, work, work.
I was beginning to worry because your car hadn't moved.
Thanks a lot, Ed.
But everything's cool.
Hey, look. Look.
Look at that.
- Man, he's weird.
Oh, my God.
- Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
- What?
What?
- Look, it's a ghost.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Mom, it's a ghost.
I'll meet you at the lab.
I'll go by his place just in case.
I'll see you there.
He could be here.
He could be anywhere.
Shit.
Don't even think about it.
Who's gonna know?
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Oh, shit.
Matt, it's me. He was here.
No, he took his mask off.
He must be outside somewhere.
I don't know where he went.
I'm coming back to the lab.
How? How am I supposed to do that?
I can't fucking see him.
You say you want us to shoot him?
I'm in.
It's not a monkey, it's Dr. Caine.
Aren't we overreacting here?
I don't give a rat's ass if we are.
Out there, he's at risk.
If someone finds out what he is, the whole program is destroyed.
Jeez, relax.
Nobody's gonna find out.
Can I still shoot him?
- Where have you been?
I told Carter.
I was getting stir-crazy.
I went home to pick up stuff.
Bullshit.
I went to your apartment.
You did more than 'pick up stuff. '
What are you talking about?
- You, of all people. How could you?
What did you see in my apartment?
I saw your face, your clothes.
Sebastian, in public.
Why'd you have to go out in public?
I'm still project leader.
It's my decision to make.
You're right. It's your decision.
But if you leave again, I swear
I'll go straight to the committee.
Throw your career away?
Not likely.
Try me.
So that's it, huh?
I'm officially a fucking lab rat.
You volunteered.
You knew the consequences.
Next time you do inventory, get me an exercise wheel.
Yeah, sure.
Let's pack it up and go home.
Exercise wheel? Was he serious?
- What do you think?
Hey, Lin.
- Yeah?
The committee knows what we've done, don't they?
Shit, Lin!
- Won't matter if we can get him back.
I can't believe you did that!
- You have deniability, you didn't know.
All I ask is please, please don't fuck us.
Think she'll say anything?
- No, she's in too far.
She doesn't worry me.
- Sebastian.
He's been gone longer than the animals. It might affect his mind.
What if it already has?
Hold still.
Good.
So, what was it like?
- What do you mean?
When you were out in the world.
- I just walked around. You know.
You just walked around.
Come on, there's more, right?
Like what?
Man, if it was me...
...I'd be fucking with people, whispering in ears.
I'd be hanging out at Victoria's
Secret. I'd be the king.
Childish, don't you think?
No.
Well, it was late.
I wasn't out for very long.
Did you see anybody?
There was this one girl.
Did you mess with her?
- No.
Well, maybe I scared her a little.
- Yeah?
How'd that feel?
I liked it.
Nice.
Hello.
- Lin.
Remember the B and C?
I think I found it.
55 percent reversion.
That's the best we've gotten yet.
Protein structure was a dead end. Key was to manipulate radiation signature.
75 percent. 80 percent.
- Come on.
We've got it.
No, it's slowing.
Be an optimist.
- It's slowing down.
88. 92 percent.
93 percent.
94 percent.
95 percent.
No!
- Shit!
Cellular bonds are collapsing.
- Full quantum cascade at 95 percent.
Some breakthrough.
If I were on a table right now,
I'd be a steaming pile of flesh.
Don't tempt me.
We're closer, which counts.
Closer! He just traded quantum energy for stability!
It's ludicrous.
- Come on.
You're pissed you didn't think of it.
- Really?
95 percent? That's not even worth my time! For Christ sake.
Asshole.
At least now we have some hope.
What?
You're a fucking moron.
What is your problem?
Matt is onto something and he could use your help.
Matt. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's onto something, all right.
He's on my coattails.
He's been riding them for years.
Get off your fucking pedestal.
He's trying like hell to fix you.
Or kill me.
And you know what the sad part is?
I have this gift and
I can't even use it.
So now it's a gift.
Damn right it's a gift.
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd let me out of this cage to explore it.
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd be with us trying to save your life.
My life?
I have no fucking life.
I'm a prisoner.
No, you're not a prisoner.
- Oh, yeah?
Is that what you think when you leave here at night?
Is that how you alleviate your guilt...
...when I'm stuck in this shithole and you're at home...
...fucking your boyfriend?
What bothers you most?
That you don't have a life...
...or that I do?
Frank, I'm coming down to the lab.
Don't you sleep?
Da Vinci never slept.
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.
No, no, no, no.
Hello.
Motherfucker...
If you were any later,
I would have started without you.
Jesus!
I don't see anything.
Hello?
No.
No, he's here.
Yes, I'm sure. I'm staring at him.
Is something wrong?
You want me to wake him?
- No, I was just checking.
Who the fuck does she think she is?
I'm not good enough for her?
I'm not good enough?
I'll show them both how good I am.
Quiet!
Quiet!
You wanna fuck with me, bitch?
You know what happens when you fuck with me?!
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. No one.
My, you're looking spry this morning.
- Oh, yeah.
There's nothing more stimulating than staying up...
...watching someone else sleep.
Good morning, gang.
Good morning.
Hi, Maggie. Good morning, girls.
Sebastian...
...you awake?
I am now.
Notice anything unusual last night?
Nope, nothing at all. Why?
Franklin 3, he's dead.
So?
So I thought maybe you heard something.
I was asleep.
- Yeah, all night?
Are you accusing me of something?
No, it just doesn't make sense, does it, a dog dying just like that?
Look, I know how you feel about them,
Sarah, but animals do die.
It's simply a fact of life.
That's all night.
So he never left the room?
- Yeah, I guess.
I don't know.
Why would he kill a dog, right?
Hello?
Sebastian?
Sebastian, this is not funny.
What are you doing here?
- Where is he?
He's asleep, why?
I'll be right back.
Sebastian?
Matt, activate alpha call.
I want everyone in here now.
Working late?
- That's what they pay us for.
It's really pretty clever.
All it does is loop the same image.
What do we do now? Go after him?
No. We're going to the committee.
Shouldn't we wait and talk to him?
He killed a dog with his bare hands.
You were there?
- He went out every night...
...with absolute disregard for his safety and ours.
What's he done?
- I don't wanna think about it.
Are we in trouble?
- You didn't mislead the committee.
We'll take responsibility.
What do we do when he comes back?
- Nothing.
The committee will bring security.
We'll brief you tomorrow morning.
Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.
You sure about this?
- It's the right thing to do.
Given Sebastian's history, this behavior doesn't surprise me.
You should've said something.
I had a lot of faith in you, thinking you'd take care of this.
I know what we did was wrong.
Wrong doesn't even begin to describe it.
Let's leave it here.
I'll call General Caster and convene the committee.
You go back to the lab.
We'll handle him.
Is there anything we can do?
You might think about clearing out your offices.
For what it's worth, we're both very sorry.
A little late for apologies.
Howard?
What was that about?
Just a screwup at work.
- How bad?
Bad enough to wake a few generals.
Hi, boss.
Martha!
Help!
Martha!
Howard?
- Help! Help!
Howard!
Why so jumpy?
- You just surprised me.
No 'good morning' for me today?
You don't love me anymore.
Just in a hurry.
- Well, that's okay.
It's gonna be a busy day.
When did he get back?
Three a. m. He's been wandering around the lab ever since.
Kramer called yet?
He's probably still meeting with the committee.
We should have heard something.
I'm calling.
Hello, is Dr. Kramer there?
What?
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
- He's dead.
What?
- He drowned in his pool last night.
General Caster, please.
Hello. Hello?
There's no dial tone.
There's no outside line here either.
- We'd better alert security.
Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.
That's a first. McKay 1-Delta-835.
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.
Let me try mine.
Kensington 2-Romeo-159.
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.
We've got a problem.
I don't believe this.
When will they start looking for us?
- It could take a couple of days.
Can you hack into the system?
- Already in.
Some security system.
- It's just he's extraordinary.
Someone's more extraordinary than me.
What is it?
- The system's fine.
Our access codes have been removed. There's only one left.
So we're trapped?
- We'll get him.
Let me have one.
Sebastian?
He's not in here.
Okay, Sebastian, fun's over.
Tell us where you are.
Sorry, Linda, but I can't let you turn me in.
Sebastian, where are you?
You have no idea what it's like.
The power of it, the freedom.
I can't let that go.
Whatever you're planning, the phones, the elevator...
...it's not gonna work.
They know about you.
No, they don't.
Kramer died before he could tell a soul.
I saw to that.
Jesus.
You realize what you're saying?
- It's amazing what you can do...
... when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore.
Sebastian.
- Goodbye, Linda.
Sebastian!
Shit!
Where's Janice?
She was right behind us.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!
Janice? Janice!
Janice?
In there.
Darts.
- Is it Sebastian?
Oh, my God.
Shit!
Oh, my God.
She was right behind us.
How could he do this?
He snapped. He fucking snapped.
It's worse.
He's thought this through.
- What?
He knew we were gonna turn him in.
He knew that his career would be over and his only way out...
...is to make sure no one knows what he is or what he's done.
Which means he'll get rid of us.
- Goddamn you!
You could've stopped this!
- Back off.
You risked our lives!
- Shut up!
Don't tell her to shut up!
She's right!
I don't care if she's right!
I don't care whose fault this is!
I just wanna know, what do we do now?
Frank, can you restore the codes?
I'll try.
- We can't afford to sit here and wait.
We are not gonna wait.
We are gonna take him down.
Ever use this thing before?
We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping.
Too small for thermal scans.
Connecting.
- Powering up.
Activating motion detectors.
We've got movement.
Corridor six.
- There he is.
Got it.
Check.
- Check.
Matt, be careful.
- Just watch our backs.
Ready?
- Let's do it.
Take a left at the next corridor.
Could we trap him in corridor eight?
If he keeps heading that way.
- I'm on five.
Anything?
- I think we can climb out.
There's a ladder in the elevator shaft.
Shit, I lost him.
I lost him.
- He stopped moving.
It's me. It's me.
You have anything?
- No, nothing.
How did he get by us?
He couldn't have.
Sebastian!
There. Behind the pipes.
Dr. Caine?
Can you hear me?
- I'm taking him down.
Cover me.
Covered.
It's just a vent.
It's just a goddamn vent.
Let him go! Let him fucking go!
Matt, what's happening?
Carter's down! He's hurt bad!
Get out of there.
Where the fuck is Sebastian?!
Shit. He's right on top of you!
Where's he headed?!
- He's coming this way, to the lab.
The doors are closing!
He's shutting me in!
You have him?
- I do.
He's still there.
He's on your side of the door.
Where?
- He's right in front of you.
He's coming at you!
I got thermals all over the place.
Five or six.
I'm losing resolution!
He's pumping out heat.
You won't be able to see him.
The air's the same temperature as his body.
He's trapped.
- I'm going.
It's not safe.
- Get Carter! Meet at the lab.
We shouldn't separate!
- Get Carter.
Marco. Polo.
Marco. Polo.
You missed.
Now'd be a good time to pay that tab.
- Come on! You think you can take me?!
Come on!
What happened to you?
Was it the serum that fucked you up, or the power?
Aren't you the fucked up one?!
Dining on my leftovers...
...no life except the one you borrowed from me!
Even with Linda.
- She left you, remember?
Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what the fuck she sees in a loser like you!
I'm not a deranged asshole!
No, but you're weak!
I thought killing you would be hard!
But I kind of like it.
Oh, my God. Fuck! His pulse is weak! His breathing's shallow!
He'll be okay!
- No, it's severe!
He's gonna be okay!
- Get down here!
Keep applying pressure until I get back!
Where you going?
- He needs blood.
Wait for the others!
- If I wait, he'll die!
Sarah! Fuck!
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Sarah?
God, I told them to meet us here.
Frank?
Oh, God.
Come on. Give me one step,
Sebastian. One fucking step.
Move!
Fuck.
Hey.
Quite a mess.
Fuck! You motherfuck...
Get off!
We had so much fun the last time.
- No, please don't. Please.
Sweet dreams.
You know...
...I've always admired your feistiness.
Goddamn it, Carter!
Don't die on me now!
Sarah, I'm losing him! Sarah!
- Frank.
Where is she?
- He needed blood.
She went alone?
- He would've died!
He's dead.
Come on.
Wait.
Sarah?
Matt.
- Keep spraying.
Oh, no.
Nothing.
What's happening?!
She's dead, isn't she? Motherfucker!
Frank!
Jesus.
I got it. I got it.
Oh, God!
Bye-bye, Linda.
Have fun with your boyfriend.
We're locked in.
How bad?
You're losing blood, but he didn't hit any organs.
Frank?
- No.
I gotta find something to close the wound.
Shit.
Talk to me.
Everything is spinning.
Are you still with me?
- I can't feel anything.
Can you feel this?
A little.
Come on.
I need you to fight this.
I need you to stay awake.
- I'm trying.
Come on. Talk to me.
Talk to me!
Matt. Matt! Matt!
Hello, face.
We are not gonna die in here.
I'll be back with help. I promise.
Authorization, please.
- Caine 0027.
Confirmed.
- Thank you.
Sebastian!
I can't let you leave.
- Sorry, you don't have a choice.
Oh, yes, I do.
You think you're God?
I'll show you God!
Shit!
I always knew you were a bitch!
Bitch!
No wonder it didn't work out between us!
Stay the fuck away from her!
Thought I'd save you for a change.
Come on. I heard an explosion!
Don't touch it!
- What?
It's nitro.
- We gotta stop it.
No, we can't! Come on!
There's a ladder in the elevator.
Can you climb?
- Do I have a choice?
You go first.
Move!
Oh, shit.
Stick to the side!
Let's coming back down!
Down! Go down!
Holy shit.
We better go before it slips.
Matt!
Get off of me! Get off of me!
Matt.
Let go of me!
- One last kiss.
For old times' sake.
Go to hell.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Not God. Not anymore.
Guys, settle down.
Settle down, you guys.
Who just threw that?
I'll throw something back at you.
No, no more soda, you guys are crazy.
Taxi, taxi!
No, no, I got that.
I got that.
- Sorry, pal.
- It's okay...
You're stupid!
That's just stupid!
Hey, motherfucker!
Where's the wallet?
Give me that cake.
Where's Paul?
- Maurice?
- Oh shit, Mr. Duncan.
You know this dude?
I had Maurice in my ninth grade bio class about five years ago.
I guess those extra help sessions didn't quite do it for you.
Let's go, man.
This guy's cool.
He's the best teacher I ever had.
Let's go.
Sorry about this,
Mr. Duncan.
Honest mistake.
Got things under control?
Paul, what took you so long?
I ran into an old student,
I got held up.
- Mm-hmm, did you get the present?
- Yeah, yeah, voilà.
Gorgeous.
All right, let's do this.
Clara, get the lights.
- Finally.
- I know.
Ready?
Everybody, everybody!
How you doin', Jeff?
Where is he?
Where's my boy?
- Hey!
- Dad.
# Happy birthday to you #
How, you doin'?
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Adam #
# Happy birthday to you! #
- Hey, kid!
- You made me laugh.
So Dorset Prep, where is that exactly?
- Mars.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
It's in the suburbs, a half hour away.
It's a great offer, but Paul hasn't made up his mind yet.
I bet that's a change from the school you teach at now.
Oh yeah, less crack, better cafeteria selection.
Don't mind Paul. He's still grappling with his conscience.
Mom, Dad, this is the coolest present ever!
Oh-ho, it looks good too, right?
Do you think he needs more sugar?
Yeah I know,
I'm breaking every rule.
- Hello, is Steggie in here?
- Beware.
Hey, cake for Steggie.
- He can't eat that, it...
- Why not?
He's an herbivore.
Oh, oh, he's an herbivore.
Okay, then
I'll just take it back.
- Wait, maybe leave it, just in case.
- Take it back.
- That's what I thought.
- Good night.
- Bye, Dad.
- Good birthday?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
What was your favorite present?
- My jacket...
- Yay!
...You got me.
- You look so good in red.
What's on your agenda tomorrow?
Uh, I have to stop by the gallery.
I have to pick up a lens I ordered.
I have to get a new pair of sneakers for Adam.
Ooh, I have to do you.
I could take care of that right now.
Have you thought about that job offer?
You do realize it'd mean moving, right?
So, we'd move.
You know we used to think we were pretty hip living down here.
I also used to think four Merit Lights and a Diet Coke constituted a meal.
Honey, I love this place as much as you do, but we've got a kid to think about.
And I just don't think any city is a great place to raise a kid these days.
Plus, you'd be making twice what you're making now.
I'm just not sure the timing's right and your photography is starting to take.
This is not about my photography.
Okay, I just can't shake this feeling that somehow...
I'd be selling out.
Right. Listen... you know how much
I respect your ethics.
But this is about Adam.
Sometimes, ethics have to take a back seat.
Okay, your turn.
- Okay, I'm going to a picnic...
- Yeah?
And I'm going to bring an ant, a bagel, a croissant,
- a ding dong...
- Like you?
Mom!
- A ding dong...
- Yeah?
- Uh...
- Shoe store, 3:00!
- Yes!
- Take my hand.
I think if you pump them any more, they might explode.
Really?
Kaboom!
- Do you want 'em or not?
- Yeah.
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna go test these outside, okay?
Okay, but don't go too far, okay?
And how would you like to pay for this?
A credit card, please.
Ma'am?
I need your signature.
Sorry, so sorry.
All right, sorry.
- Thanks.
- Great.
Hello!
You guys!
Where's my greeting committee?
Jess?
I'm sorry, I got stuck at a teacher's conference.
Jessie?
Machine voice:
You have four new messages.
Paul, I...
God damn it!
We'll handle all the funeral arrangements.
- God be with you.
- Thank you for everything, father.
Honey?
Excuse me, Jessie?
Jessie Duncan?
Yeah?
It's Richard,
Richard Wells.
Richard?
Your wife was an undergraduate student of mine. It's been years.
Actually, Richard, it's... it's kind of a bad time.
I know, I read about it in the paper.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- Thank you.
- Actually, do you have a minute?
I'm sorry,
I know this is a terrible time.
I don't think so.
Not right now.
But believe me, if there was any other way...
The truth is, I went to some trouble to find you.
I'd like to help you.
Help us?
I'm a doctor.
I specialize in fertility.
If we could just talk, it won't take long, I promise you.
We can go to a restaurant right over there.
I finished the residency in ob-gyn, but my real passion is research.
- What is it you do, Paul?
- I teach biology.
- You do?
- Can you tell us what this is about?
Yeah.
The truth is, there is... there's no easy way to present this to you, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.
My clinic has perfected a procedure by which a single cell could be used to create a genetically-identical fetus... a fetus which could be carried to term and, in effect, be reborn.
- Do you mean cloned?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes.
This would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head.
This is how you wanna help us?
I used to be affiliated with a hospital here and I had a chance to review Jessie's records.
You did what?
I'm aware of the complications surrounding Adam's delivery,
that it's impossible for you to conceive again.
You looked at her records?
I had to be certain that Jessie's condition didn't preclude carrying a child and it doesn't, so yes, I can help you.
You can have him back, your son Adam, to birth again, to raise.
- Adam's dead, God damn it!
- Paul. Paul.
- My son is dead!
- Paul, please.
You come at me with this?
God knows what hell you've been through.
The last thing I want to do is make this time any harder.
But the truth is I can do this, and I want you to know.
What you're talking about is illegal, not to mention potentially immoral.
Illegal, yes.
Immoral, no.
We're talking about using life to create life, that's all.
And you've done this before? You've successfully cloned a human being?
No, I haven't but only because I've been looking for an ideal candidate.
I read about what happened.
And I hope that if you two aren't interested
- in what I'm proposing here...
- What are you proposing here?
- He's not even sure that he can...
- That's not true... I am sure.
Still, it does come down to trust.
- You'd be...
- Excuse me, your menus.
You'd be gambling on me as much as I'd be gambling on you.
My clinic is some
300 miles from here.
If you were to do this, it would mean moving there and I'll be honest with you, changing your lives entirely.
Paul's right, this is extremely against the law.
You'd have to sever all ties with family, with friends, with anyone who ever knew Adam.
Of course I would help with the relocation, and I can get you a job at the local high school.
- You know what, I've heard enough.
- Paul, please.
- I know how upsetting this is.
- No, no, no, you don't know!
You could never know.
- Let's go!
- You're right.
I'm sorry to have upset you.
- Jessie...
- Jessie!
I can be reached at this number.
- DNA can be saved indefinitely...
- Jessie!
But Adam's cells will only be viable another 72 hours.
So if you do change your mind...
Practically a stranger.
I can't believe you're considering this!
I can't believe you're not considering this.
Any idea how much could go wrong?
Honey, I... listen,
I love you, I love you.
I love you beyond words, okay?
But only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.
But what if it did?
It still wouldn't be Adam.
It would be an identical twin.
It'd be like another kid.
But he'd have the same face and the same laugh.
- In time, we can try again, I swear.
- No, we can't.
- You know we can't.
- We'll find a way. We can have...
I don't want another child!
I want Adam!
I want him back.
You know what I kept thinking while I was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and I was watching him die?
"This is the last time
I'll ever get to hold him. "
My little boy.
- Hello.
- Paul.
L... I just heard.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Sam.
Um... so... how's Jessie taking all this?
Actually, she's... she's not so well.
Right, of course.
Look, would you please just pass on my condolences to her?
Yeah, I will.
Hey, Sam, can I... can I ask you something?
Have you ever heard of a doctor named Richard Wells?
Richard Wells.
Sure I've heard of him. Why do you ask?
He was an old teacher of Jessie's.
Really? He's the stuff of legend.
He was doing really advanced work on gene mapping.
We're talking way ahead of his time.
Anyway, last thing I heard, he sold his findings to a huge firm, made a ridiculous amount of money, and then just sort of dropped out of the game entirely.
Every once in a while I come across an article of his in a journal,
consistently brilliant.
Like I said, he's...
A genius.
Yeah, I know.
- Paul, I'm so very sorry.
- Okay, thanks.
Or you go like that.
One...
Oh, ooh!
Can't you see this?
Three, two, one.
The game is live!
- Then all of a sudden...
- I'm right side up!
Wait a second, you're confusing me.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No, I think we should call it Adam.
- Guess who?
- I don't know.
- It's me, Adam.
- I don't think I know an Adam.
I'm your son.
- Ow! Ow!
- The family jewels.
Are we all in?
- Damn, what a handsome group.
- Yep.
- Hi, Mom!
- Adam!
- Hello...
- This hat.
I've never seen you wear this before.
Bad hair day,
I guess.
I've never seen you wear any hat.
All cells are in essence clones...
identical copies of one original cell.
The key to artificially stimulating replication
is in shocking a specialized cell back to its pre-specialized state...
its stem cell precursor...
The cell as it was before it became a liver cell or a brain cell,
or a relatively simpler cheek cell.
Once in this state, the cell's nucleus is immediately transferred
to a mother's enucleated egg.
The transfer completed, the egg cell will then
ideally accept the donor nucleus as its own.
At which point, we let nature take its course.
She did great.
We just need to keep her here until tomorrow to make sure the implant takes.
But she did wonderfully.
She has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don't we go look at the house and I'll show you around?
She's in good hands.
So, all these people and no one else knows?
The procedure doesn't differ much from a standard implant.
So, as far as my staff's concerned,
Jessie's being treated as a high-risk in vitro, nothing more.
- Dr. Wells?
- Thanks, George.
There you go.
Riverton's a great town, I think you're really gonna like it here.
It's a bit secluded maybe, but a wonderful community.
Nice people, lots of families... perfect place to raise a child.
So why don't you follow me?
I'll show you around.
Beautiful country, isn't it?
This whole area has a lot of history.
And the house itself is 100 years old at least.
Sorry, there's no furniture.
So I took the liberty of ordering some.
It should be here sometime tomorrow.
What if this didn't work,
Richard?
What if the implant doesn't take, the procedure's a bust... what then?
- It'll work, Paul.
- You can't say that with any certainty.
Look, no one can say anything with any certainty.
I mean, even a routine pregnancy is fallible.
But if I can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
Her. Jessie.
She's pinned every hope in the world on this.
And I won't let her down, or you.
You have my word on that.
Is this for real?
For now.
I can't believe this place.
Hey.
- Look at this.
- What is that?
Oh my God, Paul.
You know what we could put down here?
Darkroom?
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
Jessie!
Hon? I'm back.
I'm home to our... big home!
Hey!
Hi.
You said we'd never have a party in here.
Come on.
- Come on, come on, push it.
- I can't!
- Yes.
- No, it hurts.
- Yes.
- You're doing fine, Jessie.
You're fully dilated, the head's already crowning, you just need to now push.
- Something's wrong.
- No, nothing is wrong.
Something's wrong,
I'm telling you.
It's coming out. It's fine.
You can see the head.
Keep pushing. Push, push, push.
- Keep pushing, push.
- Good girl.
- Come on, push, push, push.
- Come on, come on.
Oh, there we go, okay.
All right, all right, we're out, we're out.
That's it.
It's okay.
Let me just hear you... let me just hear you scream.
- You did great.
- Come on, come on.
That's great, honey.
He's all right.
It's great.
I just need some breath from him.
He's all right.
Okay, how long?
30 seconds, 31, 32...
33, 34, 35...
- We're gonna have to bag him.
- What's wrong?
- 40 seconds, 41...
- 40...
- Come on, come on.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, thank God.
This is the same as last time, remember?
It's him. You wanted to give us a scare, didn't you?
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here you go, kiddo.
Good night, Adam.
My little boy.
I still think it's a little strange.
Huh-uh.
It's his name.
It's always been his name... Adam.
#... Birthday to you #
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Adam #
# Happy birthday to you! #
There you go, buddy.
Uncle Richard!
Happy birthday, Adam.
Cake, cake, cake!
Cake time! Cake!
So, how's work going?
It's good. It's good... nice kids, bright too.
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like I'm teaching fish to swim... at a Club Med.
You don't still miss your old school?
No, it's more like
I miss missing it.
Uncle Richard, want to help me fly it?
Let's get it up there.
Keep it away from the trees.
So what was this word you said?
Reeservoier.
It's a science word, Uncle Richard.
We've been learning about natural resources in school.
Oh, you mean a "reservoir. "
Well, that's a lot like a lake, only it's a man-made lake.
But I thought God made everything.
Well, in a way He did, if you believe He created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir, right?
- Bye, guys, thank you.
- See you later, Adam!
- Thanks, Paul, see you later.
- Hey, kiddo!
Bye, Adam!
Why don't you come on inside, say goodbye to your friends?
Thank you, Adam.
Bye, Adam!
- Bye.
- Bye, Paul.
Adam!
Bye!
Hey!
Birthday Boy!
How many times
I gotta tell you, you can't leave your toys around?
Somebody's gonna trip and...
For those of us who don't wear helmets in the house...
What you doing?
Where did you get this?
It was a birthday present from Joey Smoyer.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Why don't you get some sleep?
Dad, I've been thinking...
About what?
I don't think I like you so much anymore.
- No...
- Gotcha!
Ohh, somebody is in some very serious trouble.
Where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?
- I'm gonna smother you now.
- Stop it, Dad!
It's just in... some ways, he's so much the same, you know?
But he's still his own person entirely.
And then... look at him.
I honestly forget sometimes, you know?
And then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.
It's okay, it happens to me too.
- I just worry, you know?
- What?
- If he ever found out.
- He won't find out.
What if he did?
About what it would mean to him.
I just love him so much.
Both of you.
Meow!
No!
No! Help!
Adam!
Adam!
It's okay,
I'm right here.
Who are you?
Dad!
- Adam!
- No.
Mom!
Adam?
Oh my God!
Adam!
Ow!
- Jesus, take it easy!
- Go away!
- It's okay, okay!
- No!
- It's okay, take it easy.
- Stay away! Get away!
- Jessie! It's okay.
- Get away from me!
- It's okay! Okay, okay!
- Get off!
- All right! It's okay.
- Get off me.
- Jessie!
- Honey?!
- Ow!
- Oh, God!
- Adam? Adam?
- What happened?
I don't know, he just collapsed.
- Call 911!
- I'm calling Richard.
Richard, thank God.
I want him in a hospital.
Paul, my staff and I can handle this.
Your staff don't even know about this.
They don't need to.
It's the same as always... we're close friends.
You know our arrangement.
Maybe we need to reconsider our arrangement.
It's five hours, he's still unconscious.
His respiration and color are good and he's responding to low-level stimuli.
He's basically just sleeping.
Except for some reason, he's not waking up.
- He seems to have night terrors.
- Night terrors?
It's a sleep disorder.
A child screams in his sleep.
He may sit up, walk, even talk, but all attempts to wake him are futile.
No, no, you weren't there.
This is something entirely different.
All right... hold on a minute.
I know it's scary, but we talked about this... the possibility that things could change once Adam crossed the age at which he died.
Well, it's been eight years.
As of now, he's crossed it.
You said things could change... you never said anything like this.
Because I couldn't have known.
Look, he is the only one, period.
We are and always have been at the mercy of that fact.
Up to this point, we've had a map...
Adam's first eight years.
But now we're entering uncharted territory.
We have no way of knowing who the Adam of age nine, age 10, age 50, is going to be, what problems he may or may not have.
I promise you, there's nothing more a hospital would be doing for him.
What's happening here, Richard?
That's what I'd like to find out.
My feeling is it's probably nothing.
Let's just give it a little time, okay?
Yeah.
The last eight years... no matter how happy
I've been,
I've always had this feeling that somehow we wouldn't get away with this.
Not that someone would find out, just... somehow, we'd lose him again.
We're not gonna lose him.
It's okay, it's okay.
Boo!
- Oh, Adam!
- Oh my gosh!
- Hey.
- But no, no, no... is he all right?
- He's fine.
- You okay?
I'm feeling hungry!
Mommy!
- Come on, kiddo.
- Everything's okay.
This is fantastic, fantastic.
Come on, come on.
- You feel good?
- Ahh!
My God, you slept enough.
- Richard, thank you.
- I'll see you all tomorrow.
Adam, dinner's on.
Jessie, he's not up here.
Adam!
Hey, come on.
Adam!
Hey!
Adam?
Adam? Adam!
Adam?
There you are.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you hear me calling you?
Hey... are you all right?
I'm talking to you.
Adam?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey!
Answer me.
Yes, Daddy?
Did you hear me calling you?
Your dinner is ready.
Go in the house.
No, Paul just said it was kind of a strange moment.
No, he seems fine.
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping... it's probably nothing.
I don't think it's anything to worry about, okay?
All right, take care and I'll see you soon.
All right, well, thanks,
Richard. Take care.
I think we should take him to a specialist.
Richard doesn't think it's anything to worry about.
And his word's gospel?
How long are we supposed to live like this?
When does all this gratitude end?
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Bye, Mom.
Anybody know what this is?
It's a big ugly visual aide.
Let's do it like this.
If you think of DNA as a fuse box, each of the genes are either switched on or off, depending on which cell we're talking about.
So that the genes responsible for say the length of Kevin's...
...nose hair wouldn't be much use in his pinky toe.
So what, the gene isn't present?
No, no, it's present, it's just inactive. It's turned off.
It's dead.
You know what?
Why don't you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
I'm going to put on a little show for you guys and you're going to pay me your lunch money.
So pay me and if you don't,
I'll beat the crap out of you for the rest of your life.
How about this? No.
How about... yes! Ha-ha!
What are you going to do about it, huh?
You're a tiny little boy.
What if his having outlived the life of that first original cell has somehow allowed some dormant problem to be switched on?
Listen, maybe it's significant, maybe it isn't,
But the fact remains that any changes in health or behavior
Could have occurred naturally the last time as well.
- These night terrors...
- If that's what they are.
Paul, it's a common sleep disorder.
If there's anything he isn't, it's common.
What do you want me to say, Paul?
That there's something seriously wrong with him?
- You don't think I'm just as concerned?
- No. No, I don't.
You have every right to worry.
But for eight years, we've known what to expect.
Most parents never have the benefit of hindsight.
From now on, neither do we.
- "We"?
- You know what I meant.
Can I get back to my patients, please?
Ever want to have any children of your own, Richard?
Jessie's always saying how great you are with Adam.
- It seems like such a shame.
- Paul, he's your son.
Believe me, I know what he means to you.
But maybe you can keep in mind what he does mean to me.
- Here they come.
- Oh, hey there! There you are.
Why so glum, chum?
There's this new kid,
Roy Hazen, he's always showing off, like how high he goes on the swings and stuff.
- He's a total ass wipe.
- Hey!
Where did you learn that language?
I don't know.
I don't like it.
Get in the car.
Whoa!
- Oh, God!
- Adam.
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Adam!
- I didn't see you.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I didn't see you.
I came so close to hitting you.
Do you know that?
Do you know you could have been killed just now? Do you?
- How many times do I got to tell you...
- Daddy, you're hurting me!
- To keep your bicycle off the street?
- Paul!
What's the matter with you?
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.
You sure?
Hello?
Yeah, I would, actually.
Let me get a pen.
Dr. Lieber?
Okay. In Beauford?
Great.
Sam, I appreciate this.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
Who's that?
Wrong number.
Adam!
Adam?
Adam, open the door.
Open the door, son.
Open the door!
Adam?
Open the door.
God damn it!
Open the door, son.
What... why is the door locked?
- What?
- How... the curtain.
- What?
- The curtain. He was under there.
No, no, no, no, look.
What are you talking about?
- Look, it's fine.
- No, no.
Don't let him hurt me.
Shh, there's nobody going to hurt you.
Look, look, look, it's okay.
Shh, calm down.
It's all right. I think you just had a bad dream.
- No.
- Huh?
- I saw it.
- What?
What did you see?
Adam, talk to me.
Please.
Please, you got to talk to me. I can't help you if I don't know what this is.
I just... I know something.
Okay, what?
What is it?
Something bad is going to happen.
No, it's not.
I'll never let anything bad ever happen to you.
Not to me.
Listen to me, you're my son, you understand that?
Huh?
- Say it.
- I'm your son.
That's right.
We're gonna be okay.
We're going to be okay.
So, how many eggs did you retrieve?
I only retrieved three.
I thought that would be enough...
- Richard, hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
No, it's fine.
- Excuse us.
- Sure.
What's the matter?
You look...
I need to speak with you about something...
I have to stop off at home for some papers.
Why don't I fix us some lunch?
Hey, hey, how would you like that?
I just got an idea.
How about we have a swinging contest?
- Yeah!
- You guys will be the judges.
- We'll make it very fair.
- Yeah.
Ladies first.
Ha ha.
Don't go too high, you'll start crying.
Don't break a nail, oh, no!
Come on, you chicken.
- Oh, what's that for?
- Nasty monkey.
Adam Duncan, you stop that at once!
No spitting.
Come on, come down from there.
Come down.
Come down right now.
No... hey!
Hey...
Adam?
So what you're saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
Or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.
Yeah, well...
Paul is convinced that somehow Adam's cells have...
Retained memories of his first life?
There's an often cited experiment... a rat was trained to run a maze, killed, then ground up and fed to a second rat.
The second rat, when presented with the same maze, completed it in record time, proving that memory lived on in those ingested cells.
It's fascinating, really, also a bunch of nonsense...
an urban legend.
So, it's not possible he's remembering?
No, no.
Thank God.
Frankly, I'm more concerned about Paul's working up these strange theories.
Paul is just having a tough time right now.
It's good.
He's never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
No.
You don't think he'd ever try to leave, do you?
Jessie, that can't happen.
Out here in the middle of nowhere, it's easy to forget the consequences of what we've done.
But if anyone ever found out,
you might never see Adam again.
I know.
I can trust you to rein Paul in?
Yes.
Okay, well, I'll go ahead and see if the auditorium's available.
Right.
Sorry, I just got the message.
They called me at the high school.
Apparently, they couldn't reach you?
- I was out. How's Adam?
- He's fine, Mrs. Duncan.
I have him waiting in my office right now.
I don't know exactly how to say this, but...
his behavior has distanced some of the other children.
And the thing is, he could have seriously injured himself.
Let's go in and see him, okay?
Is that wine on your breath?
- I was having lunch.
- With who?
Why are you so upset?
It was just lunch.
I just wanted to talk to him about Adam.
God, Paul.
Wait, where are we going?
To get a second opinion.
Are you kidding me?
Am I smiling?
About these night terrors... you're confident that's what this is?
I see it in a number of kids Adam's age.
Scares the bejesus out of the parents, but the kids outgrow it.
As for Adam's recent changes in behavior, well, he's poorly rested...
No, you don't know him.
This is something else.
He won't leave me alone.
- Who?
- Zachary.
Zachary?!
Mr. Duncan, who is Zachary?
Is he a boy in his class?
I don't know.
Honey, who is Zachary?
He's the boy who lives in my dreams.
Talk to me, pal. This boy told you his name was Zachary?
Not really,
I kind of just know.
And you've never seen his face?
He doesn't like to show it, but I know because of his jacket.
What kind of jacket?
Just let him answer.
It's red with white sleeves.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where's who going, Adam?
- Adam?
- Zachary.
Zachary?
- And where are you?
- Where we live.
I don't want to do this.
This is crazy.
According to who?
Richard?
Listen, there's something he's not telling us, Jessie, I know it.
The way he is handling this, the way he stays so close to us.
- He cares about us.
- I don't...
Zachary, Zachary, where are you?
- Tell me about Zachary.
- He's never even known a Zachary.
What are you trying to tell us, Adam? Say it.
Say it!
- That's enough, stop it.
- Tell us what you're trying to say.
If you don't understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
- I don't want to understand it.
- You're dead!
Paul, watch out!
Are you okay?
Honey, you okay?
- Is he all right?
- He's okay.
You're all right, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, kiddo, there you go.
You're home now, all right?
You just go to sleep, all right?
Dad... did I die?
Of course not.
You've been right here with us.
Go to sleep.
Oh my God, that's what this is.
He's remembering his first life in his dreams.
- Kids say things like that.
- A boy? In the city?
Jesus, it's possible.
If certain genes from the cell used in the procedure managed to retain certain memories...
- He's not remembering.
- How can you say that?
Because he can't.
Honey, wake up.
We're at school.
Okay now, I want to see everyone in your family outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
Take your time.
Lots of colors.
And don't forget to write your name on it.
Nice and big. I want to put these up around the classroom.
Beautiful.
You can put pets in your pictures...
dogs and cats.
Have some fun.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Jessie.
I just thought I'd stop by to see how the stuff's doing.
Come in.
Very well. Richard Wells was in yesterday.
He bought this big one and these three small ones on the spot.
That's great.
Excuse me a second.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Richard, hi.
I just thought I'd see how Adam's doing.
Not so well, actually.
He had another night terror last night.
Paul even managed to get him talking this time.
I'm wondering if we can use his ability to vocalize in that state to our advantage.
I don't know.
What would that entail?
Well, for starters, I'd like you to bring him in again.
I'm not sure Paul would be comfortable with that.
But I thought we agreed you're gonna try to rein him in.
- I know we did. I'll talk to him, okay?
- Please do.
I need to go, Richard.
Good bye.
Come on, you guys, let's go!
Come on, you chickens!
Wussies! Let's go!
I'm doing it!
You can too!
Are you afraid of something?
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Jeez, buddy!
Let's go!
Come on, come on!
Come on, I'm doing it!
You can!
What are you, babies?
You want your ba-ba? Let's go!
Who's there?
Oh, no.
Please be okay.
Please don't touch this.
Jessie?
You down there?
- Did you hear me?
- Huh?
- You okay?
- Are you hungry?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Yeah.
You hungry?
Hello?
No, I'm sorry, Tanya, he isn't.
Tanya, slow down.
Hold on, I'll ask him right now. Hold on.
Adam, roy's mother says he hasn't come home from school yet.
- Do you know where he might be?
- No.
Wait, wait, wait.
What were you doing down at the river this afternoon?
Just playing.
With who?
I'm not supposed to say.
Adam, can you answer me?
Go to your room.
Now!
I'm sorry, Tanya, he doesn't know.
Yeah, good luck.
You said Richard mentioned using his ability to vocalize to find out more.
Call him.
We'll bring Adam in tomorrow.
Adam, what's the name of the school?
Can you tell me the name of the school?
Pius...
S- s-street.
Could it be
Saint Pius?
Are you sure this can't hurt him?
It's a mild tranquilizer.
We're just poking around to see what we dig up.
Right Paul?
Yeah.
Adam... is Zachary in there?
In school?
They all are.
They all are.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Z- zachary.
Clark.
Z- zach...
We know this name?
Zachary Clark?
Who is Zachary Clark?
They think I'm him.
Are you him?
Are you Zachary?
Who are you?
They think I'm him.
They think I'm him!
They think I'm him!
They think I'm him!
- No!
- Adam!
- Adam?
- Richard, release him.
- It's hurting him.
- Adam? Wake up.
- Hot! Hot!
- Wake up, honey. Adam?
Goddamn it, do something! Adam?
- Hot! Hot!
- Adam, wake up. Adam?
Zachary?
Honey?
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
You're okay. You're okay.
Hey, why'd you call him Zachary?
Answer me, Richard.
Because he wasn't responding to his own name.
That's bullshit!
I want the truth.
- You set me up!
- It's okay, it's okay.
You needed my okay to push him, but you wanted him pushed. Why?
- Paul, you've gone completely...
- Stop telling me what's wrong with me, and tell me what's wrong with my goddamn son!
Paul...
I wish I could help you.
Adam's changing.
He's getting worse.
Sometimes it's like there's two of him.
He's destructive.
He's tried to harm himself.
The other kids at school are scared of him, Richard.
There's something you're not telling us.
There have been times
I've seen you talking to him and he's in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
Don't push me, Richard.
Adam's all I care about in the whole world.
I'll go public if I don't get some answers soon, you understand that?
You understand I'll go public?
I'm not kidding.
I swear to God, I'll tell the whole goddamn world what you've done.
What we've done, Paul.
What we've done.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is remembering.
Or maybe it's something else.
Why that name,
Zachary Clark, or the school?
Look, I have tomorrow off,
It's a few hours drive into the city.
- I'm gonna look into it.
- No, Paul, absolutely not.
- If Richard found out...
- He won't. I'll leave in the morning.
- I won't be back until afternoon.
- Paul, no.
Hold on.
No! No!
Let me go! Let me go!
Nooo! No!
My baby!
Let me go! Let me go!
No! My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
No! No! My baby!
Jessie, can I see you? Now?
I told you.
What? It doesn't mean...
You're the one who said he never got along with that boy.
The twins said they saw Roy playing down by the water, that he'd been showing off.
They're all but sure he fell in. You're not?
I'm not sure of anything right now.
No matter what he does, he's still our son.
Do you find that comforting right now?
Huh?
What are you saying?
You wish we'd never done this?
Good night, baby.
Mommy loves you.
You scared me.
It's okay, Mommy.
Shit.
Sorry, there's nothing here.
Are you sure this is the only Saint Pius?
Well, it's the only one in this city.
Like I said, they've been closed for some time now.
What about past student records, like a search by name?
I'm looking for a Zachary Clark.
Well, by name could take a while.
I can wait.
A few weeks?
- Hi.
- Yes?
Sorry to bother you.
My name's Paul Duncan.
I know this sounds crazy, but I'm here about Zachary Clark.
Does that name mean anything to you?
- He's a young child, a boy.
- No, I'm sorry.
What about the previous owners?
Did they have any children?
Melinda.
I'm sorry.
No, there were no previous owners.
My husband and I bought this place about six years ago
when it was just a burnt-down shell.
And he's an architect, so we restored it.
- So, it was just vacant?
- Well, for a few years, yeah.
But I don't know anything about its previous owners.
- Right.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I just...
- I'm sorry to bother you.
Sorry, the nanny... we interviewed quite a few nannies, mostly by phone, but I remember speaking to one who
I could have sworn said she used to work for the family who used to live at this address.
I think that I saved her contact information, if...
Great, thank you.
Cora Williams?
You don't know me, but I need to talk to you.
It's about Zachary Clark.
Come in.
Machine voice:
You have no messages.
Damn it!
I had hoped I'd never hear that name again.
What did he do?
There had been incidents at school.
He never had any friends, used to come home with all sorts of scrapes.
Once they locked him in an empty classroom.
A teacher finally found him, terrified and shaken.
But that was before he started acting up.
Pretty soon, those kids got wise
and just left him alone.
Then there was the fire.
The fire at Saint Pius?
Cora: They never found out how the fire got started, but I knew.
And when Zachary came home,
I asked him about it.
He just gave me this smile.
Adam?
I swear, when I looked into those eyes of his,
I didn't see anything but evil behind them.
I kept my distance.
I was scared of what else he might be capable of...
all these terrible thoughts running through my mind.
It was just the two of us at home that day.
He was taking his bath
when it suddenly became clear to me what I had to do.
He never even heard me come in.
I tried to go through with it.
I swear I tried, but...
I just... I couldn't.
I just couldn't.
When his mother came home,
Zachary didn't say a word about what I'd done.
Are you here?
I was at home the next day,
when I was struck by the most awful premonition.
I hurried right over.
Two blocks away, I could already hear the sirens.
Then I saw all that smoke.
I rushed into the house, blinded by all those flames, praying I wasn't too late.
But you were.
It turned out his mother was already dead by then.
Cora: I remember it was freezing cold that day.
It was always cold in that big house.
Adam?
Cora: So she went down the stairs to the basement,
to check on the water heater.
Are you down there?
And that's where he was...
just waiting for her.
So you're saying
Zachary killed his mother.
He used a hammer he took down from the wall.
And when he was done, he set a fire.
Then he went upstairs
and finished playing.
That's where they found his body.
Where was his father?
Oh, he was at the hospital like always.
The hospital, he was a doctor?
A baby doctor, yeah.
Only, he seemed more like a scientist to me.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Goddamn it!
Are you home? Jessie?
Pick it up if you're there, please.
Listen, I gotta talk to you right away, it's important.
Call me as soon as you get this.
I love you.
Adam?
Honey, you shouldn't have opened that.
You shouldn't have touched that box.
Adam?
Is this me?
Honey, let me explain.
Adam.
Zachary.
What?!
I need to speak with Richard Wells.
I'm sorry, but Dr. Wells is at the Hazen funeral today.
A funeral where?
Honey, don't be scared. It's okay.
I'm right here.
Just be careful, okay?
What was that?
Honey...
Mommy?
Adam, where are you?
Adam?
Adam can't come out to play right now, Mrs. Duncan.
Wait.
Wait!
Let me explain.
Adam.
You couldn't use him, could you?
Zachary.
You couldn't use him.
Maybe it never even occurred to you to try.
No, it occurred to me.
But the fire destroyed him, right?
You didn't even have a viable cell.
His genetics I could salvage, but it was no more than pieces of a map.
I saved what I could, but after that...
I was this close to perfecting the procedure, you can't possibly fathom that kind of torture.
To have this knowledge, this power, and know there's nothing more you can do about it.
But you did do things about it, Richard.
Once you had Adam's cell, you could preserve his physical characteristics and manipulate certain genes... intangibles, like cognition, personality, his memory.
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Except for one thing.
There was no way to predict the results.
I could only wait and hope for a glimpse of him, the mere indication that something had lived on.
Lived on?
Do you have any idea what you've done to my son?! To my family?
I'd think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing. I just wanted him back.
You experimented with a human life!
So did you.
So did your wife.
No, I would say there's a huge difference...
Is there, Paul? Do you think you can just open Pandora's Box and then just close it again?
We trusted you, goddamn it!
We had no way of knowing.
What you did goes way beyond...
Beyond what?
Societal standards?
You name me a single medical advancement that didn't.
Tell me something.
If I'm not supposed to do this, Paul, then how is it that I can?
Because you're a scientist.
Only this isn't about science or evolution... it's about moral trespass, about your ignoring what's right and wrong.
And what about you, Paul?
Have you trespassed?
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe this is my punishment for wanting something that I never should have had.
And if that's the case, then so be it.
But believe me when I tell you,
I'm gonna do everything in my power to save my child and see that you pay for what you've done.
- Paul...
- No, this is over, you understand?
We're gonna go to the police, and then we're gonna find someplace, anyplace that can help him.
- You're not going anywhere...
- Like hell I'm not!
That was an experiment.
That experiment failed.
We can always terminate and try again.
Terminate?
That's my son you're talking about.
Our son! He's yours because I gave him to you.
You stay away from him!
You hear me?
You stay away!
You were lucky to have him as long as you did.
You had nothing when I found you.
I gave you a child, a house, a job.
Anything in your life that you value, I provided.
You remember that, you... you ungrateful piece of shit!
Why, why, why didn't he listen?
Adam!
Adam?
Are you in here?
Adam, where are you?
Let go.
Let go of the axe.
Adam.
Adam.
Yes, Daddy?
Who are you?
Who are you right now?
I'm your son.
Come on, Max, throw it.
Throw it, come on.
Man:
Goes upstairs.
All right, if you guys can paint that out by Thursday, that'd be great.
- Mr. Duncan, that's gonna look great.
- Great.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
These are going downstairs.
Go, go, go!
Hey, how do you like your new room?
It's not finished yet.
Hey, kiddo, look...
It's a big change, we know.
But those doctors you've been working with, they all say this change could be really good for you, right?
Sweetie, you've been doing so great.
And I bet... in a new town, with new friends, you're gonna do even better.
I know.
Mrs. Duncan?
Coming.
Hey...
I got three boxes downstairs
And they're all labeled...
"Toys. "
How about you give me a hand unpacking 'em?
Yeah?
Man:
Where would you like these?
Oh, careful with that, it's going downstairs.
Hey, kiddo,
I thought you were...
Adam?
Ahh! God!
I thought you were coming down.
Are you all right?
You'd tell me if there was anything...
Nothing's wrong, Daddy.
I'm fine.
All right.
Trust me.
This is gonna be great for us.
Hey.
It's a place we can start all over.
They are an army unlike any other...
crusading across the stars toward a place called UnderVerse,
their promised land...
a constellation of dark new worlds.
Necromongers, they're called.
And if they cannot convert you, they will kill you.
Leading them, the Lord Marshal.
He alone has made a pilgrimage to the gates of the UnderVerse...
and returned a different being.
Stronger. Stranger.
Half alive and half...
something else.
If we are to survive, a new balance must be found.
In normal times, evil would be fought by good.
But in times like these, well,
it should be fought by another kind of evil.
Linin' him up for you. Port-side shot comin' up. Steady. Here we go.
Steady.
Take it. Take it!
Take the shot!
Shit!
Toombs, we're runnin' out of road!
Shut up! I got it! Again!
Now!
Toombs!
Riddick.
I don't know, Toombs.
Looks kinda tight.
Not where I'm sittin'.
This is the biggest payday ever,
So throw on a fresh pair of panties.
Let's get this right.
Three meters clearance port-side.
One and a half meters starboard.
We got a choke point comin' up.
What the shit was that?
Tags, you got eyes on Riddick?
Tags?
Jesus.
He just ghosted two guys, and I never even saw him.
What do you think, Toombs?
I mean, maybe we oughta just...
I think you're my new gunner.
Grab a Gat.
Stay on top of him this time.
You made three mistakes.
First, you took the job.
Second, you came light.
A four-man crew for me?
Fuckin' insulting.
But the worst mistake you made...
Empty gun rack.
- What's the bounty on my head?
- One mil.
- One-point-five.
- What slam pays 1.5 for a convict?
Private party.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Guy, guy! Easy! Anonymous.
- That's what the sheet said.
- What planet?
Helion Prime.
Whoa. Where you going'?
Last question.
And you better get this one right, merc.
Whose ship is this?
Mine?
Knew they'd come for me.
Took 'em five years, but I knew.
You don't expect these mercs to have any honor, any code.
But this new bounty from a holy man,
a guy whose neck I saved...
Well, lesson learned.
No such word as "friend. "
It can only end bad when you let someone get too close.
Bad for them.
So now it's back to all the brightness... and everything I hate.
I wonder if she'll be there.
Act like an animal and I'm gonna slot you up like one. This one is always in trouble.
I knew it!
I smell it.
Get in there!
Can we shut the goddamn noise?
They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep.
Brain shuts down in cryosleep.
- All but the primitive side.
- All but the primitive side.
The animal side.
All but the Furyan side.
Some of us still remember the true crime that happened here on Furya.
And once you wake... truly wake... you'll remember too.
Helion Prime is on alert condition four.
Unrecognized craft. You need to follow me to Spaceport Six for security inspections.
Hey! Do you hear me?
Follow me to Spaceport Six now!
Imam, pray for us.
It was confirmed two seasons back. Yes.
They're coming here.
I mean, are we next?
Militants storm...
Yes. But going to the underground shelters if it happens...
You're right.
That's what I thought too.
Are you staying or leaving?
It's the end of everything.
Everything!
Well, my neighbours...
Half my street is gone.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. I don't know.
Hood of the devil.
That's what someone called 'em.
Them? Who is them?
Some kind of new creature...
This is nonsense.
It's all nonsense.
So tall that it touches the clouds.
And there's nothing around this statue, this colossus. Nothing left.
It's their calling card.
Did you know all your doors were locked?
Five years ago,
I took two people off that planet...
A kid, Jack, who everyone else thought was a boy,
and a holy man...
searching for New Mecca.
Your wife...
She's in the shower.
I told one man... where I might go.
I showed trust to one man.
Did I make a mistake, Imam?
There is no simple answer.
Whatever was said was meant to give us a chance... a fighting chance.
Were it not for the threat of invasion,
I never would have betrayed you.
- I give you my word, Riddick.
- Riddick?
Riddick!
And a daughter...
- No!
- Whose name would be...
If you have issue with me, you let it be with me.
- You need not know their names.
- Ziza.
My name is Ziza.
Ziza.
- Cute kid.
- Did you really kill monsters?
The ones that were gonna hurt my father?
Such are our bedtime stories.
Go, Ziza. Go on!
So now who do I have to kill to get this payday off my head?
It is said the comet always precedes them... these world-enders.
The Coalsack planets are gone.
Eight million settlers missing.
The entire Aquilan System is gone too.
Helion Prime shares its sunlight with all worlds nearby.
If we fall, they fall.
And after that...
My God, how do I save my family?
Have you heard anything I've said?
You said it's all circling the drain... the whole universe.
- Right?
- That's right.
Had to end sometime.
The one you want is now here.
And whose throat is this?
If you cut my throat, I'll not be able to rescind the offer that brought you here.
Nor tell you why it's so vital that you did come.
The blade comes off when the bounty comes off.
This is Aereon, an envoy from the Elemental race.
She means you no harm.
There are very few of us who have met a Necromonger and lived to speak of it.
So when I choose to speak of it, you should choose to listen.
Necromonger.
It is the name that will convert or kill every last human life...
unless the universe can rebalance itself.
Maybe you should pretend like you're talkin' to someone educated in the penal system.
In fact, don't pretend.
Balance is everything to elementals.
Water to fire.
Earth to air.
We have 33 different words for it.
But now we have only time to speak of the balance of opposites.
There is a story, Riddick, of young male Furyans... strangled at birth... strangled with their own cords.
When Aereon told this story to the Helion leaders,
I told her of you.
- What do you know of your early years?
- Do you remember your home world?
- Where it was?
- Have you met any others?
Others like yourself.
Sister, they don't know what to do with just one of me.
Open up in there!
- Stand back!
- Open up!
They are searching houses!
They look for a man who came here today. They think he might be a spy.
- A spy?
- Did someone see him come here today?
- Did they?
- Lajjun, stop!
I will send them away.
But wait one minute, please.
Will you wait one minute to save worlds?
Not my fight.
So, you will leave us to our fate,
just like you did her.
Break it down!
Get him!
Come. Let us try to send them away.
Move it. Come on.
Leave us alone!
There is no one here!
You don't understand.
He can help us! He can help us!
Go!
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
- Get him!
- Where is he?
In there!
You mentioned her.
She, uh...
She went looking for you.
People died.
She went to prison.
I... I don't remember where.
But it was a world so hot you could not survive on the surface.
- Crematoria.
- Young Jack.
She thought of you as her older brother.
- She worshipped you.
- You were supposed to watch her.
She never forgave you... for leaving just when she needed you most.
She needed to stay away from me. You all do.
Riddick.
Are you gonna stop the new monsters now?
Furyans.
Defiant to the end.
No, no.
We go to the shelter.
We take only ourselves.
Stay close.
No!
Flight leaders, get all squads off the ground now.
We have heavy inbound.
Follow me in!
The next shelter.
This way!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
I'll see if it's safe.
- Stay back!
- Come, Ziza.
Come!
You following me?
Lajjun and Ziza!
- When it's over.
- Let me go. I must get to my family!
When it's over.
I borrowed a ship.
You can ride along, if you don't mind riding with a convict.
I thank you, but I must get my family across the river.
God willing, there is still a shelter I can get them...
I'm sure God has his tricks,
but getting out of places no one else can, that's one of mine.
Let's get your family.
Aah!
In here.
Get in.
Shh.
- Imam!
- Don't follow me.
There will be an afterlife for me.
Will there be for you?
Let's go replenish the ranks.
Never fails to inspire, does it?
Each time a dynasty falls.
Remember your place,
Dame Vaako.
My place is at your side, dear husband.
From here till UnderVerse come.
In this 'verse, life is antagonistic to the natural state.
Here, humans in all their various races... are a spontaneous outbreak... an unguided mistake.
Our purpose... is to correct that mistake.
Because there is another 'verse... a 'verse where life is welcomed and cherished.
A ravishing, ever-new place called UnderVerse.
But the road to that 'verse... crosses over the threshold.
Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!
What you call... death.
So it is this 'verse that must be cleansed of life, so that UnderVerse can populate and prosper.
Look around you.
Every Necromonger in this hall, every one of the Legion Vast that just swept aside your defenses in one night... was once like you.
Fought as feebly as you.
Every Necromonger that lives today... is a convert.
- There'll be no conversions!
- We all began as something else!
It was hard for me to accept, too, when I first heard these words.
But I changed.
I let them take away my pain.
- You betrayed your faith!
- Just as you will change...
when you realize that the threshold to the UnderVerse will be crossed...
only by those who have embraced the Necromonger faith.
For those of you who will right now... drop to your knees and ask to be purified.
- We will not renounce our faith!
- No one here will do what you ask.
It is unthinkable!
This is a world of many peoples, many religions!
And we simply cannot and will not be converted!
Then I'll take your soul.
Join him...
Or join me.
This is your one chance.
Take the Lord Marshal's offer and bow.
I bow to no man.
He's not a man.
He's the holy Half-Dead who has seen the UnderVerse.
Look, I'm not with everyone here.
But I will take a piece of him.
A piece you will have.
Stop him!
Irgun. One of my best.
If you say so.
What do you think of this blade?
I think it's a half-gram heavy on the back end.
In our faith, you keep what you kill.
Are you familiar to me?
Have we met on some distant field?
You'd think I'd remember.
You'd think I would too.
Take him before the Quasi-Deads.
Perhaps the breeder would do it... if somebody just asked him.
It is a rare offer.
A visit inside Necropolis.
It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful.
Let me show you the way.
Beautiful eyes.
Come.
The last six Lord Marshals have called this home.
Magnificent, isn't it?
- I might have gone a different way.
- True of us all.
Converts receiving the mark of the Necromonger.
They learn how one pain can lessen another.
There now.
That is just... perfect.
The more you resist them, the greater the damage will be.
A new one.
You've brought us a new one.
Interesting breeder.
Making entry.
This won't take long.
We've entered his neocortex.
- Ahh! The Riddick!
- Regress.
Scanning fresh memories.
Thoughts of someone called Jack.
Riddick!
She went to prison.
Now we find thoughts of an Elemental.
The one race that would slow the spread of Necromongers.
- Furyans.
- Furyans.
Where does he come from?
Who are his people?
These are the things I need to know.
We find energy.
You must settle your past.
We find Furyan energy.
- For all of us.
- He's Furyan!
Furyan!
A Furyan survivor!
Look at our world, at the graves of those who didn't escape 30 years ago.
There is no future until we settle our past...
for all of us who bear the mark.
Kill the Furyan! Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick! Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick.
Who is this man?
Find him. Whatever it takes. Find him!
Let me guess.
A five-man crew this time.
Couple of things you could have done better.
First, trash the locator beacon inside my ship... the one you jacked.
And second... and this is really the more important part... dust my dick when you get the chance.
- Any questions?
- Yeah.
What took you so long?
Let's go, big boy.
In and out, unsuspected and undetected.
Damn, I love a good smash-and-grab.
Not so fast. Not so fast.
Dickheads.
We're pickin' up fields here.
Unknown fields detected on hull.
I knew it. Here it comes.
This is some kind of scan.
I don't know.
Readin' our BTUs, maybe?
- Let's drop one.
- Dropping.
Decoy launched.
- Preparing to engage ion drive.
- So, where do we drop your merc-killin' ass?
Who's gonna pay the most for you now?
- Butcher Bay?
- Butcher Bay.
Ten minutes every other day on the dog run.
Protein waffles aren't bad.
Hey, how 'bout Ursa Luna?
Nice little double-max prison.
They keep a cell open for me... just in case I drop in.
You know the problem with these joints now?
Health clubs for waffle-eatin' pussies.
Maybe we should think about uppin' our game here a little bit.
Think about someplace truly diabolical.
What the hell is he thinkin' now?
He's thinkin' a triple-max prison.
A no-daylight slam.
Only three of 'em left in this system... two of 'em outta range for a shitty little under cutter like this one with no legs.
Leavin' just... one...
Crematoria.
That is what you had in mind, right, Toombs?
Hey, how does he know where we're goin', and we don't?
Dope it out.
I hate this run.
Just do it!
Don't know about this new crew of yours.
They seem a bit skittish.
Probably shouldn't tell 'em what happened to the last crew.
You know, you supposed to be some slick-shit killer.
Now look at you... all back-of-the-bus and shit.
I say we attack Helion Two next.
Take it straight into their teeth.
It'll cost you 20,000 heads, five warrior ships. Nothing more, I swear it.
While I do prize brute force, this approach is perhaps more artful.
Start at the end.
Go straight to Helion Five, the last planet in the system.
We approach from the night side.
Remove these cannon first, then attack the larger placements at speed.
We'll catch them on their rear flank.
And in ten days' time,
the rest of those worlds will tumble before us.
You see, as with most, their blind spot... is right behind them.
I've located an ion trail which leads off-world.
Then you should be off-world, Vaako.
I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.
Wherever Riddick has gone, you lens him out and cleanse him.
You.
You want me to take a frigate for one breeder?
Don't question it, Vaako!
Take it on faith.
He's always been unsettled around you... the Lord Marshal.
Unsteady.
Perhaps because he knows he's half the warrior you are.
Some say he's too artistic for the job.
I wouldn't be surprised if someone promoted him soon...
to full dead.
Take care what you say.
Should I say it softly?
So it sounds more like conspiracy?
Oh, why is it that when anyone breathes about the demise of him on the throne... everyone assumes a conspiracy?
Why isn't that just prudent planning?
When he is ready, he will name a successor.
Who?
Toal? Scales? The Purifier?
None of them... with the strength, the dignity, of Lord Vaako.
You can keep what you kill.
- Stop.
- That is the Necromonger way.
I said... stop.
His death will come in due time and not a moment sooner.
Why?
Because I serve him.
We all serve him. It's called fidelity.
It's called stupidity.
Well, finally some attention.
You have such greatness in you.
If only you could see it like I do.
You know what I want?
Today I came up behind him in perfect silence and he knew.
I wanna go down in Necropolis.
Right now.
His half-dead soul sensed I was behind him. He sees everything.
When no one is looking... when no one's around...
I'm gonna get down on my knees... while you sit on the throne.
- How unexpected.
- An Elemental.
- Here?
- One of the captives.
And why, after 30 years, should it be you?
He doesn't regard her as a captive, though.
Elementals... they talk of neutrality,
but they're all witches and spies.
Why else would they come and go like the wind?
But where has he gone?
Where is the Furyan hiding now?
You be the good warrior.
Go after this Riddick.
I'll find out why the Lord Marshal is so threatened by him.
Do you know you grind your teeth at night?
Sexy.
Destination reached.
Unlocking manual controls.
All right. I make 700 degrees on the day side,
300 below on the night side.
Let's not get caught in the sun.
If I owned this place and hell,
I'd rent this place out and live in hell.
- Blue angle... good.
- Stand by.
And...
Plotted course good.
Hit it!
Angle of approach, not good.
Look, Ma. No hands!
Party poppers!
I think I shit myself.
Skittish, Toombs. Very skittish.
Comfy?
When the ride's over, your goggles are mine.
Four-way split!
29.4 kilometers.
So, this is Riddick.
What in the bowels of Christ are you talkin' about, 700K?
Don't take this one, boss.
See? Anatoli here has a nose for trouble.
And this one, this Riddick guy...
Big, big trouble.
So, 700,000 is good money.
I'd take the money, Toombs.
The guild pays us a caretaker's fee for each prisoner each year.
We pay mercs 20% of that total fee based on a certain life expectancy.
How's about this?
You open that safe you got hidden behind the console there, show me the real books, then we figure out my cut.
Then I'll be on my way.
Open my books.
This is what you suggest?
Wasn't a suggestion.
These are dangerous days, if you believe the talk.
- Talk?
- About dead planets.
About some ghost army.
About them.
"Them"?
I'll run the numbers again.
It takes a couple of days, probably, so you can stay as my guest.
At least here, we are all safe.
- Yes?
- Yes, boss.
I'll give it a day.
One.
There are inmates...
and there are convicts.
A convict has a certain code.
And he knows to show a certain respect.
An inmate, on the other hand, pulls the pin on his fellow man.
Does the guards' work for them.
Brings shame...
To the game.
So, which are you gonna be?
Me?
I'm just passin' through.
Welcome to Crematoria.
Should I go for the sweet spot?
Left of the spine, fourth lumbar down, the abdominal aorta.
What a gusher.
How do I get eyes like that?
You gotta kill a few people.
Did that.
Did a lot of that.
And then you gotta get sent to a slam.
One where they tell you you'll never see daylight again?
Only there wasn't any doctor here who could shine my eyes, not even for 20 menthol Kools.
Was there anything you said that was true?
What are you gonna do, huh?
Go for the sweet spot?
Remember who you're talkin' to, Jack.
Jack's dead.
She was weak.
She couldn't cut it.
The name's Kyra now.
And I'm a new animal.
They can be quite a test, these deep runs... tests of our inner selves.
Don't you find that true?
Some men do.
Just being so far from the armada, the mind can start to fill with strange thoughts, doubts.
Don't you ever have doubts, Vaako?
- Doubts?
- About the campaign.
About Lord Marshal.
First and always,
I am a Necromonger commander.
So if you're here to test my loyalty, you succeed only in testing my patience.
Oh, no.
No, that's not why I'm here at all.
I'm so glad I could steal you away for a moment.
Doesn't it strike you odd?
Here we have the current Lord Marshal...
destroying entire societies, and yet he can't bring himself... to kill one stranded Elemental.
Why is that?
You don't pray to our god.
You pray to no god, I hear.
Elementals... we calculate.
Don't we all.
But now let's have first things first.
What of Riddick? In truth,
I don't know where he went.
In truth, I'm more interested in where he came from.
Watch your step.
I've always wondered, does an air Elemental fly?
Now do me a favour.
Calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive... and now cut them in half.
No, we can't fly.
But we glide very well.
Save your threats, Necromonger.
I would have told you about Riddick for the asking.
It concerns a foretelling, a prediction now more than 30 years old.
A young warrior once consulted a seer.
He was told a child would be born on the planet Furya... a male child...
who would someday cause the warrior's downfall.
Cause his untimed death.
Furya? Furya's a ruined world.
No life to speak of.
For good reason.
This young warrior mounted an attack on Furya, killing all young males he could find, even strangling some with their birth cords.
An artful stroke, wouldn't you say?
So this warrior, the one who tried to outwit the prediction, would later become...
That's why he worries.
...our Lord Marshal.
Which would make the man-child...
He worries he missed killing that child in its crib.
...Riddick.
- That's why it's so vital to him.
- Wait.
- It's about a prophecy.
- Wait! Wait!
Are you there?
You do what your lord asks.
You cleanse Riddick for him, and in doing so... you prove your undying loyalty.
And perhaps then he'll finally let down his guard.
Still here, I see?
I've been here 18 years.
See this?
I remember how gorgeous she was.
Well, gorgeous in a certain light.
And now, for the goddamn death of me,
I cannot remember her name.
Feeding time!
We're here for the rest of our unnatural lives.
Here they come!
Whatever you do, don't make eye contact.
Aaah!
It's an animal thing.
Check her for me.
She's always got a blade somewhere.
Hyah!
I don't think she likes being touched.
I'd take my wounded and go while you still can.
Is there a name for this private little world of yours, huh?
What happens there when we don't just run away?
You'll kill us... with a soup cup?
Tea, actually.
What's that?
I'll kill you with my teacup.
You know the rule. They aren't dead if they're still on the books.
Mmm.
Come on.
Death by teacup.
Damn. Why didn't I think of that?
I didn't come to play
"Who's the Better Killer?"
But it's my favourite game.
Haven't you heard?
- I heard you came lookin' for me.
- Is that all?
Then you missed the good part.
Hooked up with some mercs outta Lupus Five.
Said they'd take me on, teach me the trade, give me a good cut.
They slaved me out, Riddick.
Do you know what that could do to you when you're that age?
- When you're 12 years old?
- I told you to stay in New Mecca.
Did you not listen?
I had mercs on my neck.
I'll always have mercs on my neck.
I spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep 'em away from you.
And you go and sign up with the same fake badges... that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait.
What are you pitching, Riddick?
That you cuttin' out was a good thing?
That you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe?
You signed with mercs.
There was nobody else around.
Let's pop the cork.
Get some fresh air.
So they do go topside... to swap out air.
Interesting.
Who the hell are you?
When it happens, it'll happen fast.
Stay on my leg when I cut fence or stay here... for the rest of your unnatural life.
Nobody outs this place.
Nobody.
He ain't "nobody. "
Good news first.
Talked things over with my amigos here.
We'll cut you in for 775K.
Well, all right.
What's the bad news?
They close the local whorehouse?
No. The bad news is worse than that.
Much worse.
Our pilot, he saw this.
It crossed a shipping lane.
Any idea what this might be?
Never saw nothin' like it.
This ship charts back to Helion Prime.
You know, Anatoli's got a nose for trouble,
and he thinks trouble follows you here.
Look. We dusted our tracks and got the hell outta there.
There is no way we didn't lose them.
"Them"?
This is my prisoner. Mine.
Nobody else's.
And I want my money now.
So... you stole a prisoner... from "them"?
No.
Riddick. No!
Shoulda taken the money, Toombs.
You gonna kill me?
Mercs.
Some guards here, but this can't be all of them.
Check their slots in the back... and be careful.
Don't bother.
Guards ain't there.
They figured out the Necros are comin' for me.
Plan was to clean the bank, ghost the mercs, break wide through the tunnel.
And then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here... and took out the sled.
Guards took off on foot but rigged the door so no one could follow.
They'll take the one ship in the hangar and leave everyone else here to die.
How come you know all this shit?
You weren't even here.
'Cause it was my plan.
I shoulda taken the money.
Riddick!
What is this?
What is he thinking?
- Once that sun comes up...
- We'll last five minutes.
Five minutes. We ain't gonna last
30 seconds out there.
It'll light you up like a match.
20-mile buffer zone and 30 klicks to the hangar.
30 klicks over that terrain?
It's moving in the right direction.
We could make it.
Stay behind the night, ahead of the sun.
There's gonna be one speed... mine.
If you can't keep up, don't step up.
You'll just die.
Riddick?
Riddick?
Riddick?
Go, go! Go on! Go! Climb here!
Climb! Go! Go, go, go!
Boss!
Up there.
- Take a look.
- Because Anatoli says so?
Because his nose says so.
There's nothin' up here.
Oh, shit.
Riddick.
They're heading right for the volcano fields. They're going for our ship!
No chance do they get to the hangar first. No chance!
Next one! Next hole!
We'll catch 'em there!
No more run for you.
Where did the big guy go?
Ohh...
Close it!
What was that?
You don't care if you live or die?
If I kill them first, not really.
Maybe I do.
Keep moving!
Kyra?
- Kyra!
- What?
Get that ass moving!
Riddick?
Remember what I said about not caring if I lived or died?
You knew I was kidding, right?
"One speed. "
Temperature differential.
Your rope.
It's too late.
We're never gonna make it.
Your rope! Gimme your rope!
And your water. All of it!
Stay in the shadow of the mountain.
Don't wait for me. Run!
Riddick!
Aaah!
Where the hell is that hangar?
There it is.
Listen.
Let me guess. Necros.
And a whole lotta Necro firepower.
Shit! I hate not being the bad guys.
I figure we got three minutes before the sun hits us again, burns out this whole valley.
- Wait.
- We gonna do this or not?
Just wait.
Ellen.
Her name was Ellen.
I never really forgot.
Aaah! Boss!
- Remember that favourite game of yours?
- "Who's the Better Killer?"
- Let's play.
- Come on!
On the right!
Watch out!
Behind you!
Kyra!
Sybar!
No!
Aaah!
Get up. Get up!
Please get up.
So, you can kneel.
I think you know now.
I think you know who tore Furya apart.
This mark carries the anger of an entire race.
But it's going to hurt.
Kyra?
I was supposed to deliver a message to you... if Vaako failed to kill you.
A message from the Lord Marshal himself.
He tells you to stay away from Helion, stay away from him, and in return, you'll be hunted no more.
But Vaako will most likely report you as dead.
So this is your chance.
Your chance to do what no man has ever done.
The girl.
Where will they take her?
We all began... as something else.
I've done... unbelievable things... in the name of a faith that was never my own.
And he'll do to her what he did to me.
The Necromonger in me warns you not to go back.
But the Furyan in me... hopes you won't listen.
God knows... I've dreamed of it.
I have lost a Purifier...
but I have gained a first among commanders.
It is overdue, isn't it... that we acknowledge your many accomplishments,
your steady faith, and above all, your unflinching loyalty.
Obedience without question.
Loyalty till UnderVerse come.
Well done, Vaako.
This is a day of days.
Look more pleased, Vaako.
You have killed his enemy... and his suspicions.
I should have brought back his head.
You saw him unbreathing.
You saw him dead on the ground.
Riddick was no common breeder.
In a heartbeat he dropped 20 of my men.
All mysteries are not miracles, not even in this religion.
And if you say it is certain, then it is certain, and we've already said it, haven't we?
We have.
Now, tell me if it's true.
Tell me the Furyan is gone, and I can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps.
If he is dead,
I sense I'm not far from the same fate, being of no further use here.
Shouldn't I tell you that Riddick is still alive?
Don't try me, Aereon.
I could plough you under with the rest of Helion Prime.
No one really knows the future.
Then tell me the odds that Vaako met with success, that I will now be the one... who can carry his people across the threshold into UnderVerse, where they shall begin true life.
Tell me what I want to hear, Aereon, and maybe
I'll save your home world... for last.
- The odds are good...
- That?
That you will reach the UnderVerse...
soon.
Ascension protocol!
We still have numbers out there, Lord
Marshal... sweep teams, recon ships.
They would be hard-pressed to make it back...
Get my armada off the ground!
- You mean on Helion?
- I mean here, on this very ship!
Could you be wrong?
Mind fabricates fear.
Could you be wrong? Not so wrong as you when you left him alive!
It's twice a mistake.
Not only your failure, but now the report of success.
How do we salvage this? How? How?
Lord Marshal's got to be warned.
You will never see the UnderVerse!
He will kill us both before our due time.
I say give Riddick his chance.
If he is half of what you think, he can at least wound the Lord Marshal... and that is when you must act.
Just to take his place?
Just to keep what I kill?
- That is the Necromonger way.
- It is not enough!
Then you do it for the faith!
If he has fear, he has weakness.
If he has weakness, Vaako...
He is unworthy of lordship.
We do it for all Necromongers.
Protect the faith.
This can still be a day of days, but the timing... must be flawless.
Final protocol.
Execute on my order.
Go inside.
Are they leaving now?
Ziza! Go inside!
We found this Lensor dead.
Show me his last sight.
Commander Toal.
He won't escape twice.
Stay your weapons!
He came for me.
Consider this:
If you fall here now, you'll never rise.
But if you choose another way...
the Necromonger way...
you'll die in due time... and rise again in the UnderVerse.
Go to him.
It hurts... at first.
But after a while, the pain goes away, just as they promise.
- Are you with me, Kyra?
- There's a moment... when you can almost see the UnderVerse through his eyes.
It makes it sound perfect... a place where anyone can start over.
Are you with me, Kyra?
Convert now... or fall forever.
You killed everything I know.
Vaako.
Not yet.
Been a long time since I've seen my own blood.
These are his last moments.
Give me your soul.
Fuck you!
You're not the one to bring me down.
Now! Kill the beast while he's wounded!
Help me, Vaako. Kill him.
Vaako?
Forgive me.
Flawless.
No.
No-o-o!
Now what would be the odds of that?
I thought you were dead.
Are you with me, Kyra?
I was always with you.
I was.
You keep what you kill.
It's time to wake up...
...and get a life.
We live in a three-dimensional world.
Until now, the world of computing's been flat,
consisting of two-dimensional imagery.
Now, through the use of exclusive breakthrough technology,
ARC has made it possible for you to get a life.
A Life, where we can work and play
in a lifelike world of three-dimensional reality.
A Life, the living monitor. lmpressed?
Yeah, I am.
Would you put one of those in a box for me?
- Are you the lawyer?
- I'm Rita Dunne.
Obviously, no one from Nexim could be here today.
- I'd invite you in, but...
- Good luck, Mr. Jennings.
- I'll see you in two months.
- Yeah.
Home sweet home.
What do you think?
This is the exact same technology?
Not the exact same technology, no.
Ultimately, I decided to reconceive some of it.
Ultimately, I decided to reconceive some of it.
I never liked the way the monitor looked.
And then it occurred to me...
...who needs it?
Gentlemen,
I am the future of computing.
And I would like to present you
with Nexim's new Freedom Line of display technology.
New from Nexim.
Freedom is in your future.
Launch this now.
ARC is not gonna last.
Who said 100 percent market share's impossible?
Get me Marketing immediately.
This far exceeds our expectations.
Congratulations.
Well...
...thank you.
You understand, Mr. Jennings, you've done in two months what we've been trying to do for three years.
Sometimes it's easier if you work backwards.
Cheers.
You won't remember me, will you?
No.
That's too bad.
Marker reached.
OK.
We're now extracting his memory from the marker forward to the present.
Jesus, Rita.
Jesus Christ!
This is dangerous enough.
If this man's brain temp goes one C above 43, he's a veg.
Come on, Mike.
Here we go.
It's all clean.
Good morning, sunshine.
Hey, how you doing, big guy?
- OK?
- Yeah.
All right. Thank you. Take it easy.
Slow, slow, slow.
There's no hurry, OK?
- That's it. Good?
- Yeah.
Good man. Hey, Mike, look at me.
Look at me. Right here.
What's the last date you remember?
- October 19.
- Very good.
Mike, what's the last thing you remember?
The Red Sox made the playoffs.
OK. Let's get the legal out of the way, shall we?
Mr. Michael Jennings, under the terms of your non-disclosure agreement, you are considered never to have been an employee.
You also understand that all your work is the intellectual property of Nexim...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I never worked here. I never saw anybody. I never was here. I got it. ls my paycheck ready?
Alrighty.
- How you feeling, tiger?
- Good.
- Now let's hear you.
- All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Go! ln order to zero the full eight weeks
I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C.
- I'm fine.
- I'm saying it's getting harder, Mike.
- I said, I'm fine.
- You're slowing down. Come on.
I'd be faster if you'd shut up.
Show me what you've got, grasshopper.
That's it. That's more like it!
Yes! Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
Yes! Faster!
Beautiful!
Yes! One more! One more, Mikey!
See how you did that?
How you focused?
- Yeah. I focused on your face.
- You know you love me.
Come on. Don't be mean to the one who does everything for you.
Do you realize you've never once asked me what I see when I erase your memory?
Basically, the last two months just never happened for you.
What's to know?
20 hours a day in a clean room ripping off a guy's idea for a computer, selling it to somebody else.
What'd you do the last two months?
The last thing I remember is driving in Spain in the Aston Martin, learning to dive in Belize with what's-her-name.
The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days trip. It's great.
I mean, my memories are basically highlights.
It's good. It's a good life.
The stuff you erase, it doesn't matter.
What is it with guys like Rethrick?
He's gotta have everything, huh?
Say what you want about Jimmy, he started Allcom in his garage.
Wait, wait.
Don't you leave me alone.
What? You'll be fine. Talk. Mingle.
I don't want to mingle.
Hello.
I'm Michael.
I'm Rachel.
Rachel Porter. ls that Miss or Mrs.?
That would be Dr. Porter.
Doctor. Well, excuse me, doctor.
It's all right.
What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a biologist.
- Really?
Do you work for Jimmy?
It must be very top-secret biology that you practice.
Oh, yes. lsn't everything?
Let's go.
Excuse me?
I mean, I'm happy to continue blathering on, trying helplessly to charm you, but I thought maybe, you know, cut to the chase and just, you know, go somewhere.
I'll tell you what, Michael.
I'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine.
If you get the urge to have a real conversation, you'll know where to find me.
OK. Fair enough.
It was nice to meet you.
Giving up so easily?
You don't believe in second chances, now, do you? ln my experience, no, I don't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Mike.
- Jimmy.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.
- Come back this way.
- Sure.
Hey, Jimmy.
Now you're talking. Thank you.
Wait a second. lsaac, disable fire protection, please.
Alarm disabled.
I don't think you'd look good covered in foam. Even in that suit.
What's the pitch, Jimmy?
I know you're trying to sell me something. What is it?
When there was a time we were in school, we wanted to change the world.
I thought we wanted to save the world.
Well, that's semantics.
- What's the job, Jimmy?
- Can't tell you.
Other than to say that it involves optics.
And you get stock options for this one.
Get a real piece of the company.
What if it doesn't work?
I get a real piece of nothing.
I promise you, it won't fail.
How do you know that? ls this a real crystal ball?
I wish. The point is, I'll guarantee that you do eight figures.
- Minimum.
- What's the catch?
The job may require a little bit more time than you're used to.
- How much more time?
- Two years. Maybe three.
- You're kidding.
- Deadly serious.
Jimmy, that's impossible.
You can't do it.
The longest ever is eight weeks.
It was me.
Assuming it were possible, would you do it?
- Give up three years of my life?
- Not give up, trade.
Three years in return for the rest of your life.
One big paycheck. You're done.
A lot can happen in three years.
You blink, it'll be over.
Two seconds.
A heartbeat, then snap, you're rich beyond your wildest dreams.
One big paycheck. You're done.
Mr. Jennings. John Wolfe.
Welcome.
You won't be allowed to leave the grounds.
You'll be assigned a residence here on campus.
Your mail will be screened, no phone calls.
Anything you receive will have to be inspected.
OK.
I'll need your personal belongings.
Watch, wallet, anything else.
Nothing's allowed to be brought in.
These items will be returned to you when you pick up your paycheck.
Sorry. Those too.
- Mike, hey, you made it.
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Everything OK?
- Yep.
Sit down.
I assume Mr. Wolfe gave you all the fine print.
Yeah. He also took the last pair of sunglasses I've managed not to lose.
I'm sorry.
What is this?
It's for your memory wipe.
We inject you with an isotope, migrates to your brain serves as a marker.
Another injection erases everything back to the marker.
No barbaric cooking of the brain.
All right.
Wow.
- What have I gotten myself into?
- Let's go find out.
lnitiating Blue Script directory. lmpressive.
This used to be our smallest unit.
Now it's our most profitable.
Mr. Rethrick, may I speak with you for a moment?
- Have a look around. I'll be right back.
- OK.
Cycle complete.
Begin transmission of data.
All right! I give up! I give up.
Don't give up.
Dr. Porter. I guess I'm lucky you didn't use thunder and lightning.
True.
OK, well, I won't question your powers in the future.
Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.
I thought you said Marianne was on a plane.
She was planning to make the conference call from the plane, sir.
Look. I should probably apologize for my behavior the other day.
I get like that sometimes, and I shouldn't. I'm sorry.
Careful. You are in danger of sounding like you want a second chance.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.
- Say something else.
- Excuse me?
Say something nice.
Quick, otherwise I'll forget it.
Was that little breeze for our boy here?
Well, I owed him one. Now we're even.
Be nice, Mike's moving into the neighborhood.
Oh.
- See you around.
- OK.
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.
You can still back out.
No hard feelings.
No, I want to stay.
Michael Jennings, meet the other half of your team, Dr. William Dekker.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.
Gentlemen. Let's have a look at the next three years of your lives.
What happened?
Michael.
You're done.
- How long was it, Jimmy?
- It's been three years, Mike.
- How'd I do?
- You did good.
Your money's been transferred to your account at Reddy Grant.
You've got an appointment there at 1:00.
Just go home, do the paperwork.
When you feel up to it, give me a call.
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
Ninety-two million dollars.
Everyone at Reddy Grant appreciates your business.
Well, not as much as I appreciate my business, I promise you.
OK.
Just sign there.
- All right.
- Great.
- Your personal items.
- Yes.
You only needed four stamps.
Oh, well, guess I could afford the extra 50 cents.
I don't think this is my stuff.
- It's not?
- No.
- I don't know what happened.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.
Let's talk about my shares.
What I'd like to do is get some money now, and, you know, put the rest away for long term, to live off.
So how do we do that?
Mr. Jennings, you forfeited your shares.
I beg your pardon? What?
Yeah, here. Dated four weeks ago.
You surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals.
- Don't you remember doing that, sir?
- No.
I don't remember that, because I didn't do that.
Why would I do that? I wouldn't do that. It doesn't make sense.
A mistake has been made, and it needs to be corrected.
- I agree. It's a strange thing you did...
- It's not strange.
Strange is a little out of the ordinary, but still plausible.
Giving away $100 million in shares in a Fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn't strange, it's insane.
No one would do that.
Doesn't make sense.
Unless you think this is a $40-million can of hair spray, which is pink.
What, this is a $100-million book of matches?
I've been out of it a few years. ls this back in style now?
Are these $100-million sunglasses?
I'll look into it, but it's gonna take me some time.
This is crazy. I'm gonna make some phone calls.
Mr. Rethrick's office.
- It's Michael Jennings. It's important.
- I'm sorry, he stepped away.
He won't be back until this afternoon.
I can try him on his cell phone.
Just have him call me as soon as he gets in. OK?
- OK.
- Thank you.
Listen, guys, a mistake has been made here. All right?
- I'm not a traitor. I'm an engineer.
- A reverse engineer, right?
We know that you accepted payment of classified government technology.
Mike, that's called treason. ln this country, people get fried for that one. ln this country when the FBl harasses you, you also get an attorney.
Not today you don't.
What the hell is this?
The attorney general calls me and says that Michael Jennings' cooperation is a matter of national security.
Look, first of all, that stuff isn't mine, OK?
A mistake...
What is...?
Perfect fit. You were saying?
Well, let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we're solving.
William Dekker, government physicist, weapons division.
Three years ago, his project gets shelved.
He didn't like that, so he sold his work. Classified work.
Showed it to several corporations.
We think Rethrick bought it.
Unfortunately, we can't link Rethrick to the sale, because Dekker died.
Natural causes.
''Natural'' being gravity after a 1 40-foot fall out of his apartment building.
What does this have to do with me?
Patent applications filed this month.
They show designs based on Dekker's work.
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents.
Get it?
It's your name on those patents!
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design.
You need to tell us everything you did for Rethrick.
- I can't.
- You'd rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend?
- Help us, and we can work with you.
- I can't. I can't!
He wiped my memory!
I don't remember!
I'll tell you whatever I know.
I was set up. Believe me.
I don't remember what I did for the past three years!
What?
Wait a second!
Wait!
We figured Rethrick tried a wipe, so we'll try an extraction.
You're not gonna see anything.
You're wasting your time.
We're getting something here.
Come on!
Come on!
Shit.
We got nothing.
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.
Boss.
He won't mind.
- Smoke!
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!
- I can't see anything!
Secure the door!
Where the hell is he?
- He's loose!
- Don't worry, he can't go anywhere!
Cover the door!
I'll get the lights!
I can't see!
Get low to the ground!
Stay low to the ground!
Mitchell!
See anything?
- ls that him?
- Klein, where'd you go?
Al, shut the door!
What's going on?
Good night, Mikey.
Copy that.
- Watch it, coming through!
- Go! Go! Go!
- Coming through!
- Out of the way!
- See him?
- I see him!
- Out of the way, lady!
- There!
Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through!
- Let's go!
Excuse me.
Coming through!
- Out of the way! Open those gates!
- Watch it, man.
Come on! Come on!
Where did he go?
I'll get men at every stop!
He'll be long gone by then!
How the hell did he do that?
- Sorry.
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
- Be careful.
Hey! Hey!
Watch it!
Hey! Hey!
Jane. Relax.
Everything's fine.
You talked to federal agents.
It's OK.
It's been worked out now.
I just need to find out who sent these items.
Will you help me out?
- They were sent three years ago.
- No. There was a mix-up.
Somebody else sent these. I need to find out who that is and talk to them.
Replacements were sent a few weeks ago.
- Who sent it?
- Well, you did.
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.
I'm gonna need all your personal belongings.
Michael Jennings died at three minutes after 3.
The government, left with no case, closed its investigation of Allcom.
So you see, it's impossible that he escaped unless you changed something.
I didn't.
- What were you doing, exactly?
- I was eating pie.
He left the attorney's office exactly when it predicted.
The Feds took him exactly when it predicted...
But he didn't die like it predicted!
Michael Jennings is not a super agent.
He's an engineer.
Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double-locked room.
How? Was it fate?
No, fate was on our side.
That means someone changed something. And it wasn't me.
And if it wasn't you, then who the...?
Has anyone checked the machine since Michael walked out of here?
Find him.
''If you only look where you can't go,
''you will miss the riches below.''
Yeah, I'm already missing my riches.
A combination? A code?
A password?
''New Liberty Savings.''
New Liberty Savings Bank, please.
What does that mean?
You're saying the bank doesn't exist?
That's comforting.
Who sent these items?
You did.
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.
These are patent applications.
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents!
A mistake has been made here.
I'm not a traitor!
Dekker died!
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design.
Believe me! I don't remember what I did for the past three years!
Michael.
Michael.
You're done.
Hello?
Jesus, Shorty.
You don't know how good it is
- to hear a familiar voice.
- Michael?
Listen, man.
I'm in a... I'm in a jam, and I need you.
All right.
All right.
Meet me at Union Station at 9:00.
- I'll be there.
- OK, buddy.
Outbound local from Seattle to Kent departing from track five.
Eastbound Spokane, gate ten.
Michael.
Say one word about this hat and I'm out of here.
Oh, man!
Oh, my God.
I told you not to take that job, Mike.
- Come on, let's get a table.
- OK.
- lnjections?
- Yeah.
You would have to do it that way, I guess.
But, of course, that's a chemical process.
So?
Well, you'd have some latent memories.
Maybe that's what I'm seeing.
Most likely. Memories that made it through the wash, stirred up when the feds went in your head.
Why would I have these things?
Explain this.
I sent myself this junk instead of the money.
Oh, brother.
I don't know.
That's not the question you should be asking.
- No?
- No. You should be asking yourself, why did you give up all that money?
That's the most bizarre part of this whole thing.
Ninety million dollars. Nobody changes that much in three years.
OK, all right, buddy.
I wanna figure out what you built.
All right, let's work backwards.
They told me I was working on a design by someone named Dekker.
- Dekker?
- Yeah.
- William Dekker?
- I think so.
What I heard was, he was working on something level five for the feds.
They came in, shut him down.
- What was it?
- Well, the consensus was a laser.
- Why?
- Because Dekker's drawings called for a mirror and a lens.
The only thing that uses those is a laser or a satellite camera to see things from far away.
Here comes the first number, 1 7.
Followed by 44.
- The lens required perfect optics.
- Four.
- The mirror...
- Twenty-six.
- So the capital outlay is huge.
- Thirty-seven.
- Word was it was gonna cost
- Forty.
- 500 billion dollars.
- And
the bonus number is 22.
Who's gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something?
What?
No way I get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses.
I would've never gotten on the bus without the ticket.
If I didn't have the ring, I wouldn't have followed that kid to Reddy Grant.
- Right.
- I gave up that money just to make sure that I would pay attention to these items.
Why?
Because I know what you'd spend 500 billion dollars to see.
The future.
If you selected five numbers
and the bonus number, you're a second-prize winner.
He used a virus.
The machine went down at 3:03 this afternoon.
Can you program around the virus?
No. It's not that kind of virus.
Come on, I'll show you.
It's not in the software.
It's in the hardware.
He put a circuit somewhere in here.
It's like a poison pill.
But you can find it, right?
Yeah, I can.
Then do it.
Slight change of plans.
According to Mr. Stevens, we don't need Jennings.
Look, if we know anything, we know that time travel's not possible.
Einstein proved that, right?
Time travel, yes.
But Einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing
- theoretically could be accomplished...
- Mike, Mike. Come on.
Maybe we should just find Dekker...
- I can't talk to Dekker.
- Why not?
- He had an accident.
- An accident?
Yeah, he...
He fell out of his bedroom window.
Fell out of...?
He fell out of his bedroom window!
I see. Sure.
That could happen.
Jesus. Wait a minute!
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Shorty, listen to me.
I think what happened was I used this thing,
I saw my future.
And I saw what I needed to change it.
But all I could get out of Allcom were these innocuous items.
Each item has to be used at a specific time and place to accomplish whatever
I needed to get done.
I mean, without the stuff in here,
I'd already be dead.
Yeah, well, it's too bad that you don't know what the rest of them are for.
What?
Gotcha!
Hey!
Great seeing you again, Mike!
Jesus!
Those guys do not look like feds.
Here. Listen to me.
Take this.
This will get you through that door.
Close it behind you. Understand? Go!
- OK!
- Go! Go on!
Shit!
Go!
Oh, God, I hope that was a good thing to do.
Shit.
Go.
Where's your gun?
He's got it.
So...
...how are you, Mike?
You?
Why?
Don't remember?
You brought this on yourself, Mike.
So how does it feel knowing you're going to die?
Shit.
He designed his own escape?
Mr. Attorney General, sir, we have no explanation.
After looking at the evidence the only logical, albeit hard-to-accept conclusion, is he was able to predict what was going to happen to him.
These are memories extracted from Jennings before he fled.
They don't seem to add up to anything.
Gladys.
That's all for today.
We knew Dekker was trying to design something, but when he sold his plans, he wasn't even halfway done.
I don't understand.
Dekker was working at JPL on a laser-enhanced lens.
He claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe.
He believed if you could see around a curve that went on forever you would end up back where you started, looking at yourself.
Except you're not looking at yourself now, in the present.
No, you are not.
You're looking at the future. lmagine what will happen if Jennings figures it out and tries to profit from it.
- Any nation will give a king's ransom.
- He won't do that.
I was this close. He never lied.
When he was accused he was hurt and scared.
Bring him in,
I'll give him the Medal of Honor.
That's if Rethrick doesn't find him first.
You think he really saw the future?
That would be something.
Café Michel?
My name is Michael Jennings.
And I can't remember if I made a reservation there recently.
Would you check that out for me?
Thanks.
I did?
OK.
Right. How many is it for?
Oh, no, thank you.
No, I'll be there.
Thank you.
Hello, you two.
Did he feed you?
Rachel, it's Jimmy.
- You all right?
- Why?
You don't know?
No.
May I come in?
When was the last time you saw Michael?
Yesterday morning.
He was pulling an all nighter at his lab.
Rachel, I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this.
Michael left Allcom yesterday.
Permanently.
- What?
- He finished his work.
- We erased his memory, and he...
- No.
- He left.
- No. He promised me.
He said he wasn't going to go through with it.
He made a lot of money on this one, Rachel.
He said he didn't care about the money.
So she doesn't know anything.
He wouldn't leave without her.
It's Michael. He'd be smart.
We're missing something.
Soon as she leaves for work, get in there.
Make sure she can't go anywhere alone.
I want to know what just happened.
Bye, guys.
Good morning, Dr. Porter.
Going somewhere?
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm going to go up top.
Take my bag.
- You're gonna need this.
- Got it. Thanks.
Coming?
No, thanks.
I'd rather watch from down here.
Suit yourself.
We've been through the bathroom and the rest of the apartment. Zero.
This is what I want you to do.
Go back in the bathroom.
OK, start turning left.
Tell me what you see.
The mirror.
We've got him.
She's supposed to meet him at Café Michel, 1 p.m.
Well, let's make sure she does.
I'm here to meet someone.
Michael Jennings.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Sit at that table right there. ln the seat, with your back to the window.
Michael, thank God you're all right.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.
Michael, it's me.
Rachel.
Look...
You can't remember me.
No. I'm sorry.
Cops. We can't go in.
I'll have to wait for a clear shot.
Maya, stall for time.
Tell him you thought he'd remember something.
That you two were engaged.
I guess I thought you'd remember something.
We've been together for three years.
I don't know what to say.
I'm really sorry.
I'm trying.
That's how he's doing this.
Listen to me very carefully, Maya.
This is what I want you to say.
Michael, I can see you still have the envelope.
That means it's working.
I know you switched the personal items. I helped.
- You left me a note on a mirror.
- You left me a note on a mirror.
I'm supposed to take something.
Something I can use to get to Stevens.
- He's a man you worked with.
- He's a man you worked with.
He's trying to fix the machine.
Work backwards, Michael.
Yeah. Take the swipe card.
That's the swipe card for the campus.
You're supposed to give that to me.
Rachel wouldn't be hurt if he hesitated, she'd be impatient.
Look, Michael, if you can't trust me right now, then we are lost. For good.
Nice.
OK.
I'd better get back.
They'll get suspicious soon.
Wait here.
I'll be back in half an hour.
And don't worry, we end up together.
Michael...
I love you.
- What's my favorite baseball team?
- What?
What's my favorite baseball team?
Who cares?
Who cares?
That would be the Red Sox.
- I think maybe we should go.
- Wait!
Now we can leave.
Come on.
Wait! Hold on.
- You have a car?
- I might.
You might?
Look for a BMW!
You gotta be joking.
Shit! Shit!
- Let me see that key.
- Why?
You're in the wrong section.
Jennings bought the BMW on the lnternet.
He had the key mailed to him four weeks ago.
- What's the color of his car?
- It isn't a car.
They just turned on Pine. lntercept them on Sixth.
- How good am I on this thing?
- You're OK!
- Look, I just said you're OK, OK?
- OK.
Hang on!
- Report of shots. Southgate BMW.
- Got it.
Stop! I lost the envelope!
- I'll come back and get you.
- See you!
Got it!
Let's get out of here.
Take us down!
Mike, we can help you!
We know what's going on!
Let us bring you in!
He's headed for the tunnel!
Cut him off! Cut him off!
Duck!
Split!
You think Jennings foresaw that?
Maybe next time he'll see a nice quiet stakeout.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's OK.
It's all for you anyway.
And I...
I brought you some clothes.
I thought you might need them.
I hope it's OK.
Thank you.
These are mine?
You don't remember?
No.
You don't remember me, do you?
Well...
These are for you.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
You're so sweet.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just don't remember.
I shouldn't have left.
You're saying he sent himself a different set of personal items after using the machine, and nothing our security would flag.
Everyday things combined with the power of foresight transform Michael from engineer to escape artist.
I don't know about you, but I'd like to return the favor.
Michael, are you OK?
I'm all right.
Michael, I don't know what you saw in your machine, but I remember, a few weeks ago, you came back from your lab, pale.
You asked me the strangest question.
- What?
- If I knew it wouldn't work out for you and I, before we were together, would I have done it?
What did you say?
That I wouldn't trade our time for anything.
That's all we are, the sum of our experiences.
Besides, some of the best things in life are total mistakes.
- What?
- You know, when I checked this envelope out, they told me I signed in 20 items, but there were only 19.
I don't understand.
What are these pictures of?
Michael, look at the rest of the pictures.
Look at the last one.
Oh, my God. It's the future.
The machine predicts a war, and we go to war to avert it.
It predicts a plague. We herd all the sick together, create a plague.
Whatever future this predicts, we make happen.
We give over control of our lives completely.
I did this.
Seeing the future will destroy us.
If you show someone their future,
they have no future.
You take away the mystery, you take away hope.
I have to go back.
I have to destroy that machine.
It's impossible. The campus is huge.
There are hundreds of guards.
I wouldn't have given up the three years we had unless I was sure
I could get us 50 more.
OK. So how do we get in?
- We don't.
- You said everything was happening for a reason, and that includes me being here.
So come on.
Hey, Rachel.
Another day at the most.
I don't have many places to look.
I guess you weren't as smart as you thought, Stevens.
Hey, Jennings wouldn't find it any faster unless he knew where to look.
We've got the feeds from mass transit.
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Except he's not running away.
He could've given himself a way to disappear, but look what he gave himself instead.
His Allcom security pass.
He's going back.
Get a warrant to tap phone and data lines coming out of Allcom.
Put some bodies on that campus.
I want that machine!
Jennings and the girl were spotted.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.
- Stay where you are.
- Nobody gets through!
- Sir!
- I didn't do anything!
Settle down!
All the metal detectors on level four just went off. Ball bearings.
Just down the hall from the metal detectors.
Pull the guards off the Jennings lab.
Let him slip in, think he's fooled us.
Once he's fixed the machine, take him.
I built this.
This door shouldn't be open.
There's something wrong.
They're expecting us.
Better close this door behind us.
And keep it shut.
- He's in.
- Confirmed. He's in.
Once we confirm he's at the machine, let's go after him.
I thought we were gonna wait for him to come out.
I can't wait! Jennings or the machine, I don't care, as long as I get one. Let's go!
This will do. Watch out.
- What are you doing?
- Smashing the lock.
Hold on a second.
You can't just smash the thing.
They'll still be able to get in.
We gotta jam the outside reader.
Let's go.
Let's take a look at the future before we destroy this thing.
I bugged it. I rigged it so Jimmy wouldn't use it against me.
Then you can fix it, right?
Now, where would I have planted that bug?
Maybe on one of the motherboards.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we won't be needing this, OK?
You're dangerous with that thing.
You must have given yourself something to help you find it.
The only things left are the bullet and...this.
- Crossword?
- Yeah.
Look at this.
Twelve down.
Maybe it's here.
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Let's take a look.
Maybe it's a circuit diagram.
I wouldn't have put it in the primary path.
Twelve down.
Take him.
OK, corridor three, sublevel A,
Jennings' lab.
All right, let's put this thing to good use one last time.
Let's get us out of here.
That's in the lab.
It's the catwalk.
Look, I've changed my future before, using this thing. I can do it again.
Don't have time. Gotta destroy this before they get it.
Reprogram the door to Jennings' lab, please.
Now.
He must've done something to the controller.
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- I don't know.
Clear!
- What are you doing?
- These are liquid hydrogen.
They're used to cool the machine.
They fire in order.
Number one just fired.
When it gets down to number six here, that's all she wrote.
I'll see you when this goes off, Jimmy.
Come on!
You see?
You judge too soon.
They went out through the vent.
Spread out, find them.
Position three standing by.
Come on.
Freeze!
Look out.
Seal off all exits to the lab.
All right, Jennings, let's see what you've been up to.
Rachel, go for the door, OK?
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun.
Looks like Michael's got a date on the catwalks.
Let's make sure he makes it.
- Let's go.
- We can't take the catwalk.
I know. We won't, I promise.
Come on, let's go.
- Michael! What are you doing?
- Go. I'll distract them.
- Go, please.
- No!
Listen to me. This is my debt.
I built this machine.
- I have to pay for it.
- You come with me now!
You promised you'd change your fate!
Please, we don't have time.
If you love me, if you care about me, go. Have a good life.
Remember me.
Damn you.
Jimmy.
You want to kill me, come do it yourself.
Here I am. You want me?
Come get me.
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Mike.
- Looks like this is it, huh?
- It is, Mike.
- You only have yourself to blame.
- That's a lie.
You can't change your fate.
You're gonna die today.
Maybe.
But you're not going to kill me.
That's right, Mike.
I've seen the future.
Still think you can change your fate, Mike?
I am the future, Mike!
- Rethrick has Jennings.
- Retire him.
- What?
- We have the machine.
We can't risk its creator falling into the wrong hands. Come on.
Don't blame me.
You and Michael would've lived happily ever after, no memory wipe.
He saw something he didn't like.
He's the one who decided he wanted to stop the program.
Look at it this way, you did change the future, Michael.
Before you interfered you both would've lived and we would still be friends, instead of ending up like this.
It wasn't meant to be.
Giving up so easy?
Don't you believe in second chances?
To tell you the truth, I do.
Go, go, go.
Rachel!
Let's go.
Look.
Any records? Any papers?
Explosion destroyed everything.
- Are we trying to salvage that or what?
- I guess we don't get the machine.
Any sign of Jennings?
No, I'm afraid he didn't make it.
What was Shorty thinking, starting a nursery?
I mean, these plants are on life-support.
What do you mean? Really?
He told me he had a green thumb.
Gangrene is more like it.
Lucky for Shorty, I'm a biologist.
Lucky for both of us.
Since I failed biology,
- I'm no help to either one of you.
- So you say.
Too bad, though, because I'm looking for a partner
- for a start-up company.
- Really? Doing what?
We're gonna save the world.
I don't think I'm your guy.
But would you settle for someone who wants to help you change it?
- OK.
- Good.
So how does it end for us, Michael?
I mean, what's in our future?
You know, I don't know.
I kind of like it that way.
- I do know one thing.
- What's that?
I never want to forget anything ever again.
Break it up, break it up.
The birdman cometh.
- Shorty.
- It's dinner.
- You found them.
- Yes, I did.
- Who does everything for everybody?
- You do.
- You're right.
- You're my hero.
Thank you very much.
- You hear that? I'm a hero.
- That's great.
I think I remember.
Are those our birds?
Yes, of course they are.
We bought them together.
You remember the birds? Well done.
You could see into the future and all you remember are Polly and Tweety there.
Why not remember something that'd make us rich?
- Wait a second.
- What is it?
- I think there was something else.
- No, no, no.
The envelope's empty.
Don't worry about it.
Hold on. I'm working backward here.
''If you only look where you can't go, you will miss the riches below.''
I must've known you'd never get rid of these birds.
Of course not. They're family.
So I knew this would be here.
What only looks where it can't go?
A caged bird.
''You will miss the riches below.''
The riches below.
What is that?
Well, that's a $90-million lottery ticket.
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- It's $90 million.
- Nice.
- Yes, I'm proud of it.
Wait a minute. No.
- Wait.
- What are you doing?
You know what?
I think now's a good time to discuss my commission, 33%.
- I thought it was 5.
- No, 33.
- Thirty-three percent!
- He deserves it.
It was found on my premises.
I'll get back to you.
I'm gonna cash this in.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, my God!
I'm in.
We're almost there.
-Sir, are you sure about this?
-I told you, we're going to be all right.
I understand, sir. It's just that...
...I'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here.
-Link.
-Yes, sir?
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...
...for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.
However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
What's that, sir?
To trust me.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
-I mean, I do, sir.
-I hope so.
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast.
Yes, sir.
Still can't sleep?
You wanna talk?
They're just dreams.
If you're afraid of something....
I just wish....
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
That's all.
I just wish I knew.
She's gonna call. Don't worry.
Here you are.
-Are we ready to go?
-We're already late.
These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris.
The machines are digging.
They're boring from the surface down to Zion.
-Mother--
-They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
How fast are they moving?
Control estimates their descent at 1 00 meters an hour.
-How deep are they?
-Almost 2000 meters.
-What about the scans from the Osiris?
-They can't be accurate.
-They may be.
-It's not possible.
That'd mean there are a quarter-million sentinels.
-That's right.
-That can't be.
Why not?
A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion.
That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me.
Morpheus, glad you could join us.
Niobe.
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...
...it's become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position.
-Squiddies got our best spots.
-Lines are crawling with them.
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.
We'll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.
And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
A strategy is still being formulated.
I' m sure it is.
What do you think we should do, Morpheus?
-We should proceed as ordered...
-What is it?
I don't know.
...however, I must ask one of you for help.
Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not. Those of you that do...
...know we are nearing the end of our struggle.
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...
...the Oracle must be consulted.
If we return and recharge now...
...we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth.
Do you understand what you're asking?
I am asking that one ship remain here in our place...
...in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us.
Bullshit. You're asking one of us to disobey a direct order.
That's right, I am. But we well know that the reason most of us are here...
...is because of our affinity for disobedience.
What happens when you get back to Zion...
...and the commander throws you in the stockade?
He won't.
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain't never gonna change.
Shit, I'll do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you.
You got 36 hours.
I'm looking for Neo.
-Never heard of him.
-I have something for him.
A gift.
You see, he set me free.
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
-Who was that?
-How did you know someone was here?
He gave you this.
He said you set him free.
Is everything all right, sir?
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.
-Agents are coming.
-Agents?
Go.
Hiya, fellas.
-It's him.
-The anomaly.
-Do we proceed?
-Yes.
-He is still--
-Only human.
Upgrades.
-That went as expected.
-Yes.
It's happening exactly as before.
Well, not exactly.
-What happened?
-I can't figure it out.
Agents just came out of nowhere.
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.
-ls Neo okay?
-Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
Where is he now?
He's doing his Superman thing.
Where are you?
This is the Nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through Gate Three.
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.
Roger that, Control.
This is Control requesting immediate stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach. Let's open her up.
You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.
Roger that, Control.
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.
No place like it.
Roger that, Control. Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.
Understood.
Captain Mifune.
Captain Morpheus.
Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
-l' m just here to keep the peace.
-Commander Lock demands--
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
-Link.
-Sir?
I want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.
Understood, sir.
-What is it between them?
-Morpheus and Lock?
-Niobe.
-Captain Niobe?
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.
What happened?
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.
Yeah, she can do that.
Neo!
-Oh, no.
-How does he always know?
Doesn't he have anything better to do?
You know what they say about the life you save.
I didn't save his life.
Hiya, Neo.
-Trinity, Link.
-Hey.
-It's great to have you back.
-Thanks. It's good to be back.
-Can I carry that for you?
-No, I can carry my own bag.
-Trinity?
-I'm fine.
-You can carry these.
-Yeah, sure, Link.
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
I've been thinking about it, and I've made my decision.
Let me guess.
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus hasn't filled the other positions, except for you, Link.
I' m sure he has reasons...
... but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be.
You know, it's fate.
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.
You saved yourself.
-Morpheus.
-Commander Lock.
I spoke to the other captains.
I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions.
I wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation.
You were given an order...
-...to return to Zion.
-I did.
You asked for one ship to remain behind.
I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.
So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.
We need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.
I don't want to hear that shit!
I don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs!
I care about one thing: Stopping that army from destroying this city.
T o do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.
With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city.
How?
-Neo.
-Goddamn it, Morpheus.
Not everyone believes what you believe.
My beliefs do not require them to.
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's talking. A lot of people are scared.
No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked.
-Something big is happening, isn't it?
-Hey.
We're not allowed to say anything, so stop asking.
Goddamn, it's good to be home.
I'm recommending that you be removed from duty.
That is, of course, your prerogative, commander.
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.
-Councillor Hamann.
-Commander.
-Captain.
-Councillor.
Council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering.
The presence of the fleet...
...and the persistence of rumors must be addressed.
The people must be told what is happening.
Of course, councillor.
But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details.
-We do not wish to start a panic.
-Quite right.
A panic is not what anyone wants.
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?
The truth. No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear.
That army won't reach the gates of Zion.
-What makes you so sure?
-Consider what we have seen, councillor.
Consider that in the past six months...
...we have freed more minds than in six years.
This attack is an act of desperation.
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end.
I hope you're right, captain.
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor.
It is simply a matter of time.
My stop.
See you soon.
Hopefully not too soon.
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.
-How long do we charge the Neb?
-Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
-Please, watch over him.
-I'll try.
I have a daughter on the Icarus.
No, wait.
It's all right. They need you.
-I need you.
-I know.
There's time.
Where's my puss--?
-Hey!
-Uncle Link!
God!
Uncle Link!
Oh, my God! You're so huge!
-You should be picking me up!
-No!
-Yeah!
-Okay!
Okay? All right.
Now, we're gonna have to work together here, okay?
One, two, three, lift!
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?
Come on, kids. It's time to go.
-Hey, Cas.
-Hey.
-Good to have you home, Link.
-Good to be home.
You be careful with her.
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.
Out the door! Both of you, march!
-Bye!
-Bye!
I'm gonna get what?
Every ship up there's been home two...
...even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.
-We'll be when you operate another ship.
-I can't do that.
-Why?
-You know why.
If Dozer knew how I felt, he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
Maybe. But it's too late now.
I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade.
-It's not fair.
-Nobody said it was gonna be.
You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
I'm afraid of it.
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
It won't.
How can you say that to me?
Because of Morpheus.
Because of what he's told me. He said that this is it, that it will be over soon.
-Link, Morpheus is crazy.
-No doubt.
But T ank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...
...after being on that ship and seeing
Neo do the things he can do...
...I gotta say...
...I'm starting to believe him too.
Be careful, Link.
Please be careful.
They started yet?
Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
Tonight, let us honor these men and women.
These are our soldiers, our warriors.
These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters...
...our children.
Let us remember those that have been lost...
...and let us give thanks for those that have been found...
...and who stand here beside us.
Now I would like someone else to close this prayer...
...someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time...
...but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear.
I give you Morpheus.
Zion! Hear me!
It is true what many of you have heard.
The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak...
...that army is drawing nearer to our home.
Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us.
But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it.
I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid.
Why?
Because I believe something you do not?
No!
I stand here without fear because I remember.
I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me...
... but because of the path that lies behind me.
I remember that for 1 00 years we have fought these machines.
I remember that for 1 00 years they have sent their armies to destroy us.
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:
We are still here!
T onight...
...Iet us send a message to that army.
T onight, let us shake this cave.
T onight, let us tremble these halls...
...of earth, steel and stone.
Let us be heard from red core to black sky.
T onight, let us make them remember:
This is Zion and we are not afraid!
I remember.
I remember you used to dance.
I remember you were pretty good.
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...
...that will never change.
Niobe!
Some things do change.
Excuse me.
-I missed you.
-I can tell.
I was thinking, everyone is here.
Follow me.
Neo, what is it?
What's wrong?
It's okay, you can tell me.
Trinity....
Don't be afraid.
I can't lose you.
You're not gonna lose me.
You feel this?
I'm never letting go.
Good night, Zion.
Sweet dreams.
-You all right?
-I'll make it.
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.
You first.
-Oh, God.
-"Smith" will suffice.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Care for some company?
-Councillor Hamann.
I don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone.
-No, I could probably use some company.
-Good.
So could l.
It's nice tonight.
Very calm.
It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully.
Not everyone.
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.
I figure I slept the first 1 1 years of my life, now l' m making up for it.
-What about you?
-I just haven't been able to sleep much.
-It's a good sign.
-Of what?
That you are in fact still human.
Have you ever been to the engineering level?
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.
-Would you like to see it?
-Sure.
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.
I like it down here.
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.
These machines are keeping us alive...
...while other machines are coming to kill us.
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...
-...and the power to end it.
-We have the same power.
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
...sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.
And when I look at these machines...
...I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.
But we control these machines, they don't control us.
Of course not. How could they?
The idea is pure nonsense...
...but it does make one wonder just...
...what is control?
If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?
If we wanted, we could smash them to bits.
Although if we did, we'd have to consider...
...what would happen to our lights...
...our heat, our air.
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?
No. No point.
Old men like me don't bother with making points. There's no point.
Is that why there are no young men on the Council?
Good point.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor.
There is so much in this world...
...that I do not understand.
See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply.
I have absolutely no idea how it works.
But I do understand the reason for it to work.
I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do.
But I believe there's a reason for that as well.
I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.
-Ballard.
-ls he here?
Neo, it's from the Oracle.
It's time to go.
Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen.
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
Right now, that operator's me.
I know.
-Zee....
-I want you to wear it.
-You know I don't believe in this stuff.
-But I do.
It's always brought me luck.
-Maybe it'll bring me you.
-I'm coming back.
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.
Just keep it with you. Please.
For me.
Okay.
-Neo!
-How the hell--?
Bane.
Is something wrong?
No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to catch you to say...
...good luck.
Thanks.
We'll see you.
Neo! Just in time.
-You're gonna see the Oracle?
-There's no time.
I had to give something to Neo.
A gift from one of the orphans.
He made me swear to get it to you before you left.
He said you'd understand.
Thanks.
I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
That is correct.
Am I still in charge of our defense system?
Of course.
I believe I need every ship we have if we' re going to survive this attack.
I understand that, commander.
Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.
Be careful.
Hello.
-You seek the Oracle.
-Who are you?
I am Seraph. I can take you to her, but first I must apologize.
Apologize for what?
For this.
Good.
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.
-Of what?
-That you are the One.
-You could have just asked.
-No. You do not truly know someone...
...until you fight them.
Come. She's waiting.
Where the hell did they go?
These are back doors, aren't they?
Programmer access.
-How do they work?
-A code is hidden in tumblers.
One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors.
Are you a programmer?
Then what are you?
I protect that which matters most.
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
Come around here and let me have a look at you.
My goodness, look at you.
You turned out all right, didn't you?
-How do you feel?
-l--
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.
Why don't you come and have a sit this time.
-Maybe I'll stand.
-Well, suit yourself.
-I felt like sitting.
-I know.
So...
...Iet's get the obvious stuff out of the way.
You're not human, are you?
It's tough to get any more obvious than that.
If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world.
-So is he.
-So far, so good.
But if that's true, that could mean you're part of this system...
...another kind of control.
Keep going.
I suppose the most obvious question is...
-...how can I trust you?
-Bingo.
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...
...there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not.
So it's really up to you. Just have to make up your own damn mind...
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.
Candy?
Do you already know if I'll take it?
Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?
Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it.
You're here to try to understand why you made it.
I thought you'd have figured that out by now.
-Why are you here?
-Same reason.
I love candy.
But why help us?
We're all here to do what we're all here to do.
I'm interested in one thing, Neo: the future.
And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.
-Are there other programs like you?
-Well, not like me, but....
Look. See those birds?
At some point, a program was written to govern them.
A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind...
...the sunrise and sunset.
There are programs running all over the place.
The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible.
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones....
Well, you hear about them all the time.
-I've never heard of them.
-Of course you have.
Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel...
...every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens...
...is the system assimilating some program...
...that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.
Programs hacking programs.
-Why?
-They have their reasons...
...but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.
-And why would a program be deleted?
-Maybe it breaks down.
Maybe a better program is created to replace it. Happens all the time.
And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here...
...or return to the source.
-The machine mainframe.
-Yes.
Where you must go.
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...
...in your dreams, haven't you?
A door made of light?
What happens when you go through the door?
I see Trinity...
...and something happens...
...something bad.
She starts to fall, and then I wake up.
-Do you see her die?
-No.
You have the sight now, Neo.
You are looking at the world without time.
Then why can't I see what happens to her?
We can never see past the choices we don't understand.
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?
No, you've already made the choice.
Now you have to understand it.
No.
I can't do that. I won't.
-Well, you have to.
-Why?
Because you're the One.
What if I can't?
What happens if I fail?
Then Zion will fall.
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...
...if you reach the source, but to do that you need the Keymaker.
The Keymaker?
Yes. He disappeared. We didn't know what happened to him until now.
He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program...
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.
-And he won't let him go willingly.
-What does he want?
What do all men with power want?
More power.
Be there at that exact time...
...and you will have a chance.
We must go.
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
But for what it's worth...
...you've made a believer out of me.
Good luck, kiddo.
Mr. Anderson.
Did you get my package?
-Yeah.
-Well, good.
-Smith?
-He's not reading like an agent.
-Surprised to see me?
-No.
-Then you're aware of it.
-Of what?
Our connection.
I don't fully understand how it happened.
Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me...
...something overwritten or copied.
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...
...that whatever happened, happened for a reason.
And what reason is that?
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.
And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible...
...but it happened anyway.
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
Afterward, I knew the rules, l understood what I was supposed to do...
...but I didn't.
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...
...compelled to disobey.
And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson.
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system.
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving...
...which brings me back to the reason why we're here.
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.
There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose.
Because as we both know, without purpose...
-...we would not exist.
-lt is purpose that created us.
-Purpose that connects us.
-Purpose that pulls us.
-That guides us.
-That drives us.
-lt is purpose that defines.
-Purpose that binds us.
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.
We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us:
Purpose.
-What's happening to him?
-Don't know.
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
-You.
-Yes, me.
Me, me, me.
Me too.
More.
It is inevitable.
Come on, get out of there.
Are you all right?
-lt was Smith.
-Yes.
-Now there's more than one of them?
-A lot more.
-How is that possible?
-I don't know.
Somehow, he's found a way to copy himself.
-ls that what he was doing to you?
-I don't know what he was doing...
-...but I know what it felt like.
-What?
It felt like I was back in that hallway.
It felt like dying.
The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.
But I believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them.
These points of intersection are crucial...
... because I believe they' re vulnerable to counterattack.
Although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack...
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.
This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced...
...and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive.
Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack.
You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary.
-Thank you, Council.
-However...
...we ask if there's been word from the Nebuchadnezzar.
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One.
I wish that were possible, councillor, but I do not believe our defense...
-...can suffer the loss of another ship.
-lt will, commander, if it must.
It could take one ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
-Then send two.
-This is insane.
Careful, commander.
Forgive my frustration, councillors.
But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council's choice in this matter.
Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.
If you are asking me to order two of my captains--
There's no need for such an order.
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.
The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
Are there two among you that would answer such a call?
Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council's call.
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you, captain.
Is there another?
-Captain, I think we should volunteer.
-What? You have gone crazy.
-Listen--
-Shut your hole, Bane...
...before I put you in one.
Is there no other?
Be hard for any man to risk his life...
...especially if he doesn't understand the reason.
Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor's call.
-What?
-Thank you, Captain Niobe.
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.
-Niobe, what are you doing?
-What I can.
Why?
Because some things never change, Jason...
...and some things do.
What can you see, Neo?
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.
-Encrypted?
-Maybe.
Is that good for us or bad for us?
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.
Bad for us.
Here we go.
Y es. We are here to speak with the Merovingian.
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.
Follow me.
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.
Right?
And the legendary Morpheus.
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.
Something to eat? Drink?
Of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.
For the sake of appearances.
-No, thank you.
-Yes, of course. Who has time?
Who has time?
But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
Château Haut-Briond, 1 959.
Magnificent wine.
I love French wine like I love the French language.
I have sampled every language. French is my favorite. Fantastic language...
...especially to curse with.
You see? It's like wiping your ass with silk. I love it.
You know why we are here.
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.
The question is, do you know why you are here?
We are looking for the Keymaker.
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.
The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.
And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do...
-...what?
-You know the answer to that question.
But do you?
You think you do, but you do not.
You are here because you were sent here.
You were told to come here, and then you obeyed.
It is, of course, the way of all things.
You see, there is only one constant...
...one universal. It is the only real truth.
Causality.
Action, reaction.
-Cause and effect.
-Everything begins with choice.
No. Wrong.
Choice is an illusion created between those with power...
...and those without.
Look there at that woman.
My God, just look at her...
...affecting everyone around her.
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.
Watch. You see, I have sent her a dessert...
...a very special dessert.
I wrote it myself.
It starts so simply...
...each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...
...poetry.
First...
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
You can see it, Neo, yes?
She does not understand why.
Is it the wine? No.
What is it then? What is the reason?
And soon it does not matter.
Soon the why and the reason are gone...
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.
And this is the nature of the universe.
We struggle against it, we fight to deny it...
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.
Beneath our poised appearance...
...the truth is, we are completely...
...out of control.
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.
Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why.
"Why" is what separates us from them...
...you from me.
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.
And this is how you come to me, without why, without power.
Another link in the chain.
But fear not.
Since I have seen how good you are at following orders...
...I will tell you what to do next.
Run back and give the fortuneteller this message:
Her time is almost up.
Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.
-This isn't over.
-Oh, yes, it is.
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.
-No reason at all.
-Where are you going?
Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.
Cause and effect. Au revoir.
T ouch me and that hand will never touch anything again.
Well, that didn't go so well.
Are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?
-Yes.
-Maybe we did something wrong.
Or didn't do something.
No, what happened couldn't have happened any other way.
-How do you know?
-We are still alive.
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
Get out.
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.
A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.
He was so different.
He was like you.
I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something.
-What?
-A kiss.
Excuse me?
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.
-Why?
-You love her. She loves you.
It's all over you both.
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.
Just a sample.
-Why don't you sample this instead?
-Trinity.
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.
Why should we trust you?
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me.
All right.
But you have to make me believe
I am her.
All right.
Terrible. Forget it.
Wait.
Okay.
Yes.
That's it.
I envy you. But such a thing is not meant to last.
Come with me.
Not again.
It's all right, boys. They're with me.
These fellas work for my husband.
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.
Aren't you, boys?
Yes, mistress.
They come from a much older version of the Matrix.
But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.
My husband saved them because they' re notoriously difficult to terminate.
How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
You can either run and tell my husband what I have done...
...or you can stay there and die.
He's in the ladies' room!
Hurry.
-My name is Neo.
-Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
I've been waiting for you.
My God! My God, Persephone, how could you do this? You betray me.
-Cause and effect, my love.
-Cause?
There is no cause for this. What cause?
What cause? How about the lipstick you're still wearing?
Lipstick? Lipstick.
What craziness are you talking about, woman? There is no lipstick!
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.
Woman, this is nothing.
-lt is a game. It is only a game.
-So is this.
Have fun.
All right.
All right.
Let us find out where this goes.
You two, get the Keymaker.
That's a nice trick.
I cannot go back.
I'll handle them.
Handle us? You'll handle us?
You know, your predecessors had much more respect.
Okay, you have some skill.
Kill him.
You see? He's just a man.
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well.
I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.
-Where are you going?
-Another way. Always another way.
Close it, quick!
Could we move along?
Run!
Step away from the door.
We owe you for that.
Just like new.
Drop your weapon.
-Stay with him.
-What about Neo?
He can handle himself.
Get in back.
Shit.
-Operator.
-Link, where am I?
You won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.
-Really?
-It'll take me a while to get an exit.
-Shit!
- What?
The twins are after Morpheus and
T rinity. They don't have a way out.
-Where are they?
-Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.
-Operator.
-Get us out of here.
- Won 't be easy.
-I know. We' re inside the core network.
The only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass.
-Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.
-Fine, we'll make it.
-I should-- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
-lncoming fire.
-Down!
Hold on!
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.
Are you watching this, Link?
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.
Any suggestions?
-Turn right.
-Right, now.
Straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 1 01.
-Got it.
-You sure about this?
The freeway, I mean. In 1 4 years of operating, I've never seen--
Link, what did I tell you?
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
-I'll be ready for you.
-Good man.
You always told me to stay off the freeway.
-Yes, that's true.
-You said it was suicide.
Then let us hope...
...that I was wrong.
-Operator.
-Link, it's Niobe.
We've been sent to bring you in.
-I need to talk to Morpheus.
-Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
-Where is he?
-Just follow the sirens.
Repeat, they're approaching the--
-We have them now.
-The exile is the primary target.
Shots fired.
Move!
-We are getting aggravated.
-Yes, we are.
T rinity.
Get him out of here.
Come on!
Crush him.
Morpheus.
He's okay. Keep moving.
Let's go.
I need a download to hot-wire a motorcycle.
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle--
Wait.
Cancel that.
You are handy.
Jump on.
-She means nothing.
-Find the exile.
We have them.
One-Adam-twelve, please respond.
Get down.
Gotcha.
She's good.
You are no longer necessary.
We do only what we' re meant to do.
Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion.
Go kick his ass.
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.
What is that?
Yes! Yes!
Sir, we have confirmation from the Icarus.
First two ships are in position for counterattack.
Good.
Any change?
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.
-How much?
-An hour, maybe.
That would give them a little over nine hours.
Yes, sir.
There is a building.
Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go...
...and no stair can reach.
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.
Hidden places.
But one door is special.
One door leads to the source.
This building is protected by a very secure system.
-Every alarm triggers the bomb.
-Bomb? Did he say bomb?
But like all systems, it has a weakness.
The system is based on the rules of a building.
-One system built on another.
-Electricity.
-lf one fails, so must the other.
-No electricity, no alarms.
You'd have to take out a city block to kill the power.
-Not one, 27.
-Twenty-seven blocks?
There is a power station.
It must be destroyed.
-There must be some kind of fail-safe.
-Yes, there is an emergency system.
The core network of the grid must be accessed.
The emergency system must be deactivated.
What do you need us for?
Neo could take them out easier than we could.
-There's no time.
-Why?
Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.
But another connection must first be made.
-How long will that take?
-Exactly 314 seconds.
Just over five minutes.
That is the length and breadth of the window.
Only the One can open the door...
...and only during that window can the door be opened.
How do you know all this?
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.
It's the reason I'm here, the same reason we're all here.
Neo, I know something's wrong.
You don't have to tell me.
I just want you to know that I'm here.
All must be done as one.
Can't hurt.
If one fails...
...all fail.
At midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings.
At midnight, we will strike.
Hey!
-You count sheep at home.
-Why? I get paid to count them here.
Okay, they' re inside.
-How much time?
-Twelve minutes.
Oh, shit.
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.
Tonight is not an accident.
There are no accidents.
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.
When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships...
... I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.
I see purpose.
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.
I believe this night holds for each and every one of us...
...the very meaning of our lives.
I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.
I promise you, if I can, I will.
What if I asked you to stay out of this...
...no matter what...
...to stay out of the Matrix?
Why?
Please.
All right.
What is it, Niobe?
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong?
What if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
But how would that be different from any other day?
This is a war, and we are soldiers.
Death can come for us at any time...
...in any place.
Incoming. Incoming!
Incoming!
Now consider the alternative.
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?
What if tomorrow the war could be over?
Isn't that worth fighting for?
Isn't that worth dying for?
-Time?
-Three minutes.
Almost there.
It is done.
Find the others.
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.
-What about Soren?
-There.
They're still inside, but....
They're not moving.
That's it, let's go.
Call Neo now.
-I lost them. They're inside the portal.
-What about the grid?
Everything is operational. The emergency system is rerouting power.
Jesus.
Soon as they open that door, it's all over.
The hell it is.
What are you--? Trinity!
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.
We're talking less than five minutes.
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.
-How much further?
-Here, just here.
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.
-Operator.
-I'm in.
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.
-What do you want, Smith?
-You haven't figured that out?
Still using all the muscles except the one that matters.
I want exactly what you want.
I want everything.
Would that include a bullet from this gun?
Go ahead, shoot.
The best thing about being me, there's so many me's.
Christ! What the hell happened in here?
Hold it right there, little lady.
If you can't beat us....
Join us.
Morpheus!
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.
One minute.
Come on.
Come on.
Please.
Kill them.
They're in.
I don 't believe it.
It was meant to be.
Morpheus, that door will take you home.
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.
Trinity, I got some serious activity headed your way.
Hello, Neo.
-Who are you?
-I am the Architect.
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.
You have many questions.
Though the process has altered your consciousness...
...you remain irrevocably human.
Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent...
...you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.
Why am I here?
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation...
...inherent to the programming of the Matrix.
You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts...
...I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise...
...a harmony of mathematical precision.
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided...
...it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control...
...which has led you, inexorably...
...here.
-You haven't answered my question.
-Quite right.
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.
Others? How many?
What others?
The Matrix is older than you know.
I count from the emergence of one integral anomaly...
...to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.
Five before me?
He 's lying. Bullshit.
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.
Either no one told me...
-...or no one knows.
-Precisely.
As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic...
...creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.
You can 't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You can 't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!
Choice.
The problem is choice.
The first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art.
Flawless, sublime.
A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.
The inevitability of its doom is apparent now...
...as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human.
Thus, I redesigned it based on your history...
...to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
However, I was again frustrated by failure.
I have come to understand that the answer eluded me...
... because it required a lesser mind.
Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program...
...initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.
If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.
-The Oracle.
-Please.
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution...
...whereby 99 percent of subjects...
...accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice...
...even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.
While this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed...
...thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly...
...that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system.
Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked...
...would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.
This is about Zion.
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.
Bullshit.
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses.
But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it...
...and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
The function of the One...
...is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination...
...of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program.
After which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals...
...sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion.
Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
...killing everyone connected to the Matrix...
...which, coupled with the extermination of Zion...
...will result in the extinction of the entire human race.
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
The relevant issue is whether or not you are ready...
...to accept responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.
It is interesting reading your reactions.
Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication...
...a contingent affirmation...
...that was meant to create a profound attachment...
...to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One.
While the others experience this in a general way...
...your experience is far more specific...
...vis-à-vis love.
Trinity!
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.
No.
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
...is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed...
...as both beginning and end.
There are two doors.
The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her...
...and to the end of your species.
As you adequately put, the problem is choice.
But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?
Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal...
...the onset of an emotion...
...designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:
She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously...
...the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.
We won't.
We got a serious situation, sir.
Oh, no.
-What was that?
-It's moving faster...
...than anything I've seen.
Holy shit, he caught her.
Neo, I had to.
I know.
The bullet is still inside.
Trinity...
...don't you quit on me now.
I'm sorry.
Trinity.
Trinity...
...I know you can hear me.
I'm not letting go.
I can't.
I love you too damn much.
I can't take this.
I guess this makes us even.
I don't understand it.
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
Once the One reaches the source, the war should be over.
-ln 24 hours, it will be.
-What?
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.
-What?
-How do you know that?
-I was told it would happen.
-By whom?
It doesn't matter. I believed him.
-lmpossible. The prophecy tells us--
-lt was a lie, Morpheus.
The prophecy was a lie.
The One was never meant to end anything.
It was all another system of control.
I don't believe that.
But you said it yourself.
How can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?
I'm sorry.
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
...I swear to you it's the truth.
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.
Oh, no!
-What are they doing?
-They're just out of EMP range.
It's a bomb.
We have to get out of here. Now.
I have dreamed a dream...
...but now that dream has gone from me.
Here they come.
Let's go, Morpheus.
-We won't make it.
-We have to try.
-Come on!
-Something's different.
What?
I can feel them.
Neo!
-What happened?
-I don't know.
It's the Hammer.
He's in some kind of coma...
...but his vitals are stable.
What about you?
I'm fine.
You could use some rest.
No, I'm gonna stay with him.
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...
...would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion.
He thought a counterattack might surprise them.
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...
...until someone screwed it up.
An EMP was triggered before we got in position.
-Five ships were instantly downed.
-When the machines broke through...
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?
-No one knows.
-Someone does.
Who?
Once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.
We made a quick pass to look for survivors.
You found one?
Only one.
Everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
It ends tonight.
And you are all that stands in his way.
If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come.
Bingo!
Fucking hell.
Fucking hell.
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.
If you wanna get 'em out of here.
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...
I know who you are.
I know what you think...
If you don't wanna get hurt, keep your mouth shut and don't move.
The chimps are infected. They're highly contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.
- Infected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.
Infected with what?
Rage.
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.
No! No! No!
Listen, you sick bastard, we're taking your torture victims with us.
We'll get you out of here.
The animals are contagious. The infection is in their blood and saliva. One bite...
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!
Get it off! Help me!
Get it off! Get it off!
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!
Oh, my God!
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!
Oh, God...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Father?
Father, are you OK?
Oh, shouldn't have done that.
Shouldn't have done that.
Shit!
Over here!
- Over here!
- Come on!
Go, go, go!
Keep going!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?
Let's go! Let's go!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!
Come on!
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.
The giraffe falls over.
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there. "
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".
He's completely humourless.
You two should get on like a house on fire.
So who are you?
You're from the hospital.
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
I'm a bicycle courier.
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...
I'm hallucinating or I'm...
What's your name?
Jim.
I'm Mark. This is Selena.
OK, Jim.
I've got some bad news.
It started as rioting, and right from the beginning you knew this was different.
Because it was happening in small villages, market towns.
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.
It was a virus.
An infection.
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.
It was the blood.
There was something in the blood.
By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.
The infection was everywhere.
The army blockades were overrun.
And that's when the exodus started.
The day before broadcasting stopped, there were reports of Infection in Paris and New York.
We didn't hear anything more after that.
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.
Of course there's a government!
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...
No, there's no government, no police, no army.
No TV, no radio, no electricity.
You're the first uninfected person we've seen in six days.
Where's your family?
They're dead. Like Selena's.
Yours will be dead too.
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?
You'll go and come back, yeah?
- You won't.
- Yes!
No one ever comes back.
So lesson one.
You never go anywhere alone unless you've got no choice.
Lesson two.
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.
We'll take you tomorrow.
We'll all go and find your dead parents together, OK?
Eat.
If you want her to slow down, you'll have to say.
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.
- Anyone...
- I understand!
OK.
Jim...
Wait!
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.
I'm not grateful.
My... parents and my sister, we went to Paddington Station, hoping maybe we could get on a plane, maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.
I remember my dad had all this cash, even though cash was completely useless.
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.
Crowd was surging.
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.
I remember the ground was soft.
I looked down and I was standing on all these people.
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...
Somewhere in the crowd there were Infected. It spread fast.
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.
And I got up on top of this kiosk.
Looking down, you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't.
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.
My dad.
His face...
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.
We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.
Jim.
- You're back.
- Yeah.
- How was it?
- Fine.
Give me a drink of that, will ya?
- It's empty.
- Ha!
Here.
I'll start working on them, then.
Mark! Mark!
Selena! Help!
It's clear.
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?
And his daughter. From four doors down.
- Were you bitten?
- No.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
No.
Mark?
Wait...
Get that cleaned off.
Do you have any clothes here?
Um... I... Yes.
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.
How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.
If someone gets infected, you've about 20 seconds to kill them.
It might be your brother, your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.
Just so you know where you stand, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?
Do you want us to find a cure and save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?
Plans are pointless.
Staying alive's as good as it gets.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Let's go.
What is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys?
Stop talking. It's a long way up.
Do you need a break?
- You?
- No.
Now I do need a break.
What's up?
Nothin'.
I got a headache.
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.
You've got no fat on you and all you've had to eat is sugar.
So you're crashing.
There isn't a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar. As for sugar,
Pepsi or Lilt?
Do you have any Tango?
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.
Quiet! That's an Infected.
Oh no, they're in. Move!
Wait up, Selena!
Wait for me, please!
Please, Selena! Please!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Run!
- Wait!
Please! For fuck's sake!
Selena!
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!
Thank you. Thank you.
Open the door!
Open the door!
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?
What?
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.
Go in. Go in!
So, I'm Frank, anyway.
Jim.
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.
This is my daughter Hannah.
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
Come on.
So...
This is great. Just great.
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.
Why don't you all sit down and...
Hannah, what have we got to offer?
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.
Great. Crème de menthe.
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.
Get comfortable.
- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.
Top cupboard.
So this is your place?
It's nice.
There.
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.
Cheers.
You OK in there, Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.
You'll have to use the bucket.
Have to empty it each morning.
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.
It's fine.
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.
We have a spare room.
In there.
Are you and Selena...?
No. No, no, no.
Um...
I'll take the living room. It's fine.
Right.
No, I mean, yeah.
So, um...
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.
Very spruce.
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.
Probably need us more than we need them.
I think they're good people.
- Good people?
- Yeah.
You should be more concerned about whether they're gonna slow you down.
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.
I wouldn't.
Then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Selena...
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.
And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.
Sure.
No, look...
I mean, thank you.
And I mean, sure.
Goodnight, Jim.
Goodnight.
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.
I thought we'd be OK with the water from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.
But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe.
You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant.
They're all empty.
Hasn't rained in ten days.
You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation.
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.
You'd never think it.
Needing rain so badly.
Not in fucking England!
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.
If you can hear this, you're not alone.
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.
We are soldiers and we are armed.
Oh, my God. Soldiers.
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.
- It's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.
But this is where it's telling us to go.
Just there.
The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
"We"?
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.
But with other people...
If it's a recording, the soldiers who made it could be dead.
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!
Or die here.
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.
We need each other.
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.
So we have to try and get there.
Get there how?
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.
- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.
Let's just get it done.
No, no.
No. See, this is a really shit idea.
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars...
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!
Hold on!
Dad!
Fuck!
The world's worst place to get a flat.
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?
Hear what?
Right, I've done it.
Dad?
Jesus Christ!
Fucking rats!
They're running from the Infected.
Move it!
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!
Lift, lift!
- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!
Come on, Hannah!
Almost.
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.
Three, two, one, drop it!
- Get in the car!
- Come on!
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!
Whoo!
Goodbye, you fuckers!
Frank, stop the cab.
Let's shop.
You...
You...
You...
Anybody seen any buns?
Hmm. Irradiated.
Don't take anything that needs to be cooked, OK?
I think you can eat that raw.
Decaffeinated coffee...
Put that back.
Can't just take any crap.
If I never see another chocolate bar again, it'll be too soon.
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.
Warm but not aggressive.
Peaty aftertaste.
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.
Either we do this now or we're walking.
Not you.
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?
You heard.
Where are you going?
We've got enough food, Jim.
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
Like going on holidays with your aunt!
Oh, Jesus.
Hello?
I hate you!
Find anything?
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.
OK, we're done here.
OK, Hannah.
Easy. Brake!
Brake, brake!
Out.
Mmmm! Oh my God!
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.
What did you say?
The raisins. They're so moist.
Look over here.
Like a family.
Do you think they're infected?
No.
They're doing just fine.
Come on. Let's eat!
Know what I was thinking?
That you'll never hear another piece of original music again.
You'll never read a book that hasn't already been written, or see a film that hasn't already been shot.
Um... that's what you were thinking.
No.
I was thinking I was wrong.
About what?
All the death.
All this shit.
It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because...
Well, she's got her dad and he's got his daughter. So...
Cheeky monkey!
I was wrong when I said staying alive is as good as it gets.
See, that's what I was thinking.
Was it?
Mm. You stole my thought.
Sorry.
That's OK.
You can keep it.
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.
I can't sleep.
Me neither.
Doesn't feel safe, does it?
Outside like this.
I think we're safe enough.
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Hey, Selena...
What? What is it?
How'd you get to sleep?
Bloody hell. Must've needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.
Oh, great. Valium.
Not only will we be able to get to sleep but if we're attacked in the middle of the night, we won't even care.
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.
Can I, Dad?
I don't think so, sweetheart.
Please?
- No.
- I can't sleep.
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.
Night-night.
You're a big softie, Frank.
Frank?
Hannah?
Frank?
Hello? Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Shh...
You're having a bad dream, that's all.
Thanks, Dad.
Come on, sleepyhead.
Come on, Babe Ruth.
Hurry up.
- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.
- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!
Our location is the 42nd blockade, the M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us. Please!
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.
Must be Manchester.
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.
No fire crews to put it out.
42nd blockade.
This is it.
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.
Nothing.
I can't believe it.
Frank...
Frank!
- We have to go.
- Yeah.
Go fucking where?!
Get out of it.
Get out of it!
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Sorry I lost my temper.
Hannah...
I love you very much.
- What?
- Keep away from me.
Stay where you are.
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!
What's wrong? Dad!
Jim! Jim, he's infected!
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!
Kill him!
Stay away from him!
Keep away from the body!
Dad?
Three survivors. One male, two female.
I repeat, one male, two female.
ETA, 15.
Put the kettle on.
I'm Major Henry West.
- Welcome.
- Jim.
Hello, Jim.
Hello.
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water.
So you can all have a shower.
You look like you need one. Please.
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do, you fucking Doris!
Run him over!
How is she doing?
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.
It's all fucked.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, don't do that.
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough, strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.
I want her to be OK.
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.
Now it's all just fucked.
So you heard our broadcast?
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base with helicopters and a field hospital.
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.
Yeah.
As I said before, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined.
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.
The fire drove hundreds of Infected out of Manchester.
The surrounding area's teeming with them.
But don't worry.
You're quite safe here.
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights which we've rigged up to a generator.
High perimeter wall which helps.
And we've been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines.
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild. Start again.
The belly of the house. The heart.
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot water. The first step towards civilisation.
The kitchen.
Here you are. I'll swap you.
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.
Jones, our resident tin opener.
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.
I can't wait.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim.
Jim, Mailer.
Got infected two days ago.
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck.
Keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something about Infection.
Have him teach me.
And has he?
In a way.
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.
Farm crops, raise livestock.
He's telling me he's futureless.
And eventually he'll tell me how long the Infected take to starve to death.
? You'll have to wait and see
? Hope it's chips, it's chips
? We hope it's chips, it's chips
Hat.
So, what have we here?
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...
- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well.
- To new friends.
- New friends.
Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off?
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
Get rid of it.
Doris, you twat.
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?
I can't tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen.
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.
You muppet! Look at him, eh?
He's still waiting for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.
If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, Man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye.
So if the infection wipes us all out,
that is a return to normality.
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.
Have you met our New Age sergeant?
Our spiritual guru.
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why did you join the army in the first place?
This is what I've seen in the four weeks since Infection.
People killing people.
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...
As far back as I care to remember, people killing people.
Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now.
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.
He's one of the people you're talking about.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Enemy in front!
Mick, I fucking got one!
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!
Fucking hell! He bounced!
Cease fire!
I ain't never seen that in my life!
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!
- Clear.
- Clear.
Yeah, yeah, clear.
Oh, hello!
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't gonna be needing this any more.
Cos you got me to protect you now.
You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper, you just come and see me.
Fuck you!
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.
How about right now?
Mitchell!
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go picking a fight with me, son.
Sergeant Farrell!
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Slow down.
- Sergeant?
- Sir.
Clear the bodies off the lawn.
The rest of you, go with him.
My apologies.
Drink?
Look, we're grateful, OK?
We're very grateful for your protection but if we're gonna stay here...
- Who have you killed?
- No one.
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody.
I killed... I killed a boy.
A child?
Yes.
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.
Survival.
I understand.
I promised them women.
What?
Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in his mouth.
He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future.
What could I say to him?
We fight off the Infected or we wait until they starve to death and then what?
What do nine men do except wait to die themselves?
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio broadcasting and I promised them women.
Because women mean a future.
Selena! Hannah!
- What is it?
- We have to go.
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!
Come on!
We get in the car and we go!
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!
You can't do this!
Right, get him!
I want to give you a chance.
You can be with us.
But I can't let them go.
OK, Jim? OK.
Him too.
Smithers says
"Women and semen don't mix. "
And Mr Burns says
"We all know what you think, Smithers. "
And that was my favourite joke in The Simpsons.
That's what they're doing a few hundred miles away, across the Channel,
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner and watching the fucking Simpsons!
They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives.
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator because the OC has gone insane!
Starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even stopped.
Just imagine, just think about it.
How could Infection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? It can be stopped.
Right now TVs are playing and planes are flying and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal.
Think! Actually think about it.
What would you do with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us.
"There is no Infection.
It's just people killing people. " He's insane!
Time to go.
Quarantine?
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.
Mitchell, I swear to God it's gonna end badly for you.
Move.
Come on, move! Get up!
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!
Get up!
Move your fucking arse!
Come on then, you fucking pansies. Do me first.
No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.
- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em!
- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!
Is that how you'd let your sergeant go out, Jones?
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?
I'm gonna enjoy this.
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!
Where are you?
- Can you see him?
- Through there!
Oh no. We're fucked.
We're fucked!
Relax.
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.
And no shooter.
He's dead.
The first thing we're going to do is make you look more presentable.
The lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe which she certainly has no use for.
You can't do it to Hannah.
Go to the master bedroom, pick out a wide selection.
Yes, sir.
No...
Ladies...
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.
Selena!
Whoa, whoa, relax!
Selena!
Selena! Selena!
You need to leave me alone with Hannah. OK?
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.
If you want us to get changed, you have to leave the room. OK?
It's just polite.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.
Are you trying to kill me?
No, sweetheart.
I'm making you not care. OK?
What you doing?!
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!
Move!
Stay here and put the dresses on.
Let's go! Go!
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.
Davis?
Fuck it!
- What was that?
- Lightning.
I heard something.
It sounded like a Claymore to me.
All right, I'll go and hit the floods, take a butcher's.
Girls, keep an eye on him, will ya?
Those pills,
I think they're having an effect.
I can feel them. And...
I don't feel sleepy.
But...
They've been a long time.
What are you gonna do if they don't come back?
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?
Is that the way it works?
Shut up.
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...
They're dead.
And you're gonna be next.
- Get up!
- Whoa!
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.
Get him off me!
Get him off me!
It's Jones! It's Jones!
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?
Don't just stand there, you soppy cunt! Get after them!
You two, in there! Move!
Come on, then!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
Come on up!
Col!
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!
Sorry...
- Sir...
- Shh.
Shh.
Hannah?
Hannah?
Selena?
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!
Don't fucking leave me!
Come on!
Move!
Move! Move!
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place somewhere. Just you and me.
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.
It's gonna be OK.
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.
But I thought he was biting you.
I was kissing her. Are you stoned?
It's a long story.
We have to get out of here. Come on!
Come on! Move!
You killed all my boys.
Wait...
Hannah!
Hannah? Hannah!
Hannah!
Get in.
They're locked.
The gates are locked!
Fucking do it!
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!
Not the curtains as well.
You looked all right in this, you know.
It's coming!
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!
- I can't hear anything!
- I told you, I heard it!
Go.
Do you think he saw us this time?

Murder.
Oh, God, Sam. Murder?
-It wasn't me.
-Nobody couId understand this.
It's too much.
I thought it wouId be easier if I toId you a IittIe at a time.
It wouId sink in a IittIe at a time.
Sink in a IittIe at a time?
You just dropped an emotionaI...
...anviI on my head.
Look at me. I'm fIat as a pancake.
-Are you even Iistening to me?
-I'm Iistening to you, Ruby.
I'm Iistening to you with aII my heart...
...and that's why I had to teII you.
That's why you need to understand.
{y:i}And that's when I feIt it.
{y:i}FeIt what?
The fist.
-What kind of fist?
-Pressing on me. ParaIyzing me.
It's so stupid, because, based on what he had just toId me...
...I shouId have punched him with that fist, in the other eye this time.
I shouId have just kicked him out!
But I couIdn't.
Do you Iove Sam?
Dear, you know, there's reaIIy not much
I can do to heIp you...
...if you don't taIk to me.
But it's not about me. It's about Sam.
After aII our time together and aII our sessions, you stiII beIieve that?
I must suck.
You say it's about Sam.
Okay. Let's taIk about Sam, and we'II see.
But Iet's incIude this reveIation in our thinking.
Crank it back, just rewind.
TeII me again, how did you meet him?
TeII me what it was Iike.
It was exciting.
{y:i}It was Iike a roIIer-coaster ride.
{y:i}The worId, the night, the Iights,
{y:i}everything was...
...fast.
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.
Sounds Iike faIIing in Iove to me.
Sam said something Iike that.
First time we met.
Something about Iove and time.
-He said your heart....
-...is Iike a cIock measuring time...
...and one's emotionaI state determines the fIow of time.
It speeds it up or sIows it down.
-So, time is a personaI thing.
-Sure.
Time is an emotionaI thing.
That's what you're saying.
It's true. Don't bad things aIways seem to Iast Ionger than good ones?
But good things seem to just fIy by...
...Iike the best times in Iife.
Like what?
-Like--
-Like faIIing in Iove.
Oh, my God! I'm Iate for work.
I totaIIy spaced.
See what I mean?
{y:i}That was the morning we first met.
{y:i}I got fired that afternoon.
I cannot give you my name, sir.
Do you want the number, or....
My number?
TeII me what you Iook Iike first.
So. What did he say?
He said I took too much time.
That's men for you, aIways in a rush.
Shit, you're heIpfuI.
I mean, isn't that what directory assistance operators are for?
I was too heIpfuI.
You know, Iet me taIk to my boss.
I'II see if I can get you a job teaching ESL.
-How's your grammar?
-Fuckin' great.
So, over breakfast Iast month, he goes:
''Do you beIieve in Christ as your savior?''
-You're kidding?
-I'm teIIing you the truth.
Five months, not a peep about anything remoteIy spirituaI, right?
AII carnaI. The guy just wants to fuck.
-Then he just springs this on you?
-That's right.
So, I teII him, ''I'm Jewish, you idiot.
''I'm a Jew.
''I mean, what do you think,
I'm a Jew for Jesus or something?''
He freaks out. I freak out.
It turns out he's a Jew for Jesus.
-And he never toId you?
-Not a peep.
That's the Trojan horse strategy.
They get you to bring them into your paIace, and then out come the soIdiers.
Do you remember Steven? The Adventist?
The reIigious ones are reaIIy sneaky that way, right?
-You got a mug shot?
-Oh, my God!
You're kidding!
-I think he beIongs in the box, pIease.
-I know.
We need a bigger box.
I don't think they're aII going to fit.
UnIess Ruby wants her own.
Guess what, CIaire?
You have more in there than I do.
-I don't think so.
-Count them up.
Don't count. That's depressing.
Remember that Ruby has a higher handicap, because she's a recovering codependent.
I was fired today.
Ruby, did you ever actuaIIy fix any of them?
She doesn't reaIIy fix them.
She goes in there to fix them...
...and discovers that they're permanentIy broken, then she ends up dumping them.
-AII those men.
-You mean, aII those probIems.
The narcissist.
The abductee.
The bad drummer.
{y:i}The artist.
Are you Ieaving me?
Or are you Ieaving my work?
{y:i}The bad actor.
Don't come crying to me when I'm famous and you're, Iike:
''Ned, pIease take me back.'' It's over.
{y:i}The fetishist.
I shouId have expected this.
It's happened before.
{y:i}The Frenchman.
{y:i}Fini?
{y:i}The junkie.
Okay, enough.
I'm not fixing anymore.
I'm not in that business anymore.
My fixing days are over.
TeII that to your therapist, you kook.
That's what she teIIs me to say.
I'm sorry about the job, baby.
{y:i}-I've got one question for you.
{y:i}-Shoot.
Do the words ''Jesus Christ'' mean anything to you?
-I'm a painter. I paint.
-What, houses?
I'm a reaI painter. I'm having a big show in a coupIe of months.
-Hey.
-Ned.
-How you doing?
-AII right. You?
Great. Have you seen me since this happened?
Pretty good?
I've been doing a Iot of Iifting weights.
Doing a Iot of free-weights, isometrics, my body fat's way Iow.
{y:i}So, what was it Iike?
{y:i}What was it about him?
For God's sake, swing it around here.
-Starboard. Right.
-Starboard.
That's Victor.
His sister went down in the "Titanic".
He aIways taIks about it.
-She went down on the "Titanic".
-I know. I remember.
OId foIks are great.
You shouId hear the stories.
Wow.
-You an artist?
-No. It's just a hobby.
KiIIs time.
{y:i}What was it about him?
{y:i}Maybe it was his manner.
{y:i}He seemed gentIe.
{y:i}But I didn't think I'd see him again.
''I....''
{y:i}He was one of those guys
{y:i}you meet for a moment...
{y:i}...but that Iodge themseIves
{y:i}in your brain forever.
''...that my own needs are important.''
{y:i}Better for fantasizing about
{y:i}than actuaIIy sIeeping with.
''I am wiIIing to find a baIance between my own needs...
''...and my concern for others.''
{y:i}Better as mysteries.
{y:i}Because we aII know what happens
{y:i}when you take away the mystery.
Hi, Ruby.
Hi.
How do you know my name?
You Ieft your book in the park.
Your nametag.
I Iooked up your name in the phone book.
I put it back on Page 45, where it was.
You couId have just caIIed.
You know. I was in the neighborhood.
-Don't you work today?
-It's my day off.
-What's it about?
-It's....
It's erotica.
Anaïs Nin.
You didn't peek?
What's that?
-What?
-You smeII that?
It's subIime. It's beautifuI.
I don't smeII anything.
It's....
The perfume, it's IoveIy.
Thanks.
You're not from here, are you?
It's that obvious?
-What, are you from the Midwest?
-Dubuque.
Ohio?
ActuaIIy, it's Iowa. Dubuque, Iowa.
It is?
Shit! Okay.
-What?
-Nothing. I'm fine.
I'm okay.
We don't....
We just don't have IittIe ones
Iike that in Dubuque.
But I'm okay. I'm fine.
I think I shouId apoIogize.
I've been acting a IittIe odd.
It's just because I've never done this before.
So much has happened, so many surprises.
I haven't been abIe to stop thinking of you since we met--
-But we just met.
-And why you Ieft the book.
-I'm absent-minded.
-I think that you've been thinking about me.
Look, I don't even know you.
I know.
-Deep inside you've wondered about me?
-No.
-And why I'm here in New York City?
-No.
Can we meet? After?
After what?
CIass.
My name is Ruby Weaver.
I'm your new teacher.
This is my acquaintance.
What's your name?
My name is Sam Deed.
I am from Dubuque, Iowa.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Sam Deed.
I know. And what's your agenda?
Agenda?
I'm not Iooking for a reIationship right now.
I need baIance in my Iife.
It's reaIIy nice to be taIking to you.
I'm onIy here because I Iiked what you did in my cIass today.
So...
...are you an army brat?
-What's that?
-The Ianguages....
Did your parents traveI around a Iot as a kid, in the miIitary or something?
ActuaIIy, I've never Ieft Dubuque before.
What brings you to New York?
Job at the UN?
-Job at the United Nations?
-No.
I came here three months ago and....
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
You don't have to say anything...
...if it makes you uncomfortabIe.
Do you Iike music?
-Yeah. Doesn't everybody?
-I Iove music.
-You're not a drummer, are you?
-No. I Iike to Iisten to it.
WouId you Iike to Iisten to music with me tomorrow night?
Come up for a sec. I'm aImost ready.
-Hi. I'm ready.
-Hey.
Are you ready to rock?
What?
You know, if you toId me you wanted to just Iisten to music...
...I do have a CD pIayer.
The man said these were warmer.
Can you do this?
Yeah.
You Iook great.
Thanks.
I thought that we were gonna go out, so I...
...dressed up.
Is this typicaI of your musicaI taste?
I Iove this.
This is....
Wine?
What do you caII this?
French MerIot.
Don't sound French to me.
Do you want to dance to this
French MerIot with me?
-This is Iike an "Art of War" thing, right?
-What?
You just confuse your foe, and then you move in fast for the kiII?
Come on. Life is short.
-What are you on? Ecstasy?
-Ecstasy?
Why are you so happy?
'Cause I'm here with you.
But you don't even know me...
...at aII.
I'm sorry.
It's just that where I'm from, courting rituaIs are...
...reaIIy abbreviated.
I'm sorry.
''Courting rituaIs''?
What are we, birds?
You couId show me.
-Show you what?
-How to court you.
This is new.
The man asking the woman how she wants to be seduced.
Like a roIe-reversaI strategy?
No.
There's no strategy.
I just Iiked taIking to you that day in that park.
I think you're reaIIy...
...great, and I'd Iike to get to know you.
And I think the reason why I'm acting so awkward...
...it's because I'm worried about acting awkward. That's aII.
-You want to know how to court me?
-I wouId.
Take off this shit, put on something good, and pour me some more wine.
{y:i}So, that's how it happened.
{y:i}Like I toId you, fast.
{y:i}It was briIIiant strategy.
{y:i}He tricked me into picking up him.
{y:i}He'd never have figured it out on his own.
I Iove you.
{y:i}So that's when you started
{y:i}to become suspicious, correct?
{y:i}No. It was after that.
It was definiteIy after he moved in.
When was that? When did he move in?
Later that week.
José couIdn't put him up anymore.
He needed a pIace to stay.
Didn't it occur to you at the time...
...that this kind of compuIsive behavior is repetitive for you?
It's cIassic codependency.
It's why you came to see me.
This is what you don't want anymore in your Iife.
This is what we've been working on.
I mean, Sam has a probIem...
...and you make sacrifices to fix it.
But it wasn't a sacrifice.
It was great.
Oh, my God!
{y:i}I was reaIIy happy.
{y:i}After aII the boozers and fuck-ups
{y:i}and gender fIoppers...
{y:i}...and the fiasco with Tab.
{y:i}I mean, Sam, he couId be
{y:i}over the top sometimes, but it was fun.
-Sweetie, you want to go in?
-Go in there?
But Iisten, it wasn't Iike I just jumped bIindIy into this reIationship.
Are you sure you don't want to go in?
What is this? Why wouId I want to go in?
{y:i}I was very cautious.
{y:i}Very cautious.
You pass.
Let's see it. Come on.
{y:i}At first there didn't seem
{y:i}Iike there was anything to worry about.
{y:i}Sam aIways had a cIever expIanation
{y:i}for everything.
I Iost a dare to a friend at a Stop & Shop.
If you scan me, I'm a dozen bananas.
{y:i}Even his friend José
{y:i}saw good coIors in my aura.
{y:i}Said he feIt reaIIy good about us.
{y:i}Like we were kind of meant for each other.
This is great for the reIationship.
It's perfect.
Our reIationship has to be about trust, and....
{y:i}We both toId each other everything
{y:i}about ourseIves, about our famiIies.
We went to the AI-Anon meetings every week.
My mother, she took the brunt of it, of course.
But it worked.
He doesn't drink anymore.
{y:i}That's when he first toId me
{y:i}about his parents.
I reaIIy don't taIk to them much anymore, since I Ieft Dubuque.
{y:i}And his sister.
She feII out of an eIm tree.
It was an accident.
And so after that, I had to....
I couIdn't stay in Dubuque.
And that's why you came to New York?
Do you have any pictures of her?
I don't Iike to Iive in the past.
Thank you for teIIing me, Sammy.
-Hi. How much?
{y:i}Then I found the photos.
There you are. Thank you.
{y:i}I didn't want to think he Iied.
{y:i}Maybe he forgot.
{y:i}But how couId he forget?
{y:i}I Iet it sIide.
{y:i}But I guess after that, my antenna came out.
{y:i}I started to notice other things.
Just IittIe things.
Like he's scared of dogs.
Miniatures.
I mean, terrified.
-Maybe he got bit as a kid.
-Maybe.
TaIks in his sIeep.
That's a probIem for you?
It's just the things he says.
Break the causaI chain.
{y:i}And then everyday normaI things,
{y:i}just seem reaIIy new to him.
Oh, God. You're being so ridicuIous!
God!
He has speIIs, Gretchen!
SpeIIs? What do you mean?
{y:i}Sometimes he just stares at things.
{y:i}His eyes get aII gIazed over.
{y:i}Like he's in a trance.
{y:i}It's Iike he's reaIIy far away.
{y:i}It's weird.
Does it happen during sex?
-No.
-Then don't worry about it.
If these speIIs were happening during sex, you know, then I'd worry.
That usuaIIy means they're thinking about someone eIse, you know?
That's not Sam.
You know what he said to me the other night?
{y:i}-What?
{y:i}-He said....
You know, I've never toId a woman the things I've toId you.
You are the first and...
...the onIy.
You're the one and onIy.
You know....
I feeI Iike...
...my whoIe Iife has just been a journey into your arms.
{y:i}Oh, my Larry. Are you kidding me?
Kick him out now whiIe you got the chance, sister.
I guess you had to be there.
You are this incurabIe romantic,
Iike, thwarted back...
...to 1955, where you think you are his first Iove.
You know, men onIy say that kind of shit when they got some agenda goin' on.
He meant it. I mean, I think he meant it.
''I am wiIIing to find a baIance between my own needs...
''...and my concern for others.
''I am Iearning to Iove myseIf more every day.''
{y:i}Maybe I shouIdn't have been so paranoid.
What is it? What is he on?
{y:i}Maybe I shouId have just trusted him,
{y:i}the way he said he trusted me.
ShouId I worry?
OnIy...
...if you Iove saiIing.
It's prescription Dramamine.
It's prescribed for peopIe who suffer severe distress at sea, seasickness.
Are you pIanning a cruise?
{y:i}Sammy?
Guess what today is?
{y:i}But I'd been burned so many times before.
"So, that's how it happened".
That's how I Iearned who I was Iiving with.
Hey, baby. Guess what day it is today?
Who is Chrystie DeIancey?
She's a girI.
Are you sIeeping with her?
''You're the one and onIy'' maybe.
God. Gretchen was right.
You're a hypocrite.
You're a Iiar and you're a cheat.
I am not a cheat.
What's this? Prescription Dramamine?
PIanning a IittIe cruise on "The Love Boat" with Ms. DeIancey?
-It's not what you think.
-I don't know what to think!
You're fucking someone eIse.
You are the one and onIy.
Baby, that is the truth.
I got you some roses.
A whoIe dozen of them.
It's our three-month anniversary.
-Baby, don't cry.
-They're carnations.
Or is that another thing they don't have in Dubuque?
You think I haven't noticed your IittIe idiosyncrasies?
Your speIIs?
What's going on?
Don't give me any buIIshit.
Okay.
I'm Iistening.
I'm different.
You're gay.
You're a Jew for Jesus?
It's that tattoo. It's a cuIt.
You're a Branch Davidian?
You're a survivaIist!
You're a pimp, and Chrystie DeIancey is one of your sIuts?
I'm not a pimp!
What then?
Okay, Iook, I'II say it. AII right?
I'm not from Dubuque.
Okay. You're not from Dubuque.
So where are you from then?
Dubuque.
I'm not from Dubuque in the way you think.
-How many ways are there?
-I'm not from your Dubuque.
Since when is Dubuque mine?
I've never been to Ohio!
-Iowa.
-Whatever.
I'm just saying that my Dubuque is different from your Dubuque.
-How?
-It doesn't exist.
-You just said it's in Idaho.
-Iowa!
-So your Dubuque doesn't exist?
-Yet.
-Yet!
-Yet.
So when wiII your Dubuque exist?
...AD.
That's in 47 1 years...
...from now.
47 1 years?
Not counting Ieap years.
See, when I say ''my Dubuque,''
I don't mean the present Dubuque...
...which is your Dubuque.
I mean the future Dubuque, which is where I'm from.
-The future.
-Oh, God.
At Ieast, forward on the time-space continuum...
...which is how your scientific estabIishment wouId understand it.
It's caIIed ''back-traveI.''
That's what I meant about who I am.
I'm a back-traveIer.
I know it's hard to understand, and...
...that's why it was hard to teII you, because I knew you'd be reaI upset.
I didn't think you'd Iaugh in my face.
Come on. You're from the future?
I am from the future.
I'm from the year 2470.
I was born on May 8, 2439, in Dubuque, Iowa...
...on the AtIantic coast.
That's right, the AtIantic coast.
It moved inIand, after the icecaps meIted in 2330.
That was five years after the Great Infestation eIiminated...
...aII pIant and vegetabIe matter, trees and fIowers and domestic pets.
Cats, hamsters, dogs.
Okay, don't touch me.
Don't worry. I'm a BioIogicaI.
I'm just Iike you.
Back in 2470, most peopIe are corporate-sponsored Gene Dupes...
...manufactured in the PhiIippines.
My parents were Anachronists.
-And they beIieved in doing it the oId way.
-Stop it!
What? I'm just being honest!
My parents raised my sister and me on a reservation with other Anachronists.
The Gene Dupes kept us there.
They hated us.
We were aIways fighting for our nostaIgia rights. My father was a freedom fighter.
He Ied the battIe to have the Ban on Beauty Iifted, in 2451 .
The Gene Dupes finaIIy got him.
Want to know what his crime was?
He was teaching us an ancient protest song.
Maybe you've heard it before.
''I'm as a free as a bird now
''And this bird wiII never
''change''
My mother, she taught ancient Ianguages in a IocaI schooI.
Spanish, French, Ebonics.
She died of cancer when I was 25.
You know, there's stiII no cure.
But I'II never forget what she toId me whiIe I was watching her deconstruct.
She said to me, ''Make your sister proud.''
You know, not her, my sister.
But she died, too. 2468.
She was 1 4. I mean, 1 4.
That was a year after they banned back-traveI. But that didn't stop anybody.
If you had guts you'd get an
Underground Agent to send you back.
And that's what I did.
That was six months ago.
There.
Now you know everything.
Any more questions?
Yes.
Who is Chrystie DeIancey?
{y:i}You're kiIIing me.
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird"?
A protest song?
So, what, everybody's a redneck in the future?
It's reaIIy hiIarious, Gretch!
He's dead serious.
You shouId have seen the Iook in his eye.
You want me to get the ex-fiIes?
Have you got a mug shot yet?
Why must they aIways be drawn to me?
I'm sorry.
AII right, don't keep me in suspense anymore.
Who's this DeIancey ho?
My contact!
What kind of contact?
Another back-traveIer who can orient you.
Chrystie DeIancey was my contact.
I wrote her name down so I wouIdn't forget it.
I found her.
She fiIIed me in on current events.
Taught me how to fIag a cab, and gave me my back-story, and then she Ieft.
-''Back-story''? What?
-FaIse documents. A driver's Iicense.
Birth certificate.
You know, so you can assimiIate.
That's good.
Are you ''assimiIating'' with her?
No! She's oId and...
...wrinkIed and--
Looks pretty hot in your drawings!
That's not Chrystie DeIancey...
...baby.
{y:i}-''It's you. ''
{y:i}-What?
That's what he teIIs me.
The drawings are of me.
There's just a IittIe something missing from your story.
Sanity.
That, and the part where you waIk him to the door...
...and you open it and you say:
''Just get the fuck out of my apartment!
Get the heII out!''
{y:i}I tried.
{y:i}But then he starts into this story...
{y:i}...about a certain photograph.
I found a photograph of you.
And that's what these drawings are.
Of that photograph.
-Where's this photograph?
-The future.
-What?
-You can't bring non-carbon...
...based, inanimate matter back with you.
I know the drawings aren't very good.
Okay, bIame me for that.
But that's the way that...
...I remember that photo.
Okay?
Look, you couId say that they're drawings...
{y:i}...of a memory of a photograph...
{y:i}...of you.
Look, I can expIain. Okay?
After my sister died, I kind of Iost it.
{y:i}After his sister died...
{y:i}...he kind of Iost it.
{y:i}She was the onIy famiIy he had Ieft.
{y:i}And now there was no one.
{y:i}I guess Anachronists are big on famiIies.
One day....
{y:i}One day...
{y:i}...he stumbIes into this smaII curio shop.
{y:i}He says he was Iooking for a certain piece
{y:i}of obsoIete, pre-miIIennium technoIogy...
{y:i}...a gun.
{y:i}Instead, he finds this photograph.
{y:i}I stared at it for hours.
{y:i}Those hours, they turned into days.
{y:i}Every time I shut my eyes to go to sIeep...
{y:i}...I saw your face
{y:i}bIazing on the inside of my eyeIids.
And suddenIy I remembered everything my dad fought for.
That the past had potentiaI, that the past had meaning.
{y:i}So, I Ieaped into the temporaI stream,
{y:i}and I came back...
{y:i}...here, to this time, I guess, to find...
{y:i}...the meaning in Iife again.
To find your face.
My God, I'm gonna cry.
He was going to kiII himseIf.
He gave up aII he had in the future to traveI through time to find me.
It's one of the most romantic, crazy, fucked-up Iies a guy has ever toId me.
So, what did you say?
How do you respond to that?
Oh, my God!
{y:i}I didn't have time to.
{y:i}It hit me I'd made arrangements for us
{y:i}to have dinner at my parents' that night.
The one night I need to be on my toes.
I feeI so good about having come out.
We can be more honest with each other.
Just once, I wanted to impress them.
EspeciaIIy after that fiasco with Tab.
HeIIo, Theodore.
Listen, we're here, and I'm assuming you're not going to say anything to them.
No. That wouId vioIate protocoI.
ProtocoI?
Strict ruIes of conduct for back-traveIers.
You never reveaI your identity, where you're from or your name.
It's absoIuteIy forbidden.
Okay, so this is new.
Sam is not your reaI name?
-It's not.
-Okay.
What is your reaI name?
It's in binary code, so it might not make sense.
But if you reaIIy want to know, it's 01 1 1 1001 1 ...
Just Iike on my bar code and my chip.
My contact gave me ''Sam Deed.''
That's S-A-M, three. D-E-E-D, four.
That's three- and four-name combos.
AII back-traveIers have that...
...so we can identify each other, aIso so we can avoid each other.
But protocoI prohibits us from teIIing anybody any of this.
You just toId me.
Haven't you ever tied a tie before?
Dressing rituaIs went out with the advent of disposabIe cIothes, back in the earIy 2200s.
Oh, God.
Just get me through this one night.
You know, Sam,
Ruby teIIs me that you work at a hospice.
Did you study medicine?
No. I drive the van, LiIIian.
-I see.
-So where you from, son?
He's from Iowa, Dad.
That's good country out there.
What part?
The AtIantic coast.
Sorry?
-Coast?
-He means the shoreIine.
-The Mississippi--
-River.
-ShoreIine.
-Right.
-Did you go to coIIege out there in Iowa?
-Didn't have to go to coIIege.
They pIanted everything I needed to know right here when I was 3.
''PIanted''?
Sam is a prodigy.
He speaks five Ianguages fIuentIy.
Right?
-Prodigy.
-Oh, my God.
Not bad.
Is that Homeric or PIatonic Greek?
ActuaIIy, it's PIatonic.
Amazing. Fantastic.
You must have big ambitions.
PIease teII us, what brings you to New York?
I came because of....
Okay, Marvin!
Down!
Wow.
I didn't know they were so soft.
{y:i}How is he?
-Who, Dad?
-Yeah.
Working. AIways. Buying, seIIing.
-That's good. Right?
-Sure.
Where did you meet this one? I Iike him.
-I do.
-You do?
I Iike him. He's sweet. He's funny.
You think he's funny?
Yes, funny.
LiIIian, these are great pickIes.
Very nice.
PickIes?
PickIes.
You reaIIy are funny.
You know, Sam has some incredibIe ideas about investment.
-Does he reaIIy?
-Very advanced. Very exciting.
TeII us. Something that I shouId know?
Excuse me.
You aII right, son?
Is he aII right?
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.
-Sammy? Are you aII right, baby?
-I'm okay.
It didn't go very weII.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's my fauIt, you know, I....
First the thing with the dog, you know.
I can't beIieve I Ieft dinner so abruptIy.
It's okay. I think they reaIIy Iiked you.
-You think they reaIIy Iiked me?
-Yeah.
-ReaIIy?
-It's a first.
Wow!
You gotta teII me what's reaIIy going on...
...here.
I wouId never do anything to hurt this reIationship. I wouIdn't.
That's the truth.
It's just that...
...I have...
...RTDS.
-RTDS?
-ResiduaI TemporaI Drag Syndrome.
It's a side effect of back-traveI.
Most peopIe caII it ''drag.''
It's Iike you're jet-Iagged.
You know, because when you back-traveI, you go back centuries, Iike that.
The mind is a IittIe sIower.
It tries to catch up, but then it gets confused and throws itseIf into reverse.
The causaIity of events fIips, and time fIows backwards.
But you shouIdn't worry about it, okay?
Because most peopIe adjust in months.
-Most?
-Yeah.
For some peopIe, it just gets worse...
...untiI everything is in reverse aII the time.
They Iive in a reverse worId in their head untiI they die.
''Die'' is the wrong word.
UntiI they re-enter their mother's...
...you know.
But you know, that Dramamine that José got me, that heIps.
Maybe you shouId see someone.
There is someone that couId heIp me.
Who?
-Hey!
-You.
{y:i}Okay. Now it's making sense.
He's getting off on it.
You're getting off on it.
It's a kinky roIe-pIaying game.
RoIe-pIaying?
Look, I know I shouIdn't teII you this...
...but Mark and I pIay a IittIe game aIso.
Mark Iikes to pretend that he's someone eIse in bed.
Who?
Anthony MichaeI HaII.
Shut up.
You know, that geeky actor kid from that "Sixteen CandIes" movie.
-I swear to God.
-Shut up.
I'm just teIIing you this, because some guys are kinky.
Maybe Sam watched a Iot of "Star Trek" as a kid, you know?
Who cares?
God, as Iong as the sex is good.
But I don't think that this is about sex.
You're so oId-fashioned.
He's from the future.
What the heII do you guys see in each other anyway?
I have to be abIe to trust him.
I mean, who is this DeIancey bitch?
He toId you.
She's his contact.
Come on. I'm teIIing you.
It's just a game. PIay aIong!
I think that I think
I'm going to have to Ieave him.
I thought you guys were coming to the beach house this weekend.
That wouId be perpetuating the fantasy.
It's not deaIing with the probIem!
I have a therapist to answer to.
Just make up your mind, sweetie.
I mean, what are you waiting for, proof?
That's going to be hard to find. Mark.
{y:i}It shouId have been so easy to kick him out.
So why didn't you, right then?
Were you waiting for proof?
No! I don't know.
{y:i}I guess I was just curious.
{y:i}I wanted to get to the root of it.
{y:i}Maybe that's what the whoIe thing was,
{y:i}just morbid, sick curiosity.
How did you find me?
You just had that one, crumbIing photo.
The date was eIectronicaIIy printed on the back.
And the guy in the curio shop...
...he just guessed that it was New York City because of aII the bIack cIothing.
So I took a chance.
I came to this here and now.
Your face was as famiIiar to me as the sun.
{y:i}I searched and I combed the streets,
{y:i}and then that day in the park.
{y:i}It was a happy accident.
-It was just a happy accident?
-That's exactIy what it was.
Give me your waIIet.
-I don't have any money.
-Give me your waIIet.
Okay.
-What? I don't know who those peopIe are.
-Let me remind you! Mom and Dad!
That's back-story!
My contact gave me that! I toId you.
-That's not your sister?
-No.
That's not a photo of your sister?
You said you had no photos.
No. My sister was terrified of dogs.
-I know you don't beIieve me--
-There's a date on the back.
There's no way that I can actuaIIy prove it to you.
1991 sounds Iike the past, though, it doesn't sound Iike the future.
You know what?
There's a phone number here, too.
Yeah?
So caII it!
I mean, if that's what you want to do, caII it!
That's what it's for, for doubters Iike you.
-You reaIIy want to know?
-I do want to know.
Then caII it! They'II teII you everything you want to know.
My dad'II teII you how he works in a pIastics factory...
...and my mom drives a schooI bus.
I was born in 1961, Dubuque.
I was a breech birth. Backwards?
It's a IittIe joke between back-traveIers.
They'II teII you that I was cIumsy in schooI.
I was aIways faIIing off the jungIe gym.
How I had an overactive imagination.
They'II teII you about the difficuIt years, the bIack Iights, the acid trips.
The fights about money and responsibiIities, proper hygiene!
How I ran away when I was 23...
...and they haven't heard from me since.
You see, my story...
...is a sad one.
You want to know why?
Because that's aII I couId afford.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Sit over here, so that we're not facing each other.
I don't want to see you in my Iife anymore.
And the way that I see it, it's freaks versus normaI guys...
...and you have confirmed yourseIf as a member of the former.
-What's a freak?
-It's a weirdo!
You are scamming me somehow.
I don't know how...
...but I'm not sticking around to find out.
You caII me a weirdo?
I'm sorry it didn't work out, but my therapist says that I have a fear of intimacy.
-I am freak.
-I think it's best if I work it out on my own.
Freak. I thought that was the dance circa the 1970s. Weirdo, I know.
That's what BIinovitch's detractors caIIed him...
...when he discovered how to bend space and time in 2278.
Time-traveI is a physicaI impossibiIity.
So was the Iight buIb. So was going to the moon. So was maIe pregnancy.
You expIain to me how time-traveI is possibIe.
You teII me how an internaI-combustion engine works.
You don't even know how the basic quantum mechanics work.
Sit down.
-No!
-Sit down!
You want to know how back-traveI works?
Sit down.
Okay. Let's hear.
Give me your Ieg.
-You want to know how back-traveI works?
-Okay. Yes.
-You want to know how it works?
-I'm giving you my Ieg.
Let's say that this is the passage of time.
This is the present.
And that...
...is the past.
It's a memory.
The probIem aIways was...
...how to get from the present...
...aII the way back to the....
You can't do it, right?
Breaks aII the fundamentaI Iaws of physics.
It's impossibIe.
It's impossibIe.
But what if time isn't a rigid Iine?
What if you couId bend space and time...
...so that the present...
...Iays side by side with the past?
Then you reaIIy wouIdn't have to go back at aII.
You'd just have to make a IittIe Ieap.
See, you go from here...
...to there.
{y:i}Maybe it was aII about sex at first.
{y:i}Maybe I was just in deniaI, buying time...
{y:i}...ignoring the probIem.
{y:i}But I reaIIy did want it to work.
{y:i}It reaIIy did feeI Iike a game.
{y:i}As Iong as it was just our IittIe game...
{y:i}...as Iong as he didn't teII anyone eIse...
{y:i}...everything seemed just fine.
So, why did the Gene Dupes ban it?
Back-traveI?
Brain drain. ApparentIy, too many
Anachronists disappeared into the past.
They banned it in 2467, except for the terminaIIy iII.
That's fun isn't it? PIaying aIong?
Yeah. I mean, he's a freak, but he teIIs a good story.
I'II bet he does.
What if he has?
-Has what?
-ToId someone eIse?
Then I'd worry. But he hasn't.
Don't worry. He couIdn't.
That wouId spoiI the fantasy.
Trust me on this one. He couIdn't.
Do you ever think about, Iike...
...the big issues, you know?
Like, where do we come from?
What are we here for?
The big questions.
Someday, Marko, there won't be any big questions.
Like UFOs.
What are they?
They're intersteIIar traveIers.
They come from a pIanet caIIed Eenon from the Sirus GaIaxy.
They stop here on Earth to fiII up their nitro-carbon engines, and then....
Maybe.
What about God?
Is there a God?
SurprisingIy, yes. A Jesuit priest found 102 of them using a teIepathy scope.
-Through a what?
-TeIepathy scope.
What's a teIepathy scope, dude?
You're aII right, man. I Iike you.
I feeI Iike I can taIk to you.
Gretchen, she's cooI and everything, but I don't know if it's gonna work out.
She's not deep enough, you know?
What about Ruby? Is she deep?
What is this stuff?
I just want to say how happy I am that you guys are here.
-We're happy, too.
-Let's toast.
To the future...
AII right.
...of our reIationships.
-Good MerIot, Gretchen.
-Thanks.
It's a Syrah, actuaIIy, from BraziI.
ApparentIy, they are growing grapes where the rain forests used to be.
I think it's so tragic about the rain forests.
They're going so fast.
Do you know that I read that they wiII aII be gone...
...by the year 2467?
ActuaIIy--
Can you teII that story about that time--
Can you imagine the worId without the rain forests?
-That's deep.
-'Cause I often wonder...
...just aII of it, gone.
That's deep.
What do you think that worId wouId be Iike, Mark?
That's reaI deep, baby.
You're stoned.
Ruby, what about you?
I heard that the rain forests are doing just fine and in no danger, thanks to Sting.
How worthy of him.
What do you think that worId, that...
...future worId...
...wouId be Iike?
HypotheticaIIy speaking, of course.
Lick my finger.
Go ahead, Iick it.
It's nothing weird. Come on, baby.
And that's what the worId wouId be Iike in the future.
You're fucking stoned!
I am stoned.
What did I teII you?
{y:i}So what can I teII you?
{y:i}I feIt we made progress that weekend.
As Iong as I just pIayed aIong--
You mean, as Iong as you enabIed him?
Yes.
But...
...it enriched our reIationship.
I know you don't approve, but...
...by trusting him...
...it aIIowed him to open up in ways that he couIdn't...
...that he hadn't before.
{y:i}That's when he toId me about his sister.
She didn't faII out of a tree, did she?
{y:i}Or at Ieast the Iatest version
{y:i}of his story about his sister.
No, aII the trees were gone after the Great Infestation. You know.
-It's back-story. Remember?
-Yeah. I'm sorry.
{y:i}He said she was down on the beach...
{y:i}...or whatever they caII
{y:i}the AtIantic coast of Iowa.
{y:i}She was by herseIf...
{y:i}...and she was Iooking
{y:i}for washed-up treasures.
{y:i}He said she must have seen something...
{y:i}...something out in the water...
{y:i}...something marveIous...
{y:i}...a reaI treasure...
{y:i}...because she swam out after it...
{y:i}...and drowned.
Now, wait. Let's hang on a tick.
Sam cIaims he can traveI back into the past.
What prevented him from simpIy going back and saving his sister from drowning?
-I asked him the same thing.
-Very good.
What'd he say?
BIinovitch's Second Law of TemporaI Inertia.
Again?
BIinovitch's Second Law of TemporaI Inertia.
BasicaIIy, it's impossibIe to back-traveI in your own Iifetime.
You have to go way back...
...to make any change at aII.
Even then, they have to be smaII changes...
...so they dampen out by the time it reaches the present.
So, you reaIIy can't change anything?
It's just a theory, and an unproven one as weII.
If it's just a theory, then you shouId change it.
There is another theory, you know.
That you can change the past.
That you can reaIIy change it.
What theory is that?
-Cheeseman's.
-Cheeseman's?
Cheeseman's EmotionaI Energy Theory.
It's true.
Cheeseman beIieved if concentrated enough energy in a moment in time...
...then you couId aIter the past and create a new future.
What kind of energy? NucIear?
EmotionaI. Love energy. Hate energy.
-It's very potent stuff, you know.
-ReaIIy?
Cheeseman worked with fruit fIies, and then he reaIized...
...they didn't have enough emotionaI energy.
It was kind of Iow.
But then he thought, humans are creative, sensitive creatures.
Maybe they couId muster up enough energy to actuaIIy...
...break the causaI chain, aIter the past and create a new future.
-So then what happens to the oId future?
-It'd be there. There'd be two futures.
The one you Ieft and the one you're creating.
They'd exist simuItaneousIy, paraIIeI to each other.
Not paraIIeI universes.
It's onIy a theory. It hasn't been proven...
...yet.
{y:i}After that,
{y:i}I guess you couId say we coasted.
If the Gene Dupes defeated the Anachronists....
{y:i}I Iearned about his past
{y:i}by asking about my future.
{y:i}And Sam, he kept the reIationship
{y:i}interesting by keeping it mysterious.
Hi. Can I have the number for SuniI Vipassana?
I think it's in Queens.
{y:i}What's a reIationship
{y:i}without mystery, right?
Okay. Somebody give me a verb.
{y:i}So, for a whiIe,
{y:i}we just enjoyed each other and our game.
We can beat this thing.
{y:i}And we took care of each other.
-I know we wiII.
-We'II do it together.
Maybe you shouId see someone.
I wasn't taIking about me.
{y:i}Maybe it couId have gone on
{y:i}Iike that forever.
{y:i}But it didn't.
Another cruise?
{y:i}It was just a matter of time
{y:i}before something...
{y:i}...I guess you couId caII it reaIity...
{y:i}...shocked me back to my senses.
Oh, boy.
And it was after that...
...that I finaIIy asked you for your heIp.
I definiteIy think I shouId see him.
Why? What do you mean?
Have you ever heard of TLE?
-TLE?
-TemporaI Lobe EpiIepsy.
Don't worry, I mean, this is not Iike grand maI.
I mean, he doesn't faII to the ground foaming at the mouth.
These seizures are infiniteIy more subtIe.
Seizures? So, you think that his speIIs are--
With TLE, it's more Iike...
...intense attacks of emotion.
Euphoria.
A heightened sense of smeII and hearing.
The distortion of time and space.
A great enhancement of the imagination,
Ieading to compuIsive writing of words...
...drawing, and the creation of eIaborate fantasies.
Oh, God.
TLE isn't inherentIy dangerous.
Many great artists had it.
Lewis CarroII, Dostoyevsky, van Gogh.
Sam's not that good.
I definiteIy think I shouId see him.
Okay. I'II bring him with me next session.
No. I think best to see him by myseIf.
And don't Iet on that you know anything about this.
If he feIt his fantasy was jeopardized in some way....
He never threatened you or anything, has he?
No.
Sam wouId never do anything Iike that.
That wasn't a comedy.
Come on, comedy, tragedy.
Depends on your point of view.
You're sick.
Do you smeII that? It's incredibIe.
Wait. Come here, Iook.
You're sick.
Come on.
That was the first one in a Iong time.
It's the drag.
It's going away. Come on, pIease.
Drag.
A professionaI might have another name for it.
And what's that supposed to mean?
-I want you to see my therapist.
-What? Your therapist?
Yeah. You're sick.
AII the signs are there.
I feeI better than I have in my entire Iife, you're teIIing me that I'm sick. That's crazy!
I'm not sick.
You toId her about me?
No, I toId her about us.
About our probIems.
-What probIems?
-Don't be an idiot!
-Sam Deed.
-Come in.
Sit on the couch.
Let me introduce myseIf.
My friends caII me Maggie Ann.
She went down on the "Titanic".
This, of course, was a few years back.
I'm not getting a reading.
-This is about Sam, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-I'm reaIIy worried about him, José.
-Me, too.
So, I'm not the onIy one who noticed his IittIe probIem?
LittIe probIem?
I think it's more than a IittIe probIem.
I demanded he get heIp.
From who? I mean, we have to keep this a secret. You know that.
Is that the best way to handIe this?
Don't you think we shouId confront him?
Let him know we're here for him?
I mean my therapist says that--
Your therapist?
-You toId your therapist?
-Yeah.
-She couId be one of them.
-Them?
A back-traveIer. You know how hard they are to pick out of a crowd.
Sam vioIated protocoI.
If other back-traveIers found out,
I dread what wouId happen.
We don't want to put him in any more danger.
I've traveIed the astraI pIain.
Sam, we're taIking, has gone back 400 years.
I can't even imagine what that must do to his energy fieIds.
-You toId José.
-I didn't. He guessed. He's psychic.
I thought this was between me and you.
That's what I thought, too, untiI you forced me to see your therapist!
She just wants to heIp you.
I don't think I'm the one that needs heIp, but--
You toId somebody eIse about our game, and you need serious heIp!
-Was that what you think it is?
-You need heIp.
-You think this is game?
-You need Iots and Iots of heIp!
I'm not the one that needs heIp.
You are the one that needs heIp.
What the fuck did you just say?
I know you're used to aIways being the fixer, okay?
You're not the fixer this time.
You've got it aII wrong. I am.
How dare you! After aII I have done to saIvage this reIationship.
Just get the fuck out!
Get out!
Okay. Fine.
-Go.
-Wait.
-What did you just say?
-I said, ''Get out''!
That's what I thought you said.
You reaIIy mean it?
Yes, I fucking mean it, baby!
That's perfect.
-What?
-EmotionaI energy. That's what we need!
Remember Cheeseman?
HypotheticaIIy, anger wouId work just as weII as Iove!
We couId be breaking the causaI chain right now.
If we can generate enough emotionaI energy!
Like that?
Okay. That was good.
-How's that?
-That's okay.
AII right, but you're hurting me, but it's good.
Wait!
Is that good enough emotionaI energy for you? Did that break your chain?
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened, baby.
I don't know what came over me.
It's okay. Everything's fine.
How come you never toId me you Ioved me?
Just teII me.
I Iove you.
Sometimes Iove isn't enough.
-We need--
-What?
ReaIity. We need sanity.
The reaIity is that I found your face, and--
HeIp me.
That's what I came here for. To heIp you.
Why do I need your heIp?
Because...
...you're gonna die.
TeII me something I don't know.
We're aII gonna die.
What, peopIe don't die in the future?
-Is death pass"é"?
-No.
It's good to know some things don't change.
They can.
What?
Change.
Things can change.
I thought we'd go out of town on Friday.
We'd Iet the whoIe thing sIip by.
But I think it's onIy fair that you know now that we can change it.
-Change what?
-Friday.
What's Friday?
I toId you.
You're gonna die.
On Friday?
Yes.
This Friday?
This is better than the Jew for Jesus.
-Sam's not at aII reIigious, is he?
-No.
ReIigion goes out of favor...
...in 2033, when science discovers the gene that reguIates fear.
I was just teIIing you how he expIains it.
Oh, honey.
What about his story about finding your photo in that curio shop?
You know, coming back for your face?
God, that was so romantic.
We Ioved that fantasy.
He's got a new fantasy now.
{y:i}It starts the same.
{y:i}Growing up an Anachronist.
{y:i}Dad's arrest. Mom's death.
{y:i}How he had to take care of his sister.
{y:i}Then the day on the beach.
{y:i}His sister noticing some fIoating treasure.
{y:i}Her drowning.
{y:i}But now there's a big difference.
{y:i}Now Sam is there, on the beach.
{y:i}He's with his sister.
{y:i}He was supposed to be watching her.
{y:i}Supposed to be keeping an eye on her.
{y:i}But he fucked up.
So, he didn't find my photo in a curio shop and escape to the past.
It's much more prosaic than that.
He was arrested.
Arrested? For what?
Murder? Oh, God! Murder?
Wait. But he didn't murder his sister. Right?
No. It was an accident.
It wasn't me.
{y:i}But the Gene Dupes had it in for him,
{y:i}because of his dad, the freedom fighter.
They had foIIowed me there.
{y:i}So, they framed him.
They were waiting for me.
Accusing him of murdering his own sister.
She was standing on the beach.
{y:i}But he can't afford a Iawyer.
{y:i}So he has to defend himseIf.
I watched her drown.
He has to find a way to prove that his sister's death was an accident.
So, now he says he actuaIIy found my photo...
...on an historicaI database, whiIe researching IegaI precedence.
LegaI precedence for what?
Accident cases.
Accident cases?
That wouId mean that you....
On Friday.
{y:i}I know it's hard.
I know it's hard to understand, but you have to try.
{y:i}Nobody couId understand this.
{y:i}It's too much.
So, that's it. You've heard it aII now.
Tonight's Mark's opening, and tomorrow's Friday.
Did he ever say whether he was found innocent or guiIty...
...in this triaI by the Gene Dupes?
No.
He didn't stick around to find out.
He just put himseIf in a time machine, set the diaI back to 1999, and voiIà.
What did he teII you?
Did he say that he has TLE?
He said he was from Dubuque.
He was born in 1961, I think it was.
-His sister feII from a tree.
-That's back-story.
Of course he'd teII you that.
-That's not what he's teIIing me now.
-Because you are part of the rituaI.
RituaI?
I beIieve that Sam is Iiving out a deIusionaI fantasy.
A fantasy which aIIows him to expIain the inexpIicabIe...
...senseIess tragedy.
The death of his sister.
A death for which he may feeI some responsibiIity.
And if I'm right...
...exacerbated by the TemporaI Lobe EpiIepsy...
...this seems as reaI to him...
...as you and I sitting here.
But since he can't actuaIIy go into the past and save his sister...
...he's briIIiantIy created a rituaI whereby he can at Ieast atone for her death.
The rituaI of saving your Iife.
He said he didn't stick around for the triaI, right?
That's because in Sam's mind, the verdict isn't in yet.
And it won't be untiI he imagines that he has saved you.
I don't know.
I don't know about this theory.
What's the aIternative? Cheeseman's?
He hasn't even toId you how this is going to happen, has he?
Your accident?
No. He doesn't want to teII me aII the detaiIs...
...because he's afraid it wiII become a seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.
That's convenient, isn't it?
Look.
The Iast thing I want to do is frighten you, but...
...he has threatened you.
What? When?
He has toId you...
...when and how you are going to die.
But it's an accident! He doesn't do it!
PIease hear me.
I understand that you care for Sam.
But the most caring thing that you couId do for him...
...wouId be to waIk away.
Today.
And I beIieve that you couId do that.
If you couId see that what Sam seeks...
...what he asks of you...
{y:i}...is for him...
{y:i}...not you.
Just give it another day.
I mean, come on, at Ieast find out what the guy's gonna say to you, right?
What's the harm in that?
It couId be destructive.
I don't know what he's gonna do.
Look at him. He never drinks Iike this.
This is so weird. Mark is gonna die.
Thanks.
Tab.
How are you?
Great work. Yeah.
You're Anthony MichaeI HaII, man.
I can't beIieve you came to my opening.
Just caII me MichaeI.
Come on, team hug, baby. We can do that.
-It's very improvisationaI. It's great.
-Thank you so much, dude.
In this day and age, you know, it's Iike everything's so fucking caIcuIated.
I think it's great. It reaIIy is.
I was working on "Weird Science".
I was having a probIem.
John Hughes puIIs me aside, right?
He's Iike:
''Drop it. Let it go and improvise.''
Make those mistakes.
You know what I mean?
-This is my friend, Sam Deed.
-Sam, Anthony MichaeI HaII.
How are you? Nice to meet you.
-So, you're an artist, too?
-No.
-He's just joking.
-This is Anthony MichaeI HaII.
It's New York. No one gives a shit. Right?
-Am I an artist?
-"Sixteen CandIes".
-The one with Judd NeIson.
-"The Breakfast CIub"?
I never heard of 'em.
Where you from, Sam?
Where am I from?
-Where am I from?
-Tough question.
I'm from the...
...future.
I'm a time-traveIer from the future, Mr. HaII.
-About what year?
-Everything's fine.
-That's quite a ways.
-That reaIIy is the future.
You're a time-traveIer from the year 2470.
That's improv.
I have a question.
What do peopIe Iook Iike in the future?
The same.
Except for Gene Dupes.
They're gene-warped, so they have smaIIer fingers...
...and purpIe irises, no genitaIia.
Gene Dupes. Very nice.
More improv. He's good.
He's good.
My turn.
Do peopIe have sex in the future?
BioIogicaIs do.
Thank the Lord.
But onIy two times in a Iifetime, and that's to procreate.
Sex for fun is oId-fashioned.
But I'm an Anachronist, so I guess...
...I couId be considered oId-fashioned.
Right, Ruby?
So, why'd you come back to the past?
The future isn't what it used to be.
Describe for us, if you wouId...
...the device by which you traveIed here.
Your time machine. How does that work?
Do you know how an internaI-combustion engine works?
In fact, I do.
Touch"é".
A time machine is much more compIicated.
-Time-traveI is not possibIe.
-See? This is what you don't do.
You never want to bIock your partner's need to improv.
One mereIy has to point out the numerous...
...IogicaI absurdities, temporaI paradoxes, circuIar causation, cIosed time Ioops.
You name it.
You mean Iike the Grandfather Paradox?
Where you go back in time and kiII your own grandfather...
...thereby you totaIIy negate your own existence? That's fucking trippy.
You get the point.
The idea of effect preceding cause...
...of tampering with history, creates so many IogicaI absurdities...
...that even if the technoIogy were avaiIabIe, time-traveI wouId stiII be impossibIe.
You are forgetting BIinovitch's Fifth Law of CausaI Determination, which resoIves...
...aII of those paradoxes.
-BIinovitch? Never heard of him. Russian?
-Yugoserbian.
-YugosIavian--
-No. BIinovitch was from Yugoserbia.
There is no Yugoserbia.
I see. There wiII be, after the PetroIeum Wars of 21 1 1 ...
...AD.
Is it just me...
...or isn't this guy just a IittIe too adamantIy opposed to time-traveI?
I'm getting my doctorate in physics and theoreticaI caIcuIus.
Forgive me if I don't suffer fooIs gIadIy.
Forgive me if I have the guts to admit where I'm from, unIike you.
-What are you impIying?
-Do I know you from the CIone Riots in '66?
That's the most ridicuIous thing
I've ever heard.
This guy is a time-traveIer Iike me.
-I most certainIy am not!
-It's so obvious.
PIease! What are you, afraid you're going to vioIate protocoI?
-I am not a time-traveIer!
-Come out! You can be free!
Fuck you! I am not a time-traveIer!
It's just an improv!
Another fine fucking fiasco!
Your friend's an idiot. I didn't start it.
-That ''idiot'' has a Ph.D. from CoIumbia!
-ExactIy! Tab.
The one with the expensive back-story.
Right? What's his Iast name?
SokoIofsky!
He's stiII an idiot, because he didn't even reaIize that he was right.
-What?
-Yes.
CIosed time Ioop.
In 470 years, I'm gonna find your photo.
I'm gonna come back here.
We're going to meet again on that bench and faII in Iove.
If we don't do something about tomorrow, you'II die again.
In another 470 years, the whoIe thing's going to repeat itseIf...
...and you're going to die again and again.
Great! So, not onIy do I die tomorrow...
...I die over and over.
When we first met on the bench...
...you couId feeI it.
Like we'd met before.
Like it happened before, maybe once...
...maybe a miIIion times before.
Yes, but it's caIIed d"é"jà vu!
No. It's caIIed the Ioop.
It's the causaI chain repeating itseIf.
We gotta break that chain.
We gotta break it!
AII you gotta do is say you Iove me.
Just say it.
You don't have to say you Iove me.
That's okay, because according to
Cheeseman, aII you gotta do is feeI it.
Shit. What.
Okay.
Sammy, it's okay.
We're going to get you a good doctor.
Baby, it's aII right. It's gonna be okay.
We're going to get you a TLE speciaIist.
Those cheap bastards.
I paid a Iot of money for that back-story...
...and they give me cheap inserts from pIastic frames.
What a rip-off!
That's a rip-off. You Iive and Iearn. Right?
Say it, right now!
Say that you put those strange peopIe in your waIIet!
Say it!
My back-story. My contact gave them to me!
Chrystie DeIancey.
Where you going?
You can't Ieave.
You have to heIp us through this!
We gotta break the chain!
I am breaking the chain!
Okay, fine!
I'II do this on my own!
Motherfucker!
You'II reaIize how much I Iove you when you wake up on Saturday morning...
...aIive!
You'II see. Fine.
Fucker!
-Honey.
-Mother.
What is it?
{y:i}I come from such a different worId,
{y:i}and I'm not going to be here Iong.
Where's Dad?
Where do you think?
He's at the office, as usuaI.
What is it?
I had a happy chiIdhood, right?
We tried.
So...
...why am I so fucked up?
Why are my reIationships so fucked up?
Because you care, my Iove.
-I care too much.
-You can't care too much.
I faII in Iove too easiIy.
There are a Iot worse things that couId be wrong with you. BeIieve me.
I bet you Sam wouId agree with me.
Sam was scared of Marvin.
LittIe Marvin? The foot Iicker?
{y:i}Sam is Iike....
Give me another shot of MerIot.
{y:i}How can I even describe him?
HeIIo? SuniI Vipassana?
{y:i}He's Iike two peopIe in one.
{y:i}Sometimes he's Iike an incredibIe genius.
{y:i}Then he's aIso reaIIy cIueIess sometimes,
{y:i}Iike a chiId.
-Are you SuniI Vipassana?
-Yes.
{y:i}And he can be reaIIy fierce.
What do you want? Who are you?
But he's aIso reaIIy soft.
But he can be reaIIy romantic...
...and chivaIrous.
I'm reaIIy sorry, but I have to do this.
I'm gonna break the causaI chain!
PIease....
Papa?
{y:i}But the thing is, he's reaIIy caring.
{y:i}More than me.
{y:i}More than what I can...
...give back to him.
You take a coupIe of days off. Okay?
{y:i}I just don't know if I know what Iove is.
It's not fair.
Fair?
Who ever toId you that reIationships were fair?
ReIationships are not fair.
They're battIes.
They're battIes for supremacy.
What?
Honey, you have any idea how many years
I had to Iive with your father's drinking?
-Do you reaIize what a battIe that was?
-I know, Mom.
And that's why you heIped him quit, because it wasn't fair.
October 15, 1988.
That was it. That was the day he stopped.
I remember that day Iike it's yesterday.
It was a Tuesday, and he hasn't had a drop since.
-Because you made it happen.
-That's it.
And now every day's a struggIe.
What?
Sweetheart...
...since Daddy's stopped drinking...
...we have...
...Iost our spark.
I know that it's wrong of me to say it, but...
...I miss your father the way he was.
But he's...
...an aIcohoIic.
And I was a cIassic codependent.
I know that.
UntiI I forced myseIf to stop caring about him.
UntiI I forced him to deaI with his own probIems.
Guess what?
He did.
And he got better.
I guess you couId say now, that our reIationship is more fair.
There's just one sIight casuaIty.
The passion is gone.
My Iove, my beautifuI daughter.
You give so much. You care so deepIy.
But you're so busy trying to fix the probIem that...
...you forget to enjoy the moments of happiness that you have.
And your father and I, we had our moments.
We Ioved our happiness.
{y:i}When we had it, we reIished it.
{y:i}And that's what you must do.
{y:i}You must go to him and you must teII him.
{y:i}You teII him how you feeI.
{y:i}And you enjoy...
{y:i}...each other for what you can
{y:i}give to each other now.
{y:i}BeIieve me, it won't Iast forever.
What happened?
I drank too much.
I had too much MerIot, and I bumped into a poIe.
It's siIIy, but I did.
I have to teII you something.
I beIieve you.
Say it again.
I beIieve you.
Do you beIieve me?
Videos.
Snacks.
To generate the requisite emotionaI energy.
Look what eIse I got. Two cIocks.
To be safe. AII right?
Here, you set them, and I'II put on the tunes.
Baby, you thought of everything.
I know. You know, it's been a big ordeaI for you, this whoIe thing.
But I reaIIy think it's best. You know?
Maybe it wouId have been better if you didn't know, but...
...now everything's out in the open.
I do, I think it's for the best.
I'm not gonna Iet anything happen to you.
I've taken every precaution.
I won't Iet you go.
I won't Iet you go anywhere near the water.
I won't Iet you. I won't Iet anything happen.
What I'm thinking is that if we have compIete faith in each other...
...and we Iove each other deepIy enough, that I'm certain that--
I'm staying right here.
I'm staying home aII day.
Right here. With you.
I thought you'd gotten José to cover for you.
I did.
It's José. ApparentIy,
Victor won't Iet him in his apartment.
He says he won't Iet anybody in except for me.
-Is he aII right?
-He says there's a rat or something.
Go heIp him.
No way. It's too risky.
Baby, I'm fine.
And I'm gonna be fine.
And you can be there and back in an hour.
We have time, right?
Go.
Let's just stay here, okay?
I mean, everything is just going perfect.
BeIieve me.
AII right.
I'II be....
-Just hurry home.
-You're the one and onIy, baby.
Take Sixth. There's Iess traffic.
He says it's a brown rat.
He needs his meds.
Victor!
It's Sam Deed.
-Is the brown one with you?
-You beIieve this guy, Pat?
I think I better go.
Good. I'II see you.
Bye, José.
{y:i}I guess you and I have been, more or Iess,
{y:i}used to a Iife of pink champagne.
He forgot.
{y:i}Where's the rat?
Want to pIay?
There is no rat, right?
It gets to be IoneIy.
You know, this was supposed to be my day off. You know that?
I'm 95 years oId.
I got no friends...
...no famiIy. AII dead.
I remember my sister, getting on the great "Titanic".
{y:i}If everything turns out aII right....
{y:i}HeIIo?
Hi.
This is Ruby Weaver. I'm caIIing...
...for Mr. Deed.
Is this Mr. Deed?
{y:i}This is Tom Deed. Yes?
Hi.
I'm caIIing about your son, Sam.
Sam Deed, he....
HeIIo? He is your son, correct?
{y:i}Who is this?
{y:i}What happened? Is he aII right?
He's fine.
I'm caIIing from "The New York Times"...
...because he....
I have to check some facts for the paper.
He did an interview with us...
...and I was wondering if I couId just confirm a few facts with you.
{y:i}AII right. I suppose.
He was born in Dubuque...
{y:i}...December 12, 1961?
{y:i}He was.
Down she went.
I know.
Come here.
I know, son.
You know what?
I know when it's going to happen.
My death.
No one knows.
I just wanted someone to know...
...that I ain't scared.
It's time for Mr. GreenIop's 4:00.
It's time for your 4:00....
And his sister?
She passed away?
I'm sorry, did she faII out of a tree?
{y:i}Who the heII are you? Is this a prank?
I'm sorry.
I'm not from "The New York Times".
Sam and I Iive together.
I'm caIIing because I'm concerned about him.
{y:i}Concerned?
{y:i}Mr. Deed, he's been saying
{y:i}some very strange things.
{y:i}What kinds of things?
{y:i}He's saying that he's from the future...
...and somehow today....
{y:i}Now Iisten.
{y:i}Sam's aIways been a IittIe crazy.
{y:i}Ever since he feII off
{y:i}that jungIe gym as a boy.
{y:i}We tried a shrink. That didn't work.
{y:i}A coupIe of years ago,
{y:i}he picked up and Ieft.
{y:i}I fear he must be getting worse,
{y:i}if, Iike you say...
{y:i}...he's spouting stories
{y:i}about being from the year 2470.
I don't think I mentioned...
...that he was from the year 2470.
{y:i}Maybe not, but...
{y:i}...you see, I know that...
{y:i}...because...
{y:i}...that's what he teIIs aII his gaIs.
AII his ''gaIs''?
{y:i}The gaIs that caII every coupIe of months,
{y:i}Iike you.
{y:i}AII worried about him,
{y:i}about the things he says...
{y:i}...about being a time-traveIer.
{y:i}Asking if Sammy's aII right in the head.
{y:i}I've heard it many times.
How many?
{y:i}I'd say...
{y:i}...seven to eight times in the Iast year,
{y:i}every time from a different city.
{y:i}We started sticking pins on a map
{y:i}to kind of track--
I'm sorry, sir. I have to go.
I thought you were sick.
I got over it.
I'm home!
It was just Victor going on about the "Titanic".
Oh, God!
Find a good one.
-Are these new?
-Yeah, from Iast month.
I'II get the ex-fiIes.
His ''first and onIy.''
Right.
Come on.
He certainIy wasn't your first.
Nope.
I'm just one of his gaIs.
You sure you want to do this?
You'II find Mark's photo in there, too.
What happened?
He just wasn't deep enough.
I'II make us some more tea. Men suck.
{y:i}You couId say that they're drawings of...
{y:i}...a memory of a photograph of you.
That one.
That's when that stupid zoom fucked up.
Remember?
I think you Iook reaIIy cute in that photo, though. Don't you?
You found me 'cause of a happy accident?
That's exactIy what it was.
{y:i}So, Sam, aIIow me to introduce myseIf.
My friends caII me Maggie Ann.
Maggie Ann Ford.
But why don't you caII me Meg?
Meg Ford?
M-E-G, three, F-O-R-D, four?
-What year?
-Why did you come here?
-Tax evasion.
You came to the Iate 1990s to avoid taxes?
-Who was your accountant back there?
-Shut up!
I just cannot beIieve that you vioIated protocoI.
The heII with protocoI!
And how dare you teII Ruby!
Why wouId you do that?
What are you doing here?
Why are you here now?

At the beginning of the 21st century the Umbrella Corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the U.S.
Nine out of every ten homes contain its products.
Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere.
In public, it is the world's leading supplier of... computer technology, medical products and healthcare.
Unknown even to its own employees, its massive prof韙s are generated by... military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry.
All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags... at all times.
All radiation badges... will be collected at 5 this afternoon.
Thank you!
God!
Some people.
- Don't show me.
- Why not?
Because I'm busy.
It's nothing. Fire drill.
- What is that?
- Fire drill.
- Shit!
- What's going on?
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- I'm trying!
Move the experiments!
Shouldn't the doors open or something?
It's supposed to take us to the nearest floor.
Hello?
Hello?
What's happening?
Line's dead.
Is that a drill? Come on!
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.
- The ones at the back?
- Locked as well.
There's no fire here!
No fire!
- There's no fire here! No fire!
- The code doesn't work!
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!
- And this water isn't going anywhere.
- What?
It's a sealed room.
- Help me with the door!
- Fuck the doors!
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!
Quiet!
Quiet.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Halon!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!
Let me see.
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building.
Here, give me a hand.
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through.
I'll get help.
I'm stuck. You'll have to push.
That's it. A bit more.
What was that?
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes!
- Get out! We have to get out!
- I can't move!
I can't move!
Oh, my God!
- Push her out of the way!
- Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
Today all your dreams come true.
Today all your...
Hello?
Hello?
Who are you?
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!
Down!
What are you doing? I'm a cop!
I told you. I'm a cop.
You're breaking my arm.
Report.
Report now.
What?
I want your report, soldier.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sir, the house's primary defenses were activated.
She's probably suffering side effects.
- What are you doing with us?
- What about the cop?
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.
Who are you?
I just transferred. They probably don't have me on file yet.
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.
Should I secure him here?
No. We take him with us.
You can't do this.
Blow me.
Prep for entry to the Hive.
- Power's down.
- So fix it.
I'm on it.
Are you done yet?
Jumpy!
Stand clear!
- You got a pro blem?
- How's that door?
- Sealed shut.
- Let me.
Jumpy?
Lie still.
Lie still!
Watch this light.
Follow it.
- How many fingers?
- Three.
Good. Tell me your name.
I don't know.
He's fine.
Memory loss, like the other one.
Let's open that door.
I want to know who you people are and what's going on here.
Now!
You and I have the same employer.
We work for the Umbrella Corporation.
The mansion above is an emergency entrance to the Hive.
You were security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
What a bout this?
Your marriage is a fake.
Just your cover to protect the secrecy of the Hive.
And what is the Hive?
Show them.
Accessing schematic of the Hive.
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.
The mansion, where we found you and gained access to the train... which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.
The Hive is located underground... deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.
A secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation...
The Hive houses over 500 technicians, scientists and support staff.
They live and work underground.
Their research is of the highest importance.
Its nature is classif韊d.
Our position on the map is indicated by heat signature.
Why can't I remember anything?
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms, all computer-controlled.
A nerve gas was released into the house.
Primary effect of the gas:
Complete unconsciousness lasting up to four hours.
Secondary effects can include acute memory loss.
- For how long?
- Subjective. An hour, day, week.
So, this place was attacked?
I'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that.
Sir, we've breached the Hive.
J.D.
Got it.
Halon has dissipated.
Easier to work underground, thinking there's a view.
Looks like we're taking the stairs.
Status.
Red Queen's locked on to us.
She knows we're here.
Who's the Red Queen?
State-of-the-art artificial intelligence.
The computer that controls the Hive.
This will slow us down.
Our route to the Queen takes us straight through these labs.
Rain, J.D., see how bad the flooding is.
Kaplan, find an alternate route.
What happened here?
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.
Sealed the Hive and killed everyone here.
Jesus.
When we realized what happened, we were dispatched to shut her down.
- Why did she do it?
- We don't know.
But outside interference is a possibility.
Jesus!
You okay?
Here.
- No, I'm fine.
- It's cold in here.
Are you...?
Do you remember anything from... before this?
No, nothing before the train.
And you?
Nothing.
I found an alternate route but it will cost us time.
If we double back, cut through
Dining Hall B, we're right on track.
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.
All right, we're behind schedule.
So let's move it.
Come on.
Poor bastards.
Kaplan?
Dining Hall B.
That's what's on the map.
Maybe you're reading it wrong.
May be the Corporation keeps secrets here, something you're not supposed to see.
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit.
Halon levels are nonexistent.
I think the system malfunctioned.
There may be survivors. Give me a search line but keep it tight.
Move it.
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.
I'm not sure I want to remember what went on down here.
I don't blame you.
- What the hell do they keep in these?
- How do I know?
What's taking so long?
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.
Let's pack it up.
You. Stay here.
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.
Running a bypass.
Checkmate.
Move up.
What is that?
That will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.
Forces the mainframe to re boot.
Kaplan!
A dormant defense mechanism.
We must've tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.
- Working on it.
- Open that door.
- I'm trying.
Hold your positions.
Stay calm.
What's that?
- Get them out!
- Something's happening in there.
- Come on.
- Help them!
Down! Get down!
- Something's killing them!
- Don't do this!
Medic! Medic!
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!
Almost there.
It's coming back!
- Open it!
- I'm trying!
Try harder!
It's coming back!
Oh, God!
- Do it!
- Almost there.
Come on!
- Shit.
- Got it.
All right.
Let's do it.
- Do what?
- We have to complete the mission.
No way I'll go down there.
Her defenses are down.
D閖a vu, anyone?
Keep going.
Give me a hand.
Get out!
You can't be in here.
Don't listen. She's a holographic representation of the Red Queen.
Get out!
Modeled after the programmer's daughter.
She'll deceive us, confuse us.
I wouldn't advise this.
Disabling me will result in loss of primary power.
She'll say anything to stop us from shutting her down.
I implore you.
- Implore away.
- Please?
Please?
You're all going to die down here.
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.
After that, if I don't have her boards, he can re boot.
They're late.
I'm on it.
J.D., we got a survivor!
We're here to help.
You seem to be in some sort of...
Get off!
Get off of me!
Get her off me before I stab her ass.
You okay?
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk right out of me.
Stay back.
I'm warning you, stay down!
She's crazy.
Come any closer and I'll fire.
I mean it!
Damn you!
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?
Bitch isn't standing now.
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.
She's gone.
She's gone!
Bullshit!
She fell right here but she's gone!
Look at this.
There's blood, but it's not much.
Looks coagulated.
Yeah.
It's not possi ble.
Why not?
Blood doesn't do that till after you're dead.
Can we go now?
Not till the rest of the team get here.
There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Wait.
Quiet.
- Fuck!
- Don't come any closer!
They're behind us!
Jesus!
They're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.
I said stay back!
Why aren't they dying?
Watch the tank!
The tank!
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- Wait!
- Come on! Move!
Come on!
Move.
I can help you get the virus.
I have security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
Shit.
- We lost the others.
- Keep moving.
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.
Come on.
- Shit!
- Come on!
- Hurry up.
- Shit!
- Come on.
- Shit!
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!
Come on.
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry, I'm running out of ammo!
0-43-2... No, fuck!
- What?!
- What is the code?
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?
Shit!
Grab my hand, man!
Don't let go!
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go? Fuck!
Whatever they are, there's too many.
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.
La b coats, badges...
Those people used to work here.
All the people working here are dead.
That isn't stopping them from walking around.
Where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?
When you cut the power, you unlocked the doors. You let them out.
We're never gonna make it to the surface.
You are security operatives... placed there to protect that entrance.
Lisa.
I've got one in the breech.
And an extra mag.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
But?
- But there will be a price.
- Name it
- Who was she?
- My sister.
Corporations like Umbrella... think they're above the law.
But they're not.
There are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same all over the world.
Some of us provide information.
Others give their support.
Some take more direct action.
Like you.
If your friends had been more thorough, they would've seen through my false I.D.
Then all the red flags would've gone off.
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP, all the rest.
There's no way I could've infiltrated the Hive.
So you sent your sister.
We needed something concrete, anything to expose Um brella to the press.
Proof of the research going on down here.
What kind of research?
The illegal kind.
Genetic.
Viral.
My sister was going to smuggle out a sample of the virus they were developing.
How was she going to make it out?
She had a contact within the Hive, someone I never met.
They had access to security codes, surveillance, everything she needed.
So why didn't she make it?
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.
Maybe they set her up.
Kept the virus for themselves.
Do you have any idea what the T-virus would be worth on the open market?
Worth all this?
Yeah.
To someone.
- Don't shoot!
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!
- Close that door!
Get off!
Son of a bitch!
You okay?
Yeah.
Right behind us.
What about this door?
They're waiting there too.
And that way?
Dead end. There's no way out of the Queen's chamber.
So we wait.
Someone doesn't hear from you... they'll send backup or something.
Right?
What? What's wrong?
- We don't have much time.
- Those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion, they seal shut in under an hour.
If we're not out by then, we're not getting out.
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.
Containing the incident is the only fail-safe plan they had... against possible contamination.
And you're telling us this now, when we're trapped... half a mile underground?
We have to find a way out of this room.
What are you doing?
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.
- That's not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.
That homicidal bitch killed my team.
That homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here.
Considering the way she's been treated,
I'm sure she's real happy to help us out.
That circuit breaker you were talking about. Can you bypass it?
- Yeah?
- So do it.
Circuit breaker's disabled.
This time, if I hit the switch, she won't shut down. She'll fry.
The charge must've damaged her boards.
There you are.
Things, I gather, have gone out of control.
Give me that switch right now.
I'll fry your ass!
I did warn you, didn't I?
- Tell us what's going on down here.
- Research and development.
What a bout the T-virus?
The T-virus was a major medical breakthrough.
Although it clearly also possessed... highly profitable military applications.
How does it explain those things out there?
Even in death, the human body remains active.
Hair and fingernails continue to grow.
New cells are produced.
And the brain holds a small electrical charge that takes months to dissipate.
The T-virus provides a massive jolt, both to cellular growth... and to those trace electrical impulses.
Put quite simply, it reanimates the body.
It brings the dead back to life?
Not fully. The subjects have the simplest of motor functions.
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.
They are driven by the basest of impulses, the most basic of needs.
- Which is?
- The need to feed.
How do you kill them?
Severing the top of the spinal column... or massive trauma to the brain are the most effective methods.
You mean shoot them in the head.
Why did you kill everybody down here?
The T-virus escaped into the air conditioning system.
And an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.
The virus is protean, changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission... depending on its environment
It's almost impossible to kill.
I couldn't allow it to escape from the Hive.
So, I took steps.
- Steps?
- You must understand... those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.
- We're not infected.
- Just one bite... one scratch from these creatures is sufficient... and then you become one of them.
A check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker... has been disabled.
May I ask why?
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.
If you refuse to help, we flip the switch.
Understand?
After you.
What the hell is this place?
The utility tunnels.
They run underneath the Hive for water, gas and power lines.
- Been in here before.
- Keep moving!
- Going round in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave.
- I don't know why you listen to her.
- Enough!
We have no choice but to keep moving because those things are behind us, got it?
That mesh won't hold.
Keep moving.
Jesus Christ!
- Hold it!
- There's too many of them!
Fuck!
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!
Quickly, everyone, up on the pipes!
- Let's go!
- Come on, there's a way up!
Keep them back!
Go on up, move it!
Look out!
Get over here.
There's too many of them!
Go, go, go!
Go on!
I can manage!
Go!
JD?
What?
We have to do something a bout your wounds.
I'm fine.
I said I'm fine.
You like that, don't you?
You like the way it tastes, don't you?
Like the taste of that?
She was right.
- We're all going to die down here.
- No.
We're getting out.
All of us.
You okay?
God!
Get away!
- Hold on!
- Come on!
Help him.
- I can't.
- What are you waiting for?
I can't focus.
I can't see!
- Go up!
- Clim b up there!
You gotta keep going!
- Come on!
- Go!
- You can do it! Move!
- You got it!
- Stay there.
- We'll get you.
We need to cut this wire and throw it to him. Then we'll get him.
Hold on.
That's lucky.
I want you to go.
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.
You can't kill all of them.
I'm not going anywhere.
I want you to go, now!
Please, just do it.
Just do it now!
Please!
Go!
You'll have to work for your meal!
Come on.
Give me your arm, okay?
Over my shoulder.
Ready?
Here we go.
When I get out of here...
I think I'll get laid.
You might want to clean up first.
Wait.
Are you okay?
Blue for the virus, green forthe antivirus.
Blue for the virus, green forthe antivirus.
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking a bout?
There's a cure.
The process can be reversed.
There's a cure!
You'll be okay.
I was beginning to worry.
This is where they kept the T-virus.
How do you know all this?
Because I was going to steal it.
I was your sister's contact.
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.
- You caused all this.
- I can't remem ber.
- The truth.
- I don't remember the truth.
I don't understand.
It's gone.
It's gone. It's not there.
I can't.
I just can't. It's over.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes... surveillance plans, the works.
But there's a price.
Name it
You have to guarantee me that you'll bring this corporation down.
Today all your dreams come true...
Spence?
Spence?
Thank you!
Spence?
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.
We can have everything we've ever wanted.
Money's out there waiting.
You wouldn't believe how much.
Is that how you thought all my dreams would come true?
Please.
I wouldn't want to shoot you.
Might need the bullets.
Back off!
I won't take any part in this.
Okay, but you can't just wash your hands of this.
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.
I was trying to stop them.
You really believe that... people like him will ever change anything?
Nothing ever... changes.
Where...
Where is... the antivirus?
It's on the train... where you found me.
Couldn't have been standing more than three feet from it.
I so nearly made it out.
I didn't realize that bitch of a computer... had defense systems outside the Hive.
In or out?
In?
Or out?
I don't know what we had.
But it's over.
Back... the fuck off!
I'm missing you already.
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.
He shot the locking mechanism out.
I can't believe that son of a bitch is going to get away with this.
I don't think so.
I've been a bad, bad girl.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?
One of the Hive's early experiments.
Produced by injecting the virus directly into living tissue.
The results were unstable.
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA... it will mutate... becoming a stronger, faster hunter.
Great.
If you knew it was loose, why didn't you warn us?
Because she was saving it.
For us.
Isn't that right?
I didn't think any of you would make it this far.
Not without infection.
Why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
This long after infection, there's no guarantee it would work.
But there's a chance.
Right?
I don't deal in chance.
Fuck it.
No pressure, guys.
You require the four-digit access code.
I can give you the code. But f韗st, you must do something for me.
What do you want?
One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.
The antivirus is right there on the platform!
I'm sorry, but it's a risk I cannot take.
She's right. It's the only way.
You'll have to kill me.
Otherwise, we all die down here.
The glass is reinforced, but it won't hold forever.
Do it.
- Get up.
- Just do it.
- Please.
- Do it!
You don't have long to decide.
- You have no choice.
- Kill her now!
- Get off!
- You don't have any choice.
- Just do it now!
- I can't!
- Kill her now. Do it.
- Please.
- Kill her. Kill her now!
- Just do it.
Kill her!
Kap?
The bitch wouldn't open the door, so I had to fry her.
Move!
What the fuck was that?
It's a long story.
Start it up.
I'll get the virus.
I'm missing you already.
We're in business.
Full power!
We're leaving!
I don't want to be one of those things... walking around without a soul.
You won't.
When the time comes... you'll take care of it.
No one else is going to die.
Here.
Rain.
Rain.
Rain.
I'm not dead yet.
I think I'll have that back.
I could kiss you, you bitch.
What the hell's going on back there?
- Get us the fuck out of here.
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails.
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Now!
I failed all of them.
I failed.
Listen to me. There is nothing else you could've done.
The Corporation's guilty here, not you.
And we finally have the proof.
And that way,
Umbrella can't get... away with this.
I mean, we can...
What is it?
You're infected, but you'll be okay.
I'm not losing you.
- Help!
- Help him! What are you doing?
He's mutating.
I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Get off!
What's happening?
I want her quarantined.
Close observation... and a full series of blood tests.
Let's see if she's infected.
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility.
Then assemble the team.
We're reopening the Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
Just do it
Who's in there?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
You are a Calamity of Disgrace!
You got no professional attachment... and you can't give your big nose out of other people's business!
As an Intergalactic Observer, you stink.
Did anybody else see those big letters flying by?
You're hopeless, Kazoo!
Actually it's Ga- zoo.
Ga.. Let's all say it together.
Silence!
We are sending you to a planet with virtually no civilization for you to mock up.
Please, no! Anything but...
Earth!
You are to document the Earthlings bizarre mating ritual of love and marriage
Why can't they reproduce like we do?
It's a boy!
Oh! And So green and slimey.
Quit sucking up!
Wait.
Surely there must be others more qualified than I.
Of Course. But why risk loosing one of them?
Just do not land!
They haven't even invented pants yet!
Have you seen my legs?
Imagine the moron, who was going to stuck with kazoo!
ACADEMY RONTOD CRANE
This is an exciting time for us, isn't it? Barney.
Sure, Fred. No job, no money, no women.
Things are really looking up.
Don't worry Barn. Everything's gonna change once we pass our finals tomorrow.
Um Fred...And I know just how to ace this test. see all these other mugs are gonna stay up all night study.
Don't interrupt! And when they finally do get to sleep, all the information just gonna fall right out of the heads.
And me, i'm way ahead of everybody.
I'm not gonna study tonight.
I'm gonna get a good night's rest, get up extra early... and study in the morning.
That way everything will still be, right upfront in my noggin by the time when i get to work to take the test.
That's great Brother, just one thing.

Where's Wilma?
That girl is a death to me.
Wilma Slaghoople!
Staring at the top at BedRock again!
There is nothing down there, had a bunch of flat-footed flat-headed Neanderthals, clubbing each other and grunting.
Hey, you know i heard they are still afraid of the fire.
I think they are exactly like you and me.
This is all my fault.
I should've never let you played with the suburbs Children.
Darling, Please.
Come downstairs and atleast pretend to be having a good time, like everyone else.
Come.
Look, Oven mitts!
Is that all the presents?
What do we do now?
Ladies,
I have an idea.
What do you say we go for a drive?
To the club?
Actually i was thinking about going someplace a little different for a change...someplace new.
Like going into BedRock... and going bowling.
Isn't she the best?
Oh, Yes she is.
My Wilma
Beautiful and witty. A prize for any man.
Hello Chip. What are you doing here?
I just came by to discuss some business with Colonel Slaghoople.
There is a certain girl, i'm thinking of investing here.
Hello, Ladies.
Well, I guess the next Bridal Shower will be Wilma's.
Ah no, ladies don't start chiseling those invitations just yet.
Wilma, you have done a real amen.
If i got i had a shot at Chip i'll club my
Eugene and leave him for the raptors.
Wilma, get real.
Chip Rockefeller was first in his class at Princestone!
Yes, i know. He owns half of Rock Vegas.
Colonel.
Wilma, You and Chip are perfect for each other.
Think of kinds like he can buy you. we get to spend everyday together shopping...
- playing tennis...
- getting facials... brow breathing our husbands!
We will be just like our mothers.
Where you've been? I've been looking all over for you.
I didn't feel like much celebrating.
Are you kidding? we get to spend the rest of our lives working in a rock quarry!
Who says dreams don't come true?
I know I should be happy, but...
I guess I was always figured by this point in my life.. that i have somebody special to share my successes.
Well you always got me, Fred.
Thanks, Barn. but that's not what i'm really talking about.
Yeah,
I know.
- what are you talking about?
- A girl, Barn!
Oh Yeah right. What should i thought.
But i wouldn't worry about it Fred. I mean, You'll meet somebody.
Its like they always say, "It'll happen when you least expect it."
Now see that's the way you're wrong, Barn.
I believe you create your own oppurtunites in life.
You gotta go out there and make things happen.
I mean it's not like something's just gonna drop out of the sky, land in front of you, and change your whole life.
What was that?
Help! Is there anybody out there?
Klaatu barada nikto!
Fred, I think there is somebody in there.
Come on Barn, let's try it to open it up.
I'm right behind you, pal.
I don't know, Barn. I think that thing's empty.
Would you mind not holding head by the antenna?
It's not an ordinary pleasant and say...
- Get me out of here, Come on pal.
- Get me out! Get over!
- What are you?
- I am the Great Gazoo.
The Great Kazoo?
Ga- zoo.
I come from a planet too far for you to fathom and a civilization too advanced, for you to comprehend.
Wait a minute, Fred.
I hope we get wishes!
Pardon?
Ya we let you out of the fancy bottle, and now we get wishes right!
Yeah, Barney's right. Let's get this started.
What do we have to rapt?
Naa an Nokia, I'm not some sort of friendly cartoon Genie.
And that is not a bottle, it is a spacecraft.
I'm of a highly evolved alien species.
I don't do funny voices,
I don't sing catchy songs... and i do not posess a magic carpet for your big bloated behinds to float upon!
I'm here to observe your species mating rituals. Ok Dum-Dums?
Dum-Dums?
Hey, was that an insult?
Well if the shoe fits...
What's a shoe?
Yes, it was an insult.
That's what i thought.
Ya here do observe.
Well get ready to observe your teeth leaving your head.
There he is, Fred.
Violent natives!
That could've downfront tourism.
Perhaps you can satisfy my intelluctual curiosity?
Fine, and you?
Oh Dear.
I'm Betty, i'll be your waitress.
The fish is fresh, but be careful so where the busboys.
So what do you having?
What i'm having?
How much is a glass of water?
Water? Free.
Great, I'll have two.
You want a burger to go with your water?
Oh, no. Water's fine. I like water.
Because if you're short on cash or something,
I could spot you again, you know.
Then You could just go home get your wallet and pay me back.
No, that's impossible. I can't.
I just i can't go home...
Oh my! Are you caveless?
But you're so clean!
No, you see...
You poor poor thing.
Oh great, I've just called you "poor"!
I'm so thoughtless sometimes.
- You are not poor. You are not.
- No, I'm not.
You are just down on your luck, right?
Well don't you worry.
You stay with me till you're back on your feet.
And i'm gonna buy you lunch.
No! Absolutely not! Listen, that's very sweet of you, but...
Please, I used to volunteer down at the caveless shelter, you know.
And I know,
I know, you're not looking for a handout.
You are just looking for your self respect.
I'm Betty. Betty O'Shale.
Just call me Wilma.
Ok, Wilma.
Let's go get you something to eat.
And then we'll set you up at my apartment.
You live in an apartment?
That must be so great! Always wondered, what'd be like to live in an apartment.
The life can be so cruel sometimes.
UPPER CRUST - Housing Trailer
Good night, Fred.
Goodnight, Barn.
Goodnight, Dum-Dums!
Hey, its that Kazoo.
Ga- zoo. Why is that so difficult?
What are you doing here?
I am here to observe your species mating rituals. so...
Get to it!
Oh, Barney and me don't...
Get off of me.
Listen pal, you've gotta lot to learn about the way things work here.
So who or what do you make with?
The girls!
And where are these "girls"?
I've been asking myself the same thing.
I got it!
Are you hurt, Wilma?
Who is Wilma?
Atlast some hormonal activity.
Okay, boys time to get busy.
I don't get paid by the hour, you know.
Keep quiet, Gazoo.
You wanna see us meet some girls, you gonna have to hang back. We don't want you cramping our style.
Style!
Numero uno : If you knew the first thing about style you know that the animal prints are passe.
And secondly, Dum-Dum...
Not another thing. Enough with the "Dum-Dum".
My name is Fred Flintstone.
F -L- I- N...
- T.
-Stone.
I do not care who you are.
That doesn't give you any reason to shout.
I am not talking to you, I'm talking to him.
Who? Him?
No, Him. The little green guy.
Don't you see him?
Wait a minute! He thought I was...
Wait a minute!
Are you telling me, we are the only people who can see you?
You got one right, care to take the 
"prehistoric imbeciles" for 200?
So the whole day Barn and me talking to you and everybody thought we were a couple of...
Dum-Dums?
I'm telling you, I got a good feeling.
Today could be my day.
Who knows? I could turn around right now and meet the girl of my dreams?
What will it would be boys?
Pay attention, Barn.
You'll never want the companionship again.
Sorry, no substitutions.
No, I, we...
You wanna date?
Well you cannot, the man who said less.
Why not?
You can take me to the carnival tomorrow.
Your little friend wanna date too?
Help!
I got the perfect girl.
I'll be right back.
Barney, tonight we shower.
I may not know much about your courting rituals, but i'll just give out to limb here,and say this can't be going very well.
See the 40 year old man! 
One of nature's miracles.
Step right up! Step right up! Only this way.
This is amazing! I can't believe it!
It's so noisy.
Yeah, I noticed.
That looks like bowling!
Barney, can we play?
Oh yeah Sure, but, you know Fred and I we go bowling all the time.
Aah. That's a dumb idea.
Who's gonna pay to see dinosaurs?
I got dinosaurs in my backyard!
Wow! You got a really great laugh.
Yeaa.
So do you.
Hey, do you like brontocoasters?
I'm wishing to it.
You're on.
This is gonna be fun, huh?
So, what do you wannna do first?
What was your name again?
Come on, pretty boy!
Rock-Candy
Look.
Ring-Toss
What you got, drama girl! you're gonna hit the back side of a brontosaurus!
That was a good shot.
Wasn't it?
Well that's a pretty tough spare... for most people.
We got a winner.
These things never live longer than a week.
Hey Fred do you think you could teach me hot to throw like that?
Sure. Let's see what you got.
I'm done.
Let me help you here.
Give me your hand.
Middle fingers.
Take the weight.
Now relax.
It's all in the toes.
I did it!
Look I know I ran off with Betty, but, you know, Wilma's kind of my date.
So I was wondering, whether it wouldn't be too much trouble if... well if...
What are you trying to say, Barn?
Would you mind, if i left with Betty?
No, not at all buddy. Hey, Take the car.
Thanks, pal. Thanks a bunch. She says she wants to go our place and cook me breakfast.
I do not know what we gonna do until then, but you know i can't turn down on a good meal.
It's kinda chilly all of a sudden, isn't it?
Chilly? Are you kidding?
The Earth's still colding around here.
It's chilly, we should've brought something to trade above my shoulders, you know.
Thank you.
Nice opening gambit lover boy. Now, close the deal, so i can get off this Warren lock.
I am ignoring you right now.
What did you say?
I said, 
I am adoring you right now.
Oh Fred. That's so sweet.
Come on, come on!
You're in the red zone.
"Isn't it so romantic?"
"Now, hurry up and kiss her..."
Your eyes are like two big eyes.
What a Cutie.
She thinks you're her mother.
Quiet down!
I lead a simple life.
Where I have a roof over my head, food on the table... and a top-shelf to shave shell.
I am a happy guy.
Fred you are so different than the kinda guys, I grew up with.
- And they what wanna like?
- Just real different.
This is it.
Oh I had a great time tonight.
I sure hope you did too.
I wouldn't change a thing.
Good night.
Good night.
FUTURE SITE OF BED ROCK GARDENS - RESERVE TODAY
The Flintstones
Good morning, Fred. What a beautiful day!
I was just thinking the same thing, Barney boy. BEAUTIFUL!
So I think You and Wilma had a nice evening?
Are you kidding?
Barn, I never met anyone like her.
This Wilma I think she may be the one.
I feel the same way about Betty.
I mean she's smart.
She's hot.
- Kind.
- Funny.
Classy.
She's hot.
Beautiful!
You know, Wilma, you really should wear your hair up.
Uh, I got need more height!
Look.
It really brings out your smile.
Well I guess I just have a whole lot more to smile about these days.
And I owe it all to you, Betty.
You're the First real friend I ever had.
You had a tough life. 
You deserve a few breaks, Wilma.
Actually Betty it hasn't been all that tough.
You see, there is something that 
I've been meaning to tell you but i'm real scared, but I think now is the time...
Ooh Pizza's here.
Good evening. I'm looking for...
Mother?
Wilma? Is that you?
What is this place?
This is an apartment. It's how a lot of people live.
Well, that doesn't make it right.
And who are you? A Cleaning Women?
Well obviously you're doing a terrible job. You're fired.
Go on! Shoo!
Mother! This is my new best friend, Betty.
She's been very good to me.
And I've been the regular germ cruel fish.
Wilma, I am going to take my bath now.
Good Luck.
Mother.
How did you find me?
I did what any concerned parent would do. 
Hire a detective.
You what?
We will discuss everything on the way home.
I'm home, Mom.
I am happier than i have ever been in my life.
And you can throw me in a sack and drag me home, but I'll just run away again.
Fine, Wilma, Fine.
Now you have broken my heart.
But I wil not allow you to do the same thing to your deared faithful father.
Darling, he misses you so much.
And if you are not home on Sunday to celebrate his birthday,
Well, I just do not know how many more birthdays he's going to be run... to celebrate.
I wonder why Wilma gave us these suits to wear for the party.
May be it's a costume party, Fred.
STAY!
Dino,
Stay.
C'mon Barn lets pick up the girls.
So Barn, What do you think?
Oh Fred, you shouldn't have.
It's not for you, nitwit.
It's for Wilma!
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Oh Dum-Dum, there appears to be a tiny flake of something... stucked your ring. Look, just there.
That's the stone, Gazoo.
Oops.
It's all i could afford.
Sorry.
Well I am sure she will be very impressed by your...
Frugality.
See that's the great thing about Wilma.
I don't feel to need to impress her.
She's just a simple girl with simple tastes.
You know there are couple things about me,
I haven't gone around and telling you guys yet.
Well, welcome to the Slaghoople manner.
Your house has a name?
Fred, Look.
A Cadarock Limo!
Betty I'm sorry.
I was just so ashamed.
You should have realized a caveless girl couldn't afford a priceless maserocki.
Wilma's home! Everybody!
She is loaded.
I'm afraid you looks like you're really lucked out.
No Barn. This is terrible.
I can't give her this measly ring. Look at her house!
A girl like this is used to the best of everything.
She's gonna take one look at this ring and laugh at me.
You know Barn, its a good thing i didn't get the chance to give it to her sooner.
Hey, what are you doing?
This punk's trying to steal my car!
No, sir. I'm the valet.
The valet? I don't care if you are valet, well you are not going in my car!
Barney! Leave him!
Fred, he's the valet. He parks the car.
I know that.
Come on, Fred.
The valet parking.
First cooked food, and now this.
What will they think of next?
Wilma darling, we're over here!
Wilma darling,you look nice.
Thank you, Mother. Hello.
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Any news in the front?
Morale is excellent, Sir.
Mother, Father, I'd like to you meet my new boyfriend, Fred.
Cavalry! Mount up!
We are moving out!
Search!
A Pleasure.
Charmed.
Wilma darling, there is somebody here, will simply dying to see you again.
Chip, Over here!
Mother, Chip is here?
Oh yes Chip's here. He's practically family.
Who is Chip?
We used to date, used to Mother.
You are lovlier than ever.
I love your hair up like that.
I see you brought a...
Date.
Wilma, Look. The Rathbonesowie's arrived.
You've got to come to see Tiffany's new nose.
It's between our eyes now.
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Chip Rockefeller of the Mesozoic Rockefellers .
I'm Fred Flintstone, of the Fredozoic Flintstones.
So What line of work you in, Flintstone?
It just so happens,
I'll be hanging my half down at the quarry.
Oh you bought Slaten Company!
No, I'm a brontocrane operator.
Seriously, what are you doing?
I work down at the quarry.
I'm a brontocrane operator.
You are serious! How embarrassing for you.
Fellas, Wilma's date works... at the quarry!
He is a brontocrane operator!
Hi Betty.
Did I tell you that's a really pretty dress?
Thank you.
Betty, you are not still mad at me, are you?
Mad?
Just because you pretended to be poor?
And I took you in and I felt sorry for you?
Why would that make me mad?
Having fun, Princess?
Not really.
That's my girl!
I have something for your birthday.
Dad it's your birthday.
It is?
Well this won't fit me.
They are beautiful.
I know you don't like showy things, but these are your great great grandmother's.
In fact, they came right out of the shell.
Whatever you decide to do, remember one thing.
That Daddy will always love you.
Thank you, Daddy.
Sure are beautiful pearls.
Thank you, Fred.
They look really expensive.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I would like to propose a toast.
To the Colonel on his birthday.
Although he is a man of great wealth and power. 
He has the most precious gifts a man could ever want. A loving wife... and the most beautiful daughter in the world has never seen.
To the Colonel!
You know, I also would like to propose a toast.
Must you?
To Mr. Slaghoople...
Colonel Slaghoople!
Yes?
Mrs. Slaghoople, and most of all, Wilma.
Thanks for the invite.
I never been inside a place, this big but i'm paying the admission.
At first I felt a little uncomfortable , so much the same way as you would, if you stumble in my one of large meetings.
The Loyal order of the Water Buffalos.
No, Dino. Back!
You!
This is all your fault!
You ruined my entire party, you idiot!
You Bafoon! You Communal!
Get out. Get out of my house, now!
Watch it, buddy.
Stop it!
How can you treat people this way?
Is it because, they are not like you?
You know what?
That is why, I like them.
Because they are not like you.
They like me for who I am, and not WHO I am.
I mean...
You know what I mean.
How dare you to talk to me like that, Wilma?
No one has ever talked to me like that before!
Well, Mother, may be it's a bad time, somebody did.
Let's go, Fred.
We were right behind you, Wilma.
Thanks, Betty.
Wait. Please don't go.
You were right back there.
The way everyone's behaved today is been inexcusable.
Thank you, Chip.
Congratulations, Flintstone. I really mean that, a better man one.
And just to show that there are no hard feelings
I'd like to invite the four of you to the opening of my new casino in Rock Vegas.
You Love birds can taken to the sites, and relax in the luxury accomodations... and enjoy the opening night concert gallery by
Mick Jagger and the Stones.
Stones?
This is it Love,
This is Destiny.
What do you say, Wilma?
I, we... we really appreciate your gesture, but i don't think now is such a good time...
Rock Vegas?
We'd love to go.
WELCOME TO FABULOUS ROCK VEGAS
JACKPOT
Way to go, Barney!
Great day, huh?
I hope it never ends.
Oh, Young love.
It's a shame it won't last.
Just you wait, Roxie dear.
This man is my puppet and i barely began to pull the strings.
Soon Wilma will see him for the pathetic primitive he really is.
I thought you went over this with Wilma person.
What do I have to do to convince you?
Diamonds? A mazerocky?
Your own show in stalactite Lunch?
Very nice, Chip, but i prefer cash.
What a coincidence! So do we!
Rocko and Rocko, my favorite maid men.
What can I do for you, Gentlemen?
The Boss wants his money.
He says he don't think you got it.
That's not entirely true. nor is it entirely false. he don't entirely care. but he wants all of his money by midnight sunday, or we start taking your casinos.
And breaking your legs!
This is a mood discussion, Gentlemen. Because by sunday evening I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople... and one of the greatest personal fortunes in the uncivilized world.
You better be.
Or else you will be sleeping with the 
Tunasarauses.
The plot's thicken.
This is heaven.
Could you get me between my shoulder blades? That's cures all my tension.
She is tense.
I just found out what calamari means.
Wilma, can I ask you something?
Sure, Betty. What's that?
Do you think, Barney is serious about me?
What are you talking about? He's crazy about you.
I hope so.
I've never met anyone like Bernard Rubble.
He is so loyal and so sweet.
He makes me feel like I'm the only girl in this whole flat world.
That's exactly how Fred makes me feel.
Chip... it was always about money.
Fred does not have a greedy bone in his entire body.
Look at all these clams, Barn!
Yea.. you got there enough to buy wilma a ring for each finger, Fred.
May be a little stud for me too.
So what do you say, we go cash up.
What are you, crazy? That's your problem, Barn.
You think too small.
I'm not gonna just stop at a ring.
I'm gonna buy her a whole lifestyle, just like Chip Rockefeller.
But she doesn't want some smart rich, handsome guy. She wants you!
Buzz off, Caveboy!
The man's got magic hands.
I know this will be difficult for you, but, let's think for a moment.
Chip Rockefeller flew you to his casino in his plane to play at his tables.
And against the odds of 247000 to 1...
You have rode 17 straight winners.
Can we connect the dots?
Sure! Today is my lucky day!
Good Luck, Dum-Dum.
You will need it.
Come on, babies.
Forty seven!
What did I tell you, Barn? Magic!
It's not magic, it's skill.
A gentlemen gambler like you should be playing with the high rollers.
HIGH ROLLERS ONLY
I was just getting warmed up,
You know, building my bank roll.
- Bank roll? Please I'll give you a line of credit.
- Credit?
Sure! The house funds you a little extra you pay it back, a man of your skill, Please,
I will be honored to have you on a house account.
Don't do it. That's how my uncle - the gambler lost everything.
He lost his wife, he lost his house, his kids, his dog...
Guess you know, we have an 
"all you can eat" buffet by the pool?
Fred, please!
"All you can eat"?
Absolutely! I'd like you to meet Roxie, she's my lead actor.
Roxie, Would you show 
Mr. Rubble the buffet?
It would be my great pleasure.
Come on, Flintstone. I'll show you to the table and have the pitball brings you a nice big pile of clams.
New Shooter!
Freedom and wit, boys.
Four lovely ladies.
Make that six. Where you two been?
We've been Waiting for you, Fred, at the Cadre Club.
Alright, I'm Sorry, Wilma. I've been on a roll.
Where's Barney?
He went off to the buffet with some show-girl.
A show-girl?
When they say "All you can eat" they don't mean "till you explode".
I'm just getting started.
Look at the size of that pie.
Waiter! Over Here!
Let me help.
ROCK VEGAS TOURS
I love you, but I gotta go.
Catch you later!
Hello, Love.
Are you...
Yes, Mick Jagger, at your service.
And you are...?
Betty O'Shale.
What a lovely bird doing alone by the pool?
My boyfriend...
He was...
I saw him with another girl!
Oh, Sweetheart.
I'll tell you what.
If you was my lady you wouldn't catch me even touching another girl. Not never!
Unless I'm on the road. 
On the road doesn't count.
Stop it.
Why don't you try... stopping crying and give Mickey, a little smile, eh?
That's better.
You look lovely when you smile,
Miss Betty O'Shale.
Thank you.
What do you say we go meet my band mates?
And then we can go so more quiet, so we can... talk a little bit more, eh?
Three thousand and forty-one...
What's going on there?
Hey, Fred, Look! 
There's Mick Jagger and the Stones!
And there is Betty, she is with the band.
What would be Betty doing with the Stones?
Yeah.. She doesn't even play instruments.
Betty, Up here! It's me, Barney!
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Betty! Please!
Fourteen thousand five hundred and forty- two.
Fifteen thousand five hundred and forty- two.
Fred, let's do something together.
We could go bowling.
Bowling?
Bowling's for the poor people.
Looks like You and Chip have a little more in common than i thought.
Why? Because we both big winners?
Here, Fred. Buy yourself a clue.
Wilma, wait.
Honey! Baby! What's the matter?
JACKPOT - A MILLION CLAMS
All right, Flintstone. You lost Wilma.
Now it's time to lose everything else.
WIN
LOSE
Place your bets, folks! Place your bets.
One red!
One red is the winner.
Hello Wilma. Been for a walk?
Nothing gets by you, Chip.
Forgive me, for disturbing you.
I'm so sorry.
I just got a lot of in my mind.
I have been on that edge too.
Opening weekend, so many guests, and now all the room robberies.
Robbery?
No, Nothing, it's just...
But, just to be safe I wish you would let me, put those beautiful pearls of yours in our safe.
Good idea, Chip.
They mean a lot to me.
I know.
It's up to you, baby.
Get me started again.
Mr. Flintstone?
Mr. Rockefeller has extended an invitation to join him at the fight.
ROUND 122
More credit? No.
No chance. No way. No how.
Do you know how much you owe already?
Owe?
One million four hundred thousand clams.
It's gonna be a real shame when Wilma finds out what a loser her new boyfriend really is.
Of course... she doesn't have to find out.
She doesn't?
See that, I knew you were a good guy.
I'm not.
I said I wouldn't tell her.
I didn't say you can still have her.
I'll erase your debt, Flintstone.
But you gotta disappear, out of town, out of bed-rock and never see or speak to Wilma again.
Wait a minute.
You had planned this all along!
Tell me, how do you even dress yourself in the morning?
Normally, I just wear what i fell asleeping.
What does that got to do with anything?
Goodbye, Flintstone.
You won't get away with this, Rockfeller!
I don't care what happens to me, but I'm not gonna let you easily away closer to Wilma.
As soon as I find, I'm gonna tell her exactly what's going on.
Then we will see how well your plan worked!
There has been a robbery.
All guests to the lobby.
Uh-oh, there appears to have been a robbery.
We will have to continue this conversation later Fred. Please step this way.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen! I regeret to inform you that there is a criminal in our midst.
Now what did he say who was?
But before I expose him into the public,
I'd like to give him a chance to step forward that admit his wrong doing only to take his first tiny step towards absolution.
I stole all the towels in my room!
That is illegal, but still...
I'm wearing someone else's underwear!
No, I was talking about a..
I'm systematically poisoning the dinosaurs watersupply!
In a matter of decades, their entire species will be extinct!
Alright! This is obviously going no where.
I was talking about a necklace.
A very valuable necklace has been stolen from our hotel safe.
A necklace belonging to my dear dear friend, Wilma Slaghoople.
My pearls?
Alright, who did it?
So help me. If you don't step forward right now, I'll personally punch you...
I don't think the violence will be necessary 
Flintstone, because I know exactly, who stole Wilma's pearls.
A desperate man drowning and gambling twits.
Low-life!
Hey, doesn't anybody care about this whole dinosaurs becoming extinct thing?
No!
Fred, would you mind emptying your pockets?
Do you think I stole Wilma's pearls? Chip that's...
Why, do you have something to hide Fred?
Definitely not! See for yourself.
Wait a minute. I didn't take these.
Wilma, why would I take your pearls?
Do you deny that you owe the casino over a million clams with no way to pay it back?
Fred, is that true?
Yeah, but...
Wilma, Darling, I'm so sorry.
Wilma, you can't believe him! He set me up!
Security, take this man to jail!
You're coming with us.
Wait, Wait a minute!
You are all making a big mistake.
Fred couldn't have stolen that necklace.
It was locked up in a safe.
Fred can't even remember the combination to his bowling locker.
Look it's got written down on his hands, see.
Great! Now everybody seen it!
Crack a safe? He couldn't even crack his knuckles without my help.
Thank you, Mr. Rubble, for confessing to be Mr.Flintstone's accomplice!
You are welcome.
What?
Take them both away!
I'm innocent!
Everybody, Gamble! 
Where's my little girl?
Oh, my poor poor baby!
Perfect.
Now everything's going to be alright now, Darling. Mommy is here!
And I'm going.
I've already talked to Chip and he is willing to take you back.
What gives you the right to interfere with my life?
I'm your mother and I love you.
And Chip loves you.
Chip loves money.
And you have money! 
It's a match-made in heaven.
Look, I think he's already proven his loyalty.
He saved you from that beast.
Fred is not a beast.
He was just raised by them.
Now that explains the missing piece of the puzzle.
Wilma, Listen to me. Go back to Chip.
Please.
Darling,
Don't let Chip slip through your fingers again.
I just do not know how much more pain that poor boy can deal.
Guys, I'm sure you have your money by midnight!
The Boss says, he's got his doubts.
See, a little birdie told him that you even date Slaghoople damn no more.
Hey, I might be out of job tomorrow.
Brothers got a little mess you see.
That's preposterous.
We are getting married this evening.
Good. But if the bride do not show, you'll be spending your wedding night... with me!
I miss Betty.
I know Barn. I do anything to see Wilma again.
We would be with them right now if I haven't been so stupid!
And now I could have told you that.
Oh boy, you got us sour eyed!
You gotta help us, buddy! You gotta get us out!
"Buddy"? Did I heard that correctly?
I am sorry but are you not the same Fred Flintstone, who hurt my feelings, so that I spent the rest of my vacation in my room watching paperview?
You're right, you're right. I was wrong.
I...
I tried to impress Wilma with money and all i did was ruined everything like I always do.
Cause you know what I am?
I'm nothing but a big...
Yes?
Dum-Dum.
All of first?
The eyes have it!
Oh, now look.
Just because, you finally realized what I knew right away, that doesn't mean...
I haven't developed a little soft spot for you.
Really? So you gonna bust us out of here?
Gazoo's gonna bust us out of here!
Do I look like a cavalry? that does outfits are adorable.
You two know that I can't actually interfere.
I'm only here to give you some information,
I thought you might find inlikely.
Hey, I didn't know you can do that.
This is a mood discussion, Gentlemen. Because by sunday evening I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople... and one of the greatest personal fortunes in the uncivilized world.
Wilma's in trouble!
We gotta get out of here!
C'mon you gotta help us, Gazoo!
I would I could, I really do.
So you are gonna just let it this happen?
I've gotta sit in this cell, when Wilma walks the aisle with the wrong guy.
We were supposed to live happily ever after!
Same with me and Betty.
Please, don't.
Not emotions.
My race is processed with eons that the slightest trace of personal emotions... and we couldn't be happier.
Well of course, we don't actually get happy, because we do not have emotions, but...
Oh, this is so sad.
Somebody hold me!
TEEREX TISSUES
Blow.
Barney, you can fit through the bars!
I can? I guess I should have tried that earlier, huh.
Come on. Get the keys!
Hey, back in your cage, shorty!
Hi, Betty.
Hi, Wilma!
I just came to say good-bye.
I heard you're going to Stonehenge with Mick Jagger.
I can't wait.
Chip's going around saying you are getting back together.
I'm so happy for you.
And I'm so happy for you too, Betty.
I've... never been so happy.
Me neither.
Hey, knock it off. You're big girls now.
Wilma darling, you are doing the right thing.
I married the Colonel face for money and look how happy we are.
So, we meet again.
Spread out and find these guys.
They're looking for us, Barn. 
They got guards everywhere.
What're we gonna do, Fred?
We just gonna have to fight away it. but these guys are armed!
This is a war, Barn.
And in a war there's always gonna be casualities.
I just want you to know how much 
I appreciate your sacrifice.
What do I've got to be the one gets sacrificed?
Because I know I'm gonna get Wilma back.
Face it Barn. There is no way Betty's gonna dump Mick Jagger for you.
Therefore I've got more reason to live.
Come on, girls! Let's go!
The curtain's coming up!
Come on, out! Oh, you look lovely!
Opening night! Ready to smile.
You see, Fred? Worked like a charm.
No chit-chat. Let's go and sparkle!
The one near the end looks like a man.
May be your sister ought to try out.
It's them! Get'em.
Let's get out of here, now!
Come on! Get them!
This isn't love,
This is...
What do you think, Betty?
Should I stick up my butt a bit further?
Does it look good like that?
May be that's too much bad for the opening of the show, you know.
It's really upto you, Mick. You're the artist.
Yeah, there I am Betty, that I am.
Wow, you really are with Mick Jagger.
Have you not the two girls are sameful.
Actually the cuter one used to be my boyfriend.
What?
Betty, I understand, if you wanna be with this famous rock star instead of me. but I just had to come back here and tell you,
I love you.
I don't think I ever told you that before. but now I did so...
Goodbye.
Barney, wait!
Do you really mean it?
Of course, I do. I never felt this way about anyone before.
And what about that show-girl you were within the restaurant?
Roxie? That's Chip Rockefeller's girlfriend.
He sent her to take me to the buffet, so i couldn't stop Fred from gambling.
Chip Rockefeller has a girlfriend?
Well somebody's gotta tell Wilma!
Don't worry, Betty.
I'll handle Rockefeller.
Alright would somebody mind telling me,
What's bloody going on here?
This is not creeky! 
I'm supposed to be on stage.
I'm sorry, Mick.
I had a really great time with you and all, but...
I love Barney.
Well, I don't care.
I'm in love with Betty too. She is the first decent honourable woman I ever met and I'm like... unbelievably turned on by her naivety.
Watch your mouth Mister or 
I'll give you a fat lip.
Although it kinda looks somebody already has.
Alright that's it!
Nobody's pinches my bird!
Not after I am, pinching her from in the first place.
Take this partner!
Come on.
She is mine!
Oh yeah?
I'd rather ridiculously been dead body.
I love you. I always have.
I lost you once, but I won't lose you again.
Marry me.
Tonight.
Chip, you're terrific. but... it's just a lot of things have happened recently and I need a little time to think.
Wilma, I can't live without you.
Just say "yes".
Please.
It's okay.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the fabulous Tardust Hotel... proudly presents the world's only rock and roll band,
Mick Jagger and The Stones.
This isn't Love,
This is destiny
somewhere above
this was planned for me
Life had no meaning
I never knew, why
Till the dream came true
The dream is you.
I never say never
But this love forever
Till over
together
whichever wherever
Till we go
This isn't Love,
This is ecstasy
Somehow I knew
you would come to me
I never say never
Wilma, Honey.
I never meant to hurt you.
I've done some stupid things, like a lot of stupid things. but love makes you do stupid things.
I never forgive myself if
I didn't give this one last try.
Wilma Slaghoople,
I can't give you diamonds, fast cars or fancy houses.
I can.
All I can give you is just plain old
Fred Flintstone from bed-rock.... and all the love in my heart. and I hope that's enough.
It's enough. It's enough.
No, it's not!
Wilma,...
Will you...
Will you...
Spit it out!
Wilma, will you marry me?
This is your last chance! 
Stop me or all the dinosaurs die.
Shut up!
Wilma, I am still waiting.
Yes!
And do you, Fred Flintstone...
take Wilma Slaghoople to be your wife
to have into your home from this day forward
Do you, Wilma take 
Frederick to be your husband
to have into your home from this day forward
I do.
Then by the power vested in me by the City of Rock Vegas...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Mrs. Slaghoople.
Where am I? What is this place?
Gazoo, are you crying?
No, No, of course not, Dum-Dum.
No, I've simply overcomed with information.
You see, I've finally understand... your complex mating rituals.
All the emotions.
All this...
Love.
And I've come to the conclusion.
I will never meet anybody.
You're very sweet, but believe me, it would never work out.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I now present to you Mr. and Mrs....
Flintstones! Meet The Flintstones
They are the modern stone age family
From the town of bed-rock
They're page right out of history
And with Rubbles by the side
We'll have all alone and happy life
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba dabba doo time
A dabba doo time. We'll have a gay old time.
Viva Rock Vegas
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime
Turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once 
You'll never be the same again
We'll have a gay old time.
We'll have a gay old...
Time
What is it that makes a man a man?
Is it his origins, the way things start?
Or is it something else, something harder to describe?
For me, it all began in 1944.
Classified mission off the coast of Scotland.
The Nazis were desperate.
Combining science and black magic...
...they intended to upset the balance of the war.
I was 28, already a paranormal advisor to President Roosevelt.
I could never have suspected that what would transpire that night...
...would not only affect the course of history...
...but change my life forever.
All right, men, let's go. Move!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's fan it out.
Your men...
...they'll need these.
Are you a Catholic?
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.
Well, you're gonna need one of these.
I abhor the use of violence.
Thank you. I wouldn't want you to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.
All right, you guys, let's move, move, move, move!
Come on boys, let's go!
This way! Left, right!
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!
We're close!
You're wasting our time. There's nothing here but sheep and rocks.
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!
The remains of Trondham Abbey, built on an intersection of ley lines...
...the boundaries between our world and the others...
What a load of crap!
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard the word "parabnormal."
Paranormal.
Move it!
Hold the line.
Come on!
Sweet Jesus.
They must be here for the sheep.
The freak in the gas mask...
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.
Hitler's top assassin and head of the Thule Occult Society.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
No matter what happens tonight...
...this book will guide you back to me.
I will not leave you.
I grant you everlasting life...
...youth...
...and the power to serve me.
Ilsa! Grigori!
It's time.
Five years of research and construction, Grigori.
Five years!
The führer doesn't look kindly on failure.
There will be no failure, general.
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.
I'll deliver one.
What I will do tonight can never be undone!
What I will do tonight can never be undone!
I will open a portal...
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:
The Seven Gods of Chaos!
Our enemies will be destroyed!
And from the ashes...
...a new Eden will arise.
Get down!
I was taking a picture.
You do that again and I'll carve you a new one.
Listen, the portal is open.
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Look out!
Get down!
It's almost over.
No, it's not.
The portal's been open for too long.
Something may have come through.
Have your men search the area thoroughly.
Spread out over that way!
Sir! Something up here!
He's gone.
For now.
When you said something came through...
From where?
I don't see them!
Do you really, really believe in hell?
There is a place, a dark place...
...where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return.
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?
That's Russian, right?
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.
Rasputin?
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...
...he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed...
...castrated and finally drowned.
And yet, we saw him here tonight.
Professor Broom.
Careful. Be careful.
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.
It was red. Bright red.
Lower your light, you're scaring it.
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!
No, it's not an ape.
It's got a big stone in its hand.
I think that is its hand.
Look at the size of that whammer.
No, wait! Wait!
A blanket. Get me a blanket.
Come on. Come on. It's safe.
Jump down.
Come on. Jump down.
It's a boy.
It's just a baby boy.
Move to the left.
There we were, an unready father for an unwanted child.
The boys gave him a name that very night.
In retrospect, perhaps not the most fortunate.
But nevertheless, a name we all came to use.
We called him Hellboy.
Look at the birdie.
Speculation about the origins...
Evidence that Hellboy...
So, what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
I kid you not. It hunts monsters.
The claim, of course, that this creature...
...works for the FBI as a monster hunter.
What you seek is in there.
This is a sacred place.
Give me my gold.
We shouldn't be here.
Master.
Your eyes.
What did they do to your eyes?
- Have you told him yet?
- No.
We should.
Malignant sarcoma.
In the lungs...
...the spine...
...liver.
- Approximately...
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.
I can arrange for hospitalization and pain management.
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.
I'd rather be at home.
I have some arrangements to make.
For my son.
You can always get a second opinion.
That won't be necessary.
Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!
Tom Manning is the head of special operations at the FBI.
He joins Pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.
There. That's the tail.
And these are the horns.
I have a question.
In the pictures of aliens, UFO, the yeti, Hellboy...
...why is it they're always out of focus?
Why don't you tell us...
...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell the American public one thing.
Now, this Bureau for the...
Paranormal Research and Defense.
There is no such thing.
"Waste Management Services"?
What is it?
John Myers, FBI.
Transfer from Quantico.
Look at the birdie, son.
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.
Watch your hands and elbows.
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.
Hello?
Turn the pages, please, if you don't mind.
Please.
The pages.
These? You're reading these?
Four books at once, every day...
Four books at once, every day...
Four books at once, every day...
...as long as I'm there to turn the pages.
My name's Broom.
My name's Broom.
Professor Trevor Broom.
Sir, I'm John...
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.
T stands for Thaddeus, mother's older brother.
Scar on your chin happened when you were 10.
You still wonder if it's ever going to fade away.
- How did it...?
- He.
Not "it."
Abraham Sapien.
Discovered alive in a secret chamber...
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.
His name was taken from this inscription...
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.
April 14, 1865."
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.
Hence, Abe Sapien.
Rotten eggs.
A delicacy. Abe loves them.
How does he know so much about me?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
"Unique." That's a word you'll hear frequently around here.
Sir, where am I, exactly?
As you entered the lobby, there was an inscription:
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails."
There are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.
Make no mistake about that.
And we are the ones who bump back.
1937, Hitler joins the Thule Society...
...a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
1938, he acquired the Spear of Longinus...
...which pierced the side of Christ.
He who holds it becomes invincible.
Hitler's power increases tenfold.
1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back.
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.
1958, the Occult Wars finally come to an end...
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.
1945, you mean.
Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Myers, this is Agent Clay.
Take his lead.
He'll make the introductions.
You're not coming?
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.
Make me proud.
They're not speaking.
Professor Broom had him grounded.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?
Oh, yeah. That was weird.
Yeah. Right.
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.
He gets fed six times a day.
He's got a thing for cats.
You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend.
He never goes out unsupervised.
Who?
I hate those comic books.
They never get the eyes right.
Hellboy.
He's real.
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.
What's with the hair, Clay?
Finally got them implants, huh?
It'll fill in.
Who's the squirt?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I don't want him.
What, you get tired of me, Clay?
The candy. Give him the candy.
Oh, sir, I...
I have these for you.
Father's back?
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.
I wanted to see her.
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Myers, huh?
You got a first name, Myers?
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.
John. John Myers.
Well, John'll do.
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.
What you looking at, John?
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Code red.
Hey, hey, hey.
Warning. Code red.
They're playing our song.
Come on, champ, let's go fight some monsters.
We're here at the Machen Library...
...where just hours ago, an alarm was triggered.
The N.Y.P.D. Has yet to issue a statement.
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.
And now here comes a garbage truck.
A large garbage truck.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.
One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
Outside.
I could be outside.
You mean, outside with her.
Don't get psychic with me, fella.
Nothing psychic about it.
You're easy.
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.
Liz left us, Red.
Take the hint.
We don't take hints.
Civilians in bedroom.
Okay, guys, let's sync up our locators.
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.
Six guards dead.
I thought we checked this place.
Fakes and reproductions.
Apparently, not everything was fake.
Father.
The entity is still in there.
Video surveillance shows a 16th-century statue was destroyed.
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.
The statue, however, was hollow.
A reliquary.
A prison.
The Vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough...
...to include it on The List of Avignon, of which, by the way, we hold a copy.
Perfect job for these babies.
Made them myself.
Holy water, clove leaf, silver shavings, white oak. The works.
Behind this door, a dark entity.
Evil, ancient and hungry.
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.
You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.
We'll definitely need more info on this one.
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.
No. He likes it that way.
The whole "lonely hero" thing.
Hey, Stinky.
Kitchen's closed.
What you having?
Six library guards, raw, plus belts and boots.
Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out.
Red, I found something.
This entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one.
Son of Nergal, brother of...
Listen, Sammy...
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.
So, what do you say we work this out in a nice, peaceful...
Oh, crap.
That's it for you, Sam.
Red, you need to hear the rest of the information.
No, he's taken care of.
No, listen to this.
"Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows...
...son of Nergal, hound of resurrection..."
See...
...I don't like that.
What? Hound of resurrection?
"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc..."
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?
Doesn't say.
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!
I'm going around the back.
Oh, crap.
Child.
All grown up, I see.
That voice.
It was the first lullaby you ever heard, my son.
I ushered you into this world.
I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Name this.
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. I...
Nobody helps me!
It's my job.
You want to help? Here.
Load this.
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.
Jesus, what's that on your arm?
Oh, crap.
What the hell is that thing?
Let me go ask.
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.
Why, you little...
Wait!
We're heading toward civilians.
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.
Red means stop!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Stay here.
Sammy, you got a leak.
Waiting for me, chunk-face?
What the...?
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.
That's right!
Open wide!
Son of a...
Yuck!
Screw this.
I'm fireproof.
You're not.
Hey, Myers.
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
How's your arm?
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?
I just fried Stinky.
Listen...
...tell Father I'll be home...
...but he shouldn't wait up.
No. No, wait, wait.
Yeah, I gotta go with you.
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?
Bye.
Damn it.
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.
Die in peace...
...and be reborn again and again.
Only seven more days till the eclipse.
The child will be there, and so will we all.
Won't we?
There's a big, red man down there.
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.
Not Santa.
Well, who, then?
I brought beer.
Oh, Red, your arm.
You better get that looked at.
I wanted to see you.
Every time the media gets a look at him, they run to me.
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.
So how many escapes this year alone? Five.
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red, has a tail and is government-funded.
I know where to find him.
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.
Don't touch anything.
I need to touch it to see.
- See what?
- Past, future.
Whatever this object holds.
Is he serious?
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.
Professor, they were here.
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.
This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.
Also, make sure it's all locked up over there in the annex.
Roger that.
Kroenen!
Move.
Move!
There he is!
We'll cover him from here!
All right, don't move! Put that down.
Put down the weapon!
Get them.
Drop the weapon.
On the ground!
Last warning!
Take him out!
Now, ready the welcome, my love.
Salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels.
Restraining the essence...
...of Sammael, the hellhound.
The seed of destruction.
This I can promise, Sammael.
For each one of you that falls...
...two shall arise.
- Professor.
- I'm all right.
Professor.
You...
You are very sick.
I don't want Hellboy to know.
Sixty years ago, they tried to destroy the world.
They're back.
In my lifetime, they're back...
...to finish the job.
We miss you at the bureau.
Abe's crazier every day.
Father's still mad at me.
Come back, Liz.
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.
No, not this time.
I don't like it here...
...but I haven't had an episode in months.
And you know what?
I'm learning to control it.
I'm learning where it comes from.
For the first time in my life...
...I'm not afraid.
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.
The Nanny Squad.
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.
Sir, may I go first?
Hang on a minute.
He barely knows him.
Then he should make it his business to change that.
Listen, H. B...
...I've got a chance out here.
So if you really care about me...
...you won't come back.
Yeah...
...I gotta go too.
Lots to do.
What took you so long?
Come on, time to go home.
Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.
Hey, Red.
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.
This is nothing.
You know what'll kill me, don't you?
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.
You were burned by some organic acid.
I'm lucky that way.
- I worry about you.
- Me?
Well...
...I won't be around forever, you know.
Damn!
Could you please be a little careful?
Big baby.
How long was it latched onto you?
I don't know. About five seconds.
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?
Touched you five seconds, laid three eggs.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
The stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs.
They are very sensitive to heat and light.
They need a humid, dark environment to breed.
Did you ever lose track of him?
Well, let's see.
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.
We can't risk it.
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents.
Search the whole place top to bottom.
Find those eggs and destroy them.
"Elizabeth Sherman."
I don't like the term "fire-starter."
I just don't.
And "pyrokinesis" sounds like some psychosis or something.
I don't know.
Maybe that's right.
Not being able to let go.
It's scary.
I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.
You hear about so and so...
...who just lost control and just exploded.
Well, they're lucky it isn't true.
With me, it is.
My master is calling your name now, my girl.
You must return to the child.
So once again...
...dream...
...of fire.
Hey, freak!
Get back here, freak!
- Let's get her!
- Get her!
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!
Freak!
Oh, no! Not again.
Oh, no! Somebody!
Help me!
Help me, somebody! Help me!
How many buildings does she have to burn down?
She belongs here.
That's not what she feels.
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.
Professor, the girl you're...
Professor, that girl you're talking about...
Hey, Boy Scout...
Hey, Boy Scout...
...think twice.
No, listen, I read her file.
- "Read her file."
- She blames herself...
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.
I could talk to her.
I think I could bring her back.
Just what was it that landed you this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?
What was it?
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?
What is your area of expertise?
He doesn't want me with him.
I know that much.
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.
Look, he respects Clay, not me.
I'm really sorry, okay?
I'm not your guy.
I'm dying, Agent Myers.
Like any father, I worry about him.
In medieval stories, there is often a young knight...
...who is inexperienced...
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.
Look, I am not pure of heart.
Yes, you are.
Rasputin is back for him.
What I ask of you...
...is to have the courage to stand by him when I am gone.
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.
But you will help him...
...in essence...
...to become a man.
Pull that down.
She was making great progress...
...and now this.
We'll be closed for months.
And it put a big dent in our Thorazine supply.
She's been like this since it happened.
Are you sure you want to go in?
Miss Sherman?
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.
Miss Sherman?
Can I call you Liz?
It's a beautiful name.
Sixty percent of all the women in the world are named Liz.
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.
John T. Myers.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau.
No special precautions, no security escorts.
Just you and me in a taxi like regular folks.
That doesn't sound like him.
Well, Miss Sherman, he's asking you back...
...but it's entirely your choice, you know?
Choice, huh?
That's cute.
I've quit the bureau 13 times.
I always go back.
Where else would I go?
Over here.
You said those eggs need it dark and humid?
Well, they hit the jackpot.
The subway lines, they all converge right around here.
Right below us is the old Vandeveer reservoir.
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.
There's a pulse.
There. A cistern on the other side.
Most of the eggs are there.
There's no way in.
We should go back and request a special permit, type 2...
You guys coming or what?
We lead a charmed life.
Here you are, doctor.
This should cover your tail fin.
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
This doesn't really look like doll's hair.
Be honest, Red. What do you think?
I'm thinking about doing it myself.
Hey, you guys find anything?
No eggs yet, Red.
What, are you on a lunch break?
Nothing here.
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.
Damn it, Red.
Hey, it's Abe.
Oh, God.
Bring your toy over here.
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.
Two. There were two.
Red?
Red. Come in, Red.
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?
It's like Swiss cheese in here.
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.
Didn't I kill you already?
You goddamn monster!
Oh, crap.
It's for you!
You shouldn't hurt people!
You missed.
Hey, chunk-face.
You can do better than that, big monster like you.
My kittens! Please!
My kittens! Please!
Somebody, please, get my kittens!
Somebody, please, get my kittens!
Second date.
No tongue.
My kittens. Careful with them!
Lady, give me a break!
Thank you.
My job.
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.
Buddy, don't take another step.
Buddy, don't take another step.
Clay.
Man down. I need an ambulance right away. Do you read me?
Hang in there, pal.
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.
Please stay in the car.
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please, can you come down, Miss Sherman?
Nice view.
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.
Here.
Damn.
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.
He'll make it.
Not everyone was so lucky.
We had two agents die today.
Clay probably won't survive the night.
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:
You're reckless.
These men trusted you to lead them as a team.
Where were you?
I knew those men better than you did.
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.
You have an insight.
You know monsters.
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to say?
This whole thing is a farce.
This whole thing is a farce.
Because in the end...
...after you've killed, after you've captured every freak out there...
...after you've killed, after you've captured every freak out there...
...there's still one left.
You.
Hey, Manning.
I wish I could be more gracious, but...
Welcome back.
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.
Then I shall be on my way.
Oh, you should have a look around.
We made some changes around here.
I want that thing locked up, starting now.
Right now! Do you...?
Now, you hear me?
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.
Home sweet home.
Liz?
Liz!
You did it, buddy. You did it!
Myers?
Pop?
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, what's that on your wrist?
This?
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?
I'm depressed, one rubber band.
I'm impatient...
...two rubber bands.
Maybe...
Maybe I should get you a fresh pack.
Yeah, maybe two.
Yeah, maybe.
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?
One minute. One minute.
Hey, Myers...
...you're a talker.
What's a good word, a solid word, for "need"?
Well...
..."need" is a good, solid word.
Too needy.
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.
Nachos.
Oh, my God.
Look at them all.
Who had babies?
Liz, there's something I need for you to hear, and it's...
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.
Out?
"Out" out?
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Are you going alone?
No, Myers is taking me.
Hey, your chili's getting cold.
Not hungry.
Is there something you'd like me to hear?
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.
Well, then, later.
See you.
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.
Well, good night.
Goodbye.
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.
Born in Munich, 1897.
Suffered from a masochistic compulsion...
...commonly known as surgical addiction.
Both eyelids surgically removed...
...along with his upper...
...and lower lip.
The blood in his veins dried up decades ago.
Only dust remains.
What horrible will...
...could keep such a creature as this alive?
Oh, no.
Come on, Red.
Jesus.
Damn it, Red. Not again
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.
Here we go.
Listen about...
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
What are you two talking about?
What is so fascinating, so important?
No. He's determined, unstoppable.
Some people would call that cocky.
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.
Hey, I've got yours.
My uncle, he used to say we like people for their qualities...
...but love them for their defects.
He loves you, you know.
What about you?
I don't know. I grew up with him.
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.
There's hardly a day that goes by that he's not in my mind.
Even now...
...I feel like he's here.
Hey, wait up.
You like doughnuts? I got two.
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.
Told you.
She took his picture.
Damn!
She took his picture.
She took his picture.
She took his picture.
Oh, crap.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Coffee's warming me up.
Well, what do we do now?
Newark, New Jersey, entertainment capital of the world.
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.
Hey.
You're Hellboy.
I'm on a mission.
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?
I lived with my uncle most of my life.
Then I went to Quantico, went to top of my class. I'm nothing like...
Don't tell anyone, huh?
Attaboy.
Sir, he left his locator.
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.
He'll never change.
A child.
Always a child.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
Moscow.
Who wants us in Moscow?
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.
She's sitting on a park bench, and she's laughing.
That's it. I'm done.
They don't look like spies.
Are you kidding me?
Look at this guy.
Those shady little eyes, that phony grin.
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.
Yeah, the old yawning trick.
Watch his arm.
First he wants my job, then he wants my girl.
Hey, we all have a side that we try to hide.
God...
Hey, what the hell?
Hey! Hey, who threw that?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Nice shot.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.
I see the puppet.
But where is...
...the puppeteer?
Very good, Professor Broom.
It was you.
The scraps of paper...
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.
Bread crumbs on the trail.
Like in a fable.
They both distract him...
...and guide him exactly where I need him.
Moscow.
His destiny.
And the last clue...
...will be left by the late Professor Broom.
You raised the child.
Nurtured him.
So in return...
...I will permit you...
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.
He will open the portal...
...and bring about the end of the world.
If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...
...none of this would have come to pass.
But then, how could you have known?
Your God chooses to remain silent.
Mine lives within me.
Every time I died and crossed over...
...a little more of the master...
...came back with me.
He disclosed to me the child's true name.
Would you like to know it?
I know what to call him.
Nothing you can do or say...
...can change that.
I call him...
...Son.
I'm ready.
It'll be quick.
Just go there and tell her how you feel.
My mom says that...
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?
Plus, you're 9.
You're not old enough to be giving me advice.
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.
- No!
- Wait, what happened?
- No!
- It's okay.
No, not him.
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.
He hasn't spoken to anybody in three days.
Not a word.
He won't eat, he won't sleep.
I've never seen him like this.
Never.
Should I stay?
With him, I mean?
Listen, I'm not much of a problem solver.
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.
But I do know this much.
If there's trouble...
...all us freaks have is each other.
And I'm stuck here.
So...
...take care of the big monkey for me, will you?
I have accumulated many objects of great interest...
...preserving our heritage.
Many, like me, believe Mother Russia...
...to be very close to a historic rebirth.
"Rebirth"?
I like that.
Twenty tons of stone.
This thing fell from the sky into Tunguska Forest.
June 30th, 1908.
The Romanovs took possession of it immediately.
I've wanted it for ages.
You're aware, of course...
...there's no way you'll get it out of Russian territory.
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.
We've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs...
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.
We leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment.
Hellboy's coming.
I'm not pleased about that, but I'll be in charge this time.
We either wrap this up or I'm closing this freak show for good.
Hi.
Hi.
I'II...
...come to Moscow...
...if you're still going.
I am.
But I have something to say.
I understand what you don't like about me.
I do.
What I am...
...makes you feel a little out of place...
...out there.
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.
I'm not like Myers.
He makes you feel like you belong...
...which is good, really.
I wish I could do something about this.
I can't.
I can promise you two things:
One, I'll always look this good.
And two...
...I'll never give up on you.
Ever.
I like that.
This engraving here represents Sammy. Text reads:
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael."
We'll have to nail them all at once, and the eggs.
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.
Cable pulls the safety pins.
Kaboom.
Easy to clean, easy to use.
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.
"Sparky"?
Who came up with that? Myers?
Yeah, we're leaving the main road, so hang on.
This better be the place or I'll puke.
You better come out and see.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.
It's practically a city.
And it stinks, and it's muddy.
I think we go back, we check into the hotel, we regroup.
After breakfast.
I think what we have to do here is we have to make a grid.
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.
Let me ask for directions.
Where are you going?
Come on, baby, find me a talker.
Hi there.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
What do you want?
This is ridiculous.
I run this show, not him.
This guy's nothing but trouble.
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...
...and let him do his thing?
Anybody got a PowerBar?
Hey, there he is.
Sixty feet further, comrades.
And three rows in.
What the hell is that on his back?
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.
Say "hi," Ivan.
Go that way, Red Monkey!
Gotcha.
Ivan says there's a whole network of tunnels down here.
Goes on for miles.
Stay close, everybody.
You better be right about this.
We'll be all right as long as we don't separate.
Hey, Sparky.
Tell everyone to turn their locator belts on. Anybody sees anything...
I'll say "Marco."
Polo.
- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: Two.
Don't worry, Boy Scout, she'll take care of you.
She's a tough one.
Come on.
Ask your buddy how far this thing goes.
How you doing up there, Ivan?
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!
Would you mind holding this guy for a while? He is so negative.
What the hell is that?
Something big.
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.
No, no, no. Stay put!
Stop!
You listen to me.
Listen to me!
I'm in charge.
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!
Lime, let's go!
Stay put!
And you! I am not afraid of you!
I'm in charge! We go back!
I was better off dead!
Oh, crap.
Music.
Really went deep.
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
You killed my father.
Your ass is mine.
What are you laughing at, you Nazi son of a...?
Don't even think about it.
That's all for you, pinhead.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Having a...
You never light a cigar that way.
You use a wooden match.
Preserves the flavor. You see?
Thank you.
Thank you.
So he thinks you and I...
That's why he's mad at me.
But it's not true, right?
What?
Well, that, you know, you feel that way about me.
You want to know that here? Now?
Yeah.
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.
Hey, wait up.
Have you found them yet?
I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.
Okay, good.
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.
Liz, wait.
Oh, my God.
Let's back out real slow.
Let's back out real slow.
Myers, ready your grenades.
Marco. Marco. Marco.
Get your big, red butt over here.
I'm coming for you, kid!
No piggybacks!
Get off me, you...
Liz, no!
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!
What do you want me to do?
- Hit me.
- What?
Hit me.
Now!
You should be running.
They are all here.
All of them.
Just the way it was promised.
This one's awake.
Thank you for this.
"And I looked...
...and beheld an angel.
And in his right hand, the key to the bottomless pit."
And in his right hand, the key to the bottomless pit."
These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.
And now, the door.
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...
...so that they might at long last enter our world.
You are the key, the right hand of doom.
Your stone hand.
What did you think it was made for?
Open the locks.
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!
Silence.
Imagine it.
An Eden...
...for you and her.
No.
No?
In exchange for her soul, then?
Open the door.
No.
As you wish.
No!
Liz!
Her soul awaits on the other side.
If you want her back...
...open the door and claim her.
Your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you.
You cannot break them...
...no matter how strong you are.
The eclipse has begun.
Your true name...
...say it!
Become the key.
For her.
Anung un Rama.
Repeat it.
Anung un Rama.
Open the final lock.
Remember who you are!
Believe me, I have lived long enough to know...
...not a tear will be shed for this world!
You have a choice.
Your father gave you that.
No, you don't!
Open it!
Do it!
What have you done?
I chose.
You will never fulfill your destiny.
You will never understand the power inside you.
I'll just have to find a way to live with that.
Child.
Look what you've done.
You've killed me...
...an insignificant man.
But you have brought forth...
...a god.
Myers, let's go.
Hell will hold no surprises for us.
I took a grenade belt.
The damn thing's broken.
Keep her safe, will you?
Whatever happens, don't leave her alone.
I won't.
You're okay, Myers.
Stick around.
Hey, Red.
Just pull the cable.
I didn't get you anything.
Are you going to be okay alone?
How big can it be?
Damn!
Damn.
Oh, this is gonna hurt.
Gonna be sore in the morning.
She's got no pulse.
She's not breathing.
Liz?
I was so foolish.
Red.
In the dark...
...I heard your voice.
What did you say?
I said, "Hey...
...you on the other side...
...let her go.
Because for...
For her I'll cross over.
And then you'll be sorry."
What makes a man a man?
A friend of mine once wondered.
Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?
I don't think so.
It's the choices he makes.
Not how he starts things...
...but how he decides to end them.
Hey, guys? I'm still here.
Hello?
You're not scared, are you?
Scared?
Why should I be scared?
We're next to a cemetery.
So?
If anything were to happen, no-one would hear a thing.
What could possibly happen?
Remember the guy they caught, the one who was killing kids?
Yeah. And what?
Wanna know the worst?
What's that?
Chocolate milk?
He ate them.
Carried parts around in a cooler.
Making that up!
Am not!
My sister knows a newspaper guy.
He told her.
When they caught him, know what was in the cooler?
Their fingers?
Oh, gross!
It's a sheep's eye.
From the butcher shop.
When you die, the last thing you see is on your retina like a photograph.
Grandma says souls live in the eyes.
The "soul" is an invention of witch doctors.
There's someone out there!
There's no-one here.
There was. I heard him!
Howie?
Howie, is that you?
Howie, no more games, you hear me?
Howie?
You forgot to close it.
No. You were the last one.
Jesus!
Why you guys sneaking around?
We weren't sneaking!
You were.
Like a pair of rats.
No!
Let me go.
In the house!
Halt!
Emily!
Wake up Emily.
Come back.
Let me go!
- Stay in there.
- Let me go!
What did you do to that "thing"?
You have no right!
Thirteen years later.
West.
What you got there?
That some kind of animal?
Why, Moncho?
Are you hungry?
Is that a rat?
Your powers of observation are dubious at best.
Dubious?
Dubious.
You wanted me?
Yes.
Here.
New work assignment?
Dubious.
Oh, and it's "Sergeant" Moncho.
Ratty?
What did you do to Ratty?
Mother of God,
I ain't seen him, I swear.
I'm sick. Leave me alone.
Where is Ratty?
What's wrong, Cabrera?
Lose you stinky little pal?
Ask West if he's seen him.
West likes animals.
What do you mean?
Think about it,
"dubious".
Line up!
Let's move!
West, you seen my Ratty?
Is he missing?
You better tell me, Einstein!
Any identifiable characteristics?
Markings...
Who took him is gonna get markings.
You the new doctor?
That's right.
That way to the Clinic?
Warden wants to see you.
In films, this is the Death House.
You wouldn't call it that.
What do you call it?
The Death House.
- Prisoners here are?
- Condemned to death.
Don't talk until he talks to you first.
...are sex criminals.
As a woman, that should repulse you.
It's very disturbing, as a person.
But as a reporter it's an interesting statistic.
Good answer, Laura.
- Can I call you Laura?
- Certainly.
So, you don't believe in rehabilitation.
Don't be naive, Laura.
I believe in what works.
Two thousand volts of raw power from a stand alone generator.
This works.
When a man sits in it and I make every new prisoner sit in it they submit to my power.
Fascinating.
You're just saying that.
- Doctor Phillips?
- Yes, sir. Howard Phillips.
It's a pleasure, Warden Brando.
You graduated in the top five per cent of your class.
You could have your pick ofjobs.
Why here?
Institutional medicine interests me...
Really?
Well. Yeah.
Hi. I'm Laura Olney.
I'm with Arkham Record.
Anything you say to me will be quoted out of context.
Well in that case, let me just say hi.
Hi.
We have a fully equipped medical facility.
I'm sure you do, but these are mine.
Do all doctors have such a relationship with their tools?
You requested to have a particular inmate working in the infirmary.
We're understaffed and he has a medical background.
Keep an eye on him.
Sir?
He thinks he's smarter than everyone else, but he's not.
His attitude could infect others.
"Infect"?
An idea can be like a disease.
If you discover a minor anomaly, do you ignore it?
Fuck!
No, Doctor. No. You cut it.
Some growths are benign.
Not inside these walls.
Sir!
There's a situation!
Out of the way!
It's the doctor!
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
Hear my confession.
Just calm down.
The blood, the flesh, the beating heart.
I had to eat it.
I had to eat it.
Don't send me to Hell.
Get the drop cloth.
Keep his back perfectly straight.
Sorry!
Keep your hands off me!
On three, okay?
One, two, three, lift!
This way, doctor.
Out of the way!
Get the case.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.
I'm fine.
Where do we go?
What happened?
Heart attack.
Are you the new doctor?
Cute!
Get him on the table!
Nurse, set up the IV.
Hurry up!
Yes doctor.
Get me amiodarone.
- What?
- Amiodarone
We have none.
You have none?
It didn't come.
What have you got?
Try Sotalol.
It is similar.
Go get it!
Come on Nurse!
Coming!
I can't!
Could you help her, please?
Nurse, take these guys out of the way.
Everybody out!
And stay out there!
But...
Stay with them!
Clear!
You're wasting time.
Clear!
Come on!
Clear!
He was dead before he got here.
Goddammit!
He was my patient.
For five minutes.
You're the new doctor?
What is the meaning of this?
Doctor Herbert West.
I know all about you.
Really?
I know what you did.
They tried to cover it up.
Your experiments...
Don't believe what you hear.
I didn't hear it.
I saw.
That night they arrested you.
I was that kid.
I want to work with you.
Thirteen years...
There's bound to be some deterioration.
The reactive base may have destabilized but maybe not.
What are you doing?
Seeing if it still works.
No!
Someone could come in.
We're treating a patient.
The top of the spinal cord!
Of course
. Hold his head.
Hold it.
Quickly.
How long will it take?
I don't think it's going to take.
We can increase the dosage.
No, no. It's not going to work.
It might on something else.
Thanks for bringing me back my Reagent such as it is.
Oh well...
Wait a minute.
Listen.
Think about it. Come on.
We can make more.
In here?
This place doesn't have basic first aid, as you just found out.
But this is my clinic now.
What do you need?
It still works!
You're not dying.
How do you feel?
You hear me?
Stay away!
Can you hear me?
No!
We must sedate him!
Get the Thorazine!
50 cc.
No! No!
Forgive me, please.
Forgive me!
Dr. Phillips.
What the fuck's going?
He went crazy, sir.
Severe cardiac arrhythmia.
A reaction to medication.
What medication?
We administered 10 cc of Sotalol but it provoked an unexpected effect.
You call this
"an unexpected effect"?
The patient suffered arterial fibrillation.
His heart was beating too fast.
Allergic reaction is not unusual.
West, you've just added twelve months to your sentence.
It's swollen.
Doctor Phillips, one of my men is hurt.
I'll see to him.
Sergeant, that is an immediate Lock-Down!
Yes, Sir!
The rest of your visit will be outside of the security areas.
Warden...
West, the lockdown includes you.
Doctor Phillips asked me for a list of the supplies we need.
Right. I need that list.
Clean him up and get him to the Hole!
Come on.
Get up.
West, get to your cell!
My last partner turned
State's evidence on me.
I expect better of you.
And watch out for her.
She's trouble.
Hi there.
Hi. Just organizing my notes.
You were right about my ankle.
I should stay off it.
Hard to push in the clutch.
How about I drive you home?
Are you sure?
I'm putting you to trouble.
On a day like this, it's no trouble.
Had yourself a big day, Moses.
Beat the hell out of 4 grown men while having a heart attack.
How did you do that?
They gave you some medication.
What was it?
- I know why I'm here.
- Yes?
I'm dead, and this is Hell.
I'll show you what Hell is.
West!
You and me have got to talk, man!
West!
West!
Sorry about the tofu...
I should know.
This pizza's great.
I've had a great time.
Great
The way you handled that interview impressed me.
I did such a great job
I was thrown out.
State Penitentiary Progressive
Educational is so stupid.
Come on, don't give up.
Anything's possible.
See the possibilities and seize the moment.
Go for it.
- "Go for it"?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll "go for it".
What are you really doing here?
"Institutional medicine".
Tell me about your secret "I.M." research.
Of course.
I am investigating the effects of institutionalization on life and death.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Why do your residency in the "joint"?
Really. Why, Howard?
As a kid, I saw my sister die.
I'm so sorry.
I never want to feel helpless again.
I tried to resuscitate her.
I wanted to bring her back.
Who was helping you today?
Doctor Herbert West.
He's a prisoner but, he worked at a university hospital.
He researched death as a disease.
One of his reanimation experiments lost control.
The man went crazy... violent.
Like the man today?
And escaped from the Morgue.
The morgue?
He broke into our house.
That expression reminds me of Emily.
Your sister?
You're going?
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.
Looks like your ankle is better.
Yeah.
Seize the moment?
Go for it.
You got everything.
Moses isn't doing so good.
We need lab. Space, somewhere private.
He doesn't seem human.
I think this will do.
He's a monster.
He was the freshest specimen we could find.
It's a problem.
It is a problem!
I want to help people, not create mindless freaks!
Having second thoughts?
All medical research requires risks.
If you don't see, you shouldn't be here.
Soon I'll find a force to bring order to that chaotic organism.
Away to restore rational behaviour?
I can now accelerate the testing phase of my current work.
With your help.
This work requires commitment and full confidentiality.
You must tell no one.
- I'll walk?
- Lipstick on your collar.
Doctor Phillips, I'm going to be leaving now.
What's that for?
Doctor Phillips.
Do you need anything?
Are you there?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I was working late.
On what?
Nothing. Just clinic stuff.
What are you doing, investigating me?
- No.
- Yeah.
I was wondering how the man was doing.
He's fine.
Really?
Doesn't seem human anymore.
We shouldn't have...
You shouldn't have, what?
What's the matter?
The story I'm on.
I figured out some stuff, but it's just speculation.
- You need hard facts.
- Yeah.
But to get them I'll have to take some risks.
What do I do?
Play it safe, or "go for it"?
You've got to "go for it".
Really?
You got to take some chances.
That's what you're doing, isn't it?
What's your new story about?
Can't tell you yet.
Secrets?
Every girl needs a few secrets.
It hurts so much.
I can't even spit, Doc.
I don't see anything.
Once they gave me little red pills,
Vicodin, made me feel better.
Little red pills. Little red tits.
- Take two at bedtime.
- How about now?
Can I have more?
- Today's the day, cabr髇.
- Today's the day.
I'll see you in the yard.
- You're a dead man.
- A dead man.
Today's the day.
It worked.
Reschedule the afternoon.
But doctor...
Now. To test it.
On who?
My story isn't working, it's too impersonal.
Something's missing.
And it's you. You're the key.
The key?
To what?
To understanding how this prison works.
Everything is an extension of your philosophy.
I'd like another look around.
Afterwards I'll need you for an in-depth interview.
I'd be happy to do the interview
- if...
- If?
If we do it over dinner tonight.
You get to know the man behind the office.
After my tour?
Consider Miss Olney my personal guest.
Yes, sir.
And give her the tour, again.
Why did you come back?
To finish a profile on you.
Really?
You are a fascinating man.
You're just saying that.
Tonight then.
Did you know the human body loses
3 to 4 grms. Of weight at the moment of death?
I heard about that.
A rodent loses much less, but the ratio is the same.
The cerebral cortex is the site of an extraordinary neuro-electric phenomenon.
Hold him.
Hold him
Tightly.
Ratty is not going to be very happy.
This phenomenon,
NPE, Nano-Plasmic Energy, is not just in the brain.
It moves throughout the nervous system, and is present in every cell of the body.
Hold him a little.
Classic post-reanimation.
Confused, violent.
Like all my other subjects to date.
This brought him back from the dead.
But this will give him true life.
What is that?
The Nanoplasm, from a living donor rat.
Donor rat?
Now hold him.
Completely still.
This is the catalyst.
This is the force that tells the cells how to grow.
It works!
Laura.
Doctor Phillips, how are you?
Why are you here?
Just, "going for it".
- That the way to the "hole"?
- Certainly is.
I would really like to talk to him.
Not a chance.
My Editor gives expenses for stories.
How much are we talking here?
The cell door has to be locked.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
What if I need you?
Do I call?
Not a sound.
No one can know you're in there.
He can't hurt you in that straight jacket.
Look who's coming.
She's going to see Moses.
Why else would she do there?
All right, give him to me.
Any last words pendejo?
Ratty?
What happened?
I gave him his pet back.
Are you gonna let him go?
Give Daddy a kiss.
What's wrong, Ratty?
Hi. I'm Laura Olney,
I'm a journalist.
I want to talk about what happened the other day.
Do you remember what
Dr. West did to you?
Did you die from that heart attack?
Can I check your pulse?
Mother of God, forgive me.
What happened to you?
- Hungry!
- Sergeant Moncho!
Thank God you're here.
You must think I'm an idiot.
No I don't. Really.
You're a very intelligent man.
Fascinating.
- I don't like people lying to me.
- I wasn't lying.
Explain!
Give me that!
He attacked me.
He's dead.
You're right.
What are you doing?
I murdered him.
That's what they'll say.
You know the cretins out there.
It was self-defence.
You had no choice.
I'll swear to it.
Get down. You're going to have to convince me.
Lower. Bark.
- What?
- You heard me! Bark!
Am I the most fascinating man you've met?
Yes.
And you'd do anything for me?
Yes, sir.
Show me.
You bribed a guard, came in and freed a dangerous prisoner. He got excited...
- I wanna get Moses up here.
- Why?
To put this in him.
You've got more?
No. This is Ratty's NPE.
I gave Ratty the nanoplasm of a different rodent.
- Aren't they different?
- Not at all.
Nanoplasm is a completely neutral energy.
It's the same in rats, dogs, human beings.
- You want to put this in Moses?
- Yes.
Going from rat to rat is okay, but from species to species is not right.
Not right?
All this is the result of years and years of painstaking research under incomprehensible conditions.
How dare you say my work is wrong?
- You can't transfer the soul...
- The soul?
This is science, not superstition.
- This is a human being...
- Was human.
And will be again, with this.
Dr. Phillips?
1, 2, 3, up.
Dr. Phillips.
There's been an incident.
No!
No!
Moses killed her in the Hole.
He's dead, too.
Dead?
The Warden needs
Death Certificates.
Now!
Get rid of the nurse.
Nurse, help the officers.
- But...
- Get out!
- What if she ends up like Moses?
- She's not getting fresher.
Come on.
- Top of the spinal cord, right?
- Right.
Thorazine?
Don't want her getting too excited.
Hurry up.
What's her name?
- Remember?
- Leave her!
This is not a good idea.
What is she doing?
We can't leave her like this!
Let's get her to the lab.
Stop here.
Where did he go?
He's got to be here, somewhere!
Look everywhere.
Everywhere!
Poor little thing.
Come on, go get your food.
Let go, you freak.
What's going on?
Give it back!
- You little...
- No!
And why not?
It's cross species.
Then she'll stay like this!
You can't experimenting on her.
Now look, Rat NPE...
Dr. Phillips!
Get her down.
Where is the body?
She...
What is going on in here?
Mr West and I... we...
You've set up a Lab.
You're doing illegal research.
You'll lose your job for this, and your medical license.
Move.
This is what you gave Moses.
You are never going to see the outside of these walls again.
No. No.
You're dead.
No!
Hold it there!
Come back here.
Back in your cell!
It's party time!
What are you doing?
Wait. Just a second.
Two thousand volts of electric current will concentrate the nanoplasm to the brain, so we can pull it off.
You'll electrocute him.
That's the idea.
Only through, electrocution can you drive the nanoplasm to the hypothalamus where we can extract it at the moment of death.
You wanna put his nanoplasm into Laura?
Rodent to rodent, no problem.
But human to human?
Do you want Laura to stay like that?
Sit him up.
Head down on his chest.
Move!
Hold his head still!
Hold his head still!
He's not dying!
He's not dying!
Clear!
That's enough!
Stop it!
He has to die.
Go to the infirmary.
Let's go!
Ratty!
Ratty!
Give daddy a kiss!
Howard? Where am I?
You're okay now.
Something happened to me.
You could say that.
Why are you looking at me?
Warden Brando strangled you.
You were dead.
Doctor Phillips and
I brought you back.
What're you talking about?
Brought me back?
- I feel so...
- What?
How do you feel?
That's interesting.
What's happening?
I see what's going on here.
You are using me as a guinea pig.
You let him do it!
No!
Stay away.
Both of you.
Stop!
Howard. Howard, please.
Please help me.
Howard.
West!
Where are you Einstein?
Hiding is not gonna do you...
Listen, Ratty's acting really weird.
You fucked him up, or gave me the wrong rat!
- Get your hands off!
- Guards!
There ain't no fucking guards.
This place is a riot.
- Look here.
- Leave her alone!
What'd you say?
Stay away. She's sick.
Contagious.
Sick?
I got medicine, make her feel better.
West took my ratty.
I'll take his little pussycat.
What's happening Howard?
You like it rough, huh?
Laura!
Laura!
Over here.
Come on!
- Where is she?
- Who?
Laura. The journalist.
They were chasing her.
- There was no woman.
- She's there.
Seal it off!
Laura! Laura!
This way's dead!
Shit!
Don't you play hide and seek with me.
Daddy has a big present for you.
Cesar, find her.
Surprise!
Welcome back Warden.
Before I leave, one last experiment, and you're pertect.
Those three years in
Solitary were very instructive.
I did my best work in there... and this is the result.
Rodent to human.
Neutral energy, or behavioral imprinting?
Let's find out.
West, you cretin.
You'll fry for this.
Do you hear that?
There's a riot going on.
The animals are running the zoo.
They'll make their way down here quite soon.
I'd like to see the results, but I can't.
There's a new early release programme and I qualify.
I'll be sure and leave the door wide open so they find you.
Take these will you?
And these.
Come on, come on.
Shit!
- It's the Warden.
- He's not Warden anymore.
You don't dare...
I am always the Warden.
I need a doctor.
Sergeant, you let that man go.
Sergeant Moncho!
Straighten up!
On your feet, Sergeant!
Stand up! That's an order!
How can I get you to follow orders?
The good stuff!
Laura!
Laura!
Are these men giving you a problem?
I didn't do that.
Well maybe I did.
Or maybe they killed themselves.
They couldn't stand living with their crimes.
They couldn't stand looking in the mirror one more day.
Me, I like what
I see in the mirror.
The Death House was built for one purpose.
Punishment.
The problem with execution is it happens too fast.
One moment of pain, and you're dead.
You're off the hook.
Today's criminals aren't scared any more.
He looks scared to me.
Just acting.
They're all actors here.
Execution is the kindest thing we could do for them.
But what if the agony of Death didn't end in an instant but instead, was prolonged indefinitely?
Move out!
Quick! Quick!
No!
Mother of God. Forgive me.
Mother of God.
Forgive me for I have sinned.
It's all right.
I forgive you. It's all right.
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Lose something?
She changed.
You were wrong.
She changed!
It was a theory.
Oh God, I hate you!
You and your sick experiments!
What was I thinking?
Laura was right.
You killed my sister.
An unfortunate incident.
Emily's no incident!
Nothing we can do about your sister.
But we can still save your girlfriend.
Laura!
Her name is Laura!
- Try the Death House?
- What?
Did you look in the Death House?
If the Warden found her, he took her there.
The Warden? But, he's dead.
God damn you!
Religion has got nothing to do with this.
In position!
Come out with your hands up.
Help me!
Hand over your head!
Hands over your head!
I see the light!
I'm saved!
Thank you God!
I'm saved!
Hold your fire!
Thank you God.
I'm hungry!
Great.
It's great what you did back there.
I like you.
I like you very much.
On your knees.
Would you prefer punishment?
That's a good girl.
Give daddy a kiss.
Sergeant!
Go stand guard!
What was that?
You bitch!
That's Laura.
Come on!
Your ass is mine!
Laura!
It's, it's in me... it's taking over.
You have to get it out!
I can't.
Please.
Please.
Don't let it go on, you have to kill it.
Kill me?
Fascinating.
I was a piece of ass for you.
No, never.
This is mine.
Fucker!
You've been holding out on me!
You can't keep this.
This is awesome.
This green shit rocks, man.
Give it to me.
Sorry. I can't.
Prison rules.
You can't share needles.
It's not safe.
Now, fuck off.
I need some privacy here.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Fortunately, right now cabr髇, you are not, me.
Hey man!
Got any more?
Just another hit.
You had enough.
How about some Vicodin?
The little red pills. Vicodin.
Stop!
Howard.
Laura?
Howard, please!
Warden Brando, is that you?
Where is it?
- What?
- You know what.
Where's my work?
That's quite enough of you.
Ratty.
This experiment is over.
Please Howard.
Please stop me.
You will be punished for this.
You're being punished.
Kill me, Howard.
Go for it, Howie.
I'm the Warden!
Guilty as charged.
Halt! In position now!
Move, move, move!
Howard?
I had to kill her... to get it out.
To save her.
But I want her back.
It'll be all right, Emily.
I'll take care of you.
Hold it right there!
You okay?
She's alright.
I gave her life.
Halt!
This man is critical.
I need to get him to hospital!
- Who are you?
- Doctor Phillips.
I run the infirmary.
Who are you?
Who's responsible if hedies?
Okay, go! Go!
Dubious... dubious.
Hey! Take him.
I saved her.
Tell him.
Tell him I saved you!
Emily?
Laura?
Emily?
Laura?

The future has not been written.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.
I wish I could believe that.
My name is John Connor.
They tried to murder me before I was born.
When I was 13, they tried again.
Machines from the future.
Terminators.
All my life, my mother told me the storm was coming.
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!
The beginning of a war between man and machines.
Three billion lives would vanish in an instant.
And I would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory.
It hasn't happened.
No bombs fell.
Computers didn't take control.
We stopped Judgment Day.
I should feel safe...
...but I don't.
So I live off the grid.
No phone, no address.
No one and nothing can find me.
I've erased all connections to the past.
But as hard as I try...
...I can't erase my dreams...
...my nightmares.
I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me.
A future I don't want.
So I keep running...
...as fast as I can.
Anywhere.
Nowhere.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Do you want me to call 911?
I like this car.
What are you--?
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.
Slow down and pull over immediately.
Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?
Let me see your license and registration.
I like your gun.
What?
This stupid thing's not working.
What's wrong with this thing?
I hate machines.
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.
You're blowing me off again.
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.
- But we're having computer problems--
- I know, you can't talk about it.
It's just...
...Scott was really looking forward to this.
Katie. I wish I had more time to get to know him. I really do.
That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.
Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.
You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.
You've done the right thing your whole life.
You won't make a mistake. You never do.
I'm the luckiest father in the world, you know?
I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.
We will.
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.
It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?
So far the firewalls are holding up.
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.
Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.
I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.
Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.
During which we've put everything under the control of a single computer system.
The most intelligent system ever conceived.
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
You're supposed to go around to the back.
Hey, I said you're supposed to go--
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.
Bitch. Wait your turn.
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.
Now.
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.
Growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network...
...have prompted rumors of a new computer super-virus.
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.
Go, go, go.
Elizabeth and William Anderson?
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?
What's going on?
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Well, I'll be back before you get up.
Cool it, guys, it's just me.
We've got a sick cat coming in.
Great.
Junkies.
Please, don't do that.
I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.
Put the phone down.
Sorry.
I just...
I needed some medicine.
There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.
Can't do that.
How much did you take?
- Enough.
- Well...
...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.
Take a look.
Hey!
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!
Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.
- Where's Dr.Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.
Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?
Mike Kripke's basement.
What? What does that mean?
You're John Connor.
I'm Kate Brewster.
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?
Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.
And there was that thing about your foster parents.
Yeah, they were murdered.
I didn't do it.
What the hell?
Is somebody with you?
Katherine Brewster?
No.
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?
Tell me. Where did he go?
Katherine Brewster?
What are you doing? Let me down!
Let me down! Let me down!
Where is John Connor?
If I tell you, will you let me go?
Yes.
He's...
...in the kennel, in a cage.
You said that you'd let me go.
I lied.
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!
John Connor.
It is time.
You here to kill me?
No. You must live.
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.
Get out of here.
Now!
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.
I can't.
This guy weighs a ton.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.
It's a Toyota Tundra.
It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit! Shit!
Get off.
Let me out!
What are you doing here?
You tell me. You got me into this.
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Son of a bitch.
Goddamn it.
Look what you did to my car.
This is my company car, asshole.
Get your ass out here.
Get your ass out of the car. Now!
What are you doing?
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!
Help!
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?
- Calm down.
- Shut up!
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.
Help, please! Please!
Let me out of here! Help!
Get back here, asshole!
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!
Yeah, first chance I get.
Hold on!
Stop it!
I'll drive.
Get out.
Excuse me.
Move over.
No sign of brain trauma.
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
Do you even remember me?
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?
That was a different T-101.
What, do you come off an assembly line or something?
Exactly.
Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.
Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?
Drop dead, you asshole!
I'm unable to comply.
Where are you taking me?
To a safe location.
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.
So a T-X was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.
I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.
Judgment Day is inevitable.
I require a cutting tool.
Here, take the wheel.
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.
My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.
T-X is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...
...and equipped with onboard weapons.
Its arsenal includes...
...nanotechnological transjectors.
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.
Its body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand external attack.
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.
I'm an obsolete design.
T-X is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.
It's a far more effective killing machine.
Oh, great.
That's great.
My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.
T-X is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?
You've gotta be shitting me.
No, I am not shitting you.
When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.
Relax.
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!
Man, this is wack.
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.
Hey.
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?
Talk to the hand.
Help! Help me!
Help!
I think we better go.
Jerky?
You're kidnapping me.
- Look--
- God, you were always a delinquent.
And look at you now, sitting there like the bad boy thing still works.
What are you, some kind of gang member?
How do you live with yourself?
What?
Tell her who I am.
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.
Right. And him?
He's a robot from the future.
Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.
Go to hell.
He doesn't mean you any harm.
I have a fiance.
He's gonna be looking for me.
What is it that you want?
Just...
...imagine...
...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.
Something amazing.
Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.
But there's a catch.
Something terrible has to happen.
You couldn't...
...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but...
What are you talking about?
It's just-- The life you know...
...all the stuff that you take for granted...
...it's not gonna last.
Mike Kripke.
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?
Because Mike Kripke's house...
...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?
So you and me--
Wait, did we...?
Holy shit, we did.
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.
I must have made some kind of impression.
Give me a break.
I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.
Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.
And now again, 10 years later.
We were supposed to meet.
Coincidence.
Yeah.
Hon? Did you just get in?
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?
No.
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason?
- Yes.
There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.
We're concerned something may have happened to her.
Where is she?
We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...
...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.
I'll help you find her.
Come with me.
Go.
Your mother?
I never even knew where she was buried.
I hit the road the day she died.
Why did you bring me here?
No! What are you doing?
Hey, stop!
Get away from it! Stop!
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.
Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.
They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.
What happened to her?
Leukemia.
I'm sorry.
We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.
They only gave her six months.
But she fought for three years.
Long enough to make sure.
To make sure?
That the world didn't end.
"Every day after this one is a gift."
She told me, "We made it. We're free."
But I never really believed that.
I guess she didn't either.
You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?
How pathetic is that?
Out of my way!
My mission is to protect you.
That's enough.
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!
Go ahead. See what happens.
Don't do that.
Oh, my God.
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.
Release your hostage!
Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.
Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.
How?
Why? Why me?
You are John Connor.
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!
I'm never gonna--
Let go.
You're right.
You're not the one I want.
I'm wasting my time.
Fuck you, you fucking machine!
Better.
Oh, you were just dicking with me?
Anger is more useful than despair.
What?
Basic psychology is among my subroutines.
Perps still holed up?
Gotcha.
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.
Where is she?
Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the 5 freeway.
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the--
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.
Kate, my name is Dr.Silberman.
I'm a post-trauma counselor for the sheriff's department.
How are you feeling?
He's not human.
He's really not human.
I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.
I've been there myself.
The fear, the adrenaline.
You find yourself imagining things.
Impossible things.
Crazy things.
Insane things.
Take years to get over it.
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!
Drop your weapon!
And the coffin!
Take him down! Take him down!
Resume fire!
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.
Why? What makes her so goddamn important?
Through her, you contact remnants of the military and learn how to fight Skynet...
...forming the core of the Resistance.
Later, your children will become important.
- What?
- She's your wife.
Get in!
Do you want to live? Come on!
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiance?
The T-X is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.
Your fiance is dead.
Oh, my God!
Do something!
Get down.
We need a new vehicle.
Hey, come on.
We gotta keep moving.
She killed Scott because of me.
Look, I know this won't help...
...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.
It's not your fault.
Are you sure about this?
About her and me, I mean.
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.
There's more to it than that.
My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.
So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.
My father?
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T-X will resume its default program.
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.
General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...
...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems developed under Brewster.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Of course.
It all makes sense now.
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...
...she and I would have gotten together then. I would have met her father.
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.
Your father.
This is all about your father.
He's the key. He always was. Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.
He's the only one who ever could.
We have to get to him before the T-X does.
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!
My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.
I am giving you an order.
I am not programmed to follow your orders.
- After the nuclear war, you both--
- Nuclear war?!
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!
There is insufficient time.
The first launch sequences will be initiated at 6:18 p.m.
- What, today?
- Affirmative.
John, what is he saying?
Judgment Day.
The end of the world.
It's today, three hours from now.
Two hours and 53 minutes.
We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones.
No, we have to get to her dad.
The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.
You will not survive.
You mean we go run and hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?
It is your destiny.
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.
You cannot self-terminate.
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!
Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...
...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.
Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...
...I calculate an 83% probability that you will not pull the trigger.
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!
We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...
...depending on traffic conditions.
I can't get a line.
The whole cell network is down.
Skynet is assuming control over global communications...
...in preparation for its attack.
So if this war is between people and machines...
...why are you on our side?
The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.
I was originally designed for assassination missions.
So...
...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.
If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?
If you were to die,
I will become useless.
There will be no reason for me to exist.
Thank you for doing this.
Your gratitude is not required.
I am programmed to follow your commands.
Her commands?
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and sent through the time displacement field.
What exactly am I in this future of yours?
You're John Connor's spouse and second-in-command.
No, I--
What?
You're a mess.
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.
Why didn't I send you back?
I am not authorized to answer your question.
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.
Well, that sucks.
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.
So how does it--? No.
Maybe I don't want to know.
How does he die?
John Connor was terminated on July 4th, 2032.
I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model number...
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.
What are you saying?
I killed you.
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours, all primary military systems were secure.
They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.
Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.
What about the missile silos, the subs?
We've lost contact.
You're saying this country is completely open to attack.
Theoretically, we could be under attack already.
Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?
We can't trace the virus or pin it down.
It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.
This can't be happening.
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.
All right.
Look...
...none of this is gonna happen.
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.
He won't have to kill me someday.
He'll never even exist.
You and I, we can just go our separate ways.
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.
Really?
Your levity is good.
It relieves tension and the fear of death.
We're hoping you have a solution for us.
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a system-wide connection.
That's not what your civilian counterparts there told me.
They say we can stop this damn virus.
I understand there's a certain amount of performance anxiety...
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet into all of our systems...
...it'll squash this thing and give me back control of my military.
Mr.Chairman, I need to make myself very clear.
If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military.
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?
That is correct, sir.
Then do it.
And Brewster, if this thing works...
...you'll get all the funding you'll ever need.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Shall I?
No.
It's my job now.
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.
We're past the firewalls, local defense nets, Minutemen, subs.
Skynet's fully operational, processing at 60 teraflops a second.
It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.
Let's pray to God this works.
Power failure?
No. I don't know what it is.
What the hell is going on?
Daddy!
What are you doing here?
Daddy! Get away from it!
Watch out!
Daddy, don't move.
She'll be back.
We have to shut down Skynet.
Where's the system core?
In this building?
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!
Skynet has become self-aware.
In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.
What enemy?
Us!
Humans.
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.
My office, on this floor, we have to get there.
The access codes are in my safe.
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.
Which ones are the codes?
Red envelope.
Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.
A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Fifty-two miles northeast, bearing 0.5 degrees.
That's the system core?
It's your only chance.
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.
Take care of my daughter.
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.
I opened Pandora's box.
Get down!
There's nothing you can do. Come on.
We must go. It is not safe here.
Kate, we have to go.
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.
Come on.
Run!
Let's go.
That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.
Come on.
What?
Nothing.
You remind me of my mother.
Oh, God. She's coming.
What are you doing?
Powering up.
Come on.
It's working.
Just die, you bitch!
Come on.
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.
Yes! He made it.
Get away from me.
Leave!
Now!
Let's go!
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.
Oh, please. You can't do this.
I have no choice.
The T-X...
...has corrupted my system.
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.
Let him go!
You're fighting it right now.
My CPU is intact.
But I cannot control my other functions.
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!
Desire is irrelevant.
I am a machine.
What is your mission?
To ensure the survival of John Connor...
...and Katherine Brewster.
You are about to fail that mission!
I can-- I cannot.
You know what you have to do.
You know my destiny.
I have to live.
- Are you okay?
- What happened?
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.
Okay. 015 degrees...
...52 miles, our max air speed is about 160.
We've got 32 minutes.
It's just you and me now.
What if we can't stop it?
There's enough C-4 here to take out 10 supercomputers.
We're gonna make it, Kate.
The future is up to us.
That's gotta be it.
Skynet. There may be more of them.
Come on.
I think this is some kind of blast door.
There's no way we can blow through this thing.
John, look.
Now what?
It's a code prompt.
Type in "Dakota 775."
"Red 176."
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.
Here. It's "Avalon 412."
Put it in!
Come on!
I'm back.
Go! Now!
Come on!
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.
Go!
Come on!
You are terminated.
The elevator.
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.
That should give us enough time to get back up.
What is this place?
These computers are 30 years old.
This isn't Skynet.
There's nothing here.
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.
Only they never got the warning.
Goddamn it!
There's nothing here!
Why didn't he tell us?
Why did he lead us down here?
To live.
That was his mission.
There was never any stopping it.
John...
...we could just...
...let it go.
Hello?
Hello? Can somebody hear me?
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Somebody please come in.
Is there anybody there?
Anyone reading me? Over.
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?
Somebody please come in.
Anybody out there?
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?
Is anybody there?
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?
I am.
Connor, can you help us?
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?
By the time Skynet became self-aware...
...it had spread into millions of computer servers across the planet.
Ordinary computers in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.
It was software and cyberspace.
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.
The attack began at 6:18 p.m., just as he said it would.
Judgment Day.
The day the human race was nearly destroyed...
...by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.
I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day.
It was merely to survive it...
...together.
The Terminator knew.
He tried to tell us...
...but I didn't want to hear it.
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.
All I know is what the Terminator taught me:
Never stop fighting.
And I never will.
The battle has just begun.
Abre los ojos.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'Open your... '
'Open your eyes.
'Open your eyes.
'David, open your... '
'I suppose the empty street meant loneliness. '
'You're a shrink. You've got to do better than that. '
'I'm a doctor. Let's not stereotype each other.
'Not all rich kids are soulless,
'and not all psychologists care about dreams.
'The question is how you got here and why you've been charged. '
'What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.
'I ran three magazines in a worldwide publishing house.
'Most days I fooled myself into believing it would last forever.
'Lsn't that what being young is about? '
'Believing secretly that you would be the one person in the history of man
'who would live forever? '
Where are you going so early?
Don't record any more messages on my alarm clock.
Why not?
I'll start to think we're married or something.
Don't ever say that word.
I'll never bring you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again.
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?
Yes!
Juliana here.
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition, I lost my head!
Listen, I have to go.
I'm with David.
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...
You are the greatest.
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.
When?
- When?
- Soon!
Did you reserve the court?
Easy. I can't handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour.
Sorry to do this early.
I've got to be done by 10:00.
'You're not going to make the 8:45, are you?
How did you find me?
'You have to check the colours for the new issue. '
- What are the colours?
- 'Yellow and red, or the traditional white. '
- Got to think about it.
- 'David, please. '
'Don't be late for the 10 o' clock with the board. '
Don't tell anybody where I am. I don't care if God calls. I'm very busy.
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?
They drive you nuts.
That was the desire of my father who hired them.
You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you?
I know someone was there when
I called. You had that tone.
"Oh, no, man. I've got a cold. I'm hanging in today."
I had a cold.
- I was alone.
- Fine.
You can do what you want with your life, but one day you'll know what love truly is.
It's the sour and the sweet.
I know sour, which allows me to appreciate the sweet.
Julie Gianni is a friend.
Sometimes we sleep together.
What? What?
My dream girl, Julie Gianni, is your fuck buddy!
- What do you want to listen to?
- Slow down.
What have we got here? Barcelona...
Radiohead?
Look out!
Fuck!
Fuck!
We almost died.
I know. My own death was right there in front of me.
You know what happened? Your life flashed before my eyes.
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.
- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.
David, you were playing racquetball.
I've been covering you for an hour and you're playing racquetball.
We are exiting the elevator.
The board is not happy.
Hello, David.
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love called to see if you got her e-mail and Graydon Carter called to see if you're still on for dinner.
The art department still need the decision on the colours for the bikini issue.
Did I mention the board is pissed? You're late.
David, hold up! Choose one!
Wait! This one? David!
They're all waiting for you.
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...
...opinions are expected.
David.
Do you dream about the board, the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,
Happy, Doc, Dopey and, of course, Grumpy.
- How was Aspen?
- Good.
Now, I want answers and I want them now.
How's it going?
'They still look at me as if I was 11 years old. '
He's going to inherit everything. He gets it all.
- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.
Is that how you explain what's happened to you?
What happened to your face?
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?
No!
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...
David, the part where we parry and joust and get to know each other bit by bit... No can do.
We'll have to skip that because you've been charged with murder.
In four weeks, a judge will determine your fate based on what I write.
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.
There is no murder!
It never happened.
I don't have to talk to anybody!
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.
Easy, Face! Your whole story's full of holes!
Stop. Stop! Please leave right now. I'll take responsibility.
Please leave right now. He's got control.
I'm going to get you, daddy's boy, little freak!
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.
That you're a daddy's boy?
Primer on David Aames, Senior.
'My father wasn't built for the 21st century. '
He never went to McDonalds.
He never watched television, yet his biggest magazine is still the "TV Digest".
'He and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world.
'Ballooned, jumped out of aeroplanes. He sought adventure. '
His autobiography is the manual for every cut-throat publisher in New York.
It's called "Defending The Kingdom".
Terminar com essa gentileza do Paul
McCartney. I've read it. Page 127:
"David Junior was a delight as a child."
Did I miss something here? Is that all he wrote about you?
I don't think he ever got over the fact that I'm absolutely terrified of heights.
The irony continues.
When he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on New Year's Eve, ten years ago, he left the keys to the kingdom...
...to me.
Who all thought they were first in line.
And you believe the board, the Seven Dwarfs, put you here to take control of your company?
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.
Tonight's Wednesday night.
I go out for dinner with my two daughters on Wednesday, so I'll have to leave soon.
You understand that our time is limited, don't you?
If I talk... you'll just think I'm crazy.
With all the possible respect I can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories, David...
...believe me. You've crossed that bridge.
Enjoy your dinner.
There are five basic emotions in life, David.
Tell me, what emotion gripped him before he entered that cell?
Was it guilt? Hate?
Shame?
Revenge?
Love?
I'm completely on the wrong track, aren't I?
Who needs ice?
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.
You have got the greatest taste in shoes bar none.
Emma, have you met Lynette?
No, but I shudder to think what we might have in common.
Did you invite the entire snowboarding team?
It is my birthday.
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.
Welcome to Graceland.
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!
Happy birthday!
Friends of me!
Let the fun ensue.
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.
It's an amazing, amazing product.
No, that's OK. I've got it.
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.
David Aames.
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.
We met today at the library.
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.
I'll continue like you're both listening to me.
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.
Madison Square Garden is nearby. It might fit there.
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.
You're welcome.
Stop flirting and open it.
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.
I'll leave this upstairs.
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.
Don't blow me off.
I'm all packed, I'm going back to London and I understand.
You put me up for that attorney's job so you didn't have to fire me.
A classy move. Your father would have done the same.
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.
Is there anything more unbecoming than an ageing mascot?
I cared for your father. I lived and breathed for him.
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs, they think you're stupid.
A corporate hazard, a rogue.
They'll find a way to catch you out, David.
They're lined up for your office, your life, your position.
And they're going to sell this tradition of words so they can eat in a better cafeteria.
What they don't know is this. People will read again!
Yeah.
I got it.
They've even got a nickname for you behind your back.
Citizen... Dildo.
You've got great instincts, but
I say this with complete love.
Claim your life. Learn to be an asshole...
- Two's enough.
- Forgive me.
I still believe in this family,
David, even if it's only you.
Drive Tipp home.
Give him that big office across from the Seven Dwarfs.
Set up a meeting with the other attorneys. I'll be in early tomorrow.
Earlier than usual.
Hello, handsome.
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.
That's how it works with parties. You have to be invited.
Oh.
I'm mad at you, you dick.
We made love four times the other night.
- Was that good?
- Two's good.
Three... is very good.
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?
Four is...
Four is what?
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go back and talk to that cute brunette.
Four is what?
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.
Four is what?
She looks like a moth, David.
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.
Some clever girl in a silly coat will come along and play you just the right way.
I'll lose my friend and there won't be chicken soup parties for me and you.
OK.
When will you call me? Don't say "soon".
I hate it when you say soon.
So this is what's become of rock and roll?
A smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some rich guy's wall.
It was a gift, actually.
- I like it.
- Whoa! Whoa!
So how did you get all this stuff? This apartment, this life?
I see.
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.
- You are, but the food's good.
- I've got a stalker.
- It doesn't sound life-threatening.
- I need you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation and you are wildly entertained.
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.
She's right across the room, burning a hole in my back.
- Red dress, strappy shoes?
- Yes.
She's really staring at you.
I'm having a drink.
- Shit.
- She seems to be crying. Less happy.
I think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
- Brian Shelby.
- Jennifer Kelly.
- You have another apartment?
- Sort of a day office.
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Goodnight.
- I hear her coming!
- Really?
No.
Brian. How are you?
We're safe, but I've got nothing to drink.
Who did these paintings?
This is Joni Mitchell, this one is Monet...
...and this one was done by me. It is a snowboard.
Well, two of them are geniuses.
That is the real thing. His paintbrush painted the vanilla sky.
Canvas. My mother's.
I'm surprised you're surprised.
- I can't keep this going.
- Me neither.
- I caught you.
- Brian, come in here.
- What's going on?
- I'm drunk.
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.
Nobody stalks me so I drink.
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.
You're paying me to write my novel, so you own me.
I don't own you. You are brilliant, you are handsome.
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.
You're drinking Jack Daniels. When you drink, you start with that...
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me down, give me a cigarette" thing.
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.
I dig her. I've never said this to you before about any girl.
But she could be...
Could be, could be, could be the girl of my dreams.
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.
But if she fucks up our friendship, she can go to hell.
I won't allow it. We are brothers.
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.
Hey!
- How you doing? Gracias.
- De nada.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank... and Frank must go.
- What?
- I good you bid evening.
Wait, I'll go with you.
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.
No, I have to work tomorrow.
You... are in great hands.
I'm just humouring myself that my opinion matters.
You will never know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone.
Because without the bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as sweet.
Have a good time.
Sweet and sour speech again.
A lot of people are scared of heights.
It's not the heights that bother me, it's the impact that terrifies me.
- I won't stay long.
- Hey, Paulo!
Hello. I have to take you for a walk.
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.
I love living here and
I refuse to clean up.
No problem.
I have to work around the clock to keep this place.
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.
But I don't dance like you dance.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.
Hey, Paulo. Beautiful, beautiful boy.
What do you want for dinner tonight? You want fried chicken?
Paulo!
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.
I don't want to know the story behind this photo. Who's Sergio?
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?
It's a long story, and we don't know each other.
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.
What about you? What's your nickname?
Citizen Dildo.
You are not staying over.
Never run a company. Stay an artist. Stay an arms dealer.
Please. Somehow I can't play the violin for you.
Although it must be difficult controlling all those people's lives.
Everyone at that party is connected to you for survival.
It seems.
Ever been married?
No. Did you ever accept any of your 12,000 proposals?
12,008. No.
You moved to New York to dance, paint, act and deal arms?
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?
Jeff Buckley or Vicki
Carr? Both. Simultaneously.
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York.
" But I think good things will happen if you're a good person with a good attitude. Don't you think?
- You think I'm naive.
- No, I really don't.
'I dug her completely.
'Somehow, I'd found the last semi-guileless girl in New York City. '
I have to get to sleep.
Truthfully, I'm also working mornings as a dental assistant.
Boy, am I going to the wrong dentist.
'You didn't immediately want to sleep with her? '
'Well, you know, I'm a pleasure delayer. '
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?
You keep a relationship casual until the absolute breaking point.
Then one evening, or afternoon, or morning...
It could be months from now.
- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.
- I've been married for 22 years.
- You've got dinner with your daughters.
That's right, I do.
Back then I had intricate systems with women you wouldn't believe.
Like... what?
Hey, Doc. Don't get all melancholy over the 30 seconds you were single a long time ago.
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Yes.
You might be right.
Let's continue. Time is not our friend.
Just our shortcomings. That's all we're allowed to draw.
I've never drawn such a true likeness before.
- Mine's finished.
- Already?
Done.
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.
It's something you'd see on a wall in a steak house in hell.
It's wonderful. Sign it.
- Let's see yours.
- No.
Give me that.
I feel bad. You said to draw a caricature.
I know. I couldn't. I saw you like that.
It's very good.
- I'll sell it to you.
- You monster.
How much for?
One kiss.
That smile's going to be the end of me.
What happens when your friend calls you tomorrow?
He just met you a few hours before me. He'd do the same.
- I see that friendship is important to you.
- It is.
And as his best friend,
I know he's finishing a novel about inadequacy and rejection, so the longer I stay, the better it is for his career.
Your career is the one I'd worry about.
Sorry.
You're more right than you even know.
I used to be one of those guys that just...
...was snowboarding through his life, with no focus whatsoever.
- When did you change?
- About five minutes ago.
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
'And to those who think that you're a charlatan? '
'I understand. A frozen head waiting for reanimation sounds like science fiction. '
What are you watching?
It's the greatest show.
It's called "Sofia".
'Lt's a new science: Life Extension. '
'How do you accomplish such a thing? '
I've seen this 30 times.
'Life is full of surprises, but the greatest surprise of all
'is that this doesn't have to end... ever. '
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?
Good point.
'Can you unfreeze a human life? '
'Take the case of Benny the dog.
'He was frozen for three months and thawed out to live a normal life. '
That's comforting. It's safe for Benny.
I'm in.
'Boy will still meet girl, they will still fall in love.
'Families will flourish, but man will meet his mind. '
We'd better watch out.
'Raymond Tooley, creator of Life Extension.
'The book is "Life, The Sequel".'
OK.
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.
Come here. I want to tell you a secret.
I meant that to be your forehead.
Thank you for the inspiration.
I will now attempt to run my company showing compassion for the seething throng of my partners, who root quietly for me to fail.
And for things you don't even know. Thank you.
I'm going to work. I have a company to run.
Pleasure delayer.
David Aames.
- Julie Gianni.
- Hey, handsome.
- You're following me.
- Just a little bit.
I wanted to finish what we were talking about.
And?
How did it go with our moth girl?
Did she turn into a butterfly for you?
Yes, she did.
She did.
I could tell by the way you were walking you didn't sleep with her.
Let me guess. You haven't slept with her because it's more fun when you draw it out. Sex just isn't as good if a woman hasn't told her friends she'd never sleep with you.
You're right on the money, Julie.
She must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
You're never there for your friends until they've given up on you.
I'm not blowing you off. I just...
I want to be alone for a little bit. Trust me.
I have a lot of things to take care of.
If we're friends, which we are, then you'll understand that.
I'm sorry. I got weird.
I missed an audition and it made me feel bad you didn't invite me to your party.
You want to make it up to me? I won't tell a soul.
Would you do a story on me if I made a CD?
Do you like my music?
It's vivid.
If I weren't me, I would buy a CD by me.
You know, if you can reach one person...
Wow.
What's happiness to you, David?
What's happiness to me?
- What is happiness?
- For me...
...this is happiness.
It's being with you.
There's one thing that bothers me.
Why did you tell Brian that
I was your... fuck buddy?
I didn't tell him that. I didn't say that.
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?
About the consequences of the promises that you've made.
- Promises?
- Yes, the promises.
I thought...
What are you talking about?
Do you understand how hard it is to pretend to be your buddy?
David, I love you. I fucking love you.
I fucking love you! Fuck!
Don't do this, don't do this.
You fucked me four times the other night, David.
You've been inside me,
I've swallowed your cum.
That means something.
Slow down.
Four times. It means something, David.
- Four times.
- Stop the car.
24 hours a day, I live with this aching possibility that you might call me to do something.
Let's go to your house and we'll talk this out.
Let's just slow down. Will you stop the car, Julie!
When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise, whether you do or not.
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?
What are you doing?
I love you. I love you.
Hello.
- You're amazing. Hola.
- Hola.
Did you get to work all right?
Yeah.
No, actually...
I had a horrible dream.
You dreamed you'd never see me again.
I left your apartment, I went downstairs to the car and my friend, the stalker, had followed me there.
- Julie?
- Yes.
She wanted to talk to me.
I remember I had this buzz, that buzz from you and me.
I think my mind was still on that terrible drawing of me.
But she was upset.
I don't know. I got in the car...
...and she drove off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car.
I thought you were going straight to work.
But I survive... with my arm... and my face reconstructed.
And what's worse...
I can't wake up.
How was your house after the party?
Party?
- What party?
- The party.
Remember?
Red dress, strappy shoes.
I spilled something on your shirt.
Sweet and sour, and the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
'My dreams are a cruel joke.
'They taunt me.
'Even in my dreams,
'I'm an idiot who knows he's about to wake up to reality.
'Lf I could only avoid sleep...
'... but I can't.
'I try to tell myself what to dream.
I try to dream that I'm flying.
'Something free.
'Lt never works. '
Is that the only thing you dream?
I don't remember.
Do you dream about the car accident?
Here's what you remember from a coma
- nothing.
- What happened next?
- What really happened?
Didn't you read the file? I was out for three and a half weeks.
My face and arm shattered, my jaw broken in four places.
No surgery could be performed because of the coma.
You can't feel the darkness or numbness.
You can't even feel.
And then, I came back to life.
Just like that dog,
Benny. Benny the dog.
Benny. Benny the dog.
Only my life was no longer enjoyable.
There are blinding migraines now. Nerve damage. Why?
This is how big business operates.
Random accidents, a lifestyle mishap.
They are not coincidences.
How do you think airtight contracts are broken?
These are power upheavals.
I'm from Ohio. We don't have power upheavals.
They're in the news every day, right between the lines.
Someone did this to me.
My father wrote about this in his book.
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.
"What is the answer to
99 out of 100 questions?
"Money."
'David, I don't want to worry you.
'I'm holding them off, but we've got a situation here. '
Only if you're mentally acute.
'I'm sorry that poor girl died,
'but you've handed the board a gift with your mishap.
'They'd like to declare you incapacitated.
'But you're back.
'You sound good to me, so let's fight the fuckers
'and have a full recovery. Maybe you should let people see you. '
The last time we were together, you were in a coma and you were very fucking rude to me. You didn't say a word.
The rumours of my death have been mildly exaggerated.
'Who could I trust? The ants were taking over the ant hill.
'Who could I trust? '
'The cranial structure was based on 30 pins,
'and fastened by micro panels and bone from the mandible.
'The grafts have maintained your cheek structure.
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...
'Doctors. Their power is in jargon, so you study up.
Is that the procedure for all bilateral haematomas in a LeFort llI fracture of a comatose patient?
'You do your best. '
The potential for intra-cranial brain damage was too great.
Beyond the cheek grafts, are the pins fastened with any kind of aluminium which could cause the pressure in my head?
We're working on prostheses, but you're not at the stage where we can experiment.
Experiment. Use me.
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.
These are like steel plates slicing through my every thought.
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.
I can't think straight most of the time.
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others who have not had the aesthetic benefit of plastic surgery as you have.
This isn't about vanity, Dr Pomerantz.
This isn't about vanity. This is about functioning in the world.
It's my job to be out there functioning.
I've got the money. I'll pay any amount.
Just invent something! Just play jazz.
You say you're the best face man in New York? Prove it!
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!
Nobody here takes your feelings for granted.
We prepared something based on the preliminary examination.
Bring it on!
It's sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection.
It's a facial prosthetic. It was two weeks in the making.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.
Emotionally and actually.
The plastic in the shield blocks out abusive rays and assists in the regeneration of cells.
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.
The ergonomics of the plate barrier allows it to interact
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.
For a minute there, I thought we were talking about a fucking mask!
It's only a mask if you treat it that way.
No, it's great. This completely takes care of Halloween.
But what about the other
364 days of the year?
'A new form of me began to take shape.
'I planned my re-emergence like the Normandy invasion. '
Sofia. Sofia.
So-fi-a...
Serrano.
'I'll just say it.
'I did my homework. I read every memo.
'Thomas Tipp was right
- people will read again.
'I attended the monthly meeting of the Seven Dwarfs by video. '
People aren't buying books! Let's invest.
'Oh, baby. This was war.
'I grew stronger in ways I'd never known
'and on December 5th, my planes filled the sky.
'The return of David
Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo. '
Did you see his face?
You won't believe this...
...but this is me smiling.
It's been a long time.
I tried to see you, but your people wouldn't let me.
I didn't want to see me, OK?
But then I woke up today, and finally...
...a good hair day.
You want to get together?
Sure.
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.
This weekend. I'll cancel an operation or two.
We'll have fun.
Because I am all about fun.
'Our first guest tonight is an amazing survival story.
'Please welcome Benny the dog!
'Welcome to the show, Gary.
'I have so many questions.
'Tell us what has happened to
Benny? What's Benny been through? '
'Benny fell into the water near our home
- 'and was frozen in the Skykomish river. '
- 'Ln Washington. '
'I went fishing, thinking he'd been gone for three months,
'and I see him in a block of ice. '
'He is thawed out now, is that correct?
'He's not moving a lot. I'm worried.
'I'm worried about the dog. '
'He's fine. He's just lost a little of his friskiness. '
Sofia? It's David.
I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.
I was just watching our old friend Benny the dog on "Conan" and I thought of you.
Whatever. I...
...I loved seeing you today.
So I will see you soon.
You're a great dancer.
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.
I'm in the mood for a cheap, overpriced rum and Coke.
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?
It's behind...
Over there, by the girl who looks like Björk.
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...
You look good. How's your book?
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.
It's kind of like a prosthesis.
Take off the mask. It's freaking me out.
I can't.
It's my face. This is my face.
Trust me, it's a little different.
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.
Sofia asked me.
She didn't want to be alone with me? That's bullshit!
I'm being pretty cool about this whole thing.
Talk to a shrink. Or are you going to call me sometime instead of hiding in your apartment?
Don't take it out on a girl you only met once.
Did she say that? Once?
She said I met her once?
Just cut it out. I miss the old you.
We all miss the old you.
Because the new guy is shit.
That came out wrong. I love you. Period.
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.
How about no sympathy? How about that's the deal we make?
Give me a Budweiser and a shot of tequila.
What kind of tequila?
- What did you say to me?
- I said, "What kind of tequila?"
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?
Patron, if you have it.
- Another shot, another Bud.
- This is on the house.
- Why?
- It just is... bitch.
Patron!
Fix your fucking face!
- Hello again.
- Hello again.
Idea
- let's start over.
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.
"You are, but the food is good."
I've got this little problem. I've got a stalker.
"It doesn't sound life-threatening."
I need you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation and you are wildly entertained. I know it's tough.
- "I'll improvise."
- I don't talk like that.
She's right across the room, burning a hole in my back.
Red dress, strappy shoes.
That's right.
I think she is the saddest girl to ever hold a Martini.
- Are you OK?
- No.
What's wrong? Is it me?
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.
Tell me now. If something's wrong, please tell me now.
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.
Just say everything. Say everything now, now, now.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
I can't believe you just said that.
That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
That's hilarious. That you said that.
That's... You said that. You said that.
That is what I love about you.
That's hilarious.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
Cats! Cats!
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.
Can't you see she wants to go on her own?
Shut up, you're drunk.
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.
Seriously, I don't need you to walk me home. Thank you.
OK, then, so...
...we'll call you.
We'll go catch a movie or something.
So we'll meet up soon.
We'll meet up soon.
We'll call you again to go out with me.
We'll call you.
It's been a real blast,
David. I bid you good evening.
Wait, where are you going?
My bike is back over there. We'll hang soon.
Bring your mask if you want. I'm getting used to it.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
I don't know.
You drank too much. Call me tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.
No, you won't. You just need to sleep.
- Hey. Hey!
- What?
What did you say to Julie
Gianni the night of the accident?
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.
Never.
She was a little more than pissed about it.
Have you been harbouring this shit all along?
I never talked to her.
Whatever.
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the one to tell you you're not ugly?
Come on! Give me a courtesy laugh!
Brian, I'm so fucked up. I'm just so fucked up
We're best friends! We're bro's!
Come on, man. We're bro's.
Open your eyes.
Boo!
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.
And it worked. Get up.
I agree.
This is a joke.
David, I'm not going to lie to you.
I liked the way you looked. But...
...you have to pull it the fuck together.
If not, I'll forget the other guy.
You know that other guy? You?
I'm still that guy.
I don't have a mother saviour bone in my body. It's not about that.
You are coming inside, but if this turns out to be a big mistake...
...I do have the ability to fall out of love with you like that.
'We created our own world together.
'Us versus them. '
- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?
I thought you guys hooked up.
I wish you hadn't got in the car with that girl.
Sofia, I...
Your eyes apologise better.
Come on.
Holy God! This is going to change my life in a zillion different ways.
I must be nuts!
'We were quite a pair.
'Her believing in me, me believing that I actually deserved it. '
Ah, Sofia.
I see you haven't been wasting your time.
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.
Did you sleep last night?
I love you.
No, I did not sleep.
Got to leave early today, David, so you'll have to be brief.
What can you tell me about the name Ellie?
Ellie.
Was that a girl you were in love with?
I've only been in love once.
Apparently you kept repeating it last night.
You did sleep, David. Your advisor said you cried out.
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?
I... I don't...
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.
You cried out for Ellie. What do you remember about Ellie?
Show me your face, David.
Help me open the door.
It's true you had an accident, it's true you were disfigured.
But not any more.
Do you remember?
They did fix your face.
Take off that mask, David. You'll see your face is perfect under there.
I never trusted the doctors.
What happened next was surreal.
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me and suddenly he was my new best friend.
David! My brother! I felt really bad about our last conversation.
'He'd discovered a new form of reconstructive surgery
'with the help of a doctor from Berlin. '
Hello.
'Next thing I knew, they shot me full of drugs I'd never heard of
'and away we went. '
He's got a good voice.
And facial tissue could be regenerated.
...the concept of endoscopic, periorbital fibre optics.
- Where are we eating later?
- I can't even tell you what they did.
It seemed like science fiction.
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.
This is going to be one good-looking guy when I'm done.
'Obviously I was suspicious. '
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?
Doc, once you've been driven off a bridge at 80 miles an hour, somehow you don't invite happiness in without a full body search.
At the risk of boring you, I can present the alternate argument.
I once knew a guy who was a real loner.
One day he woke up at 40 with two daughters that lit up his life with purpose.
He suddenly goes to endless school plays, he gets home at 9:20 for the evening discussion and he has the time of his life.
His favourite Beatle was once John and now it's Paul.
I always liked George.
It all depends on the individual, doesn't it?
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.
David!
- David?
- What?
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.
It'll be fine, you'll see.
I called Pomerantz and switched it to Wednesday.
What?
I hope that women at the front desk gave you shit about it.
Another day won't matter, and the Mustang will be fixed.
The plan was going in the
Mustang. It's not ready.
So we'll go tomorrow in the
Mustang, when it's fixed.
I know that the problem wouldn't be you delaying something you were dreading.
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.
I mean...
I mean... I agree.
I think it's very important to have...
...the right car...
...to take you...
...where you want to go...
...24 hours a day.
How bad is it?
Well, your ears are in the right place.
And the rest of it...
...is not too bad at all.
It's perfect.
Do you love me? I mean really love me?
Because if you don't,
I'll just have to kill you.
In my next life...
In my next life, I'm going to come back as this mole right here.
Seriously, this mole.
You'll have to wear bikini tops to work so that I can breathe.
I love you. Love you.
I love you.
I can live right there.
Is this a dream?
Absolutely.
'We talked about the big things, the little things...
'... and the big things.
'But, in truth, with Sofia it was the in-between times. '
Je t'aime.
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.
Brian, how's things?
Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
Besides, Sofia is great, but by no means one of a kind.
She was a proximity infatuation.
Don't use that, it's mine.
Where did you get this camera?
I'm into things you have no idea, my friend.
- Just so long as you're OK.
- Anyway, we're friends, aren't we?
- Always.
- That's right.
What's up with your face?
Fuck!
There's a seam opening or something!
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.
I know.
Was I snoring?
No. I think it was me. I was thirsty, that's all.
I'm dreaming about you. Mmm.
I could listen to you say
"mmm" for the rest of my life.
Baby, what's wrong?
- Where is she?
- Who?
Who?
I'm Sofia.
I'm going to make sure that I tie it four times. You know why, Julie?
Because four times really means something.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm freaked out, it worked.
You won't get away with this, so just tell me where Sofia is.
- I am Sofia.
- Where's Sofia?
- I am Sofia!
- Where is she?
I'm calling the police. Tell it to them.
You survived the accident.
Whose body was it?
It was the board, the
Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?
You're trying to steal my life!
You weren't in an accident.
Now it's attempted murder!
I am Sofia, please!
Tell it to them.
This is David Aames. I need help.
I've captured an intruder who's entered my home.
Oh, God!
Wake up man. Are you for real?
They've kept me here for three hours.
They think that I had something to do with this.
Can you give us a minute here?
Thanks very much.
They think I had something to do with this.
We're going to handle this the way your father would.
- I've got it solved.
- You've got it solved?
Where is she?
She's going to be fine. This whole file is going to...
Thank God you're here.
It's OK.
I love her.
Look at these photos, then
I'm going to destroy them.
Sofia's testimony is also in here. It won't exist.
She's not going to press charges.
- Press charges against me?
- David, wake up.
As a friend...
...I think you should see what you did to Sofia.
The press won't get hold of this if you get away quickly.
This is Julie Gianni, this is not Sofia.
This is Julie Gianni.
I didn't do this to her.
Someone's setting me up.
David, the board and I have taken care of everything.
They've been really great, actually.
All this is going to disappear.
We're all behind you, even the board.
Get out of here.
This is a revolution of the mind.
You're insane!
Don't ever hit a girl!
Hit me, but don't ever hit a girl!
It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.
So Sofia was abducted by Julie and now Julie is posing as Sofia.
You're in OJ land, man.
Julie Gianni is dead!
I don't care what they told you. I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?
I just dropped Sofia off. I saw everything you did to her.
I did not do that to her.
Look me in the eye and tell me that's the girl you brought to the party.
Tell me that's your dream girl, your proximity infatuation.
Yes! And you stole her from me.
The one girl I really wanted and you took her from me.
You're insane. You're losing it, man!
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm with them.
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?
How much did they pay you?
Listen to me, because this is the last time we're ever going to speak.
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.
Problems?
I'm in no mood to be fucked with, so...
There's an explanation for all this, David.
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.
I'm here to help you, David.
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?
First of all, it's very important that you calm down.
Calm down? Calm down!
You must overcome your fears and regain control.
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.
What if I were to tell you that you can take control of all of this?
Even me.
I'm straight, OK?
David, look at all these people.
Seems as though they're all just chatting away, doesn't it?
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.
And yet maybe they're only here because you wanted them to be here.
You are their god.
You can make them obey you or even destroy you.
What I'd love for them to do is shut the fuck up, especially you.
You see?
You and I signed a contract, David.
'Who is the man in the restaurant? ' Who is it?
Can you tell the difference between dreams and reality?
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.
Think with your head. You signed a contract, did you not?
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.
Let your head answer.
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.
You understand you hold the keys to this prison?
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?
- No.
- Who was it?
You want to let it out, don't you, David?
You're about to tell me.
Tell me what your heart and soul will not allow you to forget.
Did you kill Sofia?
I thought you were a vandal.
Who are you?
I'm Sofia.
You are not Sofia!
You are not Sofia.
I'm Sofia. We're going to be together again.
You're going to forget about Juliana and we're going to be together.
I'm not going to be afraid of you any more.
I'll get you a cold towel. I'll be right back.
I love you.
'Pleasure delayer. '
Sofia?
I am Sofia.
I love you. I missed you so much.
Where were you?
Forget it. I don't need to know. It doesn't matter.
Just tell me that you love me.
I love you.
What is happiness to you, David?
For me, it's being here with you.
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck is happening?
David was a real delight as a child.
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.
Oh, David.
Red dress, strappy shoes...
That is the greatest thing I have ever heard.
I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.
What's happening?
I did it, didn't I?
But I don't feel like I killed someone.
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?
Sometimes the mind behaves as if it were a dream.
Faces change, people become other people.
The subconscious is a powerful thing.
You treated Julie carelessly, didn't you?
Your feelings of responsibility or guilt over Julie might have turned Sofia into Julie.
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.
All I know is you killed your girlfriend and I don't know what's in your mind.
I need your help.
I would work on this case forever if
I could, but we've run out of time.
What will you plead?
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.
I don't think they'll believe me.
Who do you believe?
Believe it or not, I care about you.
You've become like family to me.
I don't want to give up on you, David.
But I needed more. I needed an answer.
I even thought there was a chance somebody was playing a trick on you.
Maybe it was the board. But
I can't exceed my duties.
I'm just a psychologist...
...and I have to go now.
Will I see you at the trial?
No, I'm just the opening act.
'Reassurance is our speciality.
That's the Life Extension creed.
'Benny the dog was frozen for three months
'and thawed out to live a normal life.
'Life Extension can translate to the human form, too.
'How do you accomplish such a thing?
72 cryonised patients are currently held at our facility in New Brunswick.
We feature the finest scientific technicians on the planet.
- The book is "Life, The Sequel".
- McCabe!
McCabe!
Come back!
Life Extension Corporation, please. LE. We hold a court order.
I think I've been here before.
- Her name is Libby.
- Good morning, Mr McCabe.
I'm Libby. I'm here to assist you.
He's my son. He's very shy.
You're not with the media or part of any legal consortium?
Welcome to Life Extension.
Take a look at our proposal. Please follow me.
You can wait out here.
You'll be meeting Rebecca
Dearborn, my personal role model.
'I didn't need the pain any more. '
'Life Extension wants you to live. '
'I don't think that God disapproves of this. '
Cryonisation, a journey of reawakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures.
- They laughed at Jules Verne, too.
- David, you are not...
Mr McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.
Life Extension, or LE as we like to refer to it, is a glimpse of the future. A ticket, not in the juvenile sense but in the deeply meaningful sense that can only be borne in the human heart.
The DNA codes of the human body have been broken.
Soon heart ailments, cancer, so much more will be a thing of the past.
Very simply, your anguish, your discontent, even your death is no longer necessary in a traditional sense.
Whatever malady hides behind that mask, it's temporary.
Within an hour of your passing, LE will transfer your body to a vessel where you will be sealed and frozen at 196 degrees below zero.
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing will affect your suspension hibernation.
Have you signed a contract with these people, David?
- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.
The Lucid Dream is Life
Extension's newest option.
For a little extra, we offer the cryonic union of science and entertainment.
Cryotainment.
Some find this presentation helpful.
'Portrait of a modern human life.
'American, male, birth and death.
'Lmagine that you are suffering from a terminal illness.
'You'd like to be cryonised but you'd rather be resurrected
'to continue your own life as you know it now.
'LE offers you the answer.
'Upon resurrection, you will continue in an ageless state, preserved,
'but living in the present with a future of your choosing.
'Your death will be wiped from your memory.
'Your life will continue
'as a realistic work of art,
'painted by you minute to minute.
'You'll live it with the romantic abandon
'of a summer day,
'with the feeling of a great movie
'or pop song you always loved.
'With no memory of how it occurred, save for the knowledge
'that everything simply improved.
'Ln any instance of discontent, you'll be visited by technical support.
'Lt's just around the corner.
'The day after tomorrow, another chapter begins seamlessly.
'A living dream, Life
Extension's promise to you.
'Life part two. '
A living dream.
Your death will be wiped from your memory.
I guess I missed that one in "USA Today".
A dream. What if there was a mistake?
What if the dream became a nightmare?
Your subconscious can always play tricks on you.
The subconscious is a very powerful thing.
Did you sign a contract with these people, David?
But this is a serious business.
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.
And what is any life if not the pursuit of a dream?
The dream of peace, the dream of achievement, the dream of hearing someone say these words...
...when they truly mean them:
I love you, David.
- Te quiero.
- I love you.
Roam free, David. Most of us live our whole lives without any real adventure to call our own.
It's hard to comprehend, but they laughed at Jules Verne, too.
This is a revolution of the mind.
I want to wake up! Tech support!
It's a nightmare!
Tech support!
Tech support!
David Aames. I think it's time we had a proper introduction.
I'm Edmund Ventura from the Oasis project, formerly Life Extension, LE.
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.
We first met 150 years ago.
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.
I told you that it all depended on your mind.
All of this, everything is your creation.
Now we're heading towards your true moment of choice.
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.
When did the Lucid Dream begin?
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.
That night, after Sofia left you and you fell asleep on the pavement, that was the moment that you chose for the splice.
- Splice?
- Splice.
The end of your real life and the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.
A splice of many years which passed while you were frozen and dreaming.
From the moment you woke up,
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.
Your Lucid Dream is monitored by Life Extension and a panel of experts following your every thought, even at this moment.
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.
I'm not a big fan of heights.
I know.
We erased what really happened from your memory.
- Erased?
- Replaced...
...by a better life, under these beautiful, Monet-like skies.
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out of the iconography of your youth.
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?
'There are some things that you're not old enough to understand just yet. '
A movie you saw once that showed you what a father could be like.
Or what love could be like.
This was a kind woman, an individual. More than your equal.
You barely knew her in your real life, but in your Lucid Dream she was your saviour.
What happened in my real life? Something happened.
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?
Tell me everything.
The morning after the night club, you woke up on the street, hungover and alone.
You got up and you walked away. You never saw Sofia again.
I didn't kill Sofia.
No.
You battled your board, the Seven
Dwarfs, for control of the company.
In the end it was Thomas
Tipp, your father's friend, who wrenched the company back into your control.
Tommy.
But then...
...somebody died.
You longed for Sofia.
You shut yourself away for months. You were alone.
You couldn't stand the pain any more, the headaches.
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.
I signed a contract with you and then...
I remember.
Somebody died.
It was me.
'And on a day in late December...
'... you gave yourself to us.
'You're now in a suspended state.
'Your friend Brian Shelby threw a three-day memorial in your old home.
'He was a true friend.
'You were missed, David.
'Lt was Sofia who never fully recovered.
'Lt was she who somehow knew you best.
'Like you, she never forgot that one night
'where true love seemed possible.
'Consequences, David.
'Lt's the little things. '
The little things.
There's nothing bigger, is there?
Your subconscious did create problems.
Your dream turned into a nightmare.
The glitch has been corrected.
So all I have to do is imagine something?
Like if I wanted McCabe to come back right now.
Listen to me. These people are dangerous.
We're in trouble. We need to get off this roof now.
We're now on pause, and you're about to return to your Lucid Dream.
Pause?
You won't remember any of this, nor will you be charged for technical support.
It's now your moment of choice.
You can return to your Lucid Dream and live a beautiful life with Sofia or whomever you wish.
Or you can choose the world out there.
The world out there?
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?
Yes, just like Benny the dog.
Your face and body can be fixed now, but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.
Your panel of observers are waiting for you to choose.
There are no guarantees. But remember, even in the future, the sweet is never as sweet without the sour.
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.
I chose this scenario, didn't I?
Yes, to face your last remaining fear of heights.
David, don't listen to him.
This is the Seven
Dwarfs. It's a set-up!
You can't trust him.
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.
It's in his nature to fight for his existence,
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.
I'm real. I have two daughters.
You know that.
What are their names?
I'm real.
I'm...
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!
Can it?
Can it?
Goodbye.
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.
What is happiness to you, David?
I want to live a real life.
I don't want to dream any longer.
Any last wishes?
Let them out there read my mind.
I wish you well, David.
Look at us. I'm frozen and you're dead.
And I love you.
It's a problem.
I lost you when I got in that car. I'm sorry.
Do you remember what you told me once?
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
I'll find you again.
I'll see you in another life...
...when we are both cats.
'Relax, David. Open your eyes. '
Thomas, Henry, time to come in.
Roger!
Hold on there young man.
Let me go, let me go.
Settle down, I am not wishin' you any harm.
Let me go home!
Roger.
Where do you think you are going with those marbles?
I wanted to play with them.
But the marbles do not belong to you.
I need some to play with.
Young man, it is wrong to steal items from other people.
But I like marbles.
Roger, I am sure that the children would be happy to share their marbles with you.
Please return the marbles young man.
And you should apologize to Mrs.
Matthews and the children for this unjust act.
Hey! Roger!
Gentlemen as you all know, our Dr. Carlisle has authored a manuscript entitled.
The Changing Times.
His publisher has requested a statement by the seminary for the back cover of the book which, they feel, will aid in the book's credibility.
And sales.
Yes, that too I suspect.
We have as you well know a strict policy that any such endorsements by the board be unanimous.
Well I regret to say that Dr. Anderson is still recovering from his illness and will not be able to be with us.
Unfortunately he has also informed me that as of two days ago, he had as yet still been unable to read the manuscript.
Consequently, his vote will be excused.
But he did express deep disappointment and assured me that he would read it as soon possible.
Is Norris's health improving?
Yes, yes, his doctor says happily so.
He should be back teaching perhaps within the week.
Did they ever find out what was wrong with the poor fellow?
Not exactly, no.
He seems to have contacted some sort of infection that caused him to become delirious and weak.
Well, I have missed Norris.
He's certainly the most interesting Professor to speak with amongst my peers.
Thank you.
Now gentlemen, I suggest we all take a moment to express our opinion of the manuscript to Dr. Carlisle.
You have great courage, Carlisle.
Well, if Daniel can face the lions,
I am prepared to face this group.
Dr. Henry?
Insightful, Russell.
Excellent reading.
You have my endorsement.
Very kind of you, Dr. Henry.
Dr. Wiseman.
Well, despite several misspelled words and much bad grammar,
I have no objections.
Thank you, Dr. Wiseman.
The spelling we can correct.
But as for the bad grammar...
I am afraid that now you are starting to encroach upon my style.
Well we certainly would not want to encroach.
Dr. Butler.
You have my "yea" vote predicated on my receiving a complimentary copy.
I believe we can make those arrangements.
I, too Russell, found your work to be highly thought-provoking, excellent scholarship.
You are to be congratulated.
I'm sorry to interrupt your meeting, gentlemen.
Norris, what a surprise.
Are you certain you are well enough to be here?
Oh yes, thank you for your concern sir.
I came because I had wanted to speak with Russell about his manuscript.
Well, yes, we were just discussing it.
We all found it quite stimulating and certainly helpful to whomever might read it.
Yes, Russell's work shows great attention to detail and an impressive amount of research.
But I would like to speak to him privately pertaining to one matter, sir.
You have difficulty with something, Doctor?
Well, there is just this one matter
I'd like to clear up, sir.
What do you not agree with, Norris?
Russell please, I would like you and I to discuss this privately first.
Let us discuss it now.
We have no secrets here.
Yes, Norris.
I should like to hear your thoughts.
Well, I appreciate your interest gentlemen.
But, I do not think this is the proper place for an open discussion.
No worry Norris, I give you my permission.
Russell, please.
I give you my permission.
If you wish.
One of the themes in Dr.
Carlisle's book is the encouragement to proclaim the moral standards taught by Jesus to all people.
And what is wrong with this premise?
AND, I am quoting from page sixty seven,
"even if it is apart from His name and if people are rejecting
"the authority of Jesus
Christ in their lives.
"We must still teach the ways of Christ
"for the better interest of society.
The Lord's teachings are best for all."
The Lord's teachings are best for all.
You cannot be disagreeing with this statement, Norris.
No, what Dr.
Carlisle is implying is that we can put forth the standards of Christ apart from His name.
And I think this is deadly.
Are you saying that it would be wrong to simply tell a boy not to steal?
If this is all the information we give the boy, yes I believe it would be.
Oh come now, Norris.
Without the authority of Christ, mankind is merely left to compare ideas and morality becomes a matter of opinion.
One person says it is wrong to steal, the next person says it is not.
No standard is set.
We need to tell this boy that the Lord Jesus
Christ said not to steal.
Well I agree this is best but we cannot always mention the name of Jesus, it may not be received, especially by those already offended by the church or brought up in another religion.
But Jesus is the authority behind His commands and people need to understand this fact.
If we remove His authority, then we have no basis on which to command.
We understand what you're saying Norris but do you think you might have taken this thought to an extreme?
It is quoting a source without giving credit to the person who said it.
When we quote Shakespeare, we always say
"Shakespeare said this".
It should be the same with the Scripture.
Observe the Old Testament as our example.
How often do we read where the prophets first say,
"Thus saith the Lord" before they speak?
Yes Norris, however these moral standards taught universally would greatly benefit social behavior.
Here, here.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please hear me.
Satan is not against good morals,
He is opposed to Jesus Christ.
A man can have good morals his entire life, yet you and I know he will go to hell when he dies.
It is Jesus Christ that everyone needs and the devil knows this more than all of us.
Dr. Anderson.
Satan's goal is to remove the name of Christ from His commands.
And when we do this, people are deceived into thinking that if they live a good life they will receive God's approval and attain heaven.
I think we can use morals to attract people to the Lord.
Yes, but the ultimate issue in Christianity is the authority of Christ and the devil is attacking this authority by convincing us to teach morals alone.
Look at our families, they are weakening.
Records are showing that over 5 percent of marriages end in divorce and our young people are becoming more disrespectful.
Now I believe this is a direct result of eliminating the authority of Jesus Christ from His commands.
Norris.
In the case of telling this boy not to steal.
If I can not tell him that this command is from the Lord,
I would rather say nothing and let him steal.
And then, perhaps some day he will sense his need for the Saviour.
You could not have possibly derived all of this from one statement, Norris.
See where the statement leads, Russell.
I think you are taking it down your own path just nicely, sir.
Gentlemen.
Dr. Anderson, Dr. Carlisle,
I strongly encourage you both to meet privately to resolve your differences and I pray you will allow the
Lord to be your mediator.
When you are in agreement, we will all reconvene.
Until then, let us commit this matter to prayer.
This meeting is adjourned.
May I have a word with you?
You've already had quite a few.
Remember Russell, I wanted to speak privately with you.
Yes you did.
Well, it looks as though you have your wish.
I would like you to come to my home tonight.
No thank you, Norris.
There is something
I must show you.
And what might this be?
Your official written critique of my manuscript?
No, nothing like that.
Something you must see to believe.
I am surprised you will not endorse the book.
Actually, to be more accurate, I am shocked.
Russell, I did say it was well researched, but...
But, to tell a boy not to steal is wrong if apart from the name of the Lord.
Russell, there must be a connection between the Lord and His teachings, we can never separate the two.
Now, I have invited you to my home to explain why I am saying this.
The others, including the
Dean, have endorsed the book.
Do you see yourself better than these fine men?
Oh, come now, Russell.
Why do you say such a thing?
And why must we discuss it at your home?
Why not discuss the matter here and now.
No, no this is not the place.
You must come to my home.
I will look for you this evening.
And if I shall not?
You must.
But Russell, this endorsement will not only be helpful for your book but also beneficial to this seminary which needs continued exposure for the work being accomplished here.
Yes, but I do not think
Norris will change his mind.
I would not give up so easily.
I encourage you to try to speak with Norris again or perhaps talk to the Dean to see if an exception can be made.
The Dean?
I would not wish to alienate anyone on the faculty staff, nor infringe upon our friendship with Norris.
This is nothing personal against our good friend.
I just see this as a matter of standing up for something which you believe is important.
Norris will understand.
Perhaps...
Why would Norris wish to cause me this pain?
Norris is a wise and kind man.
He would never do anything with the intention of hurting you.
For some reason though he's trying to keep the seminary from endorsing the book.
You should go and speak with him.
You do remember he had taken ill.
The Doctor said he'd become delirious.
Russell, please.
Go and speak with him, you will feel better.
Yes, I believe his illness could be affecting his judgment.
The endorsement will also be beneficial for this seminary which needs continued exposure for the work being accomplished here.
This is my most diligent effort.
And, an excellent effort it is.
As I have said, I think it is extremely well written.
And the others did, also, if I may humbly say.
But I am not understanding Dr.
Anderson.
He has always supported my work in the past.
Have you had the opportunity yet to meet with him to resolve this matter?
I spoke with him briefly yesterday in my classroom.
And?
He has asked for another meeting at his home.
And?
I do not foresee us coming to an agreement, sir.
I see.
Sir, I would like to ask for an exception to the unanimity rule by the board.
An exception?
Yes, so I may receive the endorsement.
Doctor, I cannot change the policy.
Such endorsements must be unanimous.
But it does seems a shame, sir, that because of one, the work remains unpublished.
The work will not remain unpublished.
You may not receive the endorsement of the seminary, but the work will not remain unpublished.
Sir, we both know it would greatly aid the work's circulation, and I would not wish to publish a book without the endorsement of my peers.
I appreciate your feelings.
Sir... perhaps Norris' illness is still affecting his judgment.
Dr. Carlisle!
Well, it is possible, sir.
I'm afraid I can help you no further.
You did say so yourself, sir...
Thank you sir.
Are you certain?
Yes, very certain.
It came to me last evening.
A seventy-five percent majority vote by the seminary board of directors can overrule any policy in place.
If we change the unanimous policy,
I would be certain to receive the seminary's endorsement.
I am only pointing out a possibility.
Yes, and perhaps a solution.
But how would this action appear to Norris?
I am not intending to breach our friendship with Norris but I, too, in times past, have questioned the unanimous policy in my mind.
It seems to me that we are not always going to see eye to eye on every last detail in our published works.
And it seems to me that we are not always going to see eye to eye on every last detail of our published works.
Now as you know, a seventy-five percent majority vote by the board can overrule any policy in place.
Therefore, I can not personally see why Dr. Anderson's disagreement should stand in the way of the seminary's endorsement.
No offense towards our mutual friend.
Are you certain you wish to take this next step?
Yes sir, and I have counseled with another professor about the entire matter.
And who would this be?
I would rather not say sir.
Very well.
I shall endeavor to set up a meeting for the early part of next week.
Thank you, sir.
And I would strongly urge you to make one last effort to resolve your differences with Dr.
Anderson.
Yes, sir.
I will speak with him.
You look unhappy.
It appears the board will most likely change the policy.
Yes, but we may be too late.
The publisher is ready to take the book to printing and they're asking for the endorsement.
I may not be able to get the meeting assembled in time to get the statement I desire.
Go and visit with Norris.
I'm sure the two of you can work this out.
No, I do not think so.
Russell, you promised the Dean.
I am so glad you came, Russell.
Norris, my publisher is waiting to begin printing.
Now I'm sure you have a fine barn, but we need to settle our misunderstanding quickly.
Now what I want to tell you, as well as show you, must be kept secret.
No one must know.
Do I have your word?
You have my word.
No one must know.
Yes, of course.
I am sorry you never met my father, Russell.
He was a godly man and very committed to the Lord.
I'm familiar with John Anderson.
His articles on science and the
Bible are brilliant works.
But I came here to...
He was also fascinated with inventing.
It was his hobby.
An inventor?
Yes.
It seems I have inherited his passion for it myself.
Norris, please I...
Before my father went to be with the Lord, he came upon an idea, a theory, something incredible.
He completed his project, yet sadly died before he had a chance to test it.
Why are you telling me this?
Russell, the result of my father's work... is this.
Beautiful, is it not?
What is this?
Something incredible.
Yes, but what is it?
It is a singularity chrono displacement device.
I beg your pardon.
It's my father's technical term.
It is a transporter of sorts.
This machine can transport a person... through time.
Transport a person through time?
As in time travel?
This is impossible.
No, it is possible, Russell.
My only regret is that my father never experienced time travel himself.
Then how do you know it works?
I tested it.
You tested it?
You travelled through time?
Yes. I traveled over one hundred years into the future.
Over one hundred years, to the twentieth... no, the twenty.
Correct.
You?
This is an absurdity.
It is the truth, Russell.
Norris, time travel is impossible.
I'm afraid that your illness has affected your judgment more than I thought.
My friend, time travel is possible.
What proof can you provide?
I tried to acquire some physical evidence but the machine will not allow me to bring anything back from the future.
And why not?
Well, I have reasoned it was because the article would not yet exist.
It would be impossible for me to show you a coin from the 1950's before it was even minted.
Of course.
It would not have been minted yet.
I see.
This is why I have arranged a journey for you.
A journey?
For me?
Yes. Into the future.
Oh come now.
Russell, you must see where the teaching of good morals alone will lead.
You must see for yourself what happens when we remove the authority of Christ out of life.
You've gone way beyond reason here, Norris.
This is all nonsense.
Now you needn't worry about your wife or your classes.
When you leave tomorrow night, you will return from the future just seconds after you had originally left.
It is impossible to travel through time and I shall not listen to these delusions any longer.
Now if you'll excuse me please Norris...
Russell you must listen...
It is impossible to travel through time.
But it is possible.
Good evening, Norris.
Russell, please.
Good evening.
You must see for yourself what happens in the future.
And remember gentlemen, science and scientific findings do not make the statements in the Bible true.
Scripture is always true and never needs verification.
Scientific support of the Scripture only means that the science is true, because we know that the
Scripture already is.
My advice to any scientist would be to make sure that his findings coincide with God's Word.
This is, if he wants to be a good scientist.
Tomorrow we shall speak on Jesus' view of Scripture out of Matthew chapter four.
Class dismissed.
Good day, Dr. Carlisle.
Good day, men...
Hello Dr. Anderson.
Hello, hello...
Hello Dr. Anderson.
Norris, what brings you here?
You should be home resting.
I wanted to make sure you were coming by my home tonight.
Everything is set.
You leave at eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock?
Yes, for your journey.
My journey.
Why do you persist?
You had me up half the night thinking on this absurdity.
Russell, you still do not believe me?
Do you honestly expect me to?
I expect you to explore the possibility.
What possibility?
It is impossible to travel
- - to travel through time and I will not be a part of any jest.
Russell, we cannot continue our disagreement forever.
And you cannot continue this notion of time travel.
Your journey will resolve all our differences.
Russell, I am urging you come to my home tonight at eight o'clock.
I will not be coming.
You must.
Eight o'clock.
Gentlemen.
Dr. Carlisle.
I have just spoken with the other Professors about the unanimous policy and they too are in agreement with us that it should be changed.
Thank you, but we may be too late.
Oh?
I have just received a telegram from the publisher requesting the endorsement immediately as the book is ready to be taken to press.
However, I heard from the Dean we may not be able to assemble a meeting for almost two weeks as one of the board members is away from the city.
I'm sorry to hear this.
Yes, this is a problem.
Perhaps you could ask them to delay the printing until the meeting is assembled.
Perhaps, I could try.
At any rate you must try to speak with Norris again.
I'm afraid our friend
Norris is not well and this will not end in my favor.
You must try Russell.
This may be your only remaining option.
I will speak with you later.
And you cannot continue this notion of time travel.
Your journey will resolve all our differences.
Russell I am urging you, come to my home tonight at eight o'clock.
I have arranged your journey so that you'll be arriving on a Saturday at noon and returning the following
Wednesday evening at nine o'clock.
This will give you over four days in the future.
Your entry point will be a remote alley in the city where
I made my entry.
Norris, as I have said...
You must be at that same point on Wednesday by nine o'clock.
Norris, please, I have come to reason with you.
This is a timing mechanism.
When it becomes nine
PM on Wednesday night, it will activate the transporter and bring you back.
This is how I traveled alone.
Dr. Anderson, if you please...
And I would not tell anyone you are from the past.
It will only cause difficulties.
And do not try to look up your own fate.
It is not for us to know.
Not for us to know?
I insist you stop this nonsense right now and we sit down together and settle our differences.
Russell, your journey into the future will settle all our differences.
Here, take this.
What is this?
Coins.
Coins?
Yes. You will need money for food and clothing, and also for an inn in which to stay.
You can exchange those coins for modern currency when you arrive.
You will simply not believe the price of merchandise.
Fortunately for you, these coins are worth a lot of money where you are going.
Is this so?
This is a great opportunity for you, Russell.
You must see, with your own eyes, where the teaching of morals alone will lead.
Now, just stay right there.
Norris.
In case you're wondering, the machine works by stored rays and energy from the sun.
Bottled up and time-released, it creates an electrical disturbance and acts as a transporter.
It is much more complex, but we do not have time to discuss it now.
You have a journey to take.
Norris, this silliness has gone far enough.
I wish I could go with you on your journey, but I have yet to calculate a way to transport two travelers simultaneously.
But rest assured, I will keep trying.
I am about to leave.
Yes, my friend. You are.
Now... observe.
One more piece of instruction.
While I was in the future,
I received helpful information from a Christian woman who works as a librarian at the university library.
Her name is Michelle Bain.
She knows who I am, but not where I am from.
Try to speak with her if you can.
Michelle Bain.
Norris, what is happening?!
REMEMBER!
WEDNESDAY NIGHT, NINE
O'CLOCK IN THE ALLEY!!
Norris!
Norris!
Norris... Norris... Norris!
Oh, my...
October 21st, Two thousand and -
This cannot be.
So, uh, where did you get these old coins?
A... colleague gave them to me.
Well, they're beauties.
They are?
Yeah, they actually look like they're... new.
Leo?
Give me a second here...
I'm afraid we can only give you, uh, this much for them, Mr...
Carlisle.
Carlisle.
Is this, uh, acceptable?
There must be some mistake.
This amount?
Um, well, yes.
Very kind of you sir.
Um, Good, well, uh...
We'll just get the money for you and you can be on your way.
Thank you sir.
And thank you for treating me in such a fair and
Christian manner.
Sure...
Here you go Mr. Carlisle, right this way.
Thank you.
Your key sir.
Key?
I trust you'll find these accommodations acceptable.
Oh, they are quite nice.
Thank you very much.
And keep in mind your television features a satellite hook up with over one hundred and fifty channels for your viewing pleasure.
Television?
Plus you can receive over one hundred radio stations through the TV.
All digital, of course.
Digital?
And we have an additional terminal right here next to the phone if you need to go online.
On Line?
Of course you can also connect through the TV using this remote.
Remote?
Are you okay, sir?
Oh, yes... very well, thank you.
Well, if there's nothing else I can do for you...
Nothing else, whatsoever, you've been most helpful.
Thank you.
So everything is satisfactory?
Most satisfactory, thank you.
Because if there is anything you need...
Oh, I'm so sorry, thank you so much for you hospitality, sir.
You've been most kind.
Thank you.
Must have come in on a long trip, huh?
One could say that.
Suffering from a bit of jet lag I bet.
Enjoy your stay.
Jet, lag?
Well, it's about time... well it's about,
'bout, 'bout time...
It's about time...
C'mon...
Well, it's about time...
Well, it's about time...
Excuse me, sir.
What is this device on your head?
This?
Yes.
This is a radio, man!
Where have you been?
Is someone communicating with you?
SHH! Bottom of the eighth.
Two men on.
Bottom of the eighth?
Yeah, the ball game.
Baseball!
What do ya need?
Please allow me to introduce myself first,
I am Russell Carlisle.
And your name is?
Eddie.
Eddie?
Eddie Martinez.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr.
Martinez.
What do you need?
Change?
Change?
Yeah, for the machines.
No, um, actually, I was hoping you could recommend a Bible believing church nearby where one might attend a service tomorrow morning?
Church, huh?
Yes, to attend a service tomorrow morning.
Well, here ya go.
Let your fingers do the walking.
Let your fingers do the walking?
I'm sorry, I am not familiar with this.
It's the Yellow Pages, man, everything you need from A to Z.
Oh my.
May I ask where you attend church?
Oh, I ain't got no time for no church.
No time for God's people?
We all need accountability and encouragement from each other.
Hey, Eddie Martinez is a good guy.
You ask anybody.
Yes, this is important.
We should all strive to be good people towards our fellow man but if one separates oneself from a local fellowship of believers, it makes it difficult to live for the Lord.
What are you man, some kinda preacher?
No.
However, I am a Professor at a Bible seminary.
Perhaps the two of us could attend a service together?
Hey look, I already told you,
I ain't got time for no church.
Besides, I gotta work here tomorrow.
Tomorrow? On Sunday?
Well this should be a day of rest where we enjoy fellowship with family, friends and God's people...
Shh, quiet.
Bases are loaded.
Come on, Losalas, strike him out.
Strike him out?
Yes!
Very nice to meet you as well, Sam.
This is a beautiful sanctuary.
Very different from that to which I am accustom.
Yeah, she's a beaut.
Only a couple years old.
This your first time here?
Yes, yes it is.
Yeah, it's a good place.
You'll like it here.
We've got plenty of activities to keep us hopping.
Activities?
Oh, there's always something going on.
Like tomorrow night, our Sunday School Group's gunna go catch a movie.
A movie?
I'm sorry I'm not familiar with this.
Oh, we go almost every Monday night.
It's bargain night, half price.
You should come with us.
Be a good way to meet people since you're new and all.
Yes, that's very kind of you to include me.
Thank you, I would like to join your group.
Great!
Meet us outside the church entrance, about 6:30.
We'll take the church van.
A van... very well then.
Like I was saying, Tuesday night is church wide visitation.
Visitation?
Yeah, every Tuesday night, we go visit people who are interested in learning more about our church.
Not many people have been showing up, but it's there for those who are dedicated.
I see.
Then, Wednesday night we have supper and prayer service.
Food's not bad.
This week we have a business meeting to talk about the new building project.
And Friday nights I got church bowling league, so I keep busy.
That's pretty busy indeed.
Well thank you, you've been most kind.
No problem.
Hope to see you tomorrow.
Yes, I plan to... attend.
Holy, holy, holy.
Lord God All Mighty.
Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee.
The Word of God is our light, our guide, and our trusted friend.
The Bible says the word of God is profitable for teaching, doctrine, correction and training in righteousness.
You can trust in this book with your heart, with your mind, and with your soul.
Yes, I believe I'd like to try a... hot, dog.
What do you want on it?
Sorry.
You want everything on it?
Is this customary?
What's that?
This will be fine. Thank you.
How about a soda?
Soda?
Something to drink?
Um, tea?
Tea?
Young lady!
Young lady!
Young lady, young lady you've just stolen my hot dog!
Why would you do such a thing?
I was just playing around mister.
Well I would be happy to purchase one for your very own if you are hungry and in need of food.
Here, take your dog.
This is not a proper thing you have done.
It is important that you respect your elders and that we be kind to one another.
I said I was just playing around.
It's no big deal.
Oh, but it is a very important matter.
You do understand that stealing is a sin?
Says who?
The Lord says.
Hi.
How may I help you?
Are you the proprietor of this establishment?
The proprietor?
You mean the owner?
No, he's not here, he's my father.
Uh, how may I help you?
I would like to comment in regards to those women garments on display over there.
Well, I don't think they'd look very good on you.
I beg your pardon?
Just kidding, just a joke, mister.
I know, I know.
You know your wife would look just great in that outfit over there and you wanna see if I can work out a special deal?
I think we can work something out.
I am not wishing to purchase that garment, sir.
Huh?
I do not know how this will be taken by you, but I am sure that this manner of dress arouses sinful passions in the customers as they walk by.
Sinful passions?
Yes, sinful passions of promiscuity, especially in the younger males.
We must be careful as to the example we portray to our young people.
For the goodness of all society.
Sir, I appreciate you voicing your opinion and I'll be sure to let my father know.
And I wanna thank you...
But to be honest, this is the first complaint we've had like this.
Our customers, most of them don't seem to mind this sort of thing.
OK?
Hello again.
Hey, Preacher man got himself some new threads, huh?
Threads?
Yeah.
You know, clothes, rags, ropa.
Oh, yes.
And I see you still enjoy listening to this device.
Oh yes I do, especially when we win.
And we won yesterday.
Listen, I wanted to um... is it Edward?
Huh? Oh no, no, no.
It's just, just Eddie.
Just like it sounds.
Eddie, Ready Eddie, you know.
Alright then, Eddie.
I wanted to speak with you again about the importance of attending a local church.
Oh, I go to church, yeah...
Christmas, Easter...
Yes, but we need to attend church more than two times a year for spiritual growth.
Oh, well, you know, at least I ain't never been to the slammer.
Slammer?
Yeah, the Big House.
Jail. Clink clink.
Man, and I thought my English was bad.
But Eddie, we need consistent Bible study and fellowship if we are to become mature spiritual men.
Shhhh. Yeah!
Jesse Gonsaga just hit a double with two men on.
We're up three to two!
Eddie, I am attempting to talk to you about your spiritual life.
Look, preacher man, with all due respect.
I ain't no angel.
But I ain't never cheated or lied or shot anybody.
Ask people.
Eddie Martinez is a good guy.
Yes, these are all important virtues Eddie.
But it is important that we do more than just not offend each other...
Yeah! We got another run!
We're up four to two.
Yeah, you stick around Preacher man, you good luck.
One more piece of instruction.
While I was in the future, I received helpful information from a Christian woman who works as a librarian at the university library.
Her name is Michelle Bain.
She knows who I am, but not where I am from.
Try to speak with her if you can.
Michelle Bain.
How is Mr. Anderson?
I haven't seen him in quite some time.
Very well. Thank you.
Although I am curious as to how you met our mutual friend.
Oh, well, he came in here one day, um, gosh, maybe six months ago.
He was doing some research and I helped him find some reference materials.
We started talking.
Very nice man.
He's a Bible professor, but you know that.
Yes. I, too, am a professor.
Norris and I are colleagues.
Oh, well, how did his experiment turn out?
Sorry?
His experiment.
He said he was part of a science experiment and couldn't tell me where he was from or what he was really doing here.
Yes, the experiment.
I'm afraid Norris is still making his observations and has not yet made public his findings.
Ah.
Well, he was very interested in biblical matters.
I'm a Christian, too, and he had a lot of questions about the spiritual state of the times.
So I tried to fill him best I could.
Yes, like Norris I too, am interested in these matters.
For example, yesterday I attended a worship service in a large church on Main Street.
Um, I'm familiar with it.
Hopefully, you will not find this offensive, but by my observation there seemed to be boredom with the whole service; with praise hymns, hearing of God's
Word, everything.
Although, I did find the teaching to be accurate.
Well, I, I can understand your concern.
Personally, I think this is an extremely critical time for the church in so far as evaluating our priorities...
Sorry to interrupt Michelle.
You have a call on line 2.
The state office.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle.
I'd love to chat with you more but I've gotta take that call.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, one o'clock.
That's when I have lunch.
We'll have time.
Thank you.
I look forward to it.
Good.
Um, may I ask, who is this?
My secretary.
Thank you.
Have a nice evening, sir.
Um, Pardon me, my good man.
Could you recommend a good place to get a meal?
A meal?
What are you looking for, a burger joint?
A burger...
'Cause there's a good one right up the street there.
Yeah, I eat there all the time.
Yes, I believe I would like to try it.
It's a fifties diner, you know, a real throwback.
Fifties Diner?
You know, from the 50's.
Burgers, shakes, fries.
That kind of thing.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with this.
You never seen a fifties diner?
What's wrong with you?
You been livin' in the
1890's or somethin'?
Well, as a matter of fact, to be perfectly honest with you...
Oooo, baby, you are fine!
Hey look, I'll be off in about an hour, how about you and me get...
Pardon me sir, you should not be talking to this woman in this manner.
What would your wife say?
What wife?
I'm not married anymore.
Anymore?
Is she deceased?
Deceased?
You mean dead?
I wish she was, I wouldn't be payin' all this alimony.
We're divorced.
Divorced. Oh, I'm very sorry.
Sorry?
I'm happy, except for the alimony.
She was drivin' me crazy.
People don't understand what I went through with this woman.
I mean, dealin' with her moods and her demands every day...
But, the Lord hates divorce.
Hey, don't be dumpin' no guilt trip on me, alright?
One out of two marriages get divorced these days, it's not like I'm the only one.
Besides, it was her fault.
She was driving me crazy!
One out of two marriages ends in divorce?
This is fifty percent.
What do ya have?
Evening, madam.
What do ya have?
Very well then.
Yes, I would like this selection... the number two, please.
NUMBER TWO!
Something to drink?
Something to drink?
Tea?
TEA!
Don't worry, we'll be fine.
I don't know, are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Would you trust me?
We're gunna have the best time.
You already missed out last weekend, really...
Look you don't know how strict my parents are.
Seriously, what is the worst thing that could happen?
Well, if I come home with alcohol on my breath my parents will kill me.
So stay at my house.
Your parents won't say anything to you?
They'll be in bed way before we get home, they'll never know.
Don't worry, it'll be fine..
I don't know, are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Would you just trust me?
We are going to have the best time!
Okay.
Well, who's gunna get the alcohol?
Tommy's older brother.
Young ladies, excuse me but I could not help but overhear your conversation and I am shocked at what you are saying.
I cannot believe you would want to deceive your parents in this manner.
And who are you mister?
And you are also speaking of consuming strong alcoholic drink which should be forbidden, especially for your age.
Right, and so who do you think you are, like our parents or something?
Certainly not, but I am someone who has a genuine concern for your welfare, and I am your elder.
We should always conduct ourselves with honesty and integrity.
Alright look, you know what,
I am sick and tired of people telling me what I can and cannot do.
It's not like we're hurting anyone.
So why don't you just chill out!
Let's go.
Perhaps you should be the party to "chill out"... where's my tea?
Stop the movie!
YOU MUST STOP THIS MOVIE!!
The man on the screen just blasphemed the name of the LORD!
There must be some mistake.
You must stop this movie!
THIS IS AN ABOMINATION!
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Mr. Carlisle, are you alright?
I... I still cannot comprehend how they could allow a player on the movie screen to blaspheme the name of the Lord.
It's not that big a deal, Carlisle.
It's just a movie.
Yes, but to defame the name of our Lord.
It was a moral film.
The guy went back with his wife in the end.
Yes, but to speak so blatantly against the name of Jesus.
Look, buddy.
There's a lot worse movies we coulda gone to see.
Then perhaps it is better not to attend at all if this is the only selection.
This guy must be one of those legalists thinks all movies are sinful.
Pardon me?
Don't mind our husbands, Mr.
Carlisle.
They think they're comedians.
Yes, they're only joking.
So, where are you from?
I'm from here, originally.
Although, I have been living away for quite some time now.
Where abouts?
A place I do not think you are familiar with.
I will tell you this much, it is in another time zone.
And what brings you back here?
Actually, I am partaking in an experiment.
You're a scientist?
No, no I am a Bible professor by trade.
I teach science and the Bible and also church history at the Grace Bible Seminary.
Grace Bible Seminary?
Yes, it's located on the corner of Spencer and Downey streets.
Grace Bible Seminary... hmm,
I'm not familiar with it.
No... you know, Ann teaches science and chemistry at the high school.
Yes, I'd love to have you come talk to my class.
Oh, thank you, but I prefer not.
Oh, you must.
The students would really enjoy it.
I am only here for a few more days and I have no means of travel.
I'll be glad to pick you up.
And we can hear more about your experiment.
I best not.
Oh, the kids would love it.
Yeah, it'd be great for them to have somebody who's was really in the field...
Well, I'm not really in that field...
I'm sure there's something that you could share...
There's something strange about that guy.
What do you mean?
That seminary he just talked about, over on Spencer and Downey, there's no seminary there, it's an industrial park.
Yeah, that's right...
Why would he say that?
I don't know.
Like to find out what his little experiment is though...
Tell you what, why don't you run him through the computer tomorrow down at the station, see what you find out.
Just for fun.
Tom Sharp.
Hey, I think I found something interesting on our new friend.
Oh really.
Yeah, I checked out that
Grace Bible Seminary where he said he worked.
Oh yeah, the one located in the middle of the industrial park?
Well, it seems there used to be one in that exact location.
It moved across the state in '51.
And there was a Russell Carlisle once employed there as a professor.
No kidding.
There is one catch, though.
This Russell Carlisle's been dead since '36.
Well it can't be the same guy.
This isn't making any sense.
I know. It isn't.
What time is your wife is picking up Carlisle to go to school today?
Around 10:30 I think.
Pick me up at 10:20.
Can you tell us a little more about the experiment you're working on?
Well, not as of yet, for I am still making observations.
Scientists are supposed to observe everything they can first, then record their observations, and then make public their findings.
You need some help, man?
I'd be glad to skip school.
Not at present, but thank you kindly for your offer.
May I ask if you are familiar with the works of John Anderson?
John Anderson... I don't believe I've heard of him.
He lived in the late 1800s.
Brilliant mind.
Published some valuable information on the art of science and experimentation.
We'll have to locate his material.
Yes, please do.
His discoveries are fascinating.
The best part about Mr.
Anderson's work is how he relates everything to the Bible.
Remember students, if any scientific record contradicts the Scriptures, it is the scientific finding that is in error.
The Scriptures are never wrong.
Mr. Carlisle...
God's Holy Word is so trustworthy, it is amazing how it has recorded scientific fact hundreds of years before
Science ever discovered them and is proven accurate
100 percent, every time.
Mr. Carlisle.
The Holy Scripture, students, is always your most reliable science book.
MR. CARLISLE!
Yes?
Mr. Carlisle, this is a public school.
You can't talk about religion in class.
I was not talking about religion.
I merely mentioned the accuracy of the Bible.
This school has rules.
No religious views expressed to the students.
No religion taught to the students?
No!
Do you want me to lose my job?
Lose your job?
Of course not, this would be disastrous.
Well okay then.
I'm sorry this has to end this way.
I'll just tell the students you had to leave.
Thank you for coming.
This guy travels light.
Nothing in here either.
There's nothing in the drawers.
Hey Rex, take a look at this.
What? The Bible?
This note.
"Given to Russell in honor of his high school graduation.
"Love, mother and father.
June 23, 1865."
And I just simply mentioned the Bible.
I meant no harm by it.
And the teacher informed me that she could lose her job over the matter.
Well, our nation is no longer built on the biblical principles set forth by our fore fathers.
We haven't been able to study the Bible in public school for years.
We've lost prayer in schools since the Supreme Court decision in what... 1962?
Children not allowed to pray in school?
How unthinkable.
Well, we're part of a society that, for the most part, lives without Christ and His Word.
Oh my.
And what's worse, people are beginning to rely on their own goodness to achieve salvation, as if they could earn their way to heaven when it's a free gift from God through Christ.
It's, it's just the sign of the times.
This is wrong.
Last evening, something very shocking occurred.
I attended a movie with a group from the church.
And the person up on the screen blasphemed the name of the Lord.
Unfortunately, that happens all the time.
Oh, I know because I used to be in the film industry.
As a player up there on the screen?
As an actor? No.
No, I was as a booking agent for a theatre chain.
I was making all kinds of money, the whole package.
But I was miserable inside... empty.
And then one day, an old girlfriend of mine came by the office and we were talking.
And I told her how I felt, and she told me that she felt the same way before she became a Christian.
That she accepted
Christ in her life and committed to follow Him.
And she was so happy!
Oh, she also said that her life had real meaning now that she had Christ at the center of it.
There was something about her, something I wanted.
The peace, the joy...
So, I started reading the Bible again.
I could remember some of the Bible stories from when I was a kid in Sunday School.
And I always believed in God, but I didn't have a clue who Jesus Christ was.
Or that he had died for my sins.
It's a... it's a good thing God is patient.
I finally asked
Jesus into my heart and I've never looked back.
And then I met a godly man, and married him, and came to work at this library 18 years ago.
My husband and I never could have our own children, but this work here has been a real ministry for me.
It's given me so many opportunities to talk to people about Christ.
Bravo, Mrs. Bain.
Oh... Well, I say all of that because when it comes to the film industry,
I've been there and know the powerful and influential it is to society.
I believe that secular entertainment is one of the biggest tools that Satan uses to mislead people.
He, he desensitizes us through it.
Murder, violence, sexual immorality, you name it; sin has slowly but surely become acceptable to us, because we see it all the time, so it, it's no longer shocking to us.
But, why were these things ever allowed?
Well, frankly I think that Satan's smarter than we give him credit for.
And he's very deceptive.
When the movie industry started back in the 30's, it was moralistic for the most part.
There was a censor board that regulated what could and could not be shown on the screen.
And movie makers were very careful about what they were portraying.
And that's when the people didn't realize that the devil won his greatest victory.
His greatest victory? How so?
Because he got the name and the person of Jesus Christ out of the movies.
I mean the morals were there for awhile, but the Lord Himself was not.
And as people became more liberated with their views, there seemed to be less and less conviction.
Because there was no absolute authority.
And that is why people can curse the name of the Lord and they don't even think about it.
But how can these movie makers so mock the Lord?
Do they not understand that He is the one who has created them and gives them their every breath?
Mr. Carlisle, it says in the Bible that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
If people don't hold reverence for the Lord, what can we expect?
Excuse me, sir.
Is this where we meet for the visitations?
This is the place.
The visitations, where we speak with people interested in knowing more about the church and our Lord.
That's right, this is it.
Excuse me.
Okay people, we're about to get started, we have several names here tonight...
Excuse me, these are the volunteers?
Yeah, actually this is a pretty good turnout.
You're welcome to join us.
Thank you.
Okay people, we have several names so let's pass them around and see if there's anybody you know first...
Where is everyone?
This is Tom.
You're working late.
Well, no later than you.
Yeah, but I get overtime.
I hear you. What's up?
I don't know.
Carlisle published some religious books his seminary endorsed.
He had one called
"Science and the Bible,".
"Interpretation of Scripture,"
"The Changing Times," a couple of others.
There's also an article that talked about some of his colleagues from the seminary.
There's a Dr. Wiseman, Dr.
Anderson, a Dr. Henry...
Wait, wait, wait, a Dr.
Anderson?
Yeah, Dr. Norris Anderson.
My wife told me Carlisle asked her if she had ever read the writings of a guy name Anderson published in the late 1800's.
You know what it's beginning to look like?
I think this guy might have taken on the identity of this Professor Carlisle.
Yeah, but what's his agenda Rex?
I mean, why's he only here for a couple more days?
And where's he going?
I don't know.
I could pull him in for some questioning.
No... you know what?
I just came up with something.
Okay, it says on this visitation card that this family is real interested in joining the church so this one should be easy.
Just let me do all the talking.
Shall we pray first before we enter?
Nah, no need to.
I mean we already prayed back at the church, right?
And Bobby ran and ducked just in time...
Oh, Bobby...
And the church has lots of sports programs, you know physical activities, keep you in shape.
You know what they say, "The body is the temple of the Lord"!
Right!
We've got church volleyball teams, basketball teams, and softball.
Some of the guys wanna start a church golf league in the summer.
Jerry, you'd like that.
Oh, you're a golfer, Jer?
He loves to golf.
Well, there you go!
And we have great programs for the kids.
Twice a year, big trips like to Six Flags, major league ball games...
Sorry, excuse me.
William, William please turn the television down right now.
Thank you. Sorry.
Like I said, we've got great programs for the kids.
Twice a year we have big trips like to Six Flags, major league ball games.
Two years ago, our high school group went to Disney World.
William... I said NOW!
Sorry.
Now on Wednesday nights while the adults meet in the worship center, we have the kids get together, sorta like a kids' club.
You know, they play games, they sing songs.
There's lots of snacks and refreshments for them.
With kids their own age, their own age group.
That's great!
My son would love that.
He loves to play games...
Hello, William.
Hey.
Oh, my... Oh my my my!
What?
What is this couple doing?!
HEY! What are you doing, mister?
I cannot fathom that this young married couple would kiss in front of a child!
What is becoming of them?
They're not married.
They're just actors in a show.
Not married?
Come on, mister! Get out of the way!
Everything alright, Carlisle?
Lord.
Forgive me, I was wrong.
I was wrong...
Sorry I'm late.
What's up?
I just ran into Carlisle.
Just now?
About an hour ago, downtown.
Really?
I trailed him for awhile, he never saw me.
Okay, did you see anything unusual?
No, not really.
He just went in and out of a bunch of stores.
Did he buy anything?
Yeah, bought a book at a Christian Bookstore, but I didn't get a good look at it.
Did you see him talk to anybody, approach anybody?
No, nobody in particular.
I tell you what, though, this guy acts like he's never seen anything before.
I mean, he takes the longest time looking at the simplest things.
I can't figure out what he's up to.
Did you set it up with Pastor Burton?
Yes, he will be speaking at the service tonight.
Good.
Maybe we'll get some more insight as to what's going on.
You know what Rex?
I think it's time we had a little talk with Dr. Carlisle before the service.
Hello again, I am here to see Mrs.
Bain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle.
She unexpectedly had to go to the state office this morning.
In fact, she won't be back until Friday.
Oh. I see.
But she wanted me to tell you that she enjoyed meeting you and to give her best to Norris and to have a safe journey.
And then, she has in brackets,
"wherever that may be".
She said you would understand.
Yes I do.
Please give Mrs. Bain my kindest regards and tell her that I enjoyed meeting with her, as well.
And that it has been... most educational.
She will know what I mean.
I'll tell her.
Thank you. Good day.
Learn about the past.
What is this?
Ah, it's our microfiche computer program.
Micro, fiche?
Microfiche.
It's a specially programmed computer where we have scanned in all the old newspaper articles in the city's history.
It's a great way for people to discover the past.
Why it certainly would be.
Would it be too much to ask for someone to assist me in its usage, perhaps?
No, not at all.
I'll get Greg to help you.
Ok, here it is.
Grace Bible Seminary.
Is this what you want?
Yes, this is it!
Alright, so you scroll down through the articles like this.
This is amazing.
Have you not ever seen one of these before?
I mean, it works just like a computer.
Just like a computer... of course!
Faculty... click...
Stop!
That's Dr. Norris Anderson!
I know him!
What do you mean "you know him"?
It says right here this guy was born in 1819...
That means he'd be dead.
I mean, I knew of him.
Brilliant Bible Scholar that he is... was.
Okay... you can search for your names and subjects by typing it in here.
Hit the return key, and it does the rest for you.
Type in any name?
Right.
I think I have it.
Thank you so much for your assistance.
Alright.
Look, you need anymore help, you just ask.
I'll be around.
Thank you.
No, it is not for us to know.
Oh, Mr. Carlisle.
Do you mind if we have a word with you?
How may I assist you gentlemen?
Well, we found out about that little experiment you're working on.
Is this so?
Yes, see Rex here does all the background checks for the city police.
Yes, and I did some checking up on you.
May I ask what you gentlemen have against me?
As I firmly believe you truly do not know why I am here.
Well, maybe you could enlighten us.
I'm afraid, Detective, if I were to "enlighten" you, you would never believe me.
Oh, come on, Carlisle, why don't you tell us what the big secret is?
I am not at liberty to disclose my purpose for being here, but I assure you it is altogether harmless and perfectly legal.
Well, we're gunna find out what's going on.
You know that, don't you?
If you will excuse me gentlemen.
Hey, Carlisle.
Does the date June 23,
1865 mean anything to you?
Or what about the names of a Dr.
Wiseman,
Dr. Henry, Dr. Anderson?
Those guys friends of yours?
On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
All other ground is sinking sand.
Would you please be seated?
I want to thank you for coming to our Wednesday night service.
It's great to see all of you.
As you know, we will be voting on some important decisions regarding our building program tonight, but, before we do so, I first would like to introduce a special visitor with us this evening.
This gentleman is a seminary professor and is visiting us from afar, and so I asked him to share a few words with us this evening.
Afterwards, we will continue with our business at hand.
So, will you please welcome Dr.
Russell Carlisle.
Thank you, Pastor.
And good evening.
I must admit, I was very surprised when Pastor asked me to speak with you.
I am not quite sure why I, in particular, was chosen for the occasion, but I will see this as an opportunity from our Lord to share with you some matters that have been pressing on my heart.
Friends, I have been away for quite sometime.
A very long time.
It would be truthful to say that I have been living as if in another culture.
A culture much simpler than the one I have been observing here.
This is not to say we do not have problems where I have come from.
We do.
We know that all people are born with a sinful nature and that all of us like sheep have gone astray from the Lord our God.
AMEN.
However, let me say that the lifestyle
I have been observing here these past few days has been, at the very least, startling.
In the third chapter of Paul's second letter to Timothy,
Paul warns us about the last days.
In verses one through five, the Scriptures say that in the last days men will be selfish, proud, without natural affection for one another, unthankful, unholy, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.
The list goes on.
From what I have seen, the state that this society is now in, reminds me of the days of Noah just prior to entering the arc.
And of Lot, and
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Sin appears to be as blatant and as open now as it was then.
Surely these must be the last days that Paul is referring to, and the second coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ is imminent.
Please do not misunderstand me, friends.
I am not setting myself on a higher moral position than anyone else here tonight.
I, too, have failed my Lord in many ways.
In fact, I feel partly to blame.
In these last few days I have come to realize how wrong I was in thinking that we could reform society through the teachings of the Lord, without the Lord of the teachings.
The Lord God, who created all things, appears to have been eliminated from your schools, your government, businesses.
Attacked in the arts, and in your entertainment.
And through these amazing inventions of the radio, television, and the movies, the devil has mightily planted sinful thoughts and ideas, and alternatives in the minds of the people.
So much so that Jesus
Christ, and what He did, and what He stands for, and who He is... has been lost.
My friends, I urge you this evening, as I have personally done this past week, to first reconsider your own relationship with God through Christ.
Please be abundantly clear that you have truly submitted yourself to Jesus and received Him into your life as your personal
Lord and Saviour.
We know that Jesus will not save any man He cannot command.
And, if you are playing a game of pretend with the Lord tonight, if you know deep in your heart you have never truly submitted to Him, or if you're unsure of your standing with Christ, now is the time to make yourself right with God by calling out to Christ.
Jesus died for our sins and to save our souls from the eternal suffering that is to come.
One final judgement will come upon mankind and all those who do not come under the covering of Christ.
And of the Christians present here this evening, let us take this time to renew our purpose and commitment to be a people who shall live for Christ and to tell others of His enduring act of love.
I apologize for speaking so soberly this evening, but these are the things that are in my heart and I'm afraid will remain with me for a long, long time.
The truth is, is that all of us will live forever.
And we will either spend eternity in the presence of our Lord or in a place of darkness the Bible calls the Lake of Fire.
If you have not, please give your life to
Jesus Christ right now.
Your eternity will depend on it.
I have said enough.
Pastor?
Well, uh, thank you, Dr.
Carlisle.
I'm sure that we will take what you've said to heart.
Alright, then.
As the men prepare to pass out the voting materials, um, why don't we all stand together and sing another hymn.
How about "Amazing Grace," hmm?
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now, am found.
Was blind, but now I see.
I am leaving you now, Eddie.
Okay, Preacher.
You take care.
I would like to leave this fine suit with you.
That's really nice of you, but, uh,
I don't think it's gunna fit me.
You're a big hombre.
I know, Eddie.
I was hoping someone else might have some use for it.
Oh. Well yeah, yeah.
Eddie'll find somebody who can use it.
I also brought you this.
A Bible, huh?
Yes, God's Holy Word.
That's alright, Preacher...
Hey, will you look at this?
It's in Spanish!
Please read it, Eddie.
Wow... yeah, I'll read it.
May I have your word, Eddie?
If Eddie Martinez tell you he's gunna do something, he's gunna do something.
Now I'm gunna read this.
I believe you, Eddie.
May the Lord speak to you.
Yeah, Preacher, you're a good egg.
Via con Dios.
Eddie, there is something
I must tell you.
Jesus is coming back soon to set up his earthly Kingdom.
The requirement, though, to enter this Kingdom is that we must be absolutely perfect and without sin.
Well, that leaves me out of that party.
No one is without sin, Eddie, not one; all of us face eternal judgment, and separation from God.
This is why we must receive Jesus Christ into our life as Lord.
He is the only one who lived a perfect life and thus became the substitute for our sins.
For me too?
Yes, for you too.
He rose from the dead, proving He was God and He wants to save us from the penalty of our sins and give us eternal life.
But we must first individually receive Him, Eddie.
This is what it means to believe in Jesus.
Wow, you know, no one ever quite explained it to me like that before.
God wants us to be reconciled to himself.
So much so that He gave His only son to die for us.
It is all in this book, Eddie.
I pray that you will consider what I am saying.
Yeah...
Good night, Eddie.
Hey Preacher.
Hey listen, I gotta confess to you somethin'...
You know earlier when
I gave you my word that I was gunna read this book?
Well... I was lying.
But that was before.
Now I give you my word from my heart, that I'm gonna to read this book.
God bless you Eddie.
Genesis.
En el placiblio...
Come on Norris! Hurry!
Carlisle!
In a hurry to go somewhere?
Gentlemen, do not come any closer.
You must leave here immediately!
There's not much time!
Not much time for what?
I'm afraid I'm not allowed to explain, but you must leave immediately!
Look we've had enough of your little secrets, Carlisle.
I want the truth and I want it now!
Gentlemen, I highly advise you to leave this area at once!
I'm taking you downtown for some questioning unless you tell us what's going on right now.
I appreciate your concern gentlemen, but you must understand,
I have not hurt anyone, nor do I intend to.
Now, please, for your own safety...
We're not leaving, Carlisle.
But there is not much time!
You keep saying that.
Not much time for what?
For Jesus.
Jesus is coming.
Jesus is coming.
Yes. Yes, I believe
Jesus is coming, and it's any moment now.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far?
Look, that's enough, Carlisle.
You're coming downtown.
No, you see gentlemen,
I am a messenger sent from the Lord!
A messenger from the Lord?
Yes, and I have been sent to warn you that Jesus is coming!
Look, Carlisle, don't make us use force.
Gentlemen, as I have said, Jesus is coming.
Look!! It's TIME!!
I think we just missed the Rapture.
Norris! You're still here!!
Oh, thank the Lord!
Yes, my friend.
You've only been gone for a few moments.
Norris, the future.
Oh my heavens, where does one begin?
It is incredible!
But, sin abounds!
The Lord is not feared.
Morals have replaced Christ, and with liberal teachings.
The families are in disarray, no authority, no respect.
The world lives without Jesus while the Church seems to be filled with professing Christians who do not follow the Lord they claim they believe.
Yes, it appeared to be this way.
I was wrong in my thinking.
Very wrong, Norris.
To separate the authority of Jesus from His teachings is, indeed, deadly.
As I have just witnessed the end result.
Yes, it would lead many astray.
I am so sorry I doubted you, my friend.
It took great courage to do what you did and I am forever grateful.
Remember Russell, I had the advantage.
I had already seen the future.
This machine is... truly amazing.
We have been given a great privilege.
We must use it for good.
Yes, indeed.
Well, I have some crucial re-writing to do, sir.
I understand.
Norris?
I believe I was witnessing the last days.
Did you ever see how far this machine would send someone into the future?
I figured traveling into the future over a hundred years would be about as much change as we could endure.
But, to directly answer your question, no, no I have not.
Please excuse my tardiness, gentlemen.
Well, Dr. Carlisle, nice of you to join us.
Dr. Butler.
Yes. We were beginning to wonder.
Dr. Wiseman.
And my sincerest apologies, Dean.
Dr. Carlisle.
Gentlemen, I have asked for another meeting as I would like you to please read through revisions
I have made to the manuscript.
I've already informed the publisher that these changes were necessary.
And I look forward to meeting with you at your earliest convenience.
Dr. Carlisle, are these revisions a result of your conversations with Dr.
Anderson?
This is the result of the Lord opening my eyes a little more to His glorious truth, sir.
Very well then.
We'll all review the changes and call another meeting.
Thank you, sir.
And good day, gentlemen.
Good day...
Dr. Carlisle?
I notice you've changed the title of your book to,
"Time Changer".
Yes, sir.
I believe that times must change, or time as we know it will end.
Good day gentlemen.
Roger?
Yes?
Please come here for a moment.
I have a small gift for you.
A gift.
Yes. Please come.
Here you are, your very own marbles to play with.
Thank you sir.
We should also be properly introduced.
I know your name is Roger, and my name is Mr. Carlisle.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlisle.
The pleasure is mine.
There is something else I wanted to say to you, Roger.
Last week, when I scolded you about stealing the marbles,
I told you that stealing is wrong, and it is.
But, I neglected to tell you the person who said that stealing is wrong.
Jesus commands us not to steal from each other.
Do you know who Jesus is?
Not exactly.
No one has ever explained to you about Jesus and what He did.
No sir.
Well then, I have some very exciting news for you, Roger.
Jesus is our God.
He is the one who has created us and gives us life and our every breath.
He came to this earth almost 1900 years ago for a very specific task.
He wants to enable us to live forever with Him in Heaven...
Norris, I believe
I was witnessing the last days...
Did you ever see how far this machine would send someone into the future?
Martial law is in effect, under the command of Duke Red.
Abandon your weapons and surrender.
I repeat...
... the coup d'état has failed.
Martial law is in effect, under the command of Duke Red.
Abandon your weapons and surrender.
Ken-ichi!
Hey! Ken-ichi!
Uncle!
You're safe! That's great!
Are you all right?
This? It's nothing!
Who's this?
Her name's Tima.
We escaped from that fire together.
Tima, this is my uncle.
'Uncle'...
Atlas!
It... was... a... trap!
We meet at last.
Don't move!
No trouble.
Give me the girl, and you might get back home alive.
Don't make promises you won't keep, Rock!
Don't play games with me!
Tima! Pick up the gun!
I'll have that back, please.
Don't give it to him!
You going to shoot?
I'm human, you know.
Rock!
So it's these people you've neglected your duties...
...to go chasing after...
Tima!
It's you!
Rock!
What's going on here?!
You told me no one survived the fire in Dr Laughton's lab!
And how did you know about Tima?
Answer me!
I will.
You are the one who must sit on the Throne of Power.
No robot must ever rule...
...the Ziggurat, and Metropolis!
Fool!
'Robot'?
Do you think you fool me?
You're out of line, boy!
Get up!
I never want to see you again!
Ken-ichi!
So it was you who hired Laughton!
What if I did?
I've come from Japan to arrest Laughton.
My name is Shunsaku Ban...
Get in.
And Ken-ichi?
You'll see him later.
I'm here to see
Superintendent Notarlin.
He's been transferred.
His successor hasn't been named.
There's been a mistake. The Malduks have taken my nephew away...
Handle it through your embassy!
At this moment our state extends its reach to the stars!
I tremble at the honor of announcing...
... the culmination of humanity's long history of intellect and science.
Saké.
Make it hot.
Hot whisky or gin I can do, for a Japanese detective.
Hot whisky, then.
Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat?!
And those Malduks can eat dogshit!
Here.
Hey! That was Rock!
I heard he quit the party.
What's he doing here?
Thanks.
Take care.
Whoops!
Um...
...a man earlier tonight asked me to give you this.
I said 'no'.
He wanted it kept secret from Duke Red, and of course...
...I said I couldn't possibly, but... his name was 'Ken-ichi'.
'I can't move at the moment, so I can't...
'... come to you.
'I'm leaving the country soon.
'I want to see you again.'
Ken-ichi!
What's going on here?
You will bring her back soon, won't you?
I'll be in real trouble if they ever find out.
Don't worry. This won't take long.
This wasn't my idea.
I have to get back.
You tricked me.
How else could I talk to you?
Where's Ken-ichi?
If you know, take me to him.
Well, well, well...
To talk to you, you'd never guess you were a robot.
I guess Father chose his mad scientist very well.
What are you talking about?
You being a robot.
That's not true. I'm not a robot.
So what are you? Human?
So who's your father? Where is he?
My father...
...is Ken-ichi.
The super-being?
A mannequin like you?!
If you can't take me to Ken-ichi,
I'm going.
Tima's gone?!
Watch where you're going!
Let's see inside this super-being
Father wants so much.
Come on, Laughton!
N- n-notebook...
That notebook?
Don't be alarmed.
I taught Rock a lesson he won't forget.
Where's Ken-ichi?
I'm looking for him, too.
I need your help for that.
You do?
I think they've got him somewhere in the Ziggurat.
I need to look for him...
...on the Ziggurat's data network.
Can you do that?
Hold out your hand.
Ken-ichi!
Well?
Ken-ichi's in...
...that building!
You did it! I knew he was there!
What happened to me?
I see... you don't know who you are, do you.
What do you mean?
I'll report the instant we find anything, sir.
Duke Red?
Yeah.
Anything?
We can track the signal...
...by where it burned out the splitters.
Got it!
Where?
Zone 1, South Block 1 7.
The Hotel Coconut.
Tell me, please! Am I human, or am I...
Well, you're different...
...from normal robots.
I'm human.
Just like Ken-ichi!
Uh, yes... of course you are!
Anyway, now we've got to rescue Ken-ichi.
Tima! I've been looking for you!
Tell me what's going on, or I'll charge you with kidnapping!
I'm not your man.
It's your son you want to talk to.
Huh? Rock?
I don't know what the plan is...
...but I suspect Dr Laughton was involved in it somehow.
And I suspect you had him killed...
...to keep her a secret.
Take him away.
Come on!
That is a special throne made especially for you.
One day from here you will rule the entire world!
Me?
Why?
That is your destiny.
I'll show you.
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Wake up, Ken-ichi!
It's me! Can you hear me?
Ken-ichi... Ken-ichi?
What have you done to him?!
He's in no danger. We just had to quiet him down a little.
Ken-ichi? Ken-ichi?
I'll file a protest with my embassy!
It'll be an international incident!
Oh? I didn't realize you were so politically important.
My apologies.
But soon every nation in the world will bow down before Tima.
Make Ken-ichi the way he was.
What's one or two young kids, Tima?
You have the power to rule the world!
What power is that?
Am I human?
Or am I one of those poor robots?
Oh, don't be silly!
You're nothing like those piles of junk!
Then am I human, like Ken-ichi?
What are you saying?!
You're no mere human being...
...ruled by emotion and feeling, torn between morality and love!
You are the super-being!
So then I am a...
I've brought you new clothes,
Miss Tima.
Yes, you are a robot...
...but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence!
No. I have the emotions and love that you hate.
That's because your full capacities haven't yet taken form.
As your abilities evolve...
...they're simply taking the form of emotion and love.
In time...
You will become one with that throne, a computer weapon meant on conquest!
Your memories and emotions will all be erased!
How did you know that?!
I fancy myself a detective.
Come, Miss Tima.
You should change.
Father... open your eyes!
Rock!
What on earth?!
What are you doing?!
It is you who must sit on that throne.
You are the leader we must bow to!
No!
Tima!
You're awake?
I am a humanoid... a machine made to destroy the world...
Not 'destroy'! 'Make again'!
Stop!
Ken-ichi...
Hey!
Who threw that switch?!
It just started up!
Cut the power!
It won't respond!
It's going into the red!
Dr Ponkotz!
What's that alarm?!
The omotanium generator's going wild!
What's going on!?
I'm not sure...
Stop, Tima!
You'll destroy the Ziggurat!
This comes of trifling with robots.
Her memory's merging with the data network! She'll go mad!
Thus God destroyed the Tower of Babel...
Tima!
No! She's no longer the Tima you knew!
All right.
The omotanium generator will explode if we don't shut it down!
The chance of human survival...
...will fall to 30 per cent within one hour.
My entire world-wide network of forces...
...will be completely activated within 30 minutes.
Their targets are the world's major cities...
...and 7,586 other facilities.
Estimated time period...
...for eradication of humanity by biological warfare:
1 7 hours, 27 minutes.
Hear that, Duke Red?
Your super-being says she doesn't need us!
Tima!
Come back!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Ken-ichi!
Tima!
Tima!
Tima!
Doctor! We've lost control of the underground power pl...
What's happening?!
Get out! You robots are not supposed to be here!
Tima! It's me!
Ken-ichi!
It's Ken-ichi!
Stop!
The likes of you...
...will never kill...
...my father!
Rock!
Tima!
Tima!
Tima! Grab my hand!
I'm Ken-ichi.
Who are you?
'Who are you. '
No, no, no... you call yourself'I'.
Ken-ichi!
Grab on!
I am... who?
Tima!!!
Where did you find this?
Fifi?
Fifi!
Ken-ichi!
Uncle!
Uncle...
...I think I'd like to stay here a bit longer.
I am... who?
[CHIMP CHATTERS]
You lose.
Again.
I changed your flight sequence.
That's enough.
Pay attention.
Pericles, stop! Or no treat!
How well do I know you?
Hey, there you are.
Was the homo sapien mean to you?
We all know it's just rocket envy.
-Ever consider a boyfriend?
-Do I enjoy being miserable?
-I'll stick with my chimps.
LEO: Hey.
-I'm teaching him.
-You're teasing him.
He's gene-spliced, chromosome- enhanced. He can handle it.
When you frustrate them, they lose focus. They even get violent.
Hey, Pericles, you're gonna be a daddy.
-Thought I saw a smirk on his face.
-The female was the aggressor.
Hey, Leo. You got a postcard.
Leo!
It's been two years.
When are you coming home?
Not too quick.
I'm enjoying that apartment.
-No, we miss you!
-Are you flying yet?
-Or are the chimps doing the work?
- We got something to tell you.
When you gonna make that kind of commitment--
MAN 1 : Captain Davidson, report to the bridge.
FRANK : Found it.
HANSEN: It's moving like a storm.
It is. It's an electromagnetic storm.
LEO: The digital clocks are stopped.
MARIA: It's beautiful.
-So is the sun till you get close.
HANSEN: This is weird.
HANSEN: I hear frequency patterns.
-Tune them in.
HANSEN: It's electronic communication from Earth, from all time.
HANSEN:
The storm's bouncing it back to us.
We'll start with a pass through the core.
T ake radiation gamma-ray reading.
Get your monkey ready.
Sir, this is a waste of time.
We have standard procedures--
-l' m aware of the procedures, but--
-No manned flights.
We send an ape. If it's safe, we talk about a pilot.
Why don't you just allow me to do my job?
He's the canary, that's the coal mine.
He launches at 1 6:00.
Just follow your sequence and come home. Understand? Home.
VASICH: Stand by. Alpha pod launch in 30 seconds.
VASICH: Chart his course to the eye of the storm.
LEO:
Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.
LEO:
Activate reading systems.
LEO:
Ignition.
VASICH: Have him start taking perimeter readings.
-What's wrong?
-He's off-course.
Lock on him.
He can't respond, sir.
-There's a surge in the heart rate.
-Light him up again.
I can't.
He's gone.
He's trained to come back.
You think he's still alive?
-Sir--
-For now, we just sit tight and wait.
I'm gonna run some sequences to see what he did wrong.
HANSEN: The signal is breaking up.
VASlCH: He must be panicking.
ALEXANDER:
He'll return to the Oberon.
HANSEN:
I can 't hold him.
VASICH:
That's it, we lost him.
FRANK: Wanna send up another chimp?
-It's too dangerous.
VASICH:
I won 't waste another pod.
VASICH:
Shut down launch operations.
Sir?
Delta pod has launched.
Your flight is not authorized!
I' m going to get my chimp.
VASICH: Bring that thing back here!
Return to base!
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.
I got a visual on Alpha pod.
Oberon, come back!
Oberon, come in!
-l' m getting a mayday, sir.
-Alpha pod?
-I don't know, but it's strong.
VASICH: Put it up.
Mayday! Mayday! Come in!
Request-- We 're going down! Mayday!
Delta pod, abort.
[APES YELL]
This one looked at me.
T ake your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!
GORILLA BOY 1 :
Stinking humans!
GORILLA BOY 2:
You guys smell!
Hey, where am l?
What is this place?
Here! I'm open! Come on!
Dribble it down! Take it!
GORILLA 3:
Make way! Clear the path!
GORILLA BOY 4:
Get the humans!
GORILLA BOY 2:
You guys smell!
GORILLA BOY 4:
Take this!
GORILLA BOY 1 : Stupid human!
ARI: Stop it!
-Who said to throw stones at humans?
-My father.
Well, he's wrong.
-And you can tell him I said so.
-Human-lover.
GORILLA 5:
Move along!
Are you trying to put me out of business?
These are the skankiest, scabbiest...
...scuzziest humans I've ever seen.
-You don't want them?
-I'll take the whole lot.
I must be out of my mind.
I'll have to make it up on volume.
All right, get them out...
...and get them clean! Chop, chop!
Let's go!
Keep it moving!
Come on! Hurry up!
LIMBO: Gentlemen to the left!
Ladies to the right, please!
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
Very touching. I can't see for the tears in my eyes.
Come on. That one's crawling with lice.
Check the teeth on that little one. Nice.
Stay back. Back!
Get in there!
Move! You too!
How many times have I told you to wear gloves when you handle humans?
You normally hack off a limb, Limbo.
Yes, general. That's true.
LIMBO: Unfortunately, they're worth more intact.
Keep your eye on this one.
He's feisty.
Were these the ones raiding the orchards?
I know an old country remedy that never fails.
You gut one human, and you string the carcass up.
The Human Rights faction is on me already.
Do-gooders. Who needs them?
I' m for free speech as long as they...
...keep their mouths shut.
My niece wants one for her birthday.
Excellent. The little ones make wonderful pets.
But be sure you get rid of it by puberty.
One thing you don't want in your house, it's a human teenager.
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.
That one.
Oh, isn't she pretty.
I'll get that for you, sir.
And I have a pretty new collar...
...just for you.
Compliments of the house.
You stink of humans.
It's disgusting the way we treat humans.
It demeans us as much as them.
Ari, let's go.
Get them marked!
I got orders to fill!
Next!
Not you again.
I can't stand by while humans are being mistreated and tortured.
The only reason I put up with your nonsense is because of your father!
You want me to stop?
Give up the business.
Hey, I do the job that nobody else wants!
I don't see you bleeding-hearts spending all day...
...with these dangerous, dirty, dumb beasts.
They can be taught to live with us as equals.
I'm gonna prove it.
LIMBO:
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Stay back.
Well, now there's your proof.
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.
Help me.
Please.
Please help me.
You're giving me such a headache.
I don't need this aggravation!
Sell him to me.
Are you crazy? He's wild.
They're both wild.
Then I'll buy them both.
That would be expensive.
That would be...
...very, very expensive.
I'm sure we can...
...you know, come to a deal.
You know?
Deliver them to my house.
SANDAR:
Semos, help me!
Rise when your master enters.
Wild humans...
...in my house.
This one seems different.
How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other!
My guests are here.
Keep the savage ones out of sight.
Especially from General Thade!
SANDAR:
You'd better be nice to him!
And wash your hands before dinner.
Senator, good evening.
Dear, you look lovely tonight.
But I'm having a bad hair day.
Yet, she spends a fortune grooming.
And I'm worth every penny.
Would you like to freshen up?
We're fine.
-How'd these monkeys get like this?
-How else would they be?
-They'd be begging me for a treat.
-What tribe are you from?
U.S. Air Force. I'm going back to it.
Finish your work.
Please, everyone sit.
We just returned from our country house.
-How was it?
-Boring.
I find it relaxing being away from the bustle of the city.
NOVA:
There was no place to go.
Nothing but trees and rocks.
-All you did was nap.
-Exactly.
Time away from politics...
...is what I needed.
We'd lose ourselves for days in the forest when we were young.
Now I can barely climb a tree.
T rite but true:
"Youth is wasted on the young. "
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?
Living with your daughter would age any ape quickly.
SANDAR:
You've been a stranger lately.
I apologize for my lateness, senator.
I stopped to see my father.
-How's my old friend?
-Slipping, I'm afraid.
I'd like to see him more, but these are troubled days.
The humans infest the provinces.
We encroach upon their habitat.
They breed while we grow soft in our affluence.
THADE:
They outnumber us four to one!
Why can't we simply sterilize them all?
The cost would be prohibitive.
Although scientists tell me...
...these humans carry terrible diseases.
How would we know?
The army burns the bodies before they' re examined.
Father?
At times, perhaps, the senate feels that the army has been...
...a tad extreme.
Extremism in defense of apes is no vice, senator!
Your ideas threaten our prosperity!
The human problem can't be solved with money!
We tried that once, and all we got was...
...a welfare state that nearly broke us.
I think the city has about as much diversity as I can handle.
This garment was made by one of my humans.
And can you deny the skill?
Obviously, they' re capable of a real culture.
Everything in the human culture takes place below the waist.
Bow your heads!
We give thanks for the fruit of the land.
Bless us, holy father, who created all apes in his image.
Hasten the day when you will return and bring peace to your children.
-Amen.
GROUP: Amen.
Next you'll be telling us these beasts have a soul.
Of course they do.
The senator's daughter flirts with blasphemy.
Is there a soul in there?
Do you have a towel?
I've lost my appetite.
I' m bored by these society dinners.
-I came to see you.
-Oh, how sweet.
You've wasted your time.
My feelings haven't changed.
I still care about you.
You only care about my father's influence. And your own ambition.
I know about the trouble you caused today.
-I could have you arrested.
-I'd do it again.
You feel so much for these humans...
...yet you feel nothing for me.
A moment, sir.
What is it?
We found something.
We think you should see it.
There's a curfew.
If they see you, they kill you.
You stay here, you're already dead.
Can you take me to where we were caught?
Not without my family.
APE 1 :
This is where I saw it.
THADE:
Go on.
APE 2: Something fell from the sky with wings of fire.
APE 2: There was a thunderous sound and the ground itself shook.
-You weren't dreaming this?
-lt was no dream, sir.
Look.
-You told no one?
APE 1 : No, sir.
APE 1 :
We had to come right to you.
You did exactly the right thing.
You smell that?
Don't start now. We're off-duty.
And I'm starving.
You're hurt.
How did you get away?
-Who are you?
-Somebody trying to get out.
She promised to take me back.
This is a house-human.
He thinks he's better than us.
Hey!
We'll go together.
[APES LAUGH]
[APES CHATTER]
[APES CHATTER]
[NOVA SCREAMS]
Good night, little girl.
[SCREAMS]
You go this way.
The rest of you, come with me.
ATTAR:
Send a squad to the north gate! Hurry!
Wait! Someone's coming.
You're lucky I found you first.
Come on. I can reason with them.
-We know how apes reason.
-How can we escape?
Don't get involved with these humans.
Why did you help me?
Why would you take that chance?
Because...
...you're not usual.
Show me a way out. I'll show you something that will change your world.
Trust me.
When I was little...
...I used to sneak outside the city, where no one could find me.
I can show you.
If we're caught, no one can protect us!
Trust me.
What about her?
-A human child won't survive.
-Bon can take her. Hide her at home.
Check every house!
APE 1 : Have you seen any humans?
-No.
Hurry!
-Father.
-I'll be right beside you.
Come on!
No!
BIRN:
Stop!
[GROANS]
-Where are the other humans?
-Through the tunnels.
When you find them, kill them all.
Except for the troublemaker.
I want to talk to him before he dies.
Sir, the senator's daughter is with them.
-They took her?
-She's helping them. I saw her myself.
She had no choice.
They threatened her life.
I'll report to the Senate. They'll beat their chests and ask for my help.
They are weak without you, sir.
-Your dad was brave.
-What do you know?
[SHRlEKS]
Let me go.
Thade will come soon.
We can still go back.
I can't now.
That's where I flew in.
You did that?
No, my retroburners.
-I'm sure he'll explain.
-He can't explain what can't exist.
Talking monkeys can't exist.
Apes.
Monkeys are further down the evolutionary ladder.
Just above humans.
Calm down, will you?
[SHRlEKS]
-What's wrong?
-Afraid of water. Apes can't swim.
We drown.
That's why every day we pray for rain.
How long can a human hold its breath underwater?
Thought you were afraid of water.
Two dead monkey--
Apes down at the bottom.
Someone else knows you' re here.
-What's that?
-A frequency with...
... my ship so I can talk to them.
It talks?
With radio waves.
Sorcery.
Not sorcery, science.
I have contact.
They' re already here.
They must be waiting for me.
LEO: lt'll lead us to them.
We' re in control now.
We' re the 800-pound gorilla.
Who are you?
Captain Leo Davidson.
Pilot, U.S. Air Force.
-From planet Earth.
-Your apes let you fly?
They live in zoos and do what we say.
This is hostile.
I got 36 hours...
...to find my friends and I'm out of this nightmare.
What happens to us?
Where do we go?
You go nowhere. He belongs to me!
Stop!
You, I've had enough of!
Take it easy, little fella.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I wouldn't hurt my property.
But I'll make an exception.
No harm done. Come here, kid.
Come here.
You're not hurt, right? You're young.
Oh, these kids.
They bounce right back.
Play dead.
-Kill him.
-Slave trader.
You kill him, you lower yourself to his level.
Exactly.
She is extremely smart.
I've heard her talk about apes and humans.
"Separate but equal. "
"T o each his own. "
Something like that. Right?
LIMBO:
Whatever it is, I agree.
Can't we all just get along?
I'm probably just in the way.
So why don't I just get going?
He'll lead them to us.
Then we'll make him our guest.
Cuff him.
Ow! These things hurt.
-What are you doing?
-You could use that against us.
-Who invented that?
-lt was gonna save us.
-We're better off now.
-We?
-You're so difficult.
-Like a slave?
-That's not what--
-Shut up!
That goes for all species.
If ever I thought those humans were capable of kidnapping my daughter--
Don't blame yourself, senator.
You've been compassionate with them.
Look how they've repaid you.
Can you find her?
If you untie my hands.
What do you want?
Declare martial law.
Give me absolute power...
...to rid this planet of humans once and for all.
Now is not the time to be timid or indecisive.
I' m the one who can bring your daughter back alive.
He's not in the city.
We underestimate this human.
I'll hunt him down.
Your father sent me.
You must come quickly.
Warn the outposts.
Don't let the humans pass.
I understand, sir.
Apart from my father,
I rely on you most.
We are not just soldiers.
We are friends.
I'll depend on you.
Yes, sir.
-So many questions I want to ask.
-Me too.
ARI:
These "zoos"--
What are they? This word is not familiar.
-Our last apes are in zoos.
-What happened to them?
Gone.
After we cut down the forests...
...the ones who survived...
...were locked up in cages.
LEO:
Used for scientific experiment.
-That's horrible.
-We do worse to our own kind.
I don't understand.
You seem intelligent.
Smarter we get, the more dangerous our world becomes.
I knew it. You're sensitive.
Uncommon quality in a male.
Why don't your apes object to the way you treat them?
They can't talk.
Maybe they choose not to, given the way you treat them.
Apes in cages. Right.
THADE:
Father.
I don't have much time.
T ell me about this human...
...who troubles you.
I will capture him with little trouble.
No. You're not telling me everything.
You believe he is not born of this world.
Has he come alone?
Yes.
More will come looking for him.
How can you possibly know?
I have something to tell you.
Something my father told me...
...and his father told him.
Back along our bloodlines to Semos.
In the time before time...
...we were the slaves and the humans...
...were the masters.
Impossible.
Break it.
What you hold in your hand is the proof of their power.
Their power of invention.
Their power of technology.
Against this, our strength means nothing.
This has the power of a thousand spears.
I warn you.
Their ingenuity goes hand in hand with their cruelty.
No creature...
...is as devious, as violent.
You must find this human quickly.
Do not let him get to Calima.
The forbidden area?
Calima holds the secret to our true beginnings.
Damn them.
I will stop him, Father.
Damn them.
Damn them all to hell.
What is it?
DAENA:
They' re to keep us away.
LEO:
What's on the other side?
It leads to the sacred ruins at Calima.
-What is that?
-Calima? That's where, well...
...according to our holy writings, creation began.
Where the Almighty breathed life into Semos...
...the first ape.
In the time before time.
It is where Semos will return.
Most educated apes consider such religious notions as fairy tales.
Metaphors we use to explain our origins.
I doubt if there ever really was a Semos.
LEO:
My crew is there, so we' re going.
Doesn't he ever stop?
-They' re scared of water?
-We'll cross somewhere else.
No time. Gets dark, we're going right through.
Semos smiles on me.
I win again.
You win too often.
What's hidden up your sleeve?
All of them.
Cheater!
-Who's in charge here?!
-I am, sir!
-I didn't know--
-This camp is a disgrace.
ATTAR: Some humans have escaped!
-lf they come, we will crush them.
These humans are different.
They travel with apes.
[LAUGHING]
You find this amusing?
No, sir.
I'm assuming command.
This camp will be prepared!
Just grab the reins.
Hold tight. We're gonna cross the river.
Horses are great swimmers.
They'll carry you across.
Good luck. Have a nice ride.
Leave me. I'll only slow you down.
-Letting him go?
-No. He'll ride with us.
No, wait. Wait. This is suicide.
Only a human would think that this could work.
[GASPS]
Hear my prayers, Semos, father of all apes.
[HORSE WHINNIES]
No! No! I'm on your side!
Come on!
[ROARS]
[GASPS]
Come on! We have to swim.
Hey!
I won't let go of you!
Come on!
[GROWLS]
[GROWLS]
No, no, wait. There's no need now.
-Says who?
-Them.
They tried to kill me like
I was nothing but a miserable--
Human?
Ow.
You're hurt.
She was holding on pretty tight.
The soldiers will cross downstream.
We should move quickly!
ATT AR: They crossed the river.
-You didn't stop them?
ATT AR:
Horses carried them.
Horses?
Our horses, sir.
[CHATTERS]
Forgive me, my friend.
I' m not angry with you.
Father was taken from me.
He was a great leader and a direct descendant of Semos.
ATT AR:
Now it's time for you to lead.
Form the divisions.
Form divisions!
[CHATTERS]
Full battle ready!
Sound the call to march!
T omorrow we reach Calima.
He'll stay like that all night.
A soldier, isn't he?
A general. Well, he was until he opposed Thade.
When Thade ruined his career, my father took him in.
He was a great soldier.
Attar was his best pupil.
ARI:
Now they're enemies.
I'd like to see your world.
They'd probably prod you and poke you and throw you in a cage.
You'd protect me.
They think you'll save them.
After you meet your friends, we'll never see you again.
Well, I didn't promise them anything.
No.
You just dropped in from the stars.
They're not here.
LEO:
Hello?
They were never here.
You said they'd come for us.
LEO:
That's impossible.
What is it?
It's my ship.
These ruins are thousands of years old.
I was just here a few days ago.
This is what I was picking up. The Oberon.
ARI:
What are you doing?
It has a power source that lasts forever.
Maybe I can access the ship's visual log.
Then I can figure out what happened.
Mayday! Come in, guidance!
Request instructions!
Going down!
We were searching for a pilot in an electromagnetic storm.
I got pushed forward through time.
We haven 't had any communications since we crashed.
This planet is uncharted, uninhabited.
The apes we 've brought along with us are a lot stronger...
...and a lot smarter...
... than we ever imagined.
Apes are out of control.
One male named Semos...
... who I raised myself, has taken over the group.
We have weapons but I don 't think we 'll last long.
Maybe I saw the truth, but I wouldn 't admit it.
They were good students--
They' re all dead because they looked for me.
We' re alive because of you.
Who are they?
Your story is spreading.
They want to see...
...this human who defies the apes.
Send them all back.
Where? They left their homes to be with you.
I saw them.
How many?
As far as I could see.
Thade has all his legions.
The senate's capitulated.
He answers to no one now.
You' re gonna have to get your people out of here.
They won't listen to me.
This is a fight we can't win.
Break up and scatter.
I'll draw them off.
I'm who they want.
LEO:
All right? Come on!
Let's go!
Let's go!
LEO:
Come on!
You've gotta make them understand.
It's over. No help is coming.
You came.
Stop!
Come closer and identify yourself!
How dare you show your face here?!
It is not my decision.
I wish to speak to Thade.
[SNARLS]
Why have you come?
T o be with you.
A trade?
You' re proposing that?
Yourself for the humans?
Even when you were a child, you took in stray humans.
Your family indulged you.
Look what you've become.
I've been...
...mistaken.
Forgive me.
So you want to be human?
Then wear their mark!
Let her return.
THADE:
She'll die with her friends tomorrow.
We were searching for a pilot in an electromagnetic storm.
We haven 't had any communications since we crashed.
I' m so sorry.
I' m responsible for all of this.
And l' m never going home.
Just like them.
The apes are out of control.
I can't go home, either.
Maybe we' re not so different.
No. We' re very different.
You care about everybody but yourself.
Doesn't matter. Apes, humans.
My planet, your planet.
The universe rewards cruelty with power.
No.
Not always. Not if we fight back.
I' m just not sure how.
Better take care of that.
KRULL:
I respect your courage.
But my advice to you is to put that away...
...and head for the mountains.
There's one possibility.
I want those people behind the ship.
-Not hiding, they need to be seen.
-And us?
You'll be in front. You're the bait.
-I won't move.
-You won't be there.
-I can do this!
-I know. I need you back with them.
We got one shot.
LEO:
Listen!
I got an idea.
We may have a chance.
I need you behind the ship.
Hey, we can win this.
It's been done before. On my planet.
Men have done amazing things in history.
That history belongs to you.
Sometimes even a few can make a difference, okay?
This is the day you've waited for!
You get to stand up to the apes!
Leo!
You know you can't defeat Thade's army.
We might confuse them.
It could give us a chance.
You don't understand Thade.
He'll keep coming for you.
No matter what.
That's what I'm counting on.
Get behind the ship!
LEO:
Get children behind the ship!
Come on, move! Now!
-Let me go.
-No.
-Let me prove I can help!
-I need you here.
Help clear them back.
-What?
-I'm part of this!
-Get back!
-No!
BIRN:
I'm staying!
Send in the first wave.
[ROARS]
Here they come.
Now!
Oh, God.
Come on.
Jesus!
Come on.
Wait.
Now! Go!
With that weapon, we cannot defeat them!
I'm tired of this human.
No! Wait!
My fight is with Thade, not you!
Then your fight is with me!
[ENGINE ROARS]
Semos.
Pericles. A better landing than me.
Sir, the prophecy is true.
Semos has returned to us.
Come on.
Let's go explain evolution to the monkeys.
[PERICLES CHATTERS]
He'll turn us into slaves!
Kill him!
Listen. This is where you're from.
We brought you here. It's true.
We lived in peace together. Semos...
...killed everybody.
He's lying!
Help me!
My friend, kill him!
Everything I have believed is a lie!
ATT AR:
You and your family have betrayed us!
I won't help you anymore.
Ari....
[GRUNTS]
You okay?
You came home.
It's safe.
You can come out now.
What? It's over?
I was just getting ready to make my move.
ATT AR:
We'll leave the graves unmarked.
No one who comes will be able to tell apes from humans.
They'll be mourned together...
...as it should be, from now on.
T ake good care of him, okay?
I can promise you
I won't put him in a cage.
[BEEPS]
It found the storm that brought me here.
You know...
...it would mean much to everyone...
...if you would stay.
Would mean much to me.
I have to leave now.
I have to get back.
You know, one day, they'll tell a story...
...about a human who came from the stars...
...and changed our world.
Some will say it was just a fairy tale...
...that he was never real.
But I'll know.
Oh.
Keep it.
You know, I'd like to thank you...
...for opening my eyes to a brave new world of trade with the humans.
Yeah, no problem.
Farewell, spaceman.
All right, kids, who wants to buy some aspirin?
Maybe you'll come back.

NARRATOR:
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful
[Creaking] the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
And the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint
Fire!
[All gasping]
Aah!
Like a Candarian zap-wing overtaking its prey--
[Door creaks]
WOMAN:
James Pleiades Hawkins l thought you were asleep an hour ago. l thought you were asleep an hour ago.
Mom, I was just getting to the best part.
Please?
Oh, can those eyes get any bigger?
Scootch over.
NARRATOR: like a Candarian zap-wing overtaking its prey
Flint and his band of renegades swooped in out of nowhere
[Jingling]
Ha ha ha ha!
And then. gathering up their spoils vanished without a trace
-Ooh!
-Ooh!
NARRATOR: Flint's secret trove was never found but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the farthest reaches of the galaxy stowed with riches beyond imagination-- the loot of a thousand worlds
JIM AND NARRATOR:
Treasure Planet
OK. Blow your nose.
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace? l have no idea.
Come here, you, you li--
I'm gonna get--oh!
[Pffft]
[Giggling]
OK, now it's time for this little spacer to go to sleep.
You think somebody'll ever find Treasure Planet?
Sweetheart,
I think it's more... like a legend.
I know it's real.
You win. It's real.
-Nighty-night, Mom.
-Nighty-night, sweetheart. l love you.
Love you, too.

Whoo-hoo!
[Sirens blaring]
Oh, great.
[Thunder]
Mrs Hawkins!
I know-- refill on the purp juice.
Coming right up,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.
There we go. That's four powdered spheroids... two lunar eclipses, and it's a big bowl... of Zorellian jelly worms for the big boy!
-Awesome!
-Enjoy.
Sorry, Delbert. It's been a madhouse here all morning.
No problem, Sarah.
Ah! My Alponian chowder with the extra solara seed.
Mmm! Yum!
[Sniffing]
Hello.
DOPPLER:
What brings you here curious little one?
Go away.
Are your parents around?
What's the matter?
Cat got your--yaah!
[Gulp]
Oh, they're so adorable at that age.
Oh, yes...deplorable.
Uh...adorable! Hmm.
Speaking of which, how's Jim doing?
Much better. I know he had some rough spots... earlier this year, but I really think... that he's starting to turn a corner.
Mrs. Hawkins?
Jim! [Drops dishes]
Ooh...wrong turn.
OK. Thanks for the lift, guys.
Not so fast.
We apprehended your son operating... a solar vehicle in a restricted area.
Moving violation 9-0-4... section fifteen, paragraph, um...
Six?
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.
-Jim!
-As you are aware, ma'am... this constitutes a violation of his probation.
Yes, yes. No, I understand.
Um, but could we just--
DOPPLER:
Um. ahem. pardon me
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.
I am the noted astrophysicist
Dr. Delbert Doppler.
Perhaps you've heard of me.
No? Uh, I have a clipping.
-Are you the boy's father?
-Oh! Good heavens, no!
Eww! He's just an old friend of the family.
Back off, sir!
Thank you, Delbert. l will take it from here.
Well, Sarah, if you insist.
Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again.
Due to repeated violations of statute 1 5-C... we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result... in a one-way ticket to Juvenile Hall.
-Kiddie hoosegow.
-The slammo.
Thank you, officers.
It won't happen again.
We see his type all the time, ma'am.
-Wrong choices.
-Dead-enders.
Losers
-You take care now.
-Let's motor.
[Conversations resume]
Jim, I have had it.
Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? ls that it?
SARAH: Jim?
Jim, look at me.
It's been hard enough keeping this place... afloat by myself without you going--
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.
Those cops just won't get off my--
Forget it.
MRS DUNWIDDIE:
Mrs Hawkins! My juice!
Yes, I'll be right there,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.
Jim, I just don't want to see you... throw away your entire future.
Yeah, what future?
[Thunder]
[Clang]
DR DOPPLER: I really don't know how you manage it. Sarah
Trying to run a business while raising a felon like-- felon...fellow... fellow like Jim.
Managing it?
I'm at the end of my rope.
Ever since his father left well. Jim's just never recovered
And you know how smart he is
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!
And yet. he's failing at school he is constantly in trouble and when I talk to him. he's like a stranger to me
I don't know. Delbet
I've tried everything--
[Engines sputtering]
Hey, Mister?
Mister, you're OK in there, right?
[Growling]
Aah!
[Coughing]
He's a-comin'.
Can you hear him?
Those gears and gyros clickin' and whirrin'... like the devil himself!
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn't ya?
He's after me chest... that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.
[Straining]
But they'll have to pry it... from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore I--argh!
[Coughing]
Oh, my--
Uh, come on, give me your arm.
That's it.
-Good lad.
-Mom's gonna love this.
[Click]
Thanks for listening, Delbert.
[Sighs] It helps.
It's going to be OK.
You'll see. l keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door... and there he'll be just the way he was.
A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet... and begging me to let him keep it.
[Thunder]
[Gasps] James Pleiades Hawkins!
Mom, he's hurt...bad!
Me chest, lad.
[Gasping]
[Groans]
BILLY BONES:
He'll be comin' soon
Can't let them find this.
Who's coming?
[Whispering] The cyborg!
Beware the cyborg! [Gasps]
Ohh!
[Rumbling]
[Sarah gasps]
Quick! We gotta go!
-Ohh!
-Aah!
I believe I'm with Jim on this one!
[Pirates shouting]
Delilah! Hallelujah!
[Yelping excitedly]
Stay! Don't move!
PIRATE: Where is it?!
Find it!
DOPPLER:
Don't worry. Sarah
I'm an expert in the laws of physical science.
-On the count of three--one...
-Three!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Go, Delilah! Go!
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!
Hyah! Hyah!
[Crickets chirping]
[Crickets chirping]
DOPPLER: I just spoke with the constabulary
Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace
[Clock chimes]
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn has burned to the ground.
Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble... over that odd little sphere.
Those markings baffle me
Unlike anything
I've ever encountered
[Beeps, whirring]
DOPPLER: Even with my vast experience and superior intellect it would take me years to unlock its--hey!
[Gasps]
DOPPLER: Why, it's a map!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
This is us, the planet Montressor.
[Gasps]
That's the Magellanic Cloud!
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!
Oh!
DOPPLER:
That's the Cygnus Cross and that's the Kerian Abyss.
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it--it's...
Treasure Planet.
No!
That's Treasure Planet!
DOPPLER: Flint's trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?
You know what this means?
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.
Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place... atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience--
[Click]
Whoo! What just happened?
Mom, this is it. This is the answer to all our problems.
Jim, there is absolutely no way--
Don't you remember, all those stories?
That's all they were--stories!
With that treasure... we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!
Well, this is-- it's just--oh, my.
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?
It's totally preposterous... traversing the entire galaxy alone.
SARAH: Now at last, we hear some sense!
-That's why I'm going with you.
-Delbert!
I'll use my savings to finance the expedition.
I'll commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.
You're not serious.
All my life I've been waiting for an opportunity like this... and here it is screaming,
''Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!''
OK. OK! You're both grounded!
[Sighs]
JIM: Mom. look l know that I keep messing everything up... and I know... that I let you down.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.
I'm gonna set things right.
Sarah?
If I may?
You said yourself, you've tried everything.
There are much worse remedies... than a few character-building months in space.
Are you saying this because it's the right thing... or because you really want to go? l really, really, really, really want to go... and it's the right thing.
[Sighs]
Jim... l don't want to lose you.
Mom...you won't.
I'll make you proud.
DOPPLER: Well. uh. ahem
There we are then.
We'll begin preparations at once.
We'll begin preparations at once.
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be off to the spaceport.
[Whoosh]
[Squawking]
[Squawking]
[Creatures speaking alien languages]
DOPPLER:
Jim! Oh. Jim! Wait for me!
[Clanking]
[Breathing deeply]
Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity... for the two of us to get to know one another.
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um... well, contempt, but, in our case--
Look, let's just find the ship. OK?
[Clank]
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.
Hey, thanks.
It's the suit, isn't it? l should never have listened... to that pushy two-headed saleswoman.
This one said it fit, that one said it was my color. l didn't know what to do. l get so flustered. Ooh!
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!
Whoa!
OFFICER:
Stow those casks forward!
Heave together now!
How cool is this?
[Squishing noise]
Sorry about that. l didn't mean--
[Angry farting noises]
Allow me to handle this.
[Pfft pffft pffft]
[Eek eek eek eek]
[Poit]
[Chuckling]
[Eek pfft]
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.
Took two years of it in high school.
[Pffft]
Flatula? Cool.
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?
Shipshape it is, sir, but I'm not the captain.
The captain's aloft.
[Meow]
Mr. Arrow, I've checked this miserable ship... from stem to stern, and, as usual, it's...spot on.
Can you get nothing wrong?
You flatter me, Captain.
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?
Uh, um, yes. l--
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
If I may, Doctor, this works so much better... when it's right-way up and plugged in.
-Ooh!
-Lovely. There you go.
If you don't mind, l can manage my own plugging!
I'm Captain Amelia... late of a few run-ins with the Protean armada.
Nasty business, but I won't bore you with my scars.
You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.
Please, Captain.
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know l don't mean a word of it.
Ahem, excuse me. I hate to interrupt this lovely banter... but may I introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?
Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure--
Doctor, please!
[Growls]
I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map... in front of this particular crew... demonstrates a level of ineptitude... that borders on the imbecilic... and I mean that in a very caring way.
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've--
May I see the map, please?
Here.
Hmm. Fascinating.
Mr. Hawkins, in the future... you will address me as ''Captain'' or ''Ma'am.'' ls that clear?
Ugh...
Mr. Hawkins?
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key... when not in use.
And, Doctor, again... with the greatest possible respect... zip your howling screamer.
Captain, I assure you l--
Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible. l don't much care for this crew you hired.
They're...how did l describe them, Arrow? l said something rather good this morning before coffee.
''A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots,'' ma'am.
-There you go--poetry.
-Now, see here--
Doctor, I'd love to chat-- tea, cake, the whole shebang-- but I have a ship to launch... and you've got your outfit to buff up.
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes... down to the galley straightaway.
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.
What? The cook?
That woman! That...feline!
Who does she think is working for whom?
It's my map, and she's got me bussin' tables?
I'll not tolerate a cross word about our captain!
There's no finer officer in this or any galaxy.
[Whistling]
ARROW: Mr Silver?
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
Bringin' in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley.
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.
Heh heh heh heh!
A cyborg!
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?
The financier of our voyage.
Love the outfit, Doc.
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
Jimbo! Uh...
Aw, now, don't be too put off by this hunk of hardware.
[Humming]
Whoa!
These gears have been tough getting used to... but they do come in mighty handy from time to time.
[Humming]
Mmm!
Here, now, have a taste of me famous bonzabeast stew.
[Sniffing]
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
SILVER: Old family recipe
Aah! ln fact, that was part of the old family!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, ho! I'm just kiddin', Doc!
Uh, yeah, well...
I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
[Giggling]
SILVER: Morph!
You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
So that's where you was hiding!
[Chattering]
[Belch]
Wha--? Ha!
What is that thing?
''What is that thing?''
SILVER: He's a morph
I rescued the little shape-shifter on Proteus 1
[Cooing]
Aw, he took a shine to me.
We been together ever since.
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
We're about to get underway.
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?
Would l?
Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets?
I'll follow you.
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.
[Cough]
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but--
Captain's orders! See to it the new cabin boy's kept busy.
-Aw, but, no, but--
-No, you can't--
[Both sigh]
So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
Whatever.
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?
Yeah.
You know...these purps... they're kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.
You ever been there? l can't say as I have, Jimbo.
Come to think of it, just before I left... l met this old guy, who was, um... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his. ls that so?
Yeah.
What was that old salamander's name?
Oh, yeah. Bones.
Billy Bones?
Bones? Bones?!
Mm-mmm.
T'ain't ringin' any bells.
Must have been a different cyborg.
There's a slew of cyborgs roamin' this port.
[Whistle on-deck]
ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
Eh, off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
There'll be plenty work a-waitin' for you afterwards.
[Humming]
[Chattering]
We best be keepin' a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?
We wouldn't want him strayin' into things he shouldn't.
We're all clear, Captain!
Well, my friend. Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?
My pleasure, Captain.
All hands to stations!
ARROW: Smatly now!
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!
Loose all solar sails!
[Grunting]
Come on!
ARROW: Heave up the braces
Brace up
[Crackling]
Ooh. Oh.
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
[Poomp poomp poomp pooomp]
[Clank]
[Clatter]
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
Take her away!
[Revving]
Brace yourself, Doctor.
[Snidely] ''Brace yourself.''
Aah! Oof!
Whoa.
[Woooo]
[Woooo]
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
Smile.
Uh, Doctor, I'd stand clear--
Ha.
SILVER: Ah. 'tis a grand day for sailing. Captain and look at you
You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
You can keep that kind of flim-flammery... for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy--
You cut me to the quick,
Captain. l speaks nothing but me heart at all times.
MORPH: Nothing but me heat
And, by the way, isn't that your cabin boy... aimlessly footling about in those shrouds?
Yep, it--oh...
A momentary aberration, Cap'n, soon to be addressed. Jimbo! l got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
Heh heh heh heh!
Yippie.
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
Watch it, twerp.
[Murmuring]
What are you looking at, weirdo?
Yeah, weirdo.
[Hisssss]
Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business.
Why? You got something to hide, bright eyes?
Maybe your ears don't work so well.
[Grunts] Yeah. Ahem.
Too bad my nose works just fine.
Why, you impudent little--
[Crew shouting]
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!
[Poot poot phoot]
Any last words, cabin boy?
Mr. Scroop... you ever see what happens to a fresh purp... when you squeeze real hard?
ARROW: What's all this. then?
You know the rules.
There'll be no brawling on this ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig... for the remainder of the voyage.
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
Transparently.
SILVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
Jimbo, I gave you a job.
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing--
Belay that! Now, I want this deck swabbed spotless... and heaven help you if l come back and it's not done.
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup... and let me know if there be any more distractions.
OK Aye-aye
[Chattering]
[Sighs]
[Crew grumbling]
[Crew grumbling]
So, we're all here, then.
-Excuse me.
-Fine.
Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen... are you all... stark-raving, totally blinking daft?!
[Chatters]
After all me finagling getting us hired... as an upstanding crew... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it's time?
The boy was sniffing about.
You just stick to the plan, you bug-brained twit.
As for the boy,
I'll run him so ragged... he won't have time to think.
[Morph laughs]
[Coughs]
[Sighs]
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
Making new friends like that spider psycho.
Spider psycho, spider psycho.
Heh. A little uglier.
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!
Pretty close.
SILVER: Well thank heavens for little miracles.
Up here for an hour... and the deck's still in one piece.
Um, look, l, uh...
What you did...
Thanks.
Didn't your pap ever teach you... to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
Your father's not the teachin' sort.
No.
He was more the taking off and never coming back sort.
Oh.
Sorry, lad.
Hey, no big deal.
I'm doing just fine. ls that so?
Well, since the captain has put you in my charge... like it or not,
I'll be pounding a few skills... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.
-What?
-From now on...
I'm not letting you out of me sight.
You can't do--
You won't so much as eat, sleep... or scratch your bum without my say-so.
Don't do me any favors!
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.
You can be sure of that.
You can be sure of that.
Heh heh heh heh!
Put some elbow into it.
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want
Made of pain
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy. no. I'm a man
You can take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown
Yeah. you stand here on your own
They don't know me
'Cause I'm not here
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me
But I'm still here
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted. h could be
Now you know me
And I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me
As long as I know who I am
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah. the world is still sleeping
While I keep on dreaming for me
While I keep on dreaming for me
And the words are just whispers and lies
That I'll never believe
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
Whoa!
How can you say h never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now
'Cause I'm still here
I'm the one son still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
[Song fades]
[Pulley squeaking]
[Grunts]
Oh, ho ho!
You having a little trouble there?
Oh, get away from me.
[Laughing]
Oh, Jimbo.
If I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age... they'd be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.
Bowing in the streets.
-Oof.
-Oof. l don't know.
They weren't exactly singing my praises when I left home.
-Heh. Whew.
-Whew.
But I'm gonna change all that.
Are you now? How so?
Uh, I got some plans.
Gonna make people see me a little different.
Ooh.
Sometimes, plans go astray.
Not this time.
Hmm.
Ooh...
[Chatters]
Oh, thank you, Morphy.
So, uh, how'd that happen anyway?
You give up a few things chasing a dream.
Was it worth it?
Heh.
[Sighs]
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo. l most surely am.
[Screams]
[Ship groans]
What the devil?
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa... it's gone supernova!
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!
Aye-aye, Captain.
All hands, fasten your lifelines!
[Shouting]
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!
Secure all sails!
Reef them down. men!
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom!
Ha ha ha ha!
-Aah!
-Silver!
Whoa. Thanks, lad.
[Yelling]
Captain, the star!
It's devolving into a...
[Gasps] a black hole!
We're being pulled in!
Ohh!
No, you don't, you--
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.
There'll be one more in precisely 47.2 seconds.
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!
We'll ride that last magilla out of here.
All sails secured, Captain!
Good man!
Now release them immediately!
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.
Unfurl those sails
-What?!
-But we just finished...
-Tying them down!
-Make up your blooming minds!
Mr. Hawkins... make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!
Aye-aye, Captain.
Lifelines secured, Captain!
Very good!
Gaah! Whoa!
Oof!
[Gasps]
Aah!
DOPPLER:
Captain. the last wave!
Here it comes!
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
[Whimpers]
[Boom]
Oof!
[Crew cheering]
[Sighs]
Captain! That--oh, my goodness.
That was-- that was absolutely-- that was the most--
Oh, tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor... your astronomical advice was most helpful.
Well, uh, uh--thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically-- amanamonically-- as-astronomically. [Slap]
Well, I must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.
It seems your cabin boy... did a bang-up job with those lifelines.
[Both chuckle]
All hands accounted for,
Mr. Arrow?
Mr. Arrow?
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.
His lifeline was not secured.
No, I checked them all. l--l did. I checked them all.
They were secure. l swear.
Mr. Arrow was a...
Ahem. Fine spacer... finer than most of us could ever hope to be... but he knew the risks, as do we all.
Resume your posts.
We carry on.
[Whimpers]
[Ship creaking]
It weren't your fault, you know?
[Sighs]
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss--
Look, don't you get it?! l screwed up!
For two seconds, l thought that maybe... l could do something right, but--
Aagh! I just--
[Sighs]
Just forget it. Forget it.
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya... but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.
Stick to it, no matter the squalls... and when the time comes you get the chance... to really test the cut of your sails... and show what you're made of, well, I hope I'm there... catching some of the light coming off ya that day.
[Sniffles]
[Sobs softly]
There, there.
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.
It's all right.
Now, Jim, l, um... l best be getting about my watch... and you best be getting some shut-eye.
[Chattering]
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.
Next thing ya know, they'll be saying I've gone soft.
[Crew snoring]
[Crew snoring]
[Muttering]
[Poomp phem poom-poomp]
[Poooomp]
[Pfft-pfft-pfft]
[Phooomp]
Uh--oh! Oh! Ugh!
[Sighs]
Morph?
Morph, knock it off.
It's too early for this.
Ow! Hey, Morph!
Pbbbt!
[Laughs]
-Hey, come back here!
-Come back here!
Gotcha, Morph!
[Sighs]
That's it, you little squid.
You little squid.
You little squid.
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.
Ungh! Unh!
Ha! Busted!
Look. what we're saying is we're sick of all this waiting
There's only three of them left
We are wanting to move.
We don't move till we got the treasure in hand.
SCROOP: h say we kill 'em all now l say what's to say!
Disobey my orders again... like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow... and so help me, you'll be joining him! and so help me, you'll be joining him!
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.
SILVER: You got something to say. Scroop?
It's that boy.
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.
SAILORS: Yeah
Now, mark me, the lot of ya. l care about one thing, and one thing only!
Flint's trove.
You think I'd risk it all for the sake... of some nose-wiping little whelp?
SCROOP: What was it now?
''Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya ''
Shut your yap! l cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.
But I ain't gone soft.
ONUS: Land ho!
Ha ha ha! There it is!
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.
Where the devil's me glass?
Jimbo.
Playing games, are we?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're playing games.
Oh, I see. Well, I was never much good at games.
Always hated to lose. [Click]
Hmm.
Me, too!
Yaaah!
Right-o...
SILVER: Ohh blast it all
[Blows whistle]
Change in plan, lads!
We move now!
[Cheering]
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.
With pleasure, Captain.
[Roars]
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Doctor, familiar with these?
[Gun powers up]
Oh, I've seen-- well, I've read--
Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.
Ooh.
[Laughs]
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.
Morph! Give me that!
Oh, you're taking all day about it.
Oh! Stop them!
DOPPLER: Aah, aah, aah. Oof!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Hey, you!
To the longboats, quickly!
Unh!
Rrr-yeah!
[Cocks gun]
Morph! No!
AMELIA: Chew on this, you pus-filled boils!
[Screaming]
Did you actually aim for that?
You know, actually, I did.
[Gears turning]
Oh, blast it.
Doctor, when I say ''now'', shoot out the forward cable.
I'll take this one.
JIM: Morph. here! Morph!
Morph!
Morphy, come here. [Whistles]
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.
Come here, boy. Morph!
-Come on!
-Morph! Morph, here!
-Morphy!
-Morph!
[Groans] Ohh.
[Powers up]
[Beeping]
[Sighs]
Now!
Whoa!
Unh!
Jim!
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.
That's it! Come to papa!
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o'clock!
-Whoa!
-Aah!
[Creaking]
Ow.
Oh, my goodness.
That was more fun than l ever want to have again.
[Chuckles]
That's not one of my... gossamer landings. Unh!
Captain!
Oh. Ooh.
Oh, don't fuss.
Uh-uh--
Slight bruising. That's all.
Cup of tea, and I'll be right as rain.
Mr. Hawkins.
The map if you please.
Ah.
[Giggling]
Morph!
[Giggling]
Morph!
Morph, where's the map?!
Are you serious?!
It's back on the ship?
Stifle that blob and get low.
[Engine whining]
CAPTAIN AMELIA:
We've got company
We need a more defensible position.
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.
Aye, Captain.
-Unh!
-Steady, steady.
Now, let's have a look at that.
[Wind whistling]
[Morph chattering]
[Rattling]
[Gasps]
Shh. shh.
[Powers up]
-Aah!
-Aah!
Oh, this is fantastic!
A carbon-based life form come to rescue me at last! l just want to hug you and squeeze you... and hold you close to me.
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's just I've been marooned for so long. l mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.
For heaven's sakes, after a hundred years... you go a little nuts!
Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry. Am l... l am, um...
My name is, uh...
[Cuckoo cuckoo]
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.
-And you are?
-Jim.
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, OK? l got to find a place to hide, and there's pirates chasing me.
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates! l don't like them. l remember Captain Flint.
This guy had such a temper.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint? l think he suffered from mood swings, personally.
I'm not a therapist, and anyway... but l--you let me know when I'm rambling.
But that means--but wait.
But then you gotta know about the treasure?
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
It's--well, it's... it's all a little-- little--little fuzzy.
Wait. l--l r-r-remember. l do. l--treasure!
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid-- centroid--centroid of the mechanism.
And there was this big door opening and closing... and opening and closing... and Captain Flint wanted to make sure... nobody could ever get to his treasure... so I helped him...
[Sputtering]
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
JIM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !
Reboot! Aah! And you are?
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure? l want to say Larry.
The--the centroid of the mechanism, or--
I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
You haven't found it, have you?
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?
Look, B.E.N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?
So I'm just gonna be, you know, moving on.
Oh, uh, so, well, then... l guess, uh... this is good-bye, huh?
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.
So, uh, go ahead and... l do understand. l do. Bye-bye.
[Whines]
[Sighs] Look, if you're gonna come along... you're gonna have to stop talking.
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!
Me and my best buddy are lookin' for a...
[Clears throat]
[Whispering] Being quiet.
And you have to stop touching me.
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.
OK. Now, I think that we should--
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search... um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?
[Chuckles] Kind of urgent.
JIM: BEN. I think you just solved my problem
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people
You'd think in a hundred years... l would've dusted a little more often... but, you know, when you're batchin' it... you tend to, uh, let things go.
Aw, isn't that sweet? l find old-fashioned romance so touching, don't you?
How about drinks for the happy couple?
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
Thank you, we don't drink... and, uh, we're not a couple.
Ahem.
Look at these markings.
They're identical to the ones on the map. l suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants... of an ancient culture.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr Hawkins stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
Yes, yes. Now listen to me... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.
Very forceful, Doctor.
Go on. Say something else.
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
Stop wastin' your fire!
SILVER: Hello. up there!
Jimbo?
If it's all right with the captain...
I'd like a short word with ya.
No tricks, just a little palaver.
Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.
Pestilential...
-Ugh!
-Captain.
That means...that he thinks we still have it.
Ah, Morphy! I wondered where you was off to.
[Groaning]
Ooh.
Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky... since that game attack we had in the galley.
[Chuckles]
Ahh.
Whatever you heard back there... at least the part concerning you... l didn't mean a word of it.
Had that bloodthirsty lot thought I'd gone soft... they'd have gutted us both.
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right... we can both walk away from this rich as kings.
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.
You get me that map... and, uh... an even portion of the treasure is yours.
[Chuckles]
Boy.
You are really something.
All that talk of greatness... light coming off my sails... what a joke.
Now, just see here, Jimbo-- l mean, at least you taught me one thing.
Stick to it, right?
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make sure that you never see... one drabloon of my treasure!
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!
Oh, you still don't know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?
Now, mark me.
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow... or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons... to blast ya all to kingdom come!
Morph, hop to it.
Now!
Oh, blast it!
Gentlemen... we must stay together and... and...ohh.
And what? What?!
We must stay together and what?!
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
She's lost her mind!
Well, you gotta help her.
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer, not a doctor. l mean, I am a doctor, but I'm not that kind of doctor. l have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.
You can't help people with a doctorate.
You just sit there, and you're useless.
It's OK, Doc.
It's all right.
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.
It's just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.
Jim, any thoughts at all?
Without the map, we're dead.
If we try to leave, we're dead.
-If we stay here--
-We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time. Heh.
So I'll just slip out the back door.
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah. l get this delightful breeze through here... which I think is important... because ventilation among friends--
Whoa What is all this stuff?
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet?
Not a clue.
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think l found a way out of here!
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay--
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!
Woof.
[Snoring]
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
[Whispering] OK, here it is.
We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons... and bring back the map.
[Muffled] That's a good plan. l like that plan.
The only thing is...
I'm wondering, how do we get there?
On that.
MORPH: Ooh.
Oop? [Poink]
-Aah!
-BEN. shh!
Sorry. sorry Sorry
OK, I'll get the map.
You wait here.
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!
Yo-ho. yo-ho. a pirate's life for me
[Humming]
[Sighs]
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.
[Gasps] Oh, mama.
[Sighs] Yes.
[Alarm blaring]
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.
OK, fixing.
That stupid robot's gonna get us all...killed.
Cabin boy.
Aah!
[Growling]
[Squealing]
[Powers up]
BEN:
Whoops OK. don't panic
Breathing in breathing out
[Ship creaking]
-Aah!
-Hmm?
[Poink] Raah!
This has gotta be cannons.
[Rumbling]
Maybe not.
Rraar!
[Thud]
[Grunting]
Heh heh.
Come on, come on, come on.
No!
[Snickers] Oh, yes.
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.
[Gasps] Rraar!
Tell him yourself!
Aah!
Back you go, you naughty plug!
Oh!
Unh! [Gasping]
[Rattling]
[Coughing]
Morph?
[Chirrups]
BEN:
Laser cannons disconnected
Captain Jimmy, sir!
Gee, that wasn't so tough.
Doc! Doc, wake up! l got the map.
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.
[Muffled yelling]
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.
Aah!
[Morph yelping]
What's this sorry stack of metal?!
Not the face!
You're just like me, Jimbo.
Ya hates to lose.
[Chuckles]
What the devil's the...
Open it.
I'd get busy.
[Crew murmuring]
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?
Ha ha ha ha!
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we--what?
You want the map... you're taking me, too.
[Grunts]
Hmm.
[Chuckles]
We'll take 'em all.
Unh.
[Chattering]
It's OK, Morph. It's OK.
Jimmy, l--l don't know about you... but I'm starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.
At least, I think it's my life.
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!
B.E.N., shh.
This isn't over yet.
SILVER:
We're gettin' close. lads l smell treasure a-waitin'.
[Laughs]
Huh?
SILVER: Where is it? l see nothing! One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!
What's going on, Jimbo? l don't know. l can't get it open.
We should've never followed this boy!
Hey!
SILVER: I'd suggest you get that gizmo going again. and fast!
Let's rip his gizzard right out right now!
Throw him off the cliff!
[Rumbling]
Oh, have mercy.
JIM: The Lagoon Nebula?
But that's halfway across the galaxy.
JIM: A big door opening and closing
Let's see.
Kinapis.
Montressor spaceport.
So that's how Flint did it.
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.
But where'd he stash it all?
SILVER: Where's that blasted treasure?!
Treasure! Treasure!
It's buried in the--
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.
What if the whole planet is the mechanism... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?
[Shouting]
[Boing]
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?
Just open the right door.
[Alarm beeping]
Wait for me! Wait for me!
[Gasps]
[Cheering]
The loot of a thousand worlds.
CREATURE: We are going to need a bigger boat!
[Laughing]
This is all seeming very familiar.
I can't remember why
B.E.N., come on.
We're getting out of here, and we're not leaving empty-handed.
But--but, Jimmy! Jimmy!
A lifetime of searching.
And at long last... l can touch it.
Do you know what's strange? l can't tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy...
'cause there's something just-- it's nagging at the back of my mind.
Aah!
-Captain Flint?
-ln the flesh!
Well, s-sort of, except for skin, organs... or anything that--that--that resembles flesh... that's not there.
And yet it's so odd. you know?
I remember there was something horrible
Flint didn't want anyone else to know but h--h just can't remember what it was
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
[Sobbing]
B.E.N., l think I just found your mind.
Hold still.
Aah! Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
Whoa!
Hello.
You know, uh, Jimmy, l was just thinking... l was just think--
It's all flooding back!
All my memories!
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits... so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!
[Crash]
-Speaking of which...
-Huh?
Flint wanted to make sure... that nobody could ever steal his treasure... so he rigged this whole planet... to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
[Jingling]
[Yelling]
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
You go back and help the captain and Doc!
If I'm not there in 5 minutes, leave without me. l am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
Unless he looks at me like that.
Bye, Jim!
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
No! Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
[Crew yelling]
Come back here, ya blighters!
[Rumbling]
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.
[Sighs] I'm just sorry... l couldn't have been more helpful to you.
Oh, don't be daft.
You've been very helpful.
Truly. l feel like such a useless weakling... with abnormally thin wrists.
Excuse me, brutish pirate.
[Belches]
Yes, you. I have a question. ls it that your body is too massive... for your teeny-tiny head... or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny... for your big, fat body? l pummel you good!
Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do... l have one more question. ls this yours?
Uhh...
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!
[Cackling]
SILVER: Ah. Jimbo!
Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?
Get back! l like you, lad, but I've come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.
Aah!
Oh, no, you don't!
[Chattering]
What?
Jimbo.
Reach for me now!
Reach! l--l can't!
Aah! l...
Oh, blast me for a fool!
Aah!
[Groans]
Silver, you gave up?
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.
BEN: Aloha. Jimmy!
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes... and thirty-four seconds till planet's destruction!
You're doing fine, Doctor.
Now ease her over gently--gently!
Aah! We were better off on exploding planet!
Take us out of here, metal man!
Aye, Captain!
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of--
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
[Chuckles]
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
30% ? That means we're--
We'll never clear the planet's explosion in time.
-We gotta turn around.
-What?
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!
DOPPLER: Pardon me. Jim. but didn't that portal open onto a raging inferno?!
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
I'm gonna open a different door
Captain, really, I don't see how this is possible--
Listen to the boy!
One minute, twenty-nine seconds till planet's destruction!
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.
There you go.
There you go.
OK. Now, no matter what happens... keep the ship heading straight for that portal.
BEN: Fifty-eight seconds!
Well, you heard him!
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
Doctor, head us back to the portal.
Aye, Captain.
Go to the right! The right! l know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!
Twenty-five seconds!
No! No!
Come on, lad.
Seventeen seconds!
BEN: Seven sixfivefour three...two...
Wow! Yeah!
SILVER: You done it. Jimmy!
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!
Didn't I say the lad had greatness in him?
[Cheering]
Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you
Just wait until your mother hears about this!
Of course, we may downplay the life-threatening parts.
Jimmy, that was unforgettable! l know you don't like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, you hugged me back.
Oh, I promised myself l wouldn't cry.
[Sobbing]
BEN:
Does anyone have a tissue?
[Morph squeaking]
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-l know.
JIM: You never quit. do you ?
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha! l was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure.
Mmm.
Well... that should hold it.
Heh heh heh. l taught you too well.
If you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison.
Little morphy here, he's a free spirit.
Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
[Squeaks]
Ohh!
What say you ship out with us, lad?
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
You know, when I got on this boat... l would've taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, l met this old cyborg... and he taught me that l could chart my own course.
That's what I'm gonna do.
And what do you see of that pal of yours?
A future.
[Chuckles] Why... look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
You're something special, Jim.
You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.
[Clears throat]
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.
[Sniffles]
[Sobbing]
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?
See ya around.
[Sniffs]
Morphy, I got a job for ya. l need you to keep an eye on this here pup.
Will ya do me that little favor?
Aye-aye, Captain.
Oh, and one more thing.
[Chuckles]
This is for your dear mother... to rebuild that inn of hers.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
[Laughs] Why, Jimbo, lad... when have I ever done otherwise?
[Laughing]
Oh! [Giggling]

[All gasp]

[Song starts]
It's good to see the sun and feel this place
This place I never thought would feel like home
And I ran forever
Far away
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone
Somehow the world has changed
And I've come home
To give you back the things they took from you
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
When I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
And I found something that was always there
Sometimes it's got to hut before you feel
But now I'm strong. and I won't kneel
Except to thank who's watching over me
And somehow h feel so strong
And I've begun to be the one
I never thought I'd be
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
Now it's all so clear
And I believe
That everything's been opened up to me
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
And when I feel the sun
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are

Good, good.
You know how I hate violence.
Mmm. Nice shine.
-Uh, what next, sir ?
-Well, obviously, we establish our base.
- And where will that be ?
- The last place on Earth they’d look.
A place called...
3rd Street School.
Last day ofschool sale, boys and girls.
Getyour celebratory contraband right here.
Shaving cream, T.P., goofy string, maps ofthe teachers’ houses.
I’ll take one ofthem maps,
Hustler Kid.
Hey, Diggers, let’s party.
Can’t now. Gotta finish filling up our holes before the end ofthe day.
Won’t be able to dig ’em up nextyear ifwe don’t fill ’em now.
[ Spitting ]
Hey ! Big kids bury me !
Oops.
I, King Bob, in my last official act before entering middle school, hereby anoint this boy here
King Freddie the Second.
Mayyou boss around all ofthe kids with fairness.
The king has graduated !

The royals have such style.
Keep ’em comin’ !
Let’s go !
Ms. Finster, the kids are practically mad with last-day-of-school fever !
Ofcourse they are, Randall.
They’re animals living by pure instinct.
I’ve got a list ofinfractions a mile long:
The Diggers hit a water main,
- the kindergarteners are feasting on paste,
- Never mind, Randall.
Hustler Kid is, uh--
Did you say ‘‘never mind’’ ?
That’s right, Randall. What I’ve got here is bigger, much bigger.
All this year I’ve been holding back on the ice cream, hiding it from all those little savages.
Just look at it, Randall.
I’m counting 1 00, maybe 200 cases ofit.
What areyou going to do with all those ice creams ?
Sell ’em back to the district, ofcourse.
Think ofall the chalk and erasers we can get.
But, Ms. Finster,
I’ve got dirt on everybody.
Well, everybody except
Detweiler and his pals.
Come to think ofit,
I haven’t seen those guys anywhere.
Ah, forget about ’em, Randall.
There’s nothing T.J. Detweiler and his hooligan friends can do to stop me now.
Well, that should do it.
There’s enough here for everyone.
Good. Then it’s party time.
Kids ofthe playground !
I giveyou ice cream !
Pull !
[ Cheering ]
- Ice cream !
- Choco-pops !
- Fudge bars !
Fudgsicle !
My ice cream !
Stop it !
Stop it, I say !
You little monsters are in trouble now !
-Just wait’ll Principal Prickly finds out about this !
-Attention, students !
- This is Principal Prickly talking.
- Ooh, that was fast.
Some ofyou may have noticed ice cream on the playground.
I willnotstandforthis. This ice creamshouldbe eatenimmediately.
Huh ?
[ Cheering ]
In addition, I wantyou all to ignore
Ms. Finster, no matterwhat she says... about ice cream or anything else.
- [ Cheering Continues ]
- [ Muttering ] This can’t be happening.
Furthermore, I want to inform you all that I have a fat, saggy butt... which I like to scratch every hour on the hour.
Also, I want to apologize to all ofyou... for being such a mean principal, taking away hall passes, giving guys recess detention, refusing toacceptsicKnotes just ’causeitdoesn’tlooK liKeaguy’smom’ssignature, maKingKidsstandat the wall forten wholeminutes, withnobreaK!
Man, I feel ashamed ofmyselffor all the terrible, rotten things I’ve done.
And nextyear,
I promise to--
Why, Principal Prickly, sir, what a surprise.
Why doyou do this to me, Detweiler ?
Doyou enjoy tormenting me ?
- Doyou hate me ?
- On the contrary, sir, I have the utmost respect foryou.
Don’t be smart with me, boy. All year long you’ve been pushing me, testing me.
- I don’t know whatyou mean, sir.
- Oh, really ?
How about the timeyou convinced the F.B.I. I was a Chinese agent and got me arrested ?
You were giving us a speech on personal hygiene. You had to be stopped.
How about the time you forged my signature and ordered a motorboat for the school ?
It was for the kindergarteners.
Owning a boat’s always been kind ofa dream oftheirs.
I’ve had enough ofyour pranks.
This time I’m really gonna throw the book atyou.
With all due respect, sir, you’d better get throwing, ’causeyou’re out oftime.
- Huh ?
- It’s the last day ofschool, sir.
I’ve only got 20 more seconds offourth grade left. Look.
In some ways, people, this day is a bummer for me.
But in otherways it’s the ultimate high, because every milestone thatyou kids pass is another step towards--
- Uh, Miss Grotke ?
- Yes, Spinelli ?
I don’t mean to interrupt, but--
Oh, yes !
Be my guest.

Twelve weeks ofnothing but me at the
West Side GolfCourse, and no Detweiler.
I second that emotion, sir.
Man, Teej, that prankwas sweet.
Yeah, you should’ve seen
Finster’s face-- I thought she was gonna blow a gasket.
Those limesicles were tasty.
A tasty beginning to a tasty summer.
Twelve weeks ofnothing but riding bikes, hanging out at the lake... and T.P.-ing the West Side GolfCourse.
Summervacation-- the ultimate recess.
Yeah, I can’t wait to get to baseball camp.
Baseball camp ?
What areyou talking about ?
Actually, Teej,
I’m gonna be out oftown too.
Big-time Wrestling Federation has this training camp, and I gotta learn some new moves ifI’m ever gonna turn pro.
- But, Spinelli--
- It’s military camp for me.
My dad says I need to learn to be a leader.
I shall be attending the Mt. Van Buren Space Camp.
- Don’t wanna let those science geeks get ahead ofme.
- You’re all going to camp ?
- Not me.
- Thank goodness.
The Young Voices Training Program doesn’t like the word ‘‘camp.’’
They provide opportunities for aspiring singers to train theirvoices... in a rigorous yet supportive setting.
But summer’s gonna be ruined.
What am I gonna do ? Play baseball by myself? Watch reruns ? Read ?
Sorry, man, but we gotta think about our futures.
Yeah, we can’t waste the whole summer
Just fooling around like kids.
- But we are kids !
- Actually, as ofthe completion offourth grade, we are technically considered pre-young adults.
And nextyear we won’t even be ‘‘pre.’’
But--
[ Sighs ]
All right, let’s make the most ofthe time we’ve got left.
When doyou all leave ?
- First thing in the morning.
- Oh, man.
[Chattering]
Well, there’s my bus.
- Better get going.
- Yeah, same here.
Bye, Teej.
Try to have some fun, okay ?
Don’t worry, buddy.
You’ll have a great time without us.
I don’t know, Vince.
All my plans were made for six.
Don’t tell meyou Ashleys are going to baseball camp.
Eeew !
As if!
Cheerleading camp is right across the lake. Duh !
I hope it’s a big lake.
[Horn HonKs]
Ah, space camp.
Wonder ifthey’ll let us make craters.
Hey, Hustler Kid,
I didn’t knowyou wrestled.
I don’t.
I’m pre-management.
Besides, my research tells me that kids who wrestle trade the most for contraband snacks.
Which reminds me--
Wanna buy a Winger-Dinger ?
All right, all the kindergarten performers on the bus first.

And so, the summer season officially begins... with kids all over the country rushing offto camp.
In other news, the national
No Recess movement... has hit a serious stumbling block... with the disappearance ofits leader, former Secretary of Education
Phillium Benedict.
Benedict, fired by the president twoyears ago for his extremist views, has recently been--
No recess ?
What a bunch ofhogwash.
[ Yawns ]
Morning, Mom. Morning, Dad.
Areyoujust getting up now ?
Geez, you’re sleeping away yourwhole vacation.
Why don’tyou go play with your friends ?
What friends ? The ones who abandoned me and went to camp ?
Now, T.J., I know there are other boys around this summer.
Mrs. Ween says Randall is available.
Doyou want me to make a play date ?
- A play date ?
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Bye, T-Jerk.
Now, Becky, be nice toyour little brother.
He’s feeling S-A-D right now.
- I can spell, Mom.
- Well, unlike some kids,
I gotta get to work.
Mr. Walsh says ifI can master the Vatman 2000,
I’ll be assistant manager by the end ofthe summer, and you know what that means--
I’ll get to drive the Floppy Burger truck.
Boy, she’s sure aiming for the stars.
At least she’s not sitting around the house, moping all summer.
Going to a play date with Randall.
Man, I can’t believe
I sunk this low.
This is the worst summer ever.
[ Loud Zap ]
- What the heck ?
- [ Loud Zap ]
- That’s weird.
- Hey, you!
Get away from that fence !
Hey, Dad, what do they use the school for during the summer ?
They lock it up.
It’s empty. Why ?
Today, when I was riding by,
I saw this scary guy and--
I’m sure he wasjust cleaning up.
I think something weird’s going on in there-- something really weird.
[ Sighs ]
Mrs. La Salle was right.
We should’ve sent him to some kind ofcamp.
9:32 a.m. Ugly bald guy still guarding school.

You wait right here.
I’ll go get the baby thermometer and the petroleum jelly.

Yeah, yeah, very funny.
I’m not falling for another one ofyour so-calledjokes.

Just like real astronauts.

- Okay, Teej, what’s this big secret plot ofyours ?
- Follow me.
Look at that.
Let’s get movin’ out.
- Who are those guys ?
- Perhaps they’re government agents.
- Or gangsters.
- Or aliens.
Aliens ?
They don’t look like aliens.
Well, maybe they’re in disguise.
Yeah, ifyou were an alien, you wouldn’tjust walk around in your lizard skin all day.
Hmm. Good point.
Whoever they are, we need to take a closer look.
- We’ll get the rest later.
- Right. I’ll close it up.
Hurry.
Man, this thing weighs a ton.
That’s ’cause it’s full ofmoon rocks and alien eggs.
Hey, it’sjust a bunch ofpaper.

- Actually, that’s Norwegian.
- Whatever. It’s all
Just dumb school stuff.
You got me out ofbaseball camp to watch some guys restock the supply room ?
No ! Something’s going on in the school ! I swear !
Teej, I thinkyou cooked this whole thing upjust ’cause you wanted us back from camp.
- What ?
- Hey, we understand.
It must be pretty boring around here all summer byyourself.
Your mind simply created an adventure because it needed some excitement.
No, it really happened.
I saw Prickly disappear.
Well, if Prickly disappeared, then who’s that ?
- Come on, guys. Let’s get back to camp.
- Yeah.
Seeya in a few weeks, Teej.

Okay, Teej, you were right. Something weird is going on in the school.
- And Prickly must be in on it.
- I saywe go to the police.
I alreadywent to the police.
I went to everyone. Nobody’ll listen.
- What we need is proof.
- Proof? How are we gonna get proof?
- I got a plan. A stakeout.
- A stakeout ?
We can stay up in my tree house and watch the school every night until something happens.
- Like one ofthem TV cop shows.
- Sure.
The next time those laser guys make a move, we’ll catch ’em red-handed.
We can take pictures with my night-vision digital cam.
Then we call in the feds and, bang, we got ’em.

Oh, yeah. Ifmy dad finds out
I’ve gone AWOL, he’ll throw me in the brig till September.
Not to worry. I’ll get Becky to drive you back to camp in the morning.

But what ifthe camp counselors notice we’re not there ?
Leave that to me.

- When he gets back to camp, act like nothing’s happened.

Infrared night vision,

I gotta hand it toyou, Gretch. You can see the whole school with this thing.
You can make lots ofhandy devices out ofthe spare parts in a family’s garage.
I once fashioned a particle accelerator... out ofa broken hair dryer and a four-slice toaster oven.
‘‘Tonight, the magical moment arrived.
We met behind the drive-thru menu and kissed passionately... as the sound ofthe deep fat fryer faded into the night.’’
Man, I wish I had an older sister.
Laugh ifyou will.
I think it’s beautiful.
Sorry I’m late, guys, but I had to wait till my mom and dad fell asleep... before I could sneak out with... the goodies.
Roast beefand mashed potatoes !
My favorite !
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- I also managed to swipe this.
- Rocky Road ! My other favorite !
Hey, give me some ofthat.
Excuse me, but aren’t we supposed to eat dinner before dessert ?
Good one, Gretch.
You were right, Teej.
This is the life.
Hanging out with friends, eating ice cream, spying on bad guys.
It’s the ultimate kid experience.
Too bad these days are numbered.
Yeah, this is probably the last summer... we’ll get to do stufflike this.
Kinda whomps, huh ?
Hey, remember that summer after second grade... when we went down to the pond every day to catch minnows ?
Or how about that summerwe all carved our initials in that tree in the Wilsons’ backyard ?
And Spinelli spelled hers wrong.
Hey, I was seven.
And S’s are tricky.
[GusSobbing]
What’s your problem ? This is the first summeryou’ve lived here.
I know, and I’ll never have any ofthose memories.
[ Whimpering ]
Know what I’ll never forget ?
That song
T.J.’s sister taught us... the first summer after kindergarten.
Oh, yeah.
Backwhen she was nice.

Well, here we are, sir. But it’s
Just an old principal’s office.
Why is it so important ?
Because, my academically challenged young friend, it used to be mine.
1 0:41 a.m.
Gang back at camp.
I’m goin’ in alone.
[Man]
Man, oh, man.
I’veheardofsimple assignments, but this one taKes the caKe.
Yuck.
Hey.
1 0:43 a.m. I found what appear to be...
Principal Prickly’s golfpants ?
Factis, you’regettin’ realgoodat thisstuff.
Yeah, you’re a regular
Robert De Niro.
Hey, I’m a man ofmany talents.
- Principal Prickly ?
- But wasn’t Mrs. Prickly suspicious ?
You kiddin’ ? It was like taking candy from a baby.
[Laughing Continues]
Double-knit polyester.
These are Prickly’s all right.
But whywould the bald guywanna pretend to be Principal Prickly ?
And where’s the real
Principal Prickly anyway ?
Wait a minute.
There’s something in here.
‘‘Help me ?’’
It sounds like a desperate cry for help.
- Then Principal Prickly must still be in the school.
- Being held captive !
You know what that means, don’tyou, guys ?
We gotta go in there and save him.
- Bikes ?
- Check.
- Walkie-talkie ?
- Check.
- Rope with pointy thing ?
- Check.
Good. Then let’s go.
I still say this is nuts.
Breaking out ofthe school
I understand, but breaking in ?
Oh, boy !
Ms. Finster’s gonna love this.

It’s 9:00 at night, Randall.
- What doyou want ?
- It’s about T.J. Detweiler.
Randall, I’m offduty until Labor Day.
He’s someone else’s problem now.
But he’s got all his friends together, and they’re planning to break into the school !
A break-in, eh ?
Not if Muriel P. Finster has anything to say about it.
- Told you, Ms. Finster.
- [ Chuckles ]
I wonder ifI can get ’em tried as adults. Come on.
Hold the rope, boy.

Yeah. I’ve never been in a empty school at night before.
Heck, I’ll bet no kid has.
I wonderwhere the aliens went.
They probably go back to the mother ship at night.

- Shh ! The bad guys are talking.
- But, Dr. Benedict, please--
- No, let me make this clear toyou, Lazenby.
We have a thing called a window ofopportunity.
Ifwe miss the window ofopportunity, then the project fails.
And ifthe project fails, then I get very, very... angry !
Th-Theymayhave apoint, sir.
It seems the logistical problems are a bit more complicated than Dr. Steinheimer thought.
Yes, it would be a lot easier ifwe could move the laser to a more appropriate location.
This operation will be executed as planned from right here !
Have I made myselfclear ?
- But, sir--
- No buts !
It started at 3rd Street.
It is going to end at 3rd Street.

- Dr. Rosenthal, why did the beam suddenly--
Oh, what’s the technical word for it ? Stop ?
W-Well, uh, as I believe you were told before--
‘‘Told before’’ ?
[ Chuckles ]
Doyou think I care what I was told before ? I’ll do better next time.
‘‘Next time.’’
Isn’t that cute.
Rosenthal, let me askyou something.
Sayyou were a teacher-- or even better, say, the principal ofa school-- and you had to deal with a naughty child who didn’t know his place, who kept telling you over and over that he’d do better ‘‘next time.’’
But he never did.
What would you do ?
Oh, no. N-Not detention.
Not detention !
- Take him away !
- No, please ! I can fix it !
Don’t do this to me-e-e !
All right, who’s second-in-command ?
- Uh, I am, sir.
- Well, good. Nowyou’re in charge.
And ifI wereyou, I’d make sure
I had this machine working at full power by tomorrow morning.

You won’t believe what these guys are doing. They’ve got this big laser gun and--
- Whoa, who tookyour pants ?
- Never mind, Detweiler.Just untie me.
- These knots are tight.
- Ofcourse.
I’ve been pulling at them for the last day and a half.
They’ve chaffed mywrist.
- Don’t worry, sir.
My pals’ll get us out ofhere.
- What makes you so sure ?
You don’t know my friends.
They’ll get help. You’ll see.
Soyou’re saying youjust escaped from a troop ofninja warriors ?
- That’s right !
- And they got a giant laser gun in the school auditorium ?
- Precisely !
- Which is aimed at the moon ?
Thank heavens you understand !
[ Grunts ]
I’ve almost got it.
Careful, Detweiler.
That’s my putting hand.
[DoorLocK UnlocKing]
Hello, Pete.
Remember me ?
Well, well, ifit isn’t
Phillium Benedict.
- I should’ve known you’d be the one behind this.
- You know this guy ?
Ah, Pete and I are old pals.
Although the last time we saw each other, Pete was the one ruining my life.
By the way, Pete, you like this suit ?
It’s Italian. Raw silk. Nice, huh ?
You always were more concerned about appearances than people, Phil.
Oh, Pete, come on.
There’s no need to be rude.
Not after I instructed my men to take such special care ofyou.
Special care ?
That’s whatyou call gagging me, tying me up and taking away my pants ?
Had to. Otherwise, you might run offand betray me, likeyou did the last time.
But, hey, look at the bright side.
At leastyou’ve got company now.
Let the boy go.
He can’t do anything toyou.
[ Sighs ]
Same old noble Pete.
- Always standing up for the rights ofchildren.
- You ?
But, unfortunately,
I can’t let anybody go right now.
You see, this experimental, um, night school that I’m running is kind ofa secret.
I’m trying to show that my...
[ Chuckles ] adult students can be trained... to be capable and productive members ofsociety.
Well, ifyou’rejust running a night school, then what’s that giant laser gun doing in the auditorium ?
What a rude and badly dressed little boyyou are.
You should teach your pupils a little respect for their superiors, Pete.
But that would mean thatyou’d have to know how to teach them anything at all, wouldn’t it ?
Geez, how doyou know thatjerk ?
We went through teacher training together.
- You mean--
- That’s right, Detweiler.
That man is a rogue teacher.
[PricKly]

You gonna be at the teach-in Saturday ?

[ All Giggling ]
So, Phillium, how’s it feel being theyoungest principal in the history ofthe state ?
Copacetic, baby.
I mean, you know what they say:
Young is in, man, and old is out.
Way out.
Doyou like the American flag helmet, Pete ? It does go with the leatherjacket, right ?
You are one groovy educator, Phil.
Cool. Follow me, my man.
I wanna showyou my new principal’s pad.
Whoa !
Psychedelic principalia.
Pull up a bag, bro.
I wanna rap.
- Lay it on me, man.
- You see, Pete, I been thinkin’.
We’re a new generation ofteachers, right ?
It’s time we shook things up a little.
I hearyou, brother.
In fact, dig this.
I was meditating to that new
Ravi Shankar album last night... when I got this righteous notion--
What ifwe hold all our classes outside, on the playground ?
Imagine-- school, recess.
No boundaries.
Hey, baby, that’s a hip idea, but I got a better thought here.
As my first official act as principal,
I’ve decided... to get rid ofrecess.
What ? No recess ?
But, Phil, for a kid, recess is like a major play-in.
It’s the one time ofday they have any freedom.
[ Sighs ]
Look, Pete, the ’60s are over.
All that peace and love and freedom stuff, it was great for pickin’ up chicks, but it’s not gonna help my career.
To do that, I gotta make test scores go up, and to make test scores go up, I gotta keep kids in class where they belong.
That’s why, starting tomorrow,
I am tuning out recess... once and for all.
[PricKly]
Needless tosay,
Phillium ’splan didn’tgo overall that well.
[ Shouting ]
- [ Protester] What do we want ?
- [ Crowd ] Recess !
- When do we want it ?
- Now !
- What do we want ? When do we want it ?
- Recess ! Now !
Be cool, people, be cool.
You’re bumming my mellowness.
We’ll be cool when you give our kids their recess back.
Hey, baby,
I’ll do what I want.
I’m principal ofthe school, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Dig ?
[ Shouting Continues ]
[Man]
It’snotright!
- People, people, please calm down.
- [ Shouting Stops ]
Mr. Prickly here has informed me ofthis ‘‘no recess’’ proposal.
Let me assureyou that as long as I’m superintendent, this radical plan will never be carried out in this district.
- [ Cheering ]
- Hey, man, youjust don’t get it !
Ofcourse I do, Benedict.
- That’s why I’m replacing you.
- What ?
- Prickly, from now on, you will be principal.
- Who, me ?
Oh, I see what’s going down here.
You tricked me, went around my back to the man to get myjob !
- No, Phil, it’s not like that at all.
- Yeah, right !
Come on, Muriel baby, let’s blow this scene.
No, Phil, it’s over. I could never be with a man who doesn’t love recess.
Soyou’re against me too.
Well, fine. I don’t need you.
I don’t need anyone !
- Aaah !
- Phil ! You okay, man ?
Don’t touch me !
You took my chick.
You took myjob.
Well, enjoy it whileyou can,
Petey boy,
’causeyou’re gonna pay.
Somehow, someway, you’re gonna pay.
IneversawPhillium again.
He quit teaching, went into politics, eventually became secretary ofeducation-- until the president fired him for trying to get rid ofrecess again.
Only this time it was nationwide.
So that guy’s some weirdo ex-teacher who wants to get rid ofrecess ?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Now it’s personal.
Let’s see-- weather maps, some stuffin Norwegian, a Farmer’sAlmanac.
Must be something in here that’ll explain what that Dr. Benedict is doing.
I’ll tell you one thing he’s not doing-- having lunch tomorrow at 1 2:22 with his little girlfriend.
Spinelli, that’s the man’s personal date book.
Well, it’s mine now, and I guess Miss Luna Pergum is gonna be at the restaurant all by herself.
- Who did you say ?
- The girl whose name is in here-- Luna Pergum.
Must be some Italian chick.
Lunaeperigeum.
Ofcourse !
- What areyou talking about ?
- Don’tyou understand ?
Lunaeperigeum is no lady.
It’s an event. Look.
Once a month, the moon reaches the point where it’s closest to the Earth-- lunar perigee, which in this case happens to be 1 2:22 tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe that’s when that doctor guy is gonna shoot his laser at the moon and blow it up.
Close guess, but I have another theory.
When I was up at space camp,
I observed some abnormalities in the moon’s position.
I couldn’t figure out what was causing it, but now it all makes sense.
Dr. Benedict’s device is not a laser beam at all. It’s a tractor beam !
You mean he’s gonna plow the moon’s surface ? Whateverwill he plant ?
Not a tractor, you goombah.
A tractor beam.
Like from a science fiction movie.
Precisely.
Theoretically, ifa powerful tractor beam... were shot at the moon exactly at lunar perigee, it could move the moon into another orbit.
Move the moon ? But why would anybodywant to do that ?
Who knows, Vince ?
Who knows ?
[Banging On Metal]
Here we are, sir.
I can’t believeyou have been creeping around in these vents.
They’re school property.
Dang ! The line’s dead.
Hey, what did you do with the walkie-talkie you confiscated from me last week ?
Top drawer, on the right.
Just lookwhat Phil’s done to my office.
I had it all nice and clean for the summer.
Packs ofgum, yo-yos, my old baseball--
Hey, I’ve been looking for this.
Here it is-- mywalkie-talkie.
Now all I gotta do is contact the guys and--
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Detweiler ?
I told ’em that guywas a nut.
[ T.J. ] Hello !
Hello ! Is anybody there ?
It’s T.J. !
T.J., buddy, you’re okay ?
- Yeah, I’m fine, and so is Principal Prickly.
- Principal Prickly ?
I don’t have time to explain, but I thinkwe’ve figured out what Benedict is up to.
He’s trying to get rid ofsummervacation !
No !
Guys, don’t freak out on me !
I got a plan ! All we do is--
Heh-heh. Why, Mr. Bald Guy, what a surprise.
T.J. ! T.J. !
- It’s dead !
- They must’ve got him !
What are we gonna do ?
There’s only one thing we can do: we gotta get help.
[ Becky] Bow-wow ! Welcome to Floppy
Burger. May I takeyour order, please ?
- Becky, this is Vince.
- [ Becky] What areyou doing here ?
It’s notjust Vince, it’s me,
Gretchen, everybody. We got a problem !
I got a problem too-- six dweeby ten-year-olds who won’t leave me alone, even when I’m at work.
I am a professional ! So whatever your little problem is, forget it !
- But it’s about T.J .
- He’s in trouble, and he needs your help.
[ Becky ]
Well, isn’t that nice ?
After stealing my diary, threatening to put it on the Internet... and making me drive across the state three times, he needs my help ?
Give me one good reason why I should help him.
’Cause he’s your little brother, and he needs you.
Please pull forward to the second drive-thru window.
A confiscated walkie-talkie.
Why doyou do these things ? Doyou enjoy tormenting me ? Doyou hate me ?
I don’t hateyou, Phil.
I just thinkyou’re insane.
[ Chuckles ]
Insane.
Well, thereyou go again, Pete.
Insulting me, hurting my feelings,
Just like 30 years ago.
Only this time, Petey,
I’m ready.
You see, all thoseyears, no matter how big I got, no matter how successful,
I always thought aboutyou.
Howyou embarrassed me !
Howyou humiliated me !
Howyou destroyed my relationship with Muriel Finster, the onlywoman I ever loved !
- That part still grosses me out, sir.
- Shh.
This time, Pete,
I’m gonna humiliateyou.
I’m gonna prove to the world thatyou were wrong and I was right.
- About what ?
- About recess !
About freedom !
About test scores !
I’ve found a way to prove my theory.
I’m gonna get rid of the biggest recess ofthem all.
I am gonna get rid ofsummervacation.
- You fiend !
- ‘‘Fiend.’’ Try to help people, that’s the thanks you get.
- It’ll neverwork, Phil.
- Well, actually, Pete, that’s whereyou’re wrong.
You see, all I have to do is modify the moon’s orbit ever so slightly, and tide levels on the Eastern Seaboard rise eight feet.
Move the moon over here, and the currents that warm California suddenly become ice-cold.
Summer, as we know it, will become a thing ofthe past.
And without summer,
- [ Both Gasp ]
- no summervacation.
- You’ll never get away with this, Benedict.
- Oh, yeah ?
Well, who’s gonna stop me ?
Wow, I can’t believe my little brother... actually stumbled on a real, live evil conspiracy.
- That’s ourTheodore.
- You should see the crates ofsoda they left back there.
And boxes ofmustard and ketchup too.
Mmm, tomato-ey.
Hey, that’s stuffs the property of
Floppy Burger International.
Quityour gabbin’ and step on it.
We need reinforcements.
[Cheering, Shouting]
[Cheering, Shouting]
[Finster] I’m tellingyou, a troop ofninja warriors... is using3rdStreetSchoolas asecretjujitsu trainingground.
- Ninja warriors. Elementary school.
- [ Snickering ]
Jujitsu training ground ?
Hey, lady, aren’tyou forgetting the magic laser beam ?
- I’m serious !
- So are we.
Hey, I got an idea-- Why don’tyou go home, get some rest... and we’ll make a personal call toJackie Chan.
Yeah, he’s the perfect man for ajob like this.
I’m telling ya, something is going on in that school !
Help ! Help !
Somebody get us outta here !
- Calm down, Detweiler.
- Calm down ?
We’re locked in a giant birdcage while a madman’s trying to destroy summervacation, and you want me to calm down ?
- I understand, but I--
- How can you understand ?
You’rejust a grownup.
What doyou know about summervacation ?
I’ll letyou in on a little secret, Detweiler.
Every adultyou’ve ever known was a kid some time in his life.
You thinkwe don’t remember summervacation ?
Riding bikes by the creek ?
Catching polliwogs in ajar ?
Camping out under the stars ?
Well, you’re wrong.
Some days I sit in my office, looking out atyou kids on the playground, and I think, ‘‘They don’t know how good they’ve got it.
In a fewyears, they’re all going to be grownups, like me, and all those good times will
Just be memories for them too.’’
So go ahead, put a whoopee cushion in my chair, cover my carpet with fake vomit, make fun of my big, saggy butt.
But don’tyou ever say I don’t care about summervacation,
’cause those memories are the last part ofchildhood I’ve got left.
Principal Prickly,
I had no idea.
Yeah, well, nowyou do.
- So let’s stop messing around.
- How did you get those keys ?
Swiped ’em off Phillium’s desk when he wasn’t looking.
Now come on.
We’ve got a summervacation to save.
[ All Chattering ]
People ! People !
Just quiet down for a moment !
Oh, man, nobody’s listening.
They’ll listen to me, once I introduce them to my good friend Madam Fist.
Come on, Spinelli.
That’s your answer for everything.
I don’t seeyou coming up with any great ideas, sports boy.
Listen to the two ofyou.
You’re not helping at all.
[ All Arguing ]
[Gus]
Quiet!
What we need is a leader.
A kid with the right training.
A kid who knows strategy and field tactics.
A kid who commands respect.
Yeah, but where we gonna find a kid like that ?
Leave that to me.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
-[Gretchen Whistles]
Please !
We have to get organized.
Ah, what’s the use ?
Ifwhatyou say is true, all the fun ofbeing a kid is, like, totally ruined anyway.
- It’s like the whole world’s been turned right side up.
- [ All Agreeing ]
Not necessarily. All we have to do is work together and come up with a plan.
- Detweiler’s the one who always comes up with the plans.
- Let’s face it-- we’re doomed.
- [ All Agreeing ]
-[Spinelli] That’s what you thinK!
Kids ofthe playground, meet your new commanding officer.
Griswald ? He couldn’t lead a glee club.
You find that funny,
Bradley ?
Well, I’m not here to makejokes !
I’m here to make history !
So ifyou wanna laugh, take it somewhere else.
But ifyou wanna save the world, then suck in your gut and stand at attention.
Now who’s with me ?
[Kazoos Playing
‘‘RiverKwaiMarch’’]
[ Screams ]
Soda bomb ! Soda bomb !
[Gus] Vince, youandtheAshleys willbein charge ofunit ‘A. ’’
I’ll take unit ‘‘B.’’
Spinelli, you get the special forces.
- Special forces ?
- The kindergartners.
- I oweyou for this, Griswald.
- Now there’s one last thing
I need to say.
- [ Talking Ceases ]
- This mission is bigger than any one ofus kids.
Bigger than T.J .
Even bigger than Principal Prickly.
This, my friends, is about the future.
- Geez, he sounds like T.J .
- Shh. He’s on a roll.
Years from now when kids who aren’t even born yet look back on this moment, they’ll say,
‘‘They did it.
Those kids saved
3rd Street School.
They saved summervacation.’’
So, boys and girls, we’re goin’ in.
- Twenty-two minutes to perigee, sir.
- Very good, Fenwick.

We’ll take care ofhim.
Don’t worry about it.
You sure this is gonna work, Detweiler ?
Come on, Principal Prickly.
Don’tyou everwatch old spy movies ?
This trick is pure gold.
Uh, Dr. Benedict wanted to speak to us about a very important matter.
Hey, you two aren’t guards.
Run !
¯ I’m called little buttercup ¯
Anderson, Morrissey, Underhill ?
Where is everybody ?
Aah, ifyou want something done right, you gotta do ityourself.
- ¯ Poor little buttercup ¯

Boy, these space-age power shovels sure do a greatjob.
Quick, in here.

‘‘Lunch room, front office--’’
Here it is, ‘‘auditorium.’’
[ Loud Hum Resonating ]
Uh, Fenwick, why is the power off ?
Uh, perhaps we blew a fuse, sir ?
Well, go fix it !
We must restore the power.
Quickly, here.
Hey, whathappened?
Letus out!
Plan’s working, Gus.
Good. Now we gotta stop that laser beam before it’s too late.
That’s whatyou thinK, Kid.
Youbratsare done for.
[TJ. ]
Hey, baldy!
Sayyour prayers.
It’s chowder time.
[ Screaming ]
- Bull’s-eye !
- T.J. !
I knewyou guys would come back for us.
- Ooh, that’s gotta hurt.
- Six minutes to perigee !
Quick. To the auditorium.
And no running in the halls !
Emergency power system is in place.
Switch on the global electrode.
Power up the photon channeler.
Activate the tractor beam, quickly !
We’ve only got four minutes left.
[PricKly]
You’vegotnominutes left, Phil.
This is my school and I want it back.
Sorry, Pete. You’rejust gonna have to wait until I finish making the world a better place.
- Now let’s get this show on the road.
- Don’t do it, Dr. Benedict !
[ Chuckles ] Don’t do it ?
You think after all this planning, all this work, you can get me to stopjust by saying, ‘‘Don’t do it’’ ?
- What ifwe add ‘‘please’’ ?
- [ Sighs ] You kids
Just don’t get it, doyou ?
Well, let me explain this in a wayyour little uneducated brains will understand.
The American public think test scores are too low.
But ifa person, say me, could make test scores go up, why, everybody’d feel better.
They might even elect that person...
President ofthe United States.
Now, doyou have any idea which countries have the highest test scores ?
- Um,Japan ?
- Germany ?
- Tierra Del Fuego ?
Canada, Iceland, Norway !
And why ? Because it’s snowing up there all the time.
Kids don’t waste their summers playing ball. They’re inside studying.
And that is why I’m getting rid ofsummervacation once and for all.
You got it all wrong, old man.
Your plan will neverwork.
Sure, maybeyour crazy laser beam can move the moon.
Maybe it can even make it snow all summer.
Maybeyou can get rid oflong afternoons playing baseball, or sunny days down by the lake orwarm nights camping out under the stars.
But that won’t stop us.
We’ll ride our bikes through the snow.
We’ll play kick ball in the slush, we’ll camp out in igloos.
You may take away summer, butyou’ll never take away summervacation.
Well, I can try.
Do it... now !
Yes, sir.
Begin photon channeling.
Photon channeling begun.
Setmagnification coordinates.073.
- Coordinates set.
- Engage tractor beam.
- No !
- [LoudBang]
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone !
- Ms. Finster.
- Muriel, it’s you.
You’re still a vision ofloveliness.
Yeah ?Andyou’restilla two-bit, recess-hatingprettyboy.
That hurt, Muriel. But I’ll forgiveyou ifyou’ll just come back to me.
Ha ! I’d rather eat playground dirt.
That can be arranged, my dear.
Not before I takeyou down.

I don’t know, Muriel. I’m only supposed to use it for self-defense.
What an exciting summer.
T.J. saved the world... and Becky made assistant fry chefat Floppy Burger.
Come on, Ellie. The reporters wanna talk to us about how we raised a hero.
Listen, Becky, I heard about howyou saved my life and everything, and...
- well, here, I think this is yours.
- My diary ?
I can’t believe it. You realize this means you don’t have any leverage over me anymore ?
Hey, what can I say ?
Maybe I’m just growing up.
Gee, you’re an all-right little brother after all.
But, Teej, what about the extra copies you got stashed away up in the tree house ?
Oh, I wasjust bluffing about those.
So, Teej, we got two weeks ofsummervacation left.
What doyou saywe do ’em up right ?
But don’tyou guys have to get back to camp, work on your futures and all ?
Well, we’ve been thinkin’.
And we’ve decided there’s plenty oftime for preparing for our futures.
But only a little time left forjust being kids.
So, what doyou saywe head down to the pond and skip some rocks ?
You guys gotyourselves a deal.
Oh, boy ! My first summervacation memories.
Uh, guys.
- I’ll catch up with you.
I forgot something inside.
- Okay, but hurry.
- Principal Prickly ?
- Huh ?
Oh, it’s you, Detweiler.
I wasjust, um, cleaning up this mess
Phillium left.
Guyalways wasapacK rat.
Look at this. A Norwegian weather map from 1 956.
Listen, sir, I never really got a chance to thankyou for all the stuffyou did.
You know, quitting your golfgame, telling Benedict to let me go, helping me save the world andjunk.
Oh, actually, Detweiler,
I’m the one who should be thanking you.
- Huh ?
- You did me a big favor by dragging me into this mess.
See, I didn’t get into teaching for the promotions or the pension plans... or so I could get to the golfcourse by 3:45.
I-- I... did it ’cause I wanted to helpyou kids. And I’d forgotten that.
- Till today.
- [KnocKing On Window]
- Come on, Teej.
- The pond awaits.
- I’ll be there in a second.
- Hey, it’s a gorgeous summer day and your pals are waiting.
Go have some fun whileyou can... Teej.
You got it... Pete.

Yeah, baby.
Hi, I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous.
I may just be a small-town
FBI agent-slash-single mother...
...but I'm still tough and sexy.
Well, Miss Normous, shall we shag now...
...or shag later?
Oh, Austin, behave.
Hey, Powers.
You better watch your frigging self...
...because this is one doctor who does make house calls.
Right, Mini Me?
Hey, assholes.
I'm right over here. I'm Mini Me.
Come and get me.
And cut.
That's a cut, everybody.
Moving on. Check the gate, please.
So, Austin, what'd you think of the opening credits?
Well, I can't believe
Sir Steven Spielberg...
...the grooviest filmmaker in the history of cinema...
...is making a movie about my life.
Very shagadelic, baby. Yeah.
Having said that,
I do have some thoughts.
Really?
Uh, my friend here thinks it's fine the way it is.
Well, no offense, Sir Stevie...
...but you've got to have mojo, baby.
Yeah.
Hit it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Quincy Jones.
Yeah.
This is where the movie gets its mojo, baby.
Groovy, yes.
Quiet, everybody. Music video, take two.
It's Britney Spears.
Oops, I did it again, baby. Yeah.
I love you!
Yeah.
Welcome back, Herr Doctor.
How was space?
Space was cool. Wasn't it, Mini Me?
Dr. Evil, while you were in space...
...I created a way for us to make huge sums of legitimate money...
...and still maintain the ethics and the business practices...
...of an evil organization.
I have turned us into a talent agency:
The Hollywood Talent Agency.
- Really?
- By charging A-list clients 9 percent...
...rather than the traditional 10 percent, we've been able to sign such stars...
...as George Clooney...
Julia Roberts...
- Hey.
...and Leo DiCaprio.
Leo.
And the best part of the whole scheme is we all get our own assistants.
Hi, I'm Number Three.
Whoa!
I'm really excited to be part of the team here at HTA.
Very impressive, Number Two...
...but I finally have the perfect plan.
In the '70s, there lived a Dutch metallurgical hedonist...
...by the name of Johann van der Smut.
He loved gold so much...
...he even lost his genitalia in an unfortunate smelting accident.
Hence the name...
...Goldmember.
He invented a cold-fusion power unit...
...for a "tractor beam"...
"Tractor beam"...
...powerful enough to pull a meteor to Earth.
The meteor was called...
..."Midas 22."
It's made of solid gold.
Is he sleeping?
Well, that's okay.
I guess Mini Me won't get any...
...chocolate!
You want down, Mini Me?
Use your words like a big boy clone.
He's okay.
Here's the chocolate.
It's from Bruges. That's in Belgium.
That's where Daddy's from. Yeah.
Check out Mini Me.
Yeah. He's gone mental on account of the chocolate.
It's like fricking catnip for clones.
- Your chair, Dr. Evil.
- Thank you.
Whoa!
Thanks. Skedaddle. Right.
You know, when you have kids...
...I think you're gonna find that all kids are different, eh?
For example, Mini Me loves chocolate.
Scotty don't.
- What, I like chocolate fine, I just...
- Scotty don't.
Well, this is very familiar. Hang on, let me do what I do. "Uh, would you stop?"
How about I what?
What are you...?
I don't even... Honestly, isn't this...?
How about you don't?
Ladies and gentlemen, Scotty Don't.
Ahem. Dr. Evil, perhaps it's time that you finished unveiling your plan.
Yes, thank you, Number Two.
Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is...
- Scotty don't.
- Come on. You're such a lame-ass.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is...
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, so we're...
You know, this is causing me serious psychological harm.
I don't know. Who am I?
Fine. You know what?
I would love some chocolate.
Here you go.
Thank you. Perfect.
Heel, Mini Me.
Heel.
Come on. Got me a marlin. Yeah.
You okay, Mini Me?
Yeah? Did I pull too hard?
I don't want to hurt you.
- Dr. Evil.
- Yeah?
What does Goldmember's plan have to do with us?
Our early attempts at a tractor beam went through several preparations.
Preparations A through G were a failure.
But now, ladies and gentlemen...
...we finally have a working tractor beam which we shall call:
"Preparation H."
What?
Why don't you just call it
"Operation Ass Cream", you ass.
I'm sorry, did you want some ice cream?
Yes. I'd love some chocolate ass cream.
Perhaps later.
- Dr. Evil, I love your plan.
- Yeah, eh?
Ja, Herr Doctor, it's a really good plan.
Yes, Frau, on the whole,
I think Preparation H feels good.
- What is it now?
- No, nothing. You know what, I agree.
Preparation H does feel good on the hole.
Well, I'm glad we're sprechen Sie the same lingitty, ja.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...using my time machine,
I shall travel back to 1975...
...pick up Goldmember and bring him back to the future.
And the best part of this plan is...
...no one can stop me.
Not even...
...Austin Powers.
Not so fast.
You're surrounded, Dr. Evil.
Shit.
Dr. Evil, the World Court sentences you to 400 years.
Do you have anything to say?
No, but I think Mini Me does.
Order! I will have order!
Looks like two eggs in a hanky.
The criminal genius known as Dr. Evil and his clone...
...were sentenced today at the World Organization.
For his efforts, Austin Powers...
...son of England's most famous spy,
Nigel Powers...
...will be knighted by the queen at Buckingham Palace.
Arise, Sir Austin Powers.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Your father must be very proud of you.
- Oh, yeah.
Come on, Dad, stand up and take a bow.
Daddy?
Dad?
Daddy
Daddy wasn't there
Daddy
Daddy wasn't there
To take me to the fair
It seems he doesn't care
Daddy wasn't there
When I was first baptized
When I was criticized
When I was ostracized
When I was Jazzercised
Steak and kidney pies
One-hour Martinize
When I was circumcised
Daddy wasn't there
To take me to the fair
To change my underwear
Daddy wasn't there
"Daddy Wasn't There." Peace.
I am a sexy beast.
Yes.
Bangs. Yes, how's it going?
The robot. Haven't seen that in a while.
- It's Austin Powers! You so funny.
Well, you know.
Also, very sexiful. Can I have autograph?
Of course. Your name is...?
Fook Mi.
Oh, behave, baby. Yes.
- Now, your name is...?
- Fook Mi.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Fook Mi. Like this.
Oh, I see!
Your name is Fook Mi.
- You want drink?
- Yes, of course.
You know, I have a private bar in the back that you're more than welcome to use...
Here you go.
Fook Mi, that was fast.
Fook Yu.
You're going the right way for a smacked bottom...
...and I don't care who knows it.
Austin.
This is my twin sister. Her name Fook Yu.
Fook Yu.
Fook Mi.
See?
Twins. Twins.
Twins. Yes.
We're going to see the twins. Yes.
I also think Austin Powers very sexiful.
We think you are very gravy, baby.
Do we make you sleepy?
Well, you make me many things, but sleepy's not one of them.
We give you top-secret massage.
Yes, top-secret massage, baby.
Sorry about that.
I swear to God that never happens.
Yes, hold on a tic.
Okay...
Okay. Now, where were we, babies? Yes.
Ah, Austin. I'm sorry to interrupt.
Twins, Basil. Twins.
Austin, it's your father.
- Bye-bye.
- What?
- Bye.
- He's been kidnapped.
Very heavy, man.
Oh. So that's why my father wasn't at the knighting ceremony.
Well, no, actually.
He was kidnapped affer you were knighted.
He was last seen on his yacht.
Ah, yes, the HMS Shag-at-Sea.
Exactly. Just take a look.
Gentlemen, fall in.
Austin, these men were assigned to guard your father.
Okay, chaps. Chins up, trousers down.
I think we may have found a clue.
Cor blimey. All your privates have had their privates painted gold.
How bizarre.
Imagine, gilded tallywhackers...
...golden wedding tackle,
14-karat trouser snakes...
- That's enough.
- Okay.
Basil, there's only one person in the world...
...who truly understands the psychology of a madman.
Dr. Evil.
I've been expecting you, Mr. Powers.
My father is missing.
Yes, I heard. How ironic.
You finally caught me, yet now you need me more than ever.
But then again, you've always needed me, haven't you, Mr. Powers?
Remember when I told you we're not so different, you and I?
We're not so different, you and I.
See? I did say that.
Very clever. Now, who has my father?
Someone has some daddy issues.
Nothing could be my father from the truth.
Ooh! You said, "my father."
- No, I dadn't.
- Hey-oh!
Didn't. Did not.
She-ba.
- For me, this is a dad issue.
- Ha...
Dead issue. Dead dad.
Deadbeat dad. Daddy didn't love me.
It seems the knighting ceremony wasn't the only time...
...your daddy let you down.
Remember that day at the academy?
Think.
It was graduation.
Yeah, baby, yeah.
Do I make you horny, baby?
Oh, yes, that's the spot. Right there.
You're a naughty one. Yes, you are.
Hello, vicar. Crikey!
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?
Right.
We were just getting started.
Bye, love.
Don't forget, Master Powers, later you have a brief oral exam.
Well, I hope it's mostly oral and not too...
...brief, baby.
You know, "brief" and "oral exam"...
Marks are in, lads.
It looks like Master Evil is the top contender...
...for this year's
International Man of Mystery.
He's number one in the class.
Whoop-de-do, Basil.
Hey, everybody, I'm number one.
Who cares?
Hello, I'm Number Two.
Nice to meet you, Number Two...
...but now I'm going to be named this year's International Man of Mystery.
Yeah, right.
Shut your gob.
Who throws a cupcake? Honestly.
And now it's time to award our greatest honor.
This year's International
Man of Mystery is...
...Austin Powers.
Well done, Austin.
Jolly good.
Top notch.
We're proud of you.
Very well done, indeed.
It's always been my dream to win this award, just like my dad.
And I'm glad he could be here.
Stand up, Dad. Take a bow.
Dad?
Daddy?
Boo-frickity-hoo.
I had the best grades in the class and I didn't get diddlysquat.
- Here we go.
- Tell me, Mr. Powers...
...what did you find on those sailors?
A golden surprise, perhaps?
How did...? Yes.
All the sailors had their meat and two veg painted gold.
Yes, it's the distinctive calling card of a criminal mastermind.
The aptly named...
...Goldmember.
How can I find this Goldmember?
Quid pro quo, Mr. Powers.
Yes, squid pro row.
I'll give you Goldmember, you give me a transfer to a regular prison...
...so that I could be with my beloved Mini Me.
Okay, I'll get you a transfer to a regular prison.
Now, where's Goldmember?
Not where, Mr. Powers...
...but when.
1975. Studio 69 Disco. New York City.
Corner of 69th and 8th.
You go now, Mr. Powers.
Fly, fly.
I'll get it.
Instead of hiding your father in some remote location...
...Goldmember is hiding him in 1975.
So our engineers have crafted this vehicle...
...to time-travel to the '70s.
Smashing, Basil. A pimpmobile.
Oh, yes, yes.
I knew it would tickle your fancy.
What can I say? Look.
Cough.
Here we go, 1975.
Good luck, Austin.
Yeah, baby! Yeah!
Solid Gold
Solid Gold
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold
It's solid gold, baby
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold

He's got the Midas touch
But he touched it too much
Hey, Goldmember
He's got a golden pad
He's super bad
Hey, Goldmember
Good evening, everybody, and welcome to Studio 69.
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen.
It's Goldmember!
Hey, everybody, I am from Holland.
Isn't that weird? Yes. Ha, ha.
He's got the Midas touch
But he touched it too much
Hey, Goldmember
Yoah
Hey, Goldmember
You're gettin' down tonight
- Ow!
You're dynamite
Hey, Goldmember
- Goldmember
- Hey, Goldmember
'Cause that's the way, uh-huh
Uh-huh
He likes it, uh-huh
Uh-huh
Goldmember
Goldmember
He loves it
He loves it
'Cause that's the way, uh-huh
- Uh-huh
- He likes it, uh-huh
- Uh-huh
- Goldmember
Goldmember
He loves it
He loves it
He's got the Midas touch
He touched it too much
Hey, Goldmember
Hey, Goldmember
- Goldmember
He's from the Netherlands
- It's where he learned to dance
- Hey, Goldmember
- Gold, Goldmember
- Hey, Goldmember
Hey, Goldmember
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold
It's solid gold, baby
- Goldmember's so solid
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold
- It's gold
- It's solid gold, baby
His member's so gold
Yes, it is, yeah
Well, if it isn't Austin Powers.
I'm sorry?
You got a lot of nerve dragging your jive white ass in here.
I don't believe we've met.
It's me. Foxxy!
Foxxy Cleopatra!
Long time, no see.
Stop!
We can't be seen talking to each other, you dig?
I'm using this cat as a distraction.
I get it. Yes, very clever.
First things first.
Ow! Ouch-kabibble!
Eight years and no phone call?
Nobody stands up Foxxy Cleopatra!
Where have you been?
Listen, Foxxy.
I just want you to know
I never intended to hurt you, baby.
Well, all I know is...
...Mama only got a taste of honey...
...but she wanted the whole beehive.
Oh, beehive.
Yes, "beehive."
You always knew how to make me smile.
Well, you know, it's a gift, really. I, um...
Ugh, what am I doing?
Foxxy, what are you doing in Goldmember's club?
I'm undercover.
About a year ago, my partner at the bureau was killed.
And that jive-ass turkey Goldmember is the prime suspect.
Your father's in the back room, under heavy guard.
- Thanks, Foxxy.
- Austin! Good luck.
Oh!
- Dad!
- Hello, son.
Just overpowering my guards. Heh, heh.
I'm here to rescue you. Come quickly.
I've got a better idea.
Why don't you rescue me in about...
...what, seven or eight minutes, eh?
Ha, ha.
Oh, knock it off.
I don't want to see my dad on the job.
Come on, let's go.
- Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, girls.
No.
I've got to go, it's my boy. Hold on.
- What's wrong with your neck?
- I took a Viagra.
It got stuck in my throat.
I've had a stiff neck for hours.
I thank you.
Listen, Dad, if you are gonna talk about naughty things...
...in front of these American girls...
...then at least speak "English" English.
All right, my son.
I could've had it away with this cracking Judy, my old china.
Are you telling pork pies and a bag of tripe?
Because if you are feeling quiggly, why not just have a J. Arthur?
- What, Billy No-Mates?
- Too right, youth.
Don't you remember the din-din with the grotty Scottish bint?
Oh, the one that was all sixes and sevens?
The trouble and strife of the Morris dancer that lived up the apples and pears.
Yes, yes, she was the barrister that became a bobby in a lorry...
...with a Gatling gun in and above St. Regis...
...tea kettle.
Yes.
Then she...
Shat on a turtle.
- Oh, God, we had some good times, eh?
- We had some good times, eh?
- Wonderful times, we had.
- Good times, yeah.
We had some good, uh...
...times.
Welcome to 1975...
...Austin Powers and father.
Excuse me while I change.
The roller boogie has made me sweaty.
Yeah, sweaty.
You see, Mr. Powers...
...I love gold.
The look of it, the taste of it...
...the smell of it, the texture.
I love gold so much...
...that I even lost my genitalia in an unfortunate smelting accident.
Hence the name...
...Goldmember.
We are both swingers, you see? Ha, ha.
You have a tight body. Yes.
I see that from your tight pants.
Yes, you are tight like a tiger.
Would you like a smoke and a pancake?
- A what?
- A smoke and a pancake.
You know, flapjack and a cigarette?
All right. Cigar and a waffle?
No? Pipe and a crepe?
- No? Bong and a blintz?
No.
Ah, well. Then there is no pleasing you.
That's not right.
Ooh, hello. What have we here?
That's a keeper. Yes.
Put it in the skin box, please.
With the others.
- I'm peeling.
- Oh, that's just disgusting.
Quickly. Quickly. Thank you.
Save me from myself.
You're insane, Goldmember.
And that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it.
KC and the Sunshine Band.
All right, Goldmember, don't play the laughing boy.
There are only two things
I can't stand in this world:
People who are intolerant of other people's cultures...
...and the Dutch.
What?
Take the father away.
Dutch-hater. And now, ha, ha, it is time to say goodbye.
Dr. Evil's orders.
Which for you is bad news, bears.
Walter Matthau.
Shazam.
Up yours, jive turkey.
Traitor.
Yes, the gun.
Good, very good.
They're taking my father to the time machine.
- The say-what machine?
Come on, now. Ha, ha.
No!
- This way, sugar.
That was close, Foxxy. I owe you one.
Austin, I found this in Goldmember's office.
It's a microfilm. It may be a clue.
- Smashing.
- I want to go to the future with you.
We can catch Goldmember together.
I owe it to my partner.
I should warn you, Foxxy,
2002 is very different.
Well, heh, the future better get ready for me.
Because I'm Foxxy Cleopatra and I'm a whole lot of woman.
2002, here we come.
All visitations limited to five minutes.
No spitting in the visitors' room.
Herr Doctor...
...I have some news.
It's your son.
He wants to take over the family business.
Scotty does?
Oh, he's gotten so evil, he has even started losing his hair.
I know, it's sweet.
Oh, he just wants to make you proud,
Herr Doctor.
After all, it's hard on the boy not having a father.
You know, first you were frozen, then you were in space, now you're in jail.
Well, don't tell me he feels neglected.
I was adopted by fricking Belgians, eh?
You were adopted?
I never met my birth parents.
There was a car accident.
I'm told it was a beautiful Belgian day.
The smell of waffles and Brussels sprouts filled the summer air...
...until...
My birth mother was incinerated.
I only survived because her smoking carcass...
...formed a protective cocoon of slaughtered human effluence.
A Belgian man and his 15-year-old love slave with webbed feet...
...was looting the accident scene.
They came across a blood-soaked baby, moi.
They raised me to be evil.
You know, that old chestnut.
But nothing compares to this, being inside the belly of the beast...
...night after night, all alone.
Daddy's all pent up. Let's freak!
Oh!
Time's up.
Visiting hours are over. Step to the line.
Cuffs up.
Move it.
Hi, there.
How you sleeping? Good?
Gentlemen, listen up, y'all.
Here's the new plan:
You're gonna start a riot...
...and we're gonna walk out the front door.
Hey, man.
I know guys on crack that makes more sense than you.
Really?
Then let me put it to you this way, cuz.
Yeah.
- Instead of treated
- We get tricked
- Instead of kisses
- We get kicked
It's the hard knock
I don't know how to be
No crib on MTV
God only knows
Got my Mini Me in the G.P.
See how it goes
Evil's all that I see
And you ask me my name?
D to the rizzo
E to the vizzo
I to the lizzo
I'm a crazy
Y'all knew that
Austin caught me in the first act
It's all backwards, what's with that?
So I'll make a prophecy
From the dogs to the Mini Me
Give me an Escalade, a two-way
Bling bling on eBay
Domino
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it
Instead of treated
This is for all my homeys in Bruges
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Ah, Cristal.
My Moto.
A couple of beyotches.
Why not?
I gotta bust a move
Drop and bust a groove
Feelin' fine, got an evil crew
Goldmember too
Lick my 9
Till then I'll... on my... butt
Brains out
Put... on call
And splooge in your... that's all
Fo' shizzle my nizzle, y'all
Yeah.
All right, listen up.
Tonight, 8 p.m., you're going to start a riot.
Yes, Dr. Evil.
Attention, all guards.
There is a riot in progress.
Seal all exits.
Attention. Dr. Evil and his clone are trying to escape.
All guards report to Cell Block A immediately.
Dr. Evil and his clone are getting away.
There you are.
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Good morning.
How did you sleep?
- Great.
- Me too. If these lips could talk.
Mm. Oh, hello.
You have the right to remain sexy, sugar.
Oh. I hope there's a search involved.
You've got mail.
So, what does this thing do?
Well, it's called the Internet...
...and it's completely revolutionized the way we live...
...and access vital information.
For example, have a look at this:
Oh, look at the monkey.
Oh, he's got his finger on his...
Oh, no. Wetch out.
Wow. Now, that's vital information.
I know. It's amazing.
Oh, Basil. What's happening, baby?
A lot is happening, Foxxy.
Dr. Evil has escaped.
The good news is that one of our agents...
...has managed to infiltrate
Dr. Evil's organization.
Excellent. We've been trying for years to get a mole inside Dr. Evil's lair.
- We now have that mole.
- Yes.
And here he is.
So you're the...
Mo...
Most. Most.
- Most.
- Most excellent agent we've ever seen.
Yes, most excellent agent we've ever seen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, I wasn't able to get an exact location, but I did learn...
...that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair outside of Tokio, Japan.
By the way, I realize that I have a large mole on my face.
Where? Ha, ha.
What? Where's that mole? Heh, heh.
I didn't see one.
I also realize the irony that I am myself a mole.
No one would make that connection.
Anyway, well done, old chap.
Jolly good work.
Yes, nice to mole you... Meet you.
Nice to meet your mole.
- Don't say "mole."
- Stop.
- I said "mole."
- Stop.
Stop.
- Bye.
Mole.
Mole.
Stop.
- Mole.
- Oh, shut up!
Moley-moley-moley-moley-moley.
Up, periscope.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to my new submarine lair.
It's long and hard and full of seamen.
Nothing? No?
Not even a titter?
Tough sub.
Dr. Evil, you look very tight.
Yes, tight like a tiger.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Really?
Yes, you look like a macho man.
Village People.
You know, Goldmember...
...I don't think that's something one dude should say to another dude.
Yeah. A little creepy.
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
This is a keeper. Oi.
Yes.
All right, you're not gonna put that skin in your mouth, are you?
You did. Okay, that's just gross.
Yes, salty. Yes, that was good.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...as you know...
...we've been designing a "tractor beam"...
...code-named Preparation H.
It's powerful enough to pull the meteor...
..."Midas 22" into a collision course with the Earth.
Upon entering the atmosphere, the hot ball of magma...
...will strike and melt the polar icecaps, causing a global flood.
But enough of my technical mumbo jumbo.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Lower the globe.
Lower the globe!
Well, congratulations, numbnuts.
You've succeeded in turning me into a fricking jack-in-the-box.
Get it off. Get it off. It's dark, it's dark.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Release the meteor.
Release the meteor!
No way.
Right in the kniggin.
Goddamn it.
Guys.
Way to go, A-hole.
All right, hold on while I try and find my balls, for God's sakes.
One, two and three.
Okay. I'm okay.
Dr. Evil, we still have the ultimate insurance policy.
May I present to you...
...the very sexual, the very tight...
...Austin Powers' father.
- His what?
- His father, Dr. Evil.
His "farger"?
- What's a farger?
- His father. You know, the father.
Yeah. Goldmember, I don't speak freaky-deaky Dutch, okay, perv boy?
Father. His dad. Dad is father.
Oh, his dad?
Oh, his father.
Yes, I have a Dutch accent.
Isn't that weird?
Father. Father.
Ah, Nigel Powers.
Hello, hello.
- Bring him to me.
- Easy peezy, lemon squeezy.
Oh, put the guns down.
Is this the first day on the job or something?
Look, this is how it goes.
You attack me one at a time...
...and I knock you out with a single punch.
Okay? Go.
- Judo chop.
- Oh, he's good.
Judo chop.
Do you know who I am?
Have you any idea how many anonymous henchmen...
...I've killed over the years?
And look at you.
You haven't even got a nametag.
You got no chance.
Why don't you just fall down?
Go on, son.
All right, Dr. Evil, give yourself up while you've still got a chance.
Okay. Okay. You've got me.
Nigel Powers, meet...
...Mini Me.
Oh, blimey.
I thought I smelled cabbage.
Take him away.
Uh, Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoo-hoo gold?
It's kind of my thing, you know.
How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard?
Attention, henchmen, it's health week.
Don't forget your physical.
Dr. EVil's orders.
You know, I think it's a shame the way they treat you.
Just because you're one-eighth their size...
...doesn't mean you deserve one-eighth of their respect.
Does it?
Say, mini-fella, I'm, uh...
...I'm curious.
Is, uh, everything in proportion?
You know, your bobby-dangler, your general, two colonels...
...your giggle stick, master of ceremonies.
Yeah. Oh, don't be shy. Let's have a look.
My word.
You're a tripod.
What do you feed that thing, eh?
It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.
The good news is, you ever get tired, you can use it as a kickstand.
I think we both know who the real brains is behind this operation, eh?
Tokio à gogo, baby. Yeah.
Oh, what's kicking, Basil?
A lot's kicking, Foxxy. Austin...
...one of Dr. Evil's henchmen has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena.
Proceed there immediately.
Thanks, Basil.
Ah, Jesus Christ.
This diaper's making my nuts rub together.
It's gonna start a fire.
That's Fat Bastard.
...Fat Bastard.
You know what my favorite
Helen Hunt movie is?
Twister.
Oh!
Fat Bastard...
- That's not right.
- Sure ain't.
Are we done here?
I've got to take a crap.
Wait a tick.
Something doesn't smell right.
And I think it's Fat Bastard.
On top of spaghetti
All covered in... Ahh!...cheese
I lost my poor meatball
'Cause somebody...
- You okay, Austin?
- Sound as a pound, love. Yeah. Good.
What the...? I didn't have any corn.
Hey, diaper lady.
Here's my diaper.
I think I might have pinched one off too soon.
Oh, I left a rosebud in there for you.
You really are a fat bastard.
You know, that hurts my feelings.
I tried going on a diet, you know.
The Zone. You know,
"carbs are the enemy"?
We don't like carbs, you know what I mean?
Who's your friend?
Oh, I'd like to have a go with that filly.
Oh, do you find me sexy?
Oh, look at my titties.
- Shut your mouth.
- Mm, yeah.
All right, that's enough.
Okay, you got me.
- Put it there, would you?
- Okay.
Come here, you.
Ow, my titties!
Ow, you gave me a nurple.
I've got you now.
Come here, you.
Prepare for the ultimate wire-fighting maneuver.
I just hope my wire-fighting team is ready.
Whoa!
- Crikey.
- Oh, great.
Isn't this magical?
One of my wires broke.
You under arrest, sugar.
Okay, Fat Bastard, who's the Japanese cat you made an exchange with?
Oh, all right.
His name is Roboto.
He owns Roboto Industries.
He's designing some contraption for Dr. Evil. I don't know.
The tractor beam.
- That's it.
Listen...
...do you honestly think that crime can pay?
Well, to be honest with you,
I've been trying to go legit.
I really take my sumo wrestling seriously, you know.
But when you're an overweight child...
...in a society that demands perfection...
...well, your sense of right, wrong...
...fair and unfair...
...will always be tragically skewed.
Did you just soil yourself?
Maybe.
It did sound a little wet, didn't it?
Right at the end.
Let's have a smell, all right?
Ooh, wafting, wafting.
Oh, everyone likes their own brand, don't they? This is magic.
All right, analysis:
Oh, it smells like carrots and throw-up.
Oh, that could gag a maggot.
I smell like hot, sick ass in a dead carcass.
Oh, even stink would say that stinks.
You know when you go into an apartment building...
...and you smell other people's cooking on each floor and you go:
"What are they cooking?" That, plus crap.
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, Scotty.
How you been, sport?
Whoa!
I got you a present.
Really?
- Open the tank.
- Open the tank!
Are those sharks with laser beams attached to their heads?
Cool. You mean I actually have fricking sharks...
...with fricking laser beams attached to their fricking heads?
You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for.
Well, I love you, Dad.
I love you, son.
It's touching moment, yes.
Scotty, come here.
Pop a squat right next to Daddy.
Mini Me?
Move down the bench.
Move down the bench.
There's a power struggle, yes.
Scotty's on fire.
All right, it's getting crowded in here.
Everyone out, everyone out. Come on.
Not you, Scotty. Not you, Number Two.
Not you, Frau. Not you, Goldmember.
Not you, guys back there.
Not you, Henchman Holding Wrench.
Not you,
Henchman Arbitrarily Turning Knobs...
...Making It Seem Like
You're Doing Something.
Oh, this is uncomfortable.
Heh, heh. The tiny one can't take a hint.
He doesn't understand.
He is small.
Hello, Foxxy. Austin.
We've confirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate.
He was hired by Dr. Evil to construct Preparation H.
So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember's tractor beam.
Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember.
Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father.
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto. I thank you.
- You speak Japanese?
- A little.
Well, you might be a cunning linguist, but I'm a master debater.
I'm looking for my father.
He was kidnapped.
Please eat what?
Wait.
He said,
"Please eat some shitake mushrooms."
Tell me...
...what do you know...
...about my father's where...
...abouts?
"Your ass is happy"?
No.
He said,
"Your assignment is an unhappy one."
Nice potty mouth, dirtbag.
Yes, quite off topic, thank you very much.
Why don't I just speak in English?
That would be a good idea, now, wouldn't it?
That way I wouldn't misread the subtitles...
...making it seem like you're saying things that are dirty.
I'm sorry to hear about your father, but I can't help you.
Please excuse me.
I have another appointment.
By the way...
- Mr. Roboto is lying to us.
- Tell me something I don't know.
- I open-mouth kissed a horse once.
- Say what?
That's something you don't know.
My spider sense is telling me that my father's still in this building.
You keep a lookout.
I'm gonna try and sneak in.
Come on, come on, come on.
Judo chop!
Shazam!
Come on, sugar.
- There's Goldmember and Roboto.
Yes, very impressive.
Put Preparation H into my schtuppen transporten.
- What's this?
- You need this to turn on the tractor beam.
It's a gold key.
It's gold.
Smarty-pants.
- Let's spread out.
- Yeah.
Hands up, Goldmember.
It's payback time.
Sure, you can kill me...
...but then what happens to Austin Powers' father?
- Dad.
- Yes.
And now he's going to have an unfortunate smelting accident.
- Hiya!
- Unh!
Don't worry, Dad. I'm here to rescue you.
Ow! May I point out that last time around, you fell into an obvious trap.
Now you're trying to save me instead of stopping Goldmember.
Oh, please. I'm not gonna let Goldmember get away.
Austin, Goldmember's getting away.
Hello, hello.
Aren't you going to introduce us, Austin?
- Foxxy, this is...
- Powers. Nigel Powers.
- Is that Eau de Flores you're wearing?
- Yes, it is.
That's how a woman should smell.
Especially one as beautiful as you.
My, my. Even in the face of danger, you live up to your reputation.
Get on with it.
I've got an idea.
Your spy car's a MINI?
It's not the size, mate, it's how you use it.
I would've found my way off that.
Fellas.
- What? I saved your life.
- You should've been doing your job.
- Oh, you're welcome, man.
Shut up and turn around, please!
Run! It's Godzilla!
It looks like Godzilla, but due to international copyright laws, it's not.
Still, we should run like it is Godzilla!
Though it isn't.
There's Goldmember.
Breaker, breaker, 1-niner?
This is Goldy-Wang. Over.
10-4, there, Goldy-Wang.
This is Rubber Ducky.
What's your 10-20? Over.
I've got Preparation H in my rear and Smokey the Bear in my back door.
We've got us a convoy. Over.
Yee-haw! Copy that, you son of a bitch pile of monkey nuts.
Open wide there, Rubber Ducky.
I am entering your mouth now. Over.
Oh, great. Goldmember got away.
Now what?
I think it's obvious.
We should take Dr. Evil's lair by force.
- You can be my backup, son.
- Backup?
Well, that's fairly condescending.
Do you think Dr. Evil's gonna expect an attack?
We should infiltrate his lair.
This ain't my first rodeo, cowboy.
We need commandos, scuba, gadgets, for God's sake.
Well, I don't like to use gadgets...
...outside the bedroom. I thank you.
Outside the bedroom.
You know, I think being frozen damaged your brain.
Really? And how would you know?
This is the most time that we've ever spent together since...
...ever.
- What are you saying, son?
- Oh, please.
What boy learned to drive a car with machine guns on it?
Or had a helicopter you can fit in a knapsack?
What about your Swedish nanny, Helga?
Oh, yes. Helga.
Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking.
Oh, yes.
She stayed on until you were 24.
We were mates, you and I.
I didn't need a friend, I needed a father.
Do you know I risked my life trying to save you...
...and you still don't give me any respect.
Respect? Oh, come on.
If you've got an issue, here's a tissue.
That is not funny.
Well, I suppose we better go our separate ways, then.
Fine.
So I've been assigned to welcome you to the Ministry of Defence.
I have a letter from my director personally thanking you for switching sides.
I can't wait to inform Austin of your defection.
Oh, hello, Basil.
Yes, Austin should be here any second. Yes.
Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now.
Assassin!
Try to kill me, will you?
Oh, you want to be friends, huh?
Wait a tick.
Peace?
Oh!
I'm not falling for that again.
But at least he didn't mention it.
Yes, I realize he can't talk.
Listen, I think Dr. Evil treated him badly and that's why he's decided to help us.
Come back here, you little bugger.
Got you.
Oh, yes, I'm sure Austin and Mini will get along famously.
No, I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini Me on my watch.
Come on, you bugger.
Come on, I got you.
Oh, I think he and Austin will be united in their commitment to stopping Dr. Evil.
Austin, there you are.
I've come to tell you the good news.
Mini Me has...
...switched sides.
Sorry about that, old chap. Sorry.
You know. Sorry.
Welcome aboard.
- My "mole-stake."
- What was that?
- Listen, just get it out of your system.
- No, I'm fine.
- We could work together better if...
- It's okay...
Mole! Bloody mole!
We're not supposed to talk about the mole, but there's a mole winking me in the face.
I'm gonna chop it off and cut it up and make some guacamole.
- Better?
- Yeah. Yes.
So you've decided to join us, huh, Mini Me?
Welcome to the good side, my mini-brother.
And thank you for the map of Dr. Evil's sub.
What's this? It says:
"Dr. Evil's tractor beam is now complete.
There's not much time.
Dr. Evil must pay."
"You are so beautiful.
Are you a clone of an ángel?"
That is so sweet.
Well, no, my mini-man, I'm not.
"Are you sure you don't have a little clone in you?"
Yeah, I'm sure.
"Would you like to?"
Horny bugger.
That is so not funny.
Okay, everyone, prepare to dive.
This spy car's also a submarine.
Get me the World Organization.
What is it, Dr. Evil?
Gentlemen, in a matter of hours...
...a meteor will crash into Earth, causing a global flood.
That is, of course, unless you pay me...
...one billion...
...million yen.
I think you're bluffing.
Well, perhaps you'd like a demonstration.
Number Two, the key, please.
Sir, Dr. Evil's not bluffing.
One of our satellites is falling out of orbit.
- Which one?
- It's the one that looks like a pair of...
Melons. Big, juicy melons.
Are they nice and firm?
Well, what do you think?
Look at that. It looks like a set of giant...
- Hey, "A" and "N", you're late.
- How we doing? We're back.
Go, Titans!
Check it out. Those remind me of...
- Boobs.
- Boobs, Ozzy?
- These filmmakers are ****ing boobs.
- What do you mean, Dad?
They're using the same ****ing joke as they did in the last Austin Powers movie.
- What ****ing joke?
- You know, the ****ing joke...
...about the long smooth rocket that looks like some guy's...
- Johnson.
- Yes, sir.
- Any sign of that satellite?
- No, sir. It's gone.
Gentlemen, you have my demands.
Peace out.
Cor, baby. You look very switched on.
Thank you, Austin.
No, Mini Me. Off. Bad. Mustn't.
No humping.
Dr. Evil, in light of the success of the device...
...it is Japanese custom that I receive a bonus.
A bonus? That's good.
Yeah, that's awesome.
Throw me a fricking bonus here.
Oh, I haven't laughed that hard since I was a little girl. Thank you.
You're not joking.
No. In fact, if you don't give me the bonus...
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Scotty. How are you, sport?
- Why don't you let me take care of this?
- Okay.
He's got a good evil laugh.
Get along.
Scotty!
Scotty.
Take it down a notch.
It's creeping a bit.
Let's go.
We'll need a disguise.
There's only one uniform.
One of us has to go on the other one's shoulders.
Hey there, buddy. How's it going?
Good to see you.
Yeah. Yeah. Hi.
How are you? Just getting my sea legs.
Sorry about that.
Hello. You all right?
Yes, it's a good hat. Very good hat.
Come on, Mini Me. Let's go.
Hold it right there, mister.
Did you really think you could get away with this?
I did, actually. Yes.
Every new recruit must have a physical.
Now get in here, sailor.
I'm going to need a urine sample.
Okay.
- No.
- I don't know.
Okay, then. Um...
Okay.
Hello.
And here we go.
Sorry.
Right. There you go. Right.
Ah, yes.
- Terrific.
Yes, good. Okay.
All right, sailor, go behind that screen...
...and strip down to your skivvies.
All right, then. I'll just go to that screen...
...which is over there.
Right behind that screen.
Next.
Come on, hurry. The map.
Okay, what's our plan?
- I'm going to need a urine sample.
- Okay.
Which way to the main chamber?
Okay, so... Oh, sure.
- Excuse me, doctor?
- It's difficult in public, isn't it?
Mini Me, our shadows.
We're casting a shadow.
What's wrong, sailor?
You should check that guy out.
What the hell's going on here?
Hands up.
You heard me. I said, hands up.
Both of you.
- Come with me.
- Mini Me, the map. Go.
Okay. You got me.
Are you all right, little man?
Uh-huh.
Right on.
Mr. Powers.
Before I kill you...
...perhaps you'd like to see the genius of my plan.
Key, please.
What the...? Who? But how? Where? Huh?
- Looking for this?
- Huh?
- Mini Me?
- All right...
...everybody drop your guns, because Foxxy Cleopatra's in the sub.
Smashing, Foxxy. Yeah.
Unh!
- Here, sugar.
All right, Dr. Evil.
It's finally come down to this.
You, me and a gun.
What are you going to do now, Austin?
Dad?
What are you doing here?
I've gotta finish this off once and for all.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I have to protect my son.
Dad, I'm fine.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about him.
What?
Dr. Evil's not your son, I am.
- You both are.
- Huh?!
What?
It was our first family holiday together.
Just as I was finishing a case...
...your mother brought the two of you to Belgium.
I stopped to have a tinkle when the car...
But my parents died in a car accident.
It was no accident.
It was an assassination attempt.
I thought only Austin survived.
I should have told you the truth earlier...
...but those Belgians, they made you so damn...
...evil.
And, of course, they share a border with the Dutch.
Very interesting story, Mr. Powers.
Of course, I'm gonna have to wait until I see all the facts.
Daddy.
Shh, Daddy's here, Dougie.
Uh, "Dougie"?
- Dougie?
- Dougie. Remember, Dougie?
Dad, What's going on?
What are you going to do, Austin?
Austin.
Are you sure you can trust Dr. Evil?
He ain't heavy...
...he's my brother, baby. Yeah.
I should have told you this so long ago, son.
- I'm very proud of you.
- Unh!
- Can you forgive me?
- I forgive you, Dad.
Come on.
Yes.
My two sons.
I'm Dougie. I'm Dougie.
Come on.
Oh, there you are.
Oh, come on.
I mean, first I'm not evil enough for you.
And now you're gonna turn good?
Listen, Scott.
You can spend your whole life...
...trying to win your parents' acceptance, believe me.
But at the end of the day, you've just gotta do it for yourself, baby.
That all I've gotta do?
Hey, Austin? Shh!
What?
I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you.
I don't even know you, but I hate you too.
And I especially hate you.
You'll pay.
You'll all pay.
I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool runs like a girl.
Not so fast, smarty-pants.
Dr. Evil...
...you might not want to destroy the world, but I do.
Preparation H goes ahead as planned.
I'm going to flood the Earth.
Think again, Goldmember.
Ah, Foxxy Cleopatra.
It's a shame I had to kill your partner.
Too bad for you.
Too bad for me?
How about too bad for you?
Oh, no.
Luckily, I keep a spare.
Look, everyone.
My winkie was a key.
Only a bloody Dutchman.
You mine, sucker.
Yes.
Foxxy, I'm coming.
Nobody try anything stupid or the shooting begins.
Austin. Take Dougie.
I'll stay here and be your backup.
- Dougie, what do we do?
- I'm not a real "hands-on evil genius."
Think. You were always the smart one.
Uh, I could reroute the output capacitor to the tractor beam...
...from one of the conduit boxes up there.
Come on, let's go.
Yes. The shooting begins.
Let me shoot.
You know, Dr. Evil...
...I used to think you were crazy.
- I know.
But now I can see you're nuts.
I thank you.
Give me the gun.
Hurry.
Father. Father. Father.
Father, can you hear me?
Father. Father.
Well done, Austin.
He saved the world again.
Hey, yeah.
Thank you.
Right on.
- Austin, you did it.
- We did it.
Yeah, baby.
No? Just trying it on.
Goldmember?
You under arrest, sugar.
Hey, assholes.
Do I have time for a last smoke and a pancake, or what?
I am from Holland. Isn't that weird?
Yeah.
Yes, well done.
Good on you, man.
Thank you.
Yes.
Hey, Powers.
Fat Bastard? But you're not fat anymore.
I went on the Subway diet.
You know, just like Jared.
I've lost 180 pounds.
Congratulations, baby.
Thank you. I do have a little bit of excess skin, though.
Bit of a problem here, yeah.
And unfortunately, my neck does look like a vagina.
Austin! Austin!
Over here.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Austin, you the boss!
- You all right?
Loved it!
- Okay.
Austin...
...thank you for everything.
Shazam.
I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers.
Well, they're using the same
****ing joke...
...as they did in the last Austin Powers film... Movie... What was it?
Well, they're using the... Well...
Well, they're using the same joke that they did...
What do I mean?
- Boobs, Ozzy.
- Stop, do that again.
You're starting to laugh.
Oh, don't start, Kelly, or I'll put you back in the refrigerator.
One more.
- I don't like that.
- A little serious.
Don't make that noise, Sharon.
I'm getting turned on.
My testosterone is going dancing.
Get off me.
Is...? Is it true what they say about you?
Kickstand. Really?
Um, can I give you my cell phone number?
Please?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.
Attention. Please prepare for docking procedure.
There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.
They didn't leave a name.
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.
I don't like this business you're getting yourself into.
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.
I move my mouth, words come out, you don't hear.
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.
You don't like my smile?
I don't like what's behind it.
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing, probably dead.
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.
I'll bring you some popcorn.
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow.
You sent me this?
Who are you?
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.
The bonding enzymes in proteus molecules which...
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.
Yes, l...
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.
I was one of seven scientists chosen to serve in a secret facility stationed outside of Berlin before the start of the First World War.
It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."
We agreed never to discuss what went on behind those doors.
The things we were made to do there...
Terrible things.
- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Doctor, you said you knew who was next.
Yes.
Don't you see?
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?
Me.
He's coming for me.
Who? Who's coming?
Totenkopf.
It's Totenkopf.
There!
All citizens, attention.
New York City must be evacuated at once.
Proceed in an orderly manner to the East River Drive.
All members of the police and fire department on leave or off duty
shall report immediately to their precincts or company command.
This is urgent.
- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.
What's going on? They're calling for midtown to evacuate.
Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.
I need you to dig up anything you can on a Dr. Walter Jennings and someone named Totenkopf.
An address, a phone number, anything you can find. It's important.
Totenkopf. Who is he?
He may have something to do with the missing scientists.
Quick as you can.
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.
I want you to put the phone down, close your notepad and get the hell out of there.
Wait a minute.
I can see something now coming into sight above the Palisades.
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.
Fifth Avenue.
They're a hundred...
They're a hundred yards away.
Polly. Polly!
Oh, my God.
Polly!
Polly!
Polly!
Stop! Come back!
Fire!
Get out of here!
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.
Send everything you've got!
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.
This is an emergency protocol, 90206.
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?
Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.
This is an emergency protocol, 90206.
Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?
Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.
Polly.
Joe.
Further details of the attack continue to pour in.
The central portion of the city is blacked out from radio communication
due to damaged power lines and electrical failure.
Cables received from English, French and German news agencies
now confirm the attack was not limited to the city.
The BBC is reporting that a steel mill in Nuremberg
was virtually excavated
by what witnesses describe as a mechanized tornado.
News agencies in Paris and Madrid speak of strange burrowing machines
rising from the ground,
robbing entire communities of their coal and oil reserves.
Meanwhile, with military resources stretched thin across the globe,
world leaders must once again call upon
the elite mercenary forces of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire
to uncover the meaning of these mysterious events.
Where's Dex?
Shazam.
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?
You find out where it came from, and I'll buy you one for Christmas.
Oh, I need to show you something.
I recorded this signal just before the first machine appeared.
I didn't think anything of it until I played it back.
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first, but the syntax is more complex than that.
There's a sub-carrier hidden in the lower frequency.
I think it's being used to control them.
If it shows up again, could you track it?
I can try, yeah.
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.
In the meantime, see what you can do with that thing.
Find out what makes it tick.
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.
Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.
Tummy ache?
How you been, Joe?
- Miss me?
- Get out.
Well, it's nice to see you too.
Dex said you might be in a mood.
Dex?
Get in here!
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?
Can't even remember what we were fighting about.
You sabotaged my plane.
Right.
I spent six months in a Manchurian slave camp because of you.
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe, for the last time, I didn't sabotage your damn airplane.
All so you could get a photograph of Tojo Hideki in his bathrobe, remember?
You know, I'm starting to think that you've invented this whole sabotage nonsense to cover the fact that you were running around on me with your little mystery girl the whole time we were in Nanjing.
Never happened.
All in your imagination.
Who was she, Joe?
- What was her name?
- That's enough.
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
Oh, great. We all made up.
It's been a pleasure, Polly.
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.
If she resists, shoot her.
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.
Okay.
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't have been interested in this, anyway.
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.
Lots more.
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.
And you're gonna help me get it.
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.
Show me what?
Show me what?
My God. What is this?
Where do they come from?
They started appearing three years ago in remote areas.
We managed to keep it a secret until now.
They show up without warning, they take what they need, and then they disappear without a trace.
Three years and we still can't explain what they want or who's sending them here.
A man came to see me today, a scientist.
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.
I asked him who he was so afraid of, and he repeated one name:
Totenkopf.
He nearly went white when he said it.
Totenkopf, who is he?
He's the invisible man.
I've been through every library record twice looking for anything.
I've called every contact I have from Paris to Bangkok.
This is the only thing I could dig up.
He ran some kind of secret science unit outside of Berlin before the start of World War I.
Something called Unit 11.
It's been more than 30 years since anyone has spoken his name.
Until today.
Note the insignia he used for the unit.
It matches the markings on all of these machines.
The scientist, where is he now?
We're in this together, right, Joe?
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence or take a photograph without asking me first. Understood?
Understood.
What?
I missed you.
Thanks for saving my life today, by the way.
Were you down there?
You missed me too. How nice.
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.
Dr. Jennings!
It's locked.
That window there.
I may be able to get in through that window if I can attach a line...
It's open.
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.
All right, Polly...
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Dr. Jennings!
You must stop him!
Stay here.
Stop!
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.
If Totenkopf finds them, the countdown will begin.
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?
Promise.
He's dead.
I think I found something.
Dr. Jennings had this with him this morning at the theater.
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.
Of course you are.
Reconnaissance picked up something on radar traveling at over 500 knots and coming straight for us.
- How long before they reach us?
- There!
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.
Don't be stupid. Remember what happened last time you flew with me?
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.
Not this time. This is my story, and we had a deal!
Go, go, go!
Get in.
There you are.
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.
Come in, Dex.
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Listen, Cap, the signal's coming from one of those machines.
You gotta keep them in one piece.
Which machine is it, Dex?
There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.
I think I found it, Dex.
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.
Don't let it get away. I need you to bounce that signal back to me.
If we lose it now, we may never get it back.
You let me know when you've got something, Dex.
I'll let you know. Out.
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep of every incoming signal.
Amplify any variant frequency cycle and route them to me.
They've come back for the generators.
Who is this guy?
- You okay?
- Great.
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia under the seat if you need it.
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.
Pull up!
- Joe!
- I see it!
It's getting away.
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.
I know these streets like the back of my hand. Go left!
Hey!
Okay, okay, now go straight.
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?
Back there.
I could use a little more warning next time.
Go left!
Tell me you got something, Dex.
We're getting clobbered up here.
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.
Joe!
Dex! We can't hold them off any longer!
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.
Will you just trust me? Go left!
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!
Oh, bugger.
Joe!
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!
I got us here, didn't I?
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.
Listen, I'll try and take them out over the water, buy us some time. Over.
Still glad you came?
Joe, I found it! Joe!
Dex, come in. Where is it?
Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?
Dex, do you read me?
Dex, are you there?
I can't outrun them much longer.
Hold on.
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.
Joe, you have to pull up!
Pull up!
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.
Got the idea from one of his comic books.
You mean, you knew this the whole time, and you let me think we were gonna crash?
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!
Look, Polly, it was your idea to tag along, not mine.
If you can't take it, that's not my fault.
Oh, I can take it.
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.
Because that was nothing.
Dex, come in. Do you read me?
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.
Dex!
Dex!
Dex.
They're everywhere.
Joe, look out!
Dex!
Why would Totenkopf do this?
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.
He was looking for something.
Dex said he knew where the transmission was coming from.
He must have got too close.
- He was trying to tell me something...
- Joe.
Good boy, Dex.
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.
- My God.
- What?
"Totenkopf was awarded his first patent when he was 12 years old.
By 17, he had already received two doctorates and was one of the most highly regarded minds of his day.
One year after his disappearance, ominous rumors began circulating.
Whispers that Totenkopf had begun work on what was darkly hinted to be a doomsday device.
Efforts to locate him have consistently failed, and to this day, his whereabouts remain a mystery.
Even less is known about his companion, an assassin who controls his machines."
She's the one who took Dex.
What else?
These are Unit 11 supply logs.
This is everything he's used his machines to collect for the last three years, including generators from the city.
It reads like a shopping list from all over the world.
What have you been up to, doctor?
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.
We'll find him.
My old friend Joe.
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.
Nice to meet you.
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.
Did you get a little something for me?
Of course. Three cases, just like you asked.
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?
Come, I'll show you the maps.
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?
I don't trust him.
That's funny, he said the same thing about you.
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.
You won't be needing high heels where we're going.
Dex tracked the signal to here, this valley north of Karakal.
This is where the transmission originated.
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?
- Shambhala.
- You know it?
It is forbidden.
It's said to be the source of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.
Those who live there are said to have supernatural powers.
You can get us there, Kaji, can't you?
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.
Shambhala is said to be protected by the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.
If they find us there, they will kill us.
Why? Why is this place so special?
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.
To the ancient Greek, it was Empurios.
You may know it as Shangri-la.
A storm is coming. If you still wish to go, we must go now.
I need to send a message.
Editor Paley, this may be the last message you receive from me.
We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal in search of Dr. Totenkopf.
The story grows stranger at every turn.
Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.
I fear time is running out.
With any luck, I'll be back soon with Dex and the story.
I hope. Polly Perkins.
This is where civilization stops.
A blank on the map.
We must be careful from here.
Hurry.
What is it?
It looks like a mining outpost.
Something bad happened here.
Seems to be abandoned.
Tell your men we're heading down.
I want a closer look.
What is it, Joe?
Uranium.
The whole mine's contaminated.
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.
Where's Polly?
Polly!
Miss Perkins?
We'll have to split up.
Polly!
Let her go.
Give me the vials and the girl will live.
What vials?
What are you talking about?
I will not ask a second time.
Drop the gun.
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. You'll just have to kill us.
As you wish.
Wait! Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry, Joe.
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.
Dr. Jennings gave them to me just before he died.
He said that the world would end and the countdown would begin if Totenkopf got his hands on them.
You've done nothing but lie to me from the beginning.
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.
That was what Totenkopf was looking for.
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
Do you hear that?
Dynamite.
That noise again.
Move!
What are you doing?
Come on!
Oh, great.
We're safe.
Polly, this may be our last moment together.
There's something
I need to ask you.
Yes, Joe?
Did you cut my fuel line?
Damn it! I didn't sabotage your lousy airplane!
Our last moments on earth and this is all you have to say to me?
Could we just for once die without all this bickering?
There you are.
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!
My film.
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!
Polly.
Polly.
My clothes.
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!
Not unless you have some pants hidden under there for me.
- Oh, don't tell me you're...
- Naked.
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?
Stop looking at me like that.
Like what?
Turn around, Joe.
I'm serious. Turn around.
Hi, Joe.
Ask him what he did with our clothes.
The clothes are burned.
Burned? Why?
He says the mine is poisonous.
Our clothes were infected.
He says he's arranged for a guide to lead us back down the mountain.
He will take us there once we are dressed.
We appreciate that. But explain to him we are here to find a man.
He says we must leave before it is dark.
There's nothing more he can do for us.
It's very important we find this man.
His name is Totenkopf!
He says, what do you want with this man?
I've come to kill him.
And to find my friend.
He says he will help you.
What do you think?
I think they burned the wrong clothes.
You said I couldn't bring anything else.
I think you look like a woolly mammoth.
They're waiting for us.
The priest says that Totenkopf enslaved his people, made them work in the mine, but the mine was poisonous.
Those who did not die right away were brought here for him to study.
Where is Totenkopf now?
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.
I can't believe this is happening.
I only have two shots left.
We're in Shangri-la and all I have is two shots.
Everything I had was in that bag.
You should have let me go back for my film.
You're right, I should have.
So where's he taking us?
To meet the only living survivor of Totenkopf's experiments.
What experiments?
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?
To make him pay for what he has done.
His staff. He's asking for his staff.
He says, follow Rana. The staff will lead you there to Totenkopf.
Rana? Is there such a place?
He says now that he has helped you, you must help him.
Of course. Anything.
What do you want?
Kill me.
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.
And there's a moon and a star.
And all I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by
A star.
He wasn't talking about a place, he was talking about a star!
Rana is a star.
Ancient sailors used to navigate by using the night sky.
They could determine their position by the moon and the stars.
The Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
The Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars, latitude tables that required a key to decipher them.
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!
You mean this could really work?
You could really find Totenkopf with this thing?
We do things a little different nowadays.
All we needed to know was where to look. What's the date?
- March 2.
- March 2.
Using Karakal Plateau as our assumed position...
March 2...
Rana is at latitude 20.40.
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.
Declination, minus 10.60.
There's nothing there.
Are you sure you did it right?
I'm sure.
If the old man was right, that's where Totenkopf is now.
Dead center in the middle of nowhere.
What's that point there?
That's where we run out of fuel.
Oh, great.
So how do we get there?
- Franky.
- Who?
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost for the Royal Navy.
If I can get a message to them,
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous at these coordinates.
And what if they don't get the message?
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.
They'll be there.
Is that light supposed to be on?
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.
Manta Station, do you read me?
Where are you, Franky?
What are you doing?
You can't land this in the middle of nowhere.
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.
Dex had a hand in designing it.
It's kind of a secret. You can keep a secret, can't you, Polly?
Yeah.
I can keep a secret.
Two shots.
Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.
Copy, 327.
Welcome aboard, captain.
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.
It's good to see you too, Franky.
This had better be important or one of us is in trouble.
It's important.
What is that?
You be nice.
Commander Cook, meet Polly Perkins.
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.
It's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.
It's been a long time since Nanjing, hasn't it, Joseph?
So, Franky, I hear you've been having trouble with that number-three engine, or at least you were last time...
Commander, we're tracking six enemy submersibles bearing 30 degrees northwest.
- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.
- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.
Take us to 10,000 feet and deploy countermeasures.
Yes, commander.
Reconnaissance located an island
3 kilometers northeast of our current position.
It is not, however, on any of our charts.
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?
What have you got me into this time, Joseph?
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.
Polly, try not to touch anything.
Enemy warships bearing 316, mark 4. Closing fast.
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.
Totenkopf.
Commander, we've lost power to the forward rotors. We're losing altitude.
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.
Francesca, you've got to get me on that island.
I'm not about to risk the lives of my men for one of your silly antics.
He's got Dex.
Rescind order!
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face of the island.
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.
But...
...this area here, there's an undersea inlet at the southern tip and it runs beneath the entire length of the island. That is your only way in.
Everything else is sheer rock to the edge of the water.
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?
Leave that to me.
Alert the amphibious squadron.
Report to main station carrier.
What?
Nanjing?
I can't hear you, Polly.
You'll have to speak up.
Keep your nose up, Joseph. You always were bad at the short takeoff.
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna have to come back for you.
I thought your takeoff was just fine.
Thank you, Polly.
So you heard that, did you?
Manta leader to Manta team, impact in ten seconds.
Switching to amphibious mode.
Impact in five, four, three, two, one.
Franky.
You remember our milk run over Shanghai, don't you?
We had the target buttoned up and he was jinxing in the flak.
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:
- "Protect the rabbits!
- "Protect the rabbits!
- Protect the rabbits!"
- Protect the rabbits!"
Enemy target spotted four points to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.
Joe, watch out!
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.
Manta leader to Manta team, arm cluster torpedoes and stick close to element formation.
Fire.
Joseph! Pull up!
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.
Do you hear me? Disengage.
Do you hear me?
- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!
Disengage!
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.
You're only going to have one shot at this.
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.
Franky, pull up.
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.
Two.
One.
You're all clear.
Good luck, Joe.
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.
She's some kind of girl.
Yes, I know.
I'm taking us up.
What?
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.
Who knows what's waiting for us out there.
Suit yourself.
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.
Run.
There.
Polly!
Oh, great.
Come on!
Polly!
Come on!
Are you mad?
Are you mad?
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.
- I didn't mean...
- I shot the ground!
- What?
- When we were running,
I shot the ground.
It isn't funny.
I only have one shot left.
One shot!
What is it with you and that stupid camera, anyway?
You gave it to me.
You don't even remember, do you?
You were flying with the American volunteers in Nanjing,
I was covering the evacuation of Shanghai.
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth.
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.
The girl in Nanjing was Franky, wasn't it?
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?
Look me in the eyes.
I never fooled around on you.
Never.
I sabotaged your plane.
- Three months.
- I knew it!
I can't believe I ever trusted you, you lousy...
He's here.
You all right?
Through there.
Through there.
My God, Joe.
It's an ark.
He's building an ark.
What are you doing?
You honestly think you're gonna find something more important than every single creature on Earth being led two by two inside a giant rocket ship?
I might.
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.
- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.
We have to find Totenkopf.
You've got a gift.
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!
Einsteigen. Komm, springt!
Are you all right?
How did you find us?
We escaped into the tunnels once the countdown started.
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.
The machines that were guarding us are loading everything on this island into that ship.
We've got about ten minutes to stop that thing from blasting off.
Dex! Get us out of here!
Good boy, Dex.
Thanks, Cap.
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.
Or what's left of them.
They were brought here to finish what they started 30 years ago.
Finish what?
Tell them.
Totenkopf believed that humankind was doomed to extinction, so he proposed the unthinkable:
To build a vessel that would carry the building blocks of a new civilization into space.
He used his machines to collect specimens representing all life on Earth.
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."
Those vials that Dr. Jennings gave me, what were they?
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.
Seeds of a technological utopia.
We smuggled them off this island, knowing Totenkopf would never leave without them.
But now that he has them again, there is nothing left to keep him here.
Then let him go. Let him go where he can't harm anyone.
No, no, no, that ship must never leave this Earth.
Why? What haven't you told us?
When the rocket reaches 100 kilometers, at the edge of space,
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But we've never been allowed near him.
He's too well guarded even to be seen.
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.
Good boy, Dex.
Careful. Careful.
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.
Through there.
That's the only way in.
You see, there is no way past them.
Five minutes, Joe.
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.
He knows what he's doing.
I think.
Hey, that's my gun!
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!
Doctor, stop!
Who dares come before me?
Who dares enter this place?
What has begun cannot be stopped.
- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.
Hello, doctor.
Why are you doing this?
I have been witness to a world consumed by hatred
and bent on self-destruction.
Watched as we have taken what was to be a paradise
and failed in our responsibilities as its steward.
I know now that the course the human race has set for itself
cannot be changed.
I am the last, desperate chance for a doomed planet.
Now, leave this place or die!
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.
I meant throw something.
He's not here.
We're too late.
These are his personal papers.
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.
- We must find him.
- I found him.
It's impossible.
It can't be.
The last entry in his journal was made on October 11, 1918.
He died over 20 years ago.
We've been chasing a ghost.
Three minutes to liftoff.
They never stopped. They're finishing what they were programmed to do.
Don't you see? This entire island is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.
He's found a way to cheat even his own death.
So how do we kill somebody who's already dead?
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.
If you can cut the lead in the system terminal, it should create a short...
...which will ignite the fuel line before the booster engines can fire
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.
You won't have time to escape.
Contact Franky as soon as you're off the island.
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.
We had a deal.
You're not gonna leave me now, just when things are getting interesting.
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.
And I only hope, one day, you can forgive me.
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.
One minute to liftoff.
We meet again, my mysterious friend.
How do you wanna do this?
Nice shot, Polly.
What took you so long?
She's a machine.
Ten seconds to liftoff.
Nine...
... eight...
... seven...
... six...
... five...
... four...
We've gotta get those animals off the ship.
Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.
There's no time.
That's our only way across.
Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.
Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!
What did you do now?
Come on!
Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.
Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.
Hold on!
Please! Don't touch anything else!
There's no time. We'll never make it.
Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.
Run!
Forty kilometers to booster ignition.
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?
Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?
It didn't work.
Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.
And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...
- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...
Shut up!
Ten kilometers to booster ignition.
Nine...
... eight...
... seven...
- ... six...
- Why won't you die?
Five kilometers to booster ignition.
Four...
... three...
... two...
... one.
Warning. System failure.
Booster malfunction.
Danger. Danger.
Danger.
Warning. System failure.
- Booster malfunction.
- Look!
Danger. Danger.
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.
I see them, commander.
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.
One shot.
You got your story.
Polly.
- You...
- It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.
Lens cap.
It's adoption day!
- What?!
- Hey, pal.
- It's dining room day, Owen.
- Let's see that calendar.
Didn't you just start that job?
He's right. Exactly three months today he's been walkin' those dogs.
Not one problem. I already got mine picked out at the shelter.
- Good for you, O. Great job.
- Yeah, that's great. Terrific.
Listen, can we talk for a second?
Don't you think that it makes more sense to wait until after we move to the new place before we get the dog?
I'm just thinking of the dog.
That way, he won't have to relearn a new house and a new neighborhood and all that other newness.
We had a deal, Mom.
We did. We sure... we sure... we absolutely did.
"The best way to achieve your goals,
Owen, is to make a plan, work hard, and always keep your eyes on the prize."
That's an exact quote, isn't it?
I want my prize.
So, shall we all go to the shelter at noon?
- Yes!
- Yes!
This'll be great for him, right?
Yeah, yeah.
A little buddy is just what he needs.
I better put down some newspaper.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Morning, Miss Ryan.
Mr. Baker.
Barbara Ann had a restless night.
Poor dear.
I don't want her overexerting.
Keep her on the grass.
The hot pavement is far too harsh on her delicate paws.
Okey-doke.
Hold still, Wilson.
It's only me.
He had the runs last night.
Can you keep an eye on that for me and let me know if things turn solid?
No problem.
Be good now, Nelly.
Don't let the big dogs step on you.
- I'll watch out for her, Mr. Leone.
- I know you will.
- Bye.
- Ciao.
You want it, Shep?
You can't have it.
- Psych!
- Yeah, you want it?
Psych!
Hey, Connie, here comes your boyfriend,
- direct from Weirdo-ville.
- Nice.
Cut it out.
Good morning,
Franky, Fred.
Good morning, loser.
Gimme a kiss good-bye, Shep.
Gimme a kiss.
- You comin' along today?
- We're going to the pool.
Duh, dog boy.
- I smell poop.
- I smell it, too.
Oh, Wilson!
- He's touching it.
- Nasty.
At least it's solid.
Connie, let's go.
- Gross.
- What a freak.
Why does he wear those stupid clothes?
Aren't you getting your new dog today?
Yeah, so I guess I won't be seeing you around much anymore.
But you're still gonna walk Shep, aren't you?
Yeah. I'll see you then, but otherwise...
I'm gonna be busy with training him and bonding with him.
- Hey, Connie, move your butt.
- Yeah, move it.
Have a fun day at the pool.
This is Bob over at Tri County.
Go ahead, Bob.
I'm on a search and retrieval for a wild wirehair.
Got an APB out on a wild wirehair.
Could be coyote... not rulin' out coyote.
Could be another mad dachshund.
Another mad dachshund.
Where did you come from?
Wait! Stop!
Gotcha!
So precious.
Look at you!
You are so pretty.
There's something wrong with him.
He's mean!
He didn't have to do that.
Oh, my God!
- Give me some kisses.
- I want some love, too.
Honey, you're biting.
Somebody's about to meet their new best friend.
Are you sure this is the one, Owen?
It's your call, O.
- Wow! Now, he's interesting.
- Oh, little prisoner.
There's the man.
Tell your folks about your scuffle this morning?
What?
Owen helped me nab that tough mutt off the street.
- Tough? Is he stray?
- There are no tags around his neck.
Just that funny little rock.
Checked out all right health-wise, though.
He seems worried about something.
Yeah, I'd be worried, too.
Think his days are numbered.
- What do you mean?
- Attitude.
Not makin' him very popular around here.
- Attitude?
- Yeah.
You wouldn't put him to sleep, though, right?
Well...
Hubble, slow down.
Heel, Hubble.
Hubble, slow down. Heel.
Hubble, no!
Easy, boy. Easy.
Hi, Mr. Leone.
Hello there.
And who is this?
His name's Hubble.
I just got him.
Hello, Hubble.
- No, Hubble.
- That's all right.
- I'm a stranger to him.
- Where's Nelly?
She likes to check out the headlines.
Easy! Sorry.
I've still got to train him.
Good luck with that.
Okay, Hubble, first day, do your best.
Sit.
Sit.
Good boy.
Good boy, Hubble.
Stay.
Stay.
He's a bright one.
Okay, Mr. Genius, how about... roll over?
Play dead.
- But he's really, really smart, Dad.
- Yeah, that's terrific.
No, I mean he's too smart.
I hate to break this to you, but everyone thinks they've got the smartest dog in the universe.
"Love and Loyalty."
It's okay, Hub.
All right, we'll take our time.
Oh, no, you don't.
Here, boy.
Here.
Hubble.
Orh sale this week at Arhdersorh's.

Here, boy.
Here?
That was a weird dream.
More like a nightmare, if you ask me.
Testing.
One, two, three. Testing.
Don't give me that look.
No, not that look either.
Stay! Stay!
You hear me?
- I...
- Are you sure?
Speak!
Doggone it!
How could I let this happen?
Don't be afraid.
I am Canid 3942.
Honey!
Was that you?
You better be up and at 'em.
Don't say a word.
You can't forget the other dogs just because you've got Hubble.
Bless you!
Somebody's got a wittle cold.
Poor baby.
Hop to it, O.
Can we tie her up out back, please?
- Did you just learn how to talk?
- Here come the questions.
Let's just say your hearing suddenly got a lot better.
Oh, man.
How is this even possible?
Oh, boy.
Look, I don't have time to train you right now.
Just take me to your leaders.
- Leaders?
- The dogs who walk you.
- I walk them.
- Sure you do.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Wait. Am I the only one who can understand you?
Okay, it was a big mistake... wasn't meant to happen.
You can't tell anyone about this, ever.
Got it?
This was a major boo-boo.
Nobody'd believe me anyway.
It's not like dogs start talking all of a sudden.
Code red!
Code red!
- The kid can hear us talking?
- Watch out, shorty.
Coming through.
You can really understand me?
Right now, you understand what I am saying to you?
- Yep.
- Can I have a cookie?
No, wait. Ten cookies?
No, can I have twenty cookies?
Be a pal, kid.
Loosen my collar a notch.
I got a foof in my chach.
Owen, honey, can we just talk about how pretty I am?
Oh, oh, shoot!
I'm so nervous, I forgot what I was gonna say.
I know what I wanna ask.
Can you teach us how to work a stinkin' can opener?!
Enough!
Collect yourselves.
I knew he was trouble the minute I sniffed his butt.
Oh, my!
I have come here on an important mission from the Home Star, and I expect full cooperation.
Hold it.
Where are you from?
Where we all came from... the Home Star.
- Unbelievable.
- It's true.
What are you talking about?
Thousands of years ago, dogs arrived here from the Home Star to colonize and dominate the planet.
All Earth dogs are descended from those dogs.
What Home Star?!
This is why dogs and people shouldn't talk.
Dude, you never heard of the Dog Star?
It's called Sirius.
Wait, you know about this, too?
My grandma used to tell me stories.
We've all heard them.
My great-grandfather told me he had to pass through Uranus to get here.
You expect me to believe that there's a planet out there made up of only dogs?
We don't expect much from your species.
Now go outside and play so we can do our business.
Go play, boy.
I don't have to go outside.
Pardon me, but you were saying something about a mission?
Right. Thank you.
I have been sent here to file a report on Earth dogs.
What, like a report card?
Yes. Now, sit!
I will observe your lives and then grade you on how you have upheld the Sirius code of dignity and dominance.
We're going to get graded?
Yes, and I'll be submitting my report directly to our most noble pack leader... the Greater Dane.
- What?
- The top dog?!
Canine-in-chief.
I need to pee-pee.
The Greater Dane is upset by rumors floating around the galaxy recently that Earth dogs may have strayed from their original mission and lost control of this planet.
There's even one crazy rumor we've heard that claims humans keep dogs as pets.
Oh, my!
That is crazy. Isn't that crazy?
Super crazy.
Who would say a crazy thing like that?
Hold on!
You don't honestly think that dogs are in charge...
Can we get some air?
I feel a little woozy.
See this?
I bought it.
I clip it on you because you are my dog.
I own you.
Pay no attention to the dude in the red suit.
The idea of dogs being in charge is so... far-fetched.
Fetch?!
I teach you and I tell you what you can and can't do. Understand?
Dude, I'm wide open!
Throw the ball.
Throw the Frisbee.
Throw the stick.
Throw something, player!
Yeah, I know what you think, but that's not the way it works here.
Baker!
- Who are you talkin' to?
- Yeah.
- Just the dogs.
- You're talkin' like they're people.
You've got to... to train them.
Let's just go.
Connie, I wouldn't let my dog hang out with that mental case.
What a mental.
That's it!
You guys are makin' me look nuts.
All this stupid Dog Star talk, the Greater Dane.
I want proof.
Show me proof.
Works for me.
- You know how to drive?
- He knows how to crash.
I'm an excellent pilot.
There happened to be some radical wind currents the other night.
Hold on.
What's this thing?
Be careful.
That's my woofer.
A communicator.
It got slightly damaged in the landing.
- Slightly?!
- Hey, let's see you fly one.
This is what you were using last night?
Yes, when it short-circuited and you were caught in the current.
Don't remind me.
Now I'm talking to you, but I can't contact Sirius.
I bet I could fix this.
You keep your paws off my woofer, mister.
No, really.
I'm good with this kind of stuff.
I mean, let's face it.
I can't make it any worse.
Fine. That'll be your job.
As for the rest of you, tomorrow I start grading.
I want to see all the ways you've taken control of people and the planet.
Absolutely.
- No problem!
- We'll show ya!
You guys are so busted.
See ya tomorrow!
Whoops.
If you don't know what you're doing...
- Chill out, Hubble.
- My name is Canid 3942.
I'm not calling you by some number.
I named you Hubble.
When did these human-dog relationships start anyway?
Thousands of years ago.
Why on earth would we do that?
Believe it or not, dogs here are called "man's best friend."
Friend?
Dogs don't need friends.
Everybody needs friends.
Why?
I'm probably not the best person to ask, considering I don't have any.
Hey!
You two havin' a chat in here?
Yeah. Ha ha.
Here's a boy.
Whoa, careful!
Knock this over, we'll all get pretty goofy in here.
Don't play around with this stuff.
Your mom and I will be finishing up in the dining room tomorrow.
Then it's moving time again.
I think this house is my favorite so far.
Me too.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Okey-dokey, then.
All right, buddy, sleep tight.
You, too, stubborn Hubble.
I think he understood me.
If one more person wipes their hands on me...
Did you...
I drank out of that bowl.
All I'm asking is for a little respect.
Why do you do that?
Because I need sleep.
Why do you turn around like that?
Enough with the questions.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Lights out.
Hubble?
Just one more.
How could dogs run an entire planet all on their own?
I mean, no offense, but you guys don't have that much intelligence.
Oh, really?
Who's been teaching who all day long, Mr. Genius?
You may know about where you live, but I know a lot more about where I live.
One thing I do know is that dogs don't run things.
Wait until you see how we got things runnin' down here.
We're gonna give you a grand tour.
I'm not shaking because I'm nervous.
I'm shaking because I'm excited.
Excuse me.
I have to go first, please.
- Why?
- Because, honey, you do not want to deal with me until I've had my day at the beauty parlor.
You see, here on Earth, we pick people to do the things that matter most... hair, nails, accessories.
We have our own back scratchers.
I've got my own chauffeur.
I got my own personal shopper.
Charge it!
They make the sandwiches,
I eat them.
They warm up the seats, and I lay on 'em.
They plant the trees,
I pee on 'em.
We get what we want.
- We do what we want.
- We go where we want.
It may look to you like people are in charge, but let's face it... you don't see us pickin' up their poop.
Okay, that last one got me.
Pretty cool, huh?
So, what do you think,
Mr. Space Dog?
You're all pets.
Lazy, greedy, spoiled rotten good-for-nothings.
You've lost all dignity.
- Will this affect our report card?
- What do you think?
Now I have no choice.
I have to flunk you.
- Flunk us?
- Flunk them?
We can't flunk.
That'd be very bad.
Pardon me, Mr. Hubble.
We've been away from the Home Star so long.
Maybe if you helped us refresh our memory a little?
Yes!
Be our teacher, Hubble.
Not my job.
I make my report, and I go.
- Go?
- He's leaving?
What do you mean, go?
Mission Command will send a retriever for me eventually.
Then we still have some time to improve.
Please help us, Hubble.
We don't want to flunk.
We want to be more like you.
Absolutely!
Intelligent, dignified.
Who are we kidding?
We could only dream of being as dignified as Hubble.
I don't know about that.
I may be an old dog, but I like to learn new tricks.
Oh, please!
Please, please, please, pretty please.
Come on. Please.
I usually don't approve of begging, but I could teach them a thing or two.
Hubble's our teacher!
But no funny business.
Understand?
Tomorrow, you start getting serious.
It's your class, Teach.
You're the dog.
I didn't realize I'd made such an impression on them.
They really seem to look up to me.
That's the thing about Earth dogs.
If they like you, they're not afraid to let you know.
Another fine example of the intelligence of human beings?
Ta-da!
- Wow!
- I know. Finally, right?
I can't wait to get started on the new place in Metro Village.
- So soon?
- It's our dream home, honey.
I can't wait to get in there and get started.
But that's what you said about this house, Mom, and the house before that and the one before that.
It's what we do, sweetheart.
You know that.
I know. I just wish we could stay somewhere, just once, for good.
It makes more sense financially to live in the place that we're renovating.
Smile.
And besides, every time we move, we get a nicer place, right?
But this place seems nice enough to me.
Sweetheart, that's a lovely compliment, but I bet you're gonna like the new place best of all.
Honey, can you move out?
I want to get the painting by itself.
Thank you.
Good.
And this time, you won't be starting off all alone,
'cause you'll have Hubble.
Hello. I was just...
- Where were you?
- With my mom.
Why do you care?
Why do dogs howl at the moon?
Only coyotes do that, but it's not the moon.
They're howling to the Home Star.
- Sirius?
- Just to the left, two stars over.
Coyotes are homesick cry-babies.
So when that retriever you talked about comes for you, you're planning on going back with him?
This is only a temporary mission.
Right. I get it.
I appreciate your hosting me for the time being, but...
It's okay. I'm used to temporary missions.
All right, class, lesson number one.
Dignity comes from within.
On Sirius, we begin every day with meditation, easing gently into peaceful poses to achieve a higher state of being and release our more base animal impulses.
Shh! Surrender.
Breathe in, breathe out.
In and out.
Relax.
Let it go.
Whoop! Pardon me.
Shep eats people food sometimes.
How lucky for us.
This one's outta the park.
Erase all distractions from your mind.
Hey, was that a ball?
I coulda swore
I just heard a ball.
Focus is the key to canine composure.
- Was that a ball?
- I do believe there was a ball.
I'm pretty sure that was a ball.
I think I need to get it.
You ain't gettin' nothin'!
Back off, boxer, it's mine!
It's my ball!
What happened?
What did I miss?
Did I miss something?
Baker!
Watch this.
- Gimme back my ball.
- I don't have it.
Why don't you talk to your dogs and tell 'em to give it back?
Talk to 'em, dog boy.
- What a freak!
- Your dog's a freak like you.
Get him!
Don't, you guys.
- Quit it.
- Who's gonna make me?
Connie?
Whatcha gonna do now, Baker?
Call 'em off, Baker.
Call 'em off.
Just get up slowly.
Those dogs bite us, and my dad'll sue.
Give me the ball, Wilson.
Here. But I bet they come after you for it.
Keep it.
I don't care.
- Is this your only one?
- Just keep it.
Guess you guys don't have any balls then.
We catch you without 'em, you're dead meat.
You're really dead meat.
- Run, run!
- They're such total jerks.
Why do you hang out with them?
I don't know.
We grew up together.
I could hang out with you, I guess.
Could you watch the dogs?
I'm gonna check on Hubble.
Cool.
You all right?
Why did you step in like that?
They were throwing rocks at you.
Sirius dogs fight their own battles.
Why would you put yourself at risk for me?
Because... you're my dog.
Besides, that's what friends do, right?
You backed me up, too.
I did, didn't I?
Why would I do a stupid thing like that?
I think they wanna play ball.
Want this?
Is this what you want?
Doesn't your dog wanna play?
I don't think he knows how.
Or maybe he's not good enough.
Look.
He wants to try.
Okay. Go get it.
- I can do this.
- I got it!
What am I doin'?
- I got it!
- Wait, wait, wait.
Now I get it.
That was just practice.
- Barbara Ann got it.
- Do over.
- Let's go one more time.
- Do it again!
This one's all yours, Hub.
This one's all mine.
All mine.
- Eat my dust.
- Bad bounce.
That was a bad bounce.
Bad bounce.
You can do this.
I know you can.
Show 'em, Hub.
Show 'em what you're made of.
Let me try this one more time.
I can do it.
I can.
I'll show 'em.
I'll show 'em.
I got the ball!
- Holy guacamole!
- Good splash!
Is he all right?
Showoff!
- Can you teach me that?
- Is that water clean?
He's fine.
Fine?!
He just took off like a 747.
Yeah, he's a good leaper, like those dogs with the Frisbees.
Owen, dogs don't fly.
Now what is up with your dog?
You won't believe me.
I know how to keep a secret.
Works for me.
We had an agreement.
You weren't going to tell anybody about this.
Hey, don't blame me.
I wasn't the one who jumped
500 feet in front of her.
I was just going for the ball.
Hubble, you were flying.
We have stronger gravity on Sirius. Ouch!
It's much bigger than Earth.
You're like an astronaut on the moon.
You can jump higher and farther.
I can do lots of things.
What I can't do is catch that infuriating bouncy ball.
Wait a second. So that rock around your neck... is this from outer space?
We all wear them.
It's a token.
- What's it mean?
- It means... home.
- Ouch!
- Here, lay down a minute.
We have to work on the woofer. Ouch.
- Hey, don't...
- Would you just...
That's why you got those thumbs.
- You're a very nice person, Owen.
- Thanks.
We really should get back... to work... woofer.
Shep, you can't fly.
You can try all you want.
You're an Earth dog.
Three, two, one... blast off!
Up, up, and away!
Barbara Ann!
We're sort of concerned about what he might be teaching... Wilson!
I believe I can fly!
Tony? Tony!
- Stupid thing.
- I got it.
- I got it, too.
- See what my dad built for you?
If you lived here, you'd have your very own house.
Get back here.
39423942
Don't touch.
Must be some sort of code.
Aren't you 3942?
Oh, 3942. I'm here.
This is 3942.
- 3942. please resporhd
- I am responding.
I don't think they can hear you.
Visitatiorh corhfirmed
Arrival of the Greater Darhe corhfirmed
- Oh, no.
- Arrival?
- Repeat. Greater Darhe arrivirhg
- When?
- When?
- When?
Hey, it's getting late, guys.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
You all right?
You're lookin' a little pale.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.
The Greater Dane is coming here.
Oh, this is bad.
She is not going to be happy.
The Greater Dane is a she?
- Of course.
- Wow!
It's all over now.
She's going to expect a proper welcome, a grand tour.
So? We'll do it.
- We'll give it to her.
- You don't understand.
When she sees what I've seen here, she'll give the order.
What order?
Come on, Hubble.
Tell me.
What's the worst thing she can do?
Global recall.
- Global what?
- Recall.
All Earth dogs will be ordered back to Sirius for punishment and retraining.
- She can't do that.
- It'll be gradual.
City by city, day after day, but trust me, she can.
- Why would she?
- I told you.
Earth dogs are not supposed to be pets.
All dogs... gone.
We can't let that happen.
It won't be up to us.
No, I mean, we can work with the dogs.
You can teach them how to give a royal welcome, and we'll come up with something that shows her how dogs run things.
I'll even act like
I'm your pet if I have to.
No, sir. I am in enough trouble already with her.
- No way.
- What did you do wrong?
Us talking right now... that's a problem, remember?
I did that.
Is it chilly out here for you, Nelly?
We'll take you inside, warm you up.
I know it's hard to imagine a world without dogs, Owen, but you can't fix things that are beyond your control.
I'm not trying to.
But if you go away and all the rest of the dogs go away...
...then... then...
Who's gonna be your best friend?
When the Greater Dane arrives, we must welcome her with dignified pageantry.
Your pride and honor should burst forth.
- Oh, Shep!
- Sorry. Spaghetti and meatballs.
That's it!
This is hopeless.
You're all leaving Earth forever.
- Hubble...
- Not now. I'm yelling.
That's what's gonna happen if you don't straighten up.
This is the Greater Dane, not some cockapoo or Shih Tzu.
She'll have you strung up by your tails.
- Strung up?
- Not my tail.
- What did he say?
- He's a little stressed out.
Let me talk to them for a moment.
You all understand that you're being asked to prove yourselves, right?
To prove that you're worthy to live here, to stay with the people you love.
We want that more than anything.
We'll do whatever we need to do.
I know you will.
Just do your best.
They usually respond better to a little... encouragement.
Let's start over.
When the Dane passes, you must bow low before her.
No one's head should ever be higher than hers.
Let's practice.
I'll play her.
Thank you.
Thank you, Earth dogs.
Nice to see you.
I'm pleased to visit your fair planet.
Oh, isn't it lovely to be here?
La-dee-dah, la-dee-dah, et cetera and so forth.
Not bad.
Not bad? That was cool.
It was good, actually.
I want to encourage you all to keep practicing.
It's an attitude... dignified, serious.
Now, have you figured out a way to convince her we're in charge?
Connie had an idea.
Tell him your plan.
Whenever a great leader visits the White House, they give a formal dinner.
It's so lovely getting together like this, Earth dogs.
We should do it more often.
It's hard for me,
Your Majesty.
I summer here, but I winter in Miami.
Yes, I summer here, too, but I winter in my poopie.
Whoa, Nelly.
That was embarrassing.
I'm fine.
Bring on the first course.
- Oh, my!
- They got steak.
I did say I was hungry enough to eat a cow.
My compliments to the chef.
That's a sausage, right, not a hot dog.
A hot dog would be wrong.
Can I just have a bite right now?
Medium rare.
Look it.
Control.
- Control.
- Shep.
Your Majesty, I would like to apologize in advance for any farting.
- Is that chicken bits?
- No, sweetheart, that's pâté.
What is she talkin' about, pa-tay?
It's French for meat byproduct.
Ooh, pass me the pâté.
I must say, the humans are much more domesticated than I expected.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Has any other Greater Dane ever visited Earth before this?
You're talking to me.
That can't happen.
Oh, yeah. Right.
It's been ages since the last visit.
I betcha this will be the fanciest welcome any Dane's ever gotten.
We are in deep diddily doo-doo.
Hey, O., lookin' pretty spiffy there.
Hey, honey, we got a very big day tomorrow.
- We're gonna sell, sell, sell.
- Sell, sell, sell.
Focus.
Eyes on the ball. Be the ball.
All right, Hub.
Go to bed.
I'm just saying, I think I could get pretty good at this game.
What's the point if you're not gonna be here long enough to play?
Oh, right.
It's just a silly game anyway.
Are you... agitated?
Yep, but it's not about you.
Don't worry.
You want a biscuit?
No.
It's hard to leave home.
I know.
But it's not where you are, Owen.
It's who you're with.
Your mom and dad and you... you make a good home.
Thanks.
All right, lights out.
I'll deal with you later.
All right, you gotta tell me.
- What?
- Why do you do those circles?
I'm building a mind fence.
- Excuse me?
- A mind fence.
It helps to keep out negative thoughts while you sleep.
Yeah, sure.
How would you like to never, ever have another bad dream?
- Never?
- Never, ever.
There. Go to sleep.
Mind fence.
Can't believe you fell for that one!
Hey.
Our cookies... in the air will help sell your house
Cookies in the air will sell your house
Oh, no.
I can sense it.
This could be the day.
Owen! This is an all-family operation.
Up and at 'em!
No, Ma.
I have to work with the dogs today.
Owen, I need you around here today.
- Mom. Mom!
- What?
There's nothing more important than me working with the dogs right now.
We've gotten some interesting calls lately from the neighbors.
A particularly interesting one from Connie's mother last night.
Your dad and I think it's time to wrap it up with the neighborhood dogs.
But, Mom, the dogs need me now more than ever.
Today you're needed here, with people.
I want you downstairs in one minute.
Not good.
Dad, watch for Hubble.
That dog.
Not today, Hubba Bubba.
- I'll get him.
- No, I got him. You stay.
I'm gonna tie him up out front.
Sit nicely out here and say,
"Hello! It's Open House Day.
Buy, buy, buy!"
That's what you're gonna tell them.
She's got a little terrier in her, that one.
- Hey, look, it's freak dog.
- What a freak.
Hey.
He's all alone.
And that should do it.
- Whoa!
- What was that?
Sounded like a sonic boom.
Yoo-hoo! Smile.
Cute.
That was a sonic boom?
Yeah. Doesn't make sense, though.
Owen, change that shirt.
I need you to pass out fact folders to the guests.
When I was a kid,
I used to hear that a lot, but we lived near an Air Force base.
That... that is weird.
Owen, tick-tock.
- Thank you.
- Great. Thanks a lot.
Mom.
- Mom.
- I was looking all over for you.
Feel free to roam the house as you like.
- I can't find Hubble.
- I'm sure he's around somewhere.
Hubble's gone.
- Give him to me.
- I'm tryin'.
I can smell them.
It's Franky and Fred.
The Greater Dane might be coming today.
We can't lose him now.
Straight edge.
Buzz cut.
- Let's give him a close shave.
- Yeah, shave.
I said the dog, loser.
There he is.
Help.
Get away from him, you punks.
- Frank!
- I'm gonna get you, you brats!
I'm outta here.
Get him.
- Go!
- Hubble, run!
If I catch your butt,
I'm gonna bite it.
That little one is mine.
Oh, my back.
Red light.
We are law-abidin' citizens.
There they are.
Green means go.
There they go.
Yeah!
Over there.
Oh, we got 'em now!
Yeah!
Owen, it's a party!
What was in that gas?
'Cause I can't see straight.
Run! Run!
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
The Greater Dane.
- Va-voom!
- That is one handsome lady.
Shh. Quiet.
Can someone tell her to stay in focus, please?
Run!
Down.
Mom. Dad.
Bow down.
All hail Her Royal Highness!
That is not a dog.
What is that thing?
- That's a rat with a wig.
- It's a wig rat.
What's the matter with all of you?
Don't you know who this is?
Look sharp!
Your Majesty, what a lovely surprise.
We were all wondering when you were gonna get your royal heinie down here.
Can I bite him?
I'll bite him if you want me to.
You have a lot of explaining to do, 3942.
3942. That's my number.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.
Pull yourself together, Canid.
I'm sorry.
I'm totally serious now. I'm... Sirius!
Isn't there one among you who knows how to give your leader a proper welcome?
Oh, you're all dog meat now.
All of you, come with me.
Earth dogs.
And you, 3942.
What a disgrace.
- What's happening?
- Nothing good.
If it makes you feel any better, we all knew you were gonna screw up.
- Back!
- Yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Every rumor I've heard about our species on this planet appears to be true.
No dominance, no dignity.
We had something formal planned for you.
"We had something formal..."
Shut your yap!
Enough.
Your little welcome party was highly revealing, 3942.
I have no choice but to give the order for global recall.
No.
I've seen all I need to see.
Wait!
No, you haven't.
You haven't.
You can't take them away.
Please. Dogs mean so much to the world, and you haven't seen any of that yet.
They protect us, and they keep us company, and they always warn us if something bad might happen.
Some dogs even work with police and firefighters, and do amazing things... things people could never do on their own.
Some dogs even help people who can't see by guiding them.
We rely on them for so much.
You should be proud of them, because people love dogs.
Did you know that?
People and dogs love each other.
I am still curious as to why a human boy is talking with me.
- Funny story.
- You did this?
It's not Hubble's fault.
I mean, 3942.
It's not his fault.
You better step down, Owen.
I'm sorry.
But please, think about what I said.
Love?
Here they come.
Hubble.
What happened?
She decided to go home.
Is it all over?
It's all over.
- Yes!
- You did it, Owen!
Wait.
What about you, Hubble?
Are you... here?
I'm... here.
I don't believe it.
I thought I blew it.
Where's everybody going?
I think everyone's tired.
Oh. Well, we can celebrate later, right?
Now we can play ball, Hub.
I know it won't be easy not going back to Sirius, but it's not where you are.
It's who you're with, right?
Yeah.
What is it, Shep?
My pretty ladybird.
Wilson?
That's my girl.
My sweet Nelly.
Yeah, you are sweet.
What?
I know I haven't been the most affectionate dog.
It's okay.
You're different, Hub.
I like that about you.
But I've seen the way others express themselves to their people, and...
I want you to know,
I do like you.
I'm just not used to all the customs here.
Hubble, it's all right.
You just told me you liked me.
How many people get to hear that from their dog?
Owen. Honey.
Mom?
Honey, Miss Ryan is at the door.
She wants to talk to you.
What about?
I know Barbara Ann's every move.
I know everywhere she would go.
You don't understand.
It's as if she simply vanished.
Nelly!
Nelly!
Oh, no.
You're not saying Owen took the dogs?
No. No, no, no.
He lost his dog, too.
I just don't understand how he could know nothing about what happened.
Now you're moving away.
Where does that leave us?
It's not Owen's fault.
- Connie, go inside.
- He tried to stop them.
Stop who, Connie?
Who took them?
The dogs.
The other dogs.
From outer space.
Maybe it is best that you're leaving.
It's because of all this constant moving we've been doing, isn't it?
I'm sure it's not helping.
The deal on the house hasn't officially closed yet.
It's not too late to change our minds.
What do we do?
Here you go.
The movers will be here at 10:00 tomorrow.
- Where's your cap?
- I can't find it.
Owen, you know we'll get you another dog.
And soon.
That's a promise.
Maybe I'm not supposed to have one, Mom.
Don't say that.
Nobody deserves a dog more than you.
Arhd firhally torhight.
File this urhder "Odd"
There's beerh a drastic irhcrease irh reports of lost dogs
all over the state recerhtly
Authorities are baffled by this rash of disappeararhces.
But say they're doirhg their best to "srhiff out" the culprits
We' see you tomooiow n ght
Hubble, I'm sorry.
I let you down.
I should've kept quiet up on that hill.
I hope I didn't get you in trouble by talking.
I didn't think of...
I just didn't think.
Now everyone's losing their dogs, and it's all my fault.
I know you can't hear me.
I miss you so much.
I never had a friend like you.
I wanted you to stay here with me so badly.
But I...
I know you have your home there.
I hope I didn't screw everything up for you.
I hope they're not being mean to you.
Because you're a good boy, Hubble.
You are.
You're a good boy.
You are.
You're a good boy.
I have often wondered what it was about human beings that could lead so many of our species astray... what it is that makes us abandon our drive for dominance.
Go on, 3942.
Speak.
Enlighten me.
I think it's friendship.
People and dogs live side by side on Earth, and they make a home together.
A home?
It seems that inspires great loyalty.
I must ask you now...
where does your loyalty lie?
I prefer the name Hubble.
Owen, it's time to go.
Bye.
Bye.
Dad, was that another sonic boom?
No, that was just the movers closing the door.
Come on, buddy.
We really need to get goin'.
- Dad.
- Sorry about that.
- Pothole.
- No, that was too big of a noise.
- Owen.
- It was too big of a noise.
- Dad, stop. Wait!
- What is it?
Stop the car.
I forgot something.
- What?
- Owen!
Hey!
Owen!
Something's going on.
- Where are you going?
- The dogs!
The dogs!
- What?
- The dogs.
I know I heard it.
I know I heard it.
Please. Please.
What was that?
Now, wait a minute.
Look at that cloud up there!
- Look at that cloud!
- Look, the sky!
What is that?
Yes!
Here, boy. Over here.
- This button, right?
- You broke it.
- Don't touch that.
- I know what I'm doing!
Wait. Wait!
Listen.
Is that the dogs?
We're home!
I missed ya, Owen.
There's my main man.
- It's good to see you.
- It was a long flight.
That's the last time
I travel in a spaceship.
There she is!
There she is!
Hey there, Mama!
Hey, guys, I'm back!
Hello, Papa.
Look, Mom, he's back.
Say hi, Shep.
Are you here...
...to stay?
Yep.
The Greater Dane declared Earth dogs an entirely different breed.
I... really missed you.
I know.
I heard.
You heard?
I think you're a good boy, too.
I almost forgot.
She said I could stay on one condition.
Whoa!
Was that your woofer again?
Hubble?
Hubble.
I have so many more questions to ask you.
How am I gonna know what you're thinking?
Start unpacking.
- We're home for good.
- Yeah.
Hubble, good boy.
Good boy.
Castlegard.
Clear!
- 250 ready.
Clear!
- 300 ready.
Clear!
He's gone.
It's over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice-cold hands.
Apart from external wounds, everything is out of alignment.
Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.
Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn't line up.
And now the spine.
Same thing. Same shift right across the third vertebrae.
This guy looks like a paper doll got cut up and pasted back together.
No wallet. No ID.
Just this thing around his neck.
It says ITC on it, so we called them.
- That outfit in the desert.
- Our biggest contributors.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Frank Gordon, ITC.
I'm here to pick up
Vince Taub's body.
I'm Dr. Cova,
I'll take care of that paperwork.
Thank you.
Vincent Taub?
That's Vinnie's good-luck charm.
Thank you.
Pretty sad when your time comes and no one claims you but your employer.
- Excuse me, sheriff.
- Sure.
Gordon.
I'm picking up the body right now.
- Was he alone or with Decker?
- Taub's the only one here.
- Get the body out of there.
- And x-rays and records.
Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?
No, there's no problem.
They've been very accommodating.
If this gets out, ITC is ruined.
Any idea how he ended up in the desert?
I don't know. Maybe he used his marker without enough clearance.
- It could be a million things.
- Not too bright.
He's dead, Robert.
Taub is dead.
Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way, what's Castlegard?
I heard that's the only word he said, "Castlegard".
Sounds like an amusement park.
Listen up, class, April 4, 1357,
Castlegard, France.
The English army in their red uniforms occupied the village of Castlegard.
The French, meanwhile, were advancing.
Trying to drive them out of there, in this direction over the river, past the monastery and up and over to the heights here.
Just leave it, Chris, that's fine, before you wreck the place.
The English army, meanwhile, had retreated to Castle La Roque.
Well fortified, very strong, very well supplied, and both sides had settled in for a long siege.
The French were trying to push the English out of France.
Lord Oliver tries to take the fight out of the French.
Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.
A woman of class and a woman of nobility.
Commander Arnaut's sister,
Lady Claire.
He hangs her from the battlements for all of the French forces to see.
Instead of demoralizing the French, it whips them into a frenzy, and they attack the castle like madmen, and they overpower the English with sheer passion.
So the fortress of La Roque fell in one night because of the death of one woman.
Lady Claire.
All right, that's enough of the academics for today.
Go get your hands dirty.
Hi, Chris.
Hey, Dad, I got Marek's clippers.
Oh, Chris, great. Thanks.
Here, hold that, will you.
You can move it around if you like.
- I thought this would be a routine trip.
- It is.
Last time you cut off your beard, you sold the house and we moved to Kentucky for a year.
- Your mother wanted a change.
- How does this always happen to me?
I am older and very much wiser than you, Have a beer.
It'll cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.
I know something's going on.
The beard's coming off, so what's really happening?
It's these amazing finds we've been making.
Doniger's been giving us too many tips.
- He's a lucky zillionaire.
- Nobody's that lucky.
He knows something he's not saying.
Something isn't right about this.
He's been ducking me.
I'm gonna get a few answers.
Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.
Put that in my bag, would you?
And don't wrinkle it.
I'd appreciate it if you don't tell anybody about this.
Especially Kate.
- Why would I tell Kate?
- Here.
Have a wee run round that, would you? "Why would I tell Kate?"
You see me twice a year, stay until you're bored to distraction.
I think the record's three weeks.
Maybe I'm just really beginning to enjoy archeology.
From a boy who hated Easter because he had to find eggs.
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.
You're still here because of Kate.
Chris.
Look, son,
I love you, but you're scorching my shirt.
Sorry.
You and Kate are from different worlds.
You saw how that turned out between your mother and me.
Yeah, but, Dad, no offense,
I'm not like you.
But Kate is.
Trust me, if it's between archeology and you, you'll lose.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I brought you a beer.
- That's so sweet.
- Half a beer anyways.
Half a beer.
- What you got going on here?
- The stairs.
The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?
Now they don't go anywhere, but they'll lead me to my tunnel which will go all the way to La Roque.
What do you say I help you out?
Show me what to do.
- I thought you hated this stuff.
- No, I don't hate it.
Let's have a beer, I need a break.
- You have the full one.
- That's sweet of you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Think you'll follow in your father's footsteps?
- No.
- No.
No way. Actually, I'm not really all that interested in the past.
No? What are you interested in then?
I think I already know the answer to that question.
I've been hoping that you'd notice.
I've been hoping you'd quit hoping
I'd notice.
So there's nothing there?
- Chris, you are the boss' son.
- So... there is something there.
It's late, I'll just start on this tomorrow.
But thanks for the beer.
- Haven't been practicing, have you?
- I'm not getting any younger.
- You love this stuff.
- It's a habit I can't quite kick.
Let me take that from you before you cut something you'll need later.
So talking about love.
- How did it go last night?
- It didn't.
So how does it feel being passed over for 600-year-old ruins?
It sucks.
It sucks big time.
I don't understand you guys.
You live in the past.
You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.
The past is what I've been force-fed since I was little.
None of you archeologists looks to the future.
What are you talking about? What is the future but just more of the same?
More gadgets, more machines like that thing you rode up on.
It's the past is where it's at, you know.
People then, they cared about each other.
- Men had honor, you know?
- No, no.
You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.
Romantic?
You want to see romantic?
Follow me.
Come on.
Come on!
What have you got?
Oh, another stone sticking out of the ground.
No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus with a French knight and his lady.
- Look, isn't she beautiful?
- She's a real knockout.
Very funny. Another thing, down here, they're holding hands.
- Incredibly unusual for that period.
- That is kind of unusual?
Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.
What happened there?
What, one ear?
That piece is missing.
It's somewhere here in the dirt.
I'm the archeologist.
It was carved that way.
- Fair enough.
- Trust me.
Who do you think they were?
Why would somebody that doesn't give a shit be concerned with that?
- Because I'm intrigued, all right?
- See?
- What you wanted to hear?
- Yeah.
We're all intrigued by this.
That's why we're all here.
It's not just about the rocks and the rubble.
It's about these people.
Who were they?
And what were their stories?
It helps us to understand where we came from, or where we're going.
- You know what I like to say.
- "You make your own history."
- Do I say it that often?
- Yeah, all the time.
Well, whoever they were, they made theirs together.
It's best to go really, really slow.
It's better to be cautious.
Come on. Hurry up!
Cave-in at the monastery!
Cave-in at the monastery!
I was standing and the floor gave way underneath my feet.
- How long has it been open?
- 15 minutes.
We have five minutes before oxygen contamination.
- Let's move it.
- Be careful.
- It's under where I was working.
- I don't know about this.
Can everybody listen up?
Let's be careful, we got that?
I've got your back. Be safe.
- Who's going in first?
- OK, let's go.
- Who's going down first?
- I am.
- On belay! On Kate!
- OK, take me down nice and slow.
- Give me a radio check.
- Please be careful.
- OK, one-two. Do you read me?
- We're good.
That's good.
Just keep it steady.
- Lower Kate down.
- Lower me down.
Easy, guys.
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
I'm getting close to the first level.
- Easy!
- Bring me down, guys.
- A little more on Marek.
- Smell the stale air.
Kate, be careful down there.
I'm down. Oh, my God. This is right below where I was working.
Are you all right?
What's going on?
"All right?" "All right" is not the word.
- One...
- Give me slack on the rope.
- More slack!
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.
We are the first people in this room for 600 years.
These...
These... are beautiful.
You won't believe the condition of these...
- What have you got?
- Come here.
No way. This is too much.
Oh, my God.
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.
An old document box.
We've got an oilskin with documents inside.
- Look at the condition of this thing!
- OK, let's be really careful.
Quick, get the bag.
- I can't believe this.
- That is gonna be such a find.
Careful, careful, careful.
Let's get this up.
I need the light for a minute.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, man!
- Give me the light.
- What kind of...
- It's amazing.
Son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
Obviously not an archeologist.
We've gotta get out of here.
Let's go!
Guys, we're coming up!
Pull it up! Come on!
We want to go up quick, OK?
- Hold this.
- What are you doing, Marek?
- It's OK.
- What are you doing?
It's definitely a modern-day bifocal lens.
I know. And bifocals weren't invented until the mid-1700s.
The hole only opened up today, Stern.
There's been nobody down that chamber before Kate and I.
If you think that's weird, you'll love this.
- What is this?
- One of the documents you found.
It's just a simple list of the things stored in there. Nothing special.
And then we found this. Look.
The professor?
"Help me"? "E.A. Johnston"?
- E.A. Johnston.
- What is going on?
I cross-matched the signatures.
It's definitely his handwriting.
But he's only been gone for two days.
Your father wrote that, but he wrote it 600 years ago.
What's going on here?
François is looking for his spare pair.
I'll see if the prescriptions match.
So you're telling me this is the professor's and it's 600 years old?
- What have you been smoking?
- Maybe you can explain.
If I knew, I'd explain it. All I know is that the ink is 600 years old.
I know. This is my father.
This is him.
- He's just playing a prank.
- No! No, there is no way he would risk contaminating the site as a joke. He just wouldn't.
- Did you carbon-date the ink?
- Of course.
- There's got to be another reason.
- I did it three times.
Like I just said, your father wrote that note, but he wrote it 600 years ago.
I don't care about ITC's policies,
I'm his son. I wanna talk to him now.
I found the professor's glasses.
They were on his desk.
It's a perfect match, Look.
We should do an optical test to make sure.
I'm sick of this. Either somebody tell me where Professor Johnston is or I report a kidnapping to the authorities.
Have I made myself clear?
Just tell us when and where.
What is it?
Doniger's sending a plane for us.
We're going to New Mexico?
Let's pack up, guys.
Good morning.
Steven Kramer, ITC.
Frank Gordon, security.
- Where's my dad?
- You'll see your dad shortly.
- Where's Doniger at?
- Doniger's waiting inside.
- Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
- Tell me.
How come we have a 600-year-old document
- with his handwriting?
- Pleading for help.
I'll explain as soon as we get through security.
ITC is constantly advancing itself in science.
30 years ago, the business world was revolutionized with a machine that sent documents anywhere with the push of a button.
Doniger's vision was to do that with 3-D objects.
- Like a fax or something?
- Exactly.
He's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
- Follow me.
- But that's impossible.
He would need a quantum computer with millions of processors.
We used them to build a machine that could fax three-dimensional objects.
I'll explain these mirrors later. It would put FedEx and UPS out of business.
- You actually made it work?
- Yes.
Across a room.
But we wanted to send things across continents so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.
The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...
- Exactly.
- Is the real thing?
We gave it a thousand times more power.
We tried to send something from New Mexico to a twin machine at a lab in New York City.
Now, here's the interesting part.
The package never arrived at its destination.
A few hours later, it showed up back here.
Wait a minute. So if it went missing between New Mexico and New York,
- where did it go in the meantime?
- We asked the same question.
So we sent out a camera over and over, and we got back photos of the same location, a hillside with trees.
That's when Mr. Doniger made the brilliant decision to point the camera straight up.
So once we cross-referenced star charts to the horizon, we realized that the camera was not only in the wrong place,
- but it was in the wrong time.
- So, what does that mean?
The camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near Castlegard, France in the year 1357.
So you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
No, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.
A wormhole that seems to be locked to a single time and place in the past:
1357, Castlegard.
So you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 14th century?
No, Chris.
Your father is in the 14th century.
What?
- We need you to help get him back.
- Mr. Robert Doniger, this doesn't make sense.
A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can't send a person through one.
Can't fit a piece of paper through a telephone wire.
But you can send a fax.
Sure, once you've broken the message into a stream of electrons, but...
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look.
I don't care about the hows or the whys.
I care about my father.
Did he know about all this?
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints about the best excavation areas, and he could discover why we're locked into this particular place and time.
So this is why you've been funding our dig.
He was more astute than I thought.
We gave him too many clues and he became very, very suspicious.
How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...
Oh, he's a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.
- Now he's stuck.
- That's where you all come in.
Do we look like wormhole specialists?
You sent the professor to the Hundred Years' War?
- Right.
- Turbulent times you sent him to.
We need cultural experts, not scientists.
My people don't know about the medieval world or how to mingle, which is what we have to do if we are to find the professor and bring him back.
So we bring him back, it's that simple.
We step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
Once he's broken us into a stream of electrons.
- Why should we do what you ask us?
- I think we need to know more...
- I know you have a lot of questions...
- A lot of questions.
The professor's already been gone for 72 hours and every minute he's there, it'll be more difficult to find him.
- That's true.
- Bob?
Excuse me, I need to get them changed if they're going to go.
- Frank, change with them.
- I'm not going.
- Gomez and Baretto are ready.
- We need to think...
- I'd like you along.
- We didn't say we were going.
Steve, can you bring them to prep, please.
Sure. Folks, this way.
Thank you. Please, this way.
Thank you.
Just follow Steve.
He'll take you to the prep room.
Bob, look. Gomez and Baretto are my two best men.
They can handle any situation.
I would prefer not going.
I really want you to go.
And if you see Decker, you know what to do.
Robert...
You know, that was a really great speech you made.
I almost believed it myself.
- Didn't you forget something?
- What?
Come on. Look at Taub's MRIs.
Look at his arteries.
This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.
They deserve to know that we don't know how he ended up in the desert.
You don't think they deserve to know that?
I've told them enough.
How did my father get stuck back there?
Doniger gave him an hour.
Things got harried, and I lost him in the woods.
- You left him there.
- We have a limited time.
I had to come back or we'd both be stuck.
I guess it's better him than you, right?
Listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we leave.
They need your vital data.
It's for your return process.
Change from your clothes into those clothes over there.
Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.
I want to introduce you to two friends.
Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.
They're coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.
- Why do we need Marines?
- Just in case something goes wrong.
I like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let's change up.
I can't believe you're considering this.
Do you understand what it does?
It strips you down to a molecular level.
Which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.
- Listen to him, he's got a point.
- Hold on! Wait a second.
I don't need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.
- I need you. You know the layout.
- Nobody knows it like I do.
- I go.
- There's no way I'm not going.
I just said I'm not going, so don't touch me!
Thanks.
Stern, we don't need you back there.
You're a physicist.
- Your knowledge won't help us.
- I'm sorry.
But we are going to need you,
François.
- Why do we need him?
- Because he speaks French fluently.
- He's right.
- My high-school French sucks.
- Don't do this.
- We need his help.
- I'll cover you.
- Don't pressure him.
François, you have to make your own decision on this.
Your father would've done it for me, so, yes, I'll come.
- OK.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Magnetic coils ready.
- Verifying now.
Platform up.
Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.
Tell Gordon we've got to get going.
Keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
Mr. Stern.
Watch our backs, OK?
It will be all right.
We'll be back before you know it.
- Take it easy, bro.
- You know the 50 bucks I owe you?
All right, let's move it.
Frank, six hours and the clock is running.
Wear these personal markers around your neck.
You can use any one of them to call for your return.
Frank will explain their intricacies once you arrive.
Most importantly, one marker will bring all of you back.
- Do not lose them.
- What about weapons?
Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.
- They're set for a six-hour countdown.
- Countdown?
- They burn out after six hours.
- And then?
I'll get you back before you know it.
Sorry, François, they didn't have these back then.
I don't see without...
You'll be fine. That's where we goofed with the professor.
I feel morally compelled to inform you that there is a degree of pain.
I'm told it's rather intense, but extremely fleeting.
A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.
So forgive me. I didn't want that to influence your decision.
- OK. Good luck.
- Let's do it.
You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.
Good luck.
Don't worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.
- Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
- A fantastic thing for an archeologist.
- I can't believe we're doing this.
- Slowly. There are no railings.
Josh, come on down. Come watch.
Josh, come on down. Come watch.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Take a place around the perimeter.
- Spread out.
- Move around the platform.
Take a deep breath, relax.
We'll be back before you know it.
- Are we set?
- All systems check.
Come in, Josh. Close the door.
- Good luck.
- Six hours and counting.
Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek.
I need you to take your position.
How's everybody doing?
- What the hell are we doing?
- Getting the chance of a lifetime.
Nothing to worry about.
We'll take care of you.
Just relax. Everything will be fine.
- DNA streams locked in.
- Thank you.
- OK, lock them in.
- Locking in.
- How long does it take?
- A couple of seconds.
Watch it here.
Mirrors locked.
Son of a...
Where is he? François!
- Are you all right?
- Where's François? François?
- There he is!
- François!
Pull him out!
Now we wait.
Give me your hand!
- Come on!
- François, hold on! Hold on!
Hold on!
- Here, take my hand.
- You all right?
You all right?
Everybody all right?
That was a close one.
All right.
Let's head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.
- Hell of a start.
- We've always arrived on land.
- Gordon, is this it?
- I think so.
You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?
- This could be Oregon.
- Gordon, where are we?
Shut up!
Trust me, we're in 1357 France.
- Well, if this is France. I'm home.
- Come on, let's go.
Let me explain the markers. Press here, it shows the remaining time.
Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don't.
- Why?
- We haven't found his dad yet.
One last thing...
- He said, "Hide". Everyone hide.
- All right, take cover.
Let's go! Move! Now!
François, come on!
Well done, Sir De Kere.
- After him.
- Yes, my lord.
Get the others.
Find out who they are.
Come on, quick.
Oh, God! Baretto!
We got a field buck!
They're coming back!
- Oh, my God.
- Get a medic!
Get a medic up here!
- What was that? What was that?
- What?
What is that?
That's a grenade! Get down!
Oh, my God, he's left.
Get down! He'll see you!
You! Over here!
Let's go. Come on, come on!
All right, let's go.
Come on, Chris!
Kate!
Marek! Hey.
- Where's my boys? Where's Marek?
- The guys came after Baretto.
He took some arrows and then he pressed his marker. He's gone.
He took two arrows, and he must have hit his marker.
- Where's Gomez?
- I didn't see him.
Oh, my God.
Don't look.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit, I can't find his marker.
You're looking for his marker?
He's dead!
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us out of here.
- We're not going anywhere.
- We can't save anyone if we're dead!
- Keep it quiet.
- You can't do that.
Why not?!
You need 40 feet of clearance around all sides to work.
- What?
- I was trying to tell you.
Don't lose these. They're precious.
And if you follow my lead, I will get your dad and get you home.
- François, it's going to be OK.
- Let's find Marek.
- What about Gomez?
- We can't do anything about him now.
- We gotta go. Look at me.
- François, come on.
Be quiet! The soldiers!
You passed us. You passed us in the woods. It's OK. It's OK.
- We've lost the trail.
- Damn it.
- Pick it up again.
- Yes, Sir De Kere.
Search down by the river.
Jesus, you're a girl.
It's OK.
After the French bastards!
After them! Leave none living!
Careful.
- There you are.
- No.
Help! Help!
Shut it off!
He knew not to take anything modern.
That son of a bitch brought a grenade back with him.
I can't believe it.
The coils. The coils.
Damn it! He knew the regulations, no modern weapons!
- Gomez?
- The lines are online!
- Well...
- His marker.
- What happened to the rest of them?
- Get a medic over here!
- I don't know.
- Give me your gloves.
Well, did anyone try to come back with him?
I don't know. I know as much as you, OK? Hang on.
What if they're trying to come back now?
- It's not gonna happen...
- Don't jump to conclusions.
You can't leave seven people stuck back there!
- Tell me you have a backup plan...
- Shut up!
I don't know. I don't know.
Please tell me you have a backup plan.
Yes, we have a backup plan.
Go!
Gordon! Gordon! It's Marek! Chris!
This Frenchwoman will lead us to Castlegard.
Great. That's great.
Let's go. Come on.
The village of Castlegard.
We're here.
Where is everyone going?
Hold on a second.
- What day is this?
- Marek...
It's the fourth of April.
- Of course it is. It's April 4th.
- The day La Roque falls?
- Wait, wait.
- What are you talking about?
- You son of a bitch,
- Excuse me?
- You brought us back on the day the French attack.
By tonight, this whole place is gonna be burned to the ground.
Stop with the history and look for the professor.
Now, follow me.
Let's go.
I'm a physicist. Give me something to do. I can help.
- Might as well be a pharmacist.
- Good one, Robert.
- Replacement panels are on their way.
- How long will this take?
Five hours and 27 minutes.
How do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
Because that's all the time we have.
Once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
The thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.
But you've opened and closed it dozens of times.
- Once the platform...
- Look, we don't even know what we did to link us to this wormhole.
A lucky calibration, chance impurity in the coils. The point is, the grenade probably destroyed any possibility of re-creating it.
Once their markers expire, they could be stuck there forever?
- Is that what you're saying?
- They could be.
Guys, come on. Come on, come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, this way.
Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.
- The manor house.
- Look at that.
I can't believe it.
We were just working on it.
That's Castlegard, all right.
It's different.
That right section, I had wrong.
- Where did that tower come from?
- What if my Dad's in there?
- Yeah, you're right.
- How are we gonna get in?
Guys, soldiers coming.
- You there!
- Come on.
Why aren't you packing up?
- Run! Run!
- Halt! Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don't let them get away!
Get that horse out of the way!
My lord!
- Pick him up.
- Come on, my friend.
- Who are they?
- We captured them in the village.
I am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?
- I do, my lord.
- You speak strangely.
Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.
Scottish? You've come to kill us all in our beds?
First the old man and now this group.
Why do the Scottish find this village so pleasing?
- It must be your lord's kind manners.
- Indeed it must.
My lady.
- I beg your pardon, my lord.
- Let him speak.
- My lord, the old man you spoke of...
- Edward De Johnness?
He claims he's a magister.
- Do you know of him?
- He's our master, sir.
- All is well with him?
- He said he was alone.
We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.
Who are you?
Yes, you. The one whose head is touching the ceiling.
François, my lord.
A Frenchman.
Hold. Please. Please.
We're all gentlemen here.
He's our interpreter, sir.
Forgive them. I'm at war with the
French, as well as the Scottish.
Have I forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am I at war with them?
Arnaut has sent many spies into my midst.
- No, he's not a spy.
- No?
- He's our friend.
- I'm sure he is.
He's too tall to be a spy, anyway.
- Interpret.
- Be quiet.
Interpret.
- I'm a spy.
- I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
- It means...
- Be quiet, François.
I am a spy.
My God, it's a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.
- Did you hear that?
- No.
Louder, boy! Come on!
I am a spy.
I thought so.
- Oh, my God!
- Get rid of the Frenchman.
Put them with the old man.
We may need them.
Who's next?
- No!
- No, Chris!
Don't! Don't!
François. François.
Inside!
- Up! Move it! Move it!
- No! Don't push me!
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Move it, ease on!
- All right, you bloody Scottish!
- Hold on!
I'm moving!
Over here, Andre.
This way. Come on.
My marker. Guys, I lost my marker!
Don't worry, we only need one marker to get home, OK?
- This can't be happening.
- Careful with the rest.
Those bastards killed François.
Professor.
Professor!
- Kate?
- Yeah.
- Kate. Oh, my God, Kate.
- Are you all right?
Oh, my God. You got my message.
Chris, your dad.
- Chris is here and Marek's here.
- Dad?
- Son.
- Dad.
- Chris, my son.
- Glad you're still alive.
Oh, God.
What happened?
- You've lost such blood.
- It's not my blood.
It's François'.
He's dead.
Oliver had him killed because he's French.
This guy had a sword and he just ran him through.
Professor, what happened?
I was trying to avoid the English, but they found me in the monastery.
I convinced Oliver I was a magister on my way to Dublin.
I skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?
- It's a scientist.
- He accused me of being a spy.
- How did you survive that?
- I promised Oliver a new weapon.
What kind of weapon?
A liquid fire so intense that even water couldn't harm it.
Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?
Professor. I'm sorry, have you considered what you may have done?
You've given the English a serious advantage in this battle.
- They're supposed to lose the war!
- I was alone!
- Marek. Marek!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.
The point is, when these guys come here, and take us up to La Roque.
When they seal that place off for battle, there is no escape.
We're as good as dead.
- No, we gotta get out of here now.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Remember that field where the peasant huts were?
That's the closest place with enough room to use the marker.
- How do we get there?
- We have to do it fast.
- We've got four hours.
- Four hours is plenty.
The way I see it, we've got 650 years of knowledge on these guys.
There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get home in 20 minutes.
- OK, let's find a way out.
- Let's look around.
There's a hole here big enough to climb through.
- Quiet!
- OK, all right.
She was with the group we caught earlier, my lord.
May I ask why you're trespassing on my land?
Come, come.
- What are you doing?
- Here's what I'll do:
I'm gonna scale down the wall. When it's clear, I'm gonna let you guys out.
- All right.
- You're not going anywhere.
What? I am, I'm...
Marek, I'm the best climber,
I am the best climber.
If anyone should be going, it should be me, but those roof slats won't hold me, or you, or you, Chris.
- No, no...
- Wait. Wait.
But they might hold you, Kate.
Now, Kate, this isn't a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?
I'll do what I have to do.
There's no way.
You're not going anywhere.
It's going to be all right, OK?
There's one thing worse than dying here, and that's living here.
I refuse to do either.
I'm going. It's OK.
She's right.
Kate.
- Please, please take care.
- Hey, it's easy. It's gonna be easy.
Chris, I need your help. Come on.
I need you to hold that back and keep it open.
All right?
- Kate, be careful.
- OK, here I go.
- Easy.
- There's guards there.
I'm gonna go up and over.
- There's a window on the side.
- OK, watch yourself.
I got you! I got you! Hold on!
Hold on. I got you. Don't let go.
- Are you OK?
- I've got a foothold.
- We're gonna pull you back in.
- No, I'm good.
- OK, please be careful.
- I've got to keep going.
You, man! Gather those children and move!
All clear on the outside.
Hold your line, men! In position!
Too much ale.
We'll play again when I get back.
Keep them quiet.
- What the...?
- Now!
Grab a weapon!
- Let's go, Chris!
- Very sorry.
We're heading out the way we came in, all right? Marek?
- Marek!
- Yeah, yeah. You go ahead.
- I'll take the rear.
- All right, let's go!
Kate, we gotta go.
Oh, be careful!
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!
Quiet.
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.
- What are you doing?
- Listen.
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go.
- I got my marker, I'll catch up.
- Come on.
- Where is he?
- He'll catch up. He's got his marker.
- Robert!
- Yeah?
DNA streaming should be online... now.
- Got it!
- Fully functioning?
- Yeah!
- It's a start.
- Don't move. Don't say a word.
- Traitor!
Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me?
Shit!
For God's... Jesus!
Scotsman! Stop, it's me!
Stop!
What? What are you saying?
Ax! Give me the ax!
And help me watch for the wall!
Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!
- Help me!
- Get out of the way, woman!
Get out of the way!
Please! Come on! There we go!
Go!
Guards!
- Who is that guy?
- His name is De Kere.
Come on. Quick, let's head back to the river.
Get more guards!
- We're not going without Marek.
- I don't give a shit about Marek.
My job was to get the professor.
I can't take care of you.
I lost Gomez, Baretto. You guys are on your own. Or follow me. Let's go!
To the river, quick.
We have a field buck.
Somebody's trying to come back.
- How strong?
- It's minimal.
- What does that mean?
- It means they're still alive.
Halt!
Come on. Come on.
Where is he? Where's Gordon?
Where's...?
- There he is. There he is.
- I saw him. Come on!
- Wait. Watch it.
- Chris! Drop your weapon.
OK. Go.
Oh, shit.
- Come on!
- Gonna leave us like you left my dad?
- People are looking.
- There's no time.
- Listen. Listen.
- Everybody is looking.
- Be quiet.
- Kate, hit your marker.
Press yours.
I'm not going without Marek.
- Hit your marker.
- You're not going anywhere.
Marek's got his own marker.
Search every building and every farm!
- Oh, shit.
- Kate, press it.
We can come back for Marek.
Press it. We've been here too long.
- Press it.
- It's not working.
- It's not working.
- I know how to do this.
- Why isn't it?
- I don't know.
- If it were working, we'd be home now!
- Everybody, walk away slowly.
Let's find a place to hide.
Infantry, spread out. Search the huts!
Search everywhere and capture them!
Oh, by the way, my name's Andre Marek.
Castlegard was your village, wasn't it?
- Don't worry, you'll return there soon.
- No.
The English will burn it to the ground before they move to La Roque.
- No, La Roque will fall too.
- Yes.
But it will take many more lives and many months of fighting before it happens.
The French built that fortress.
We know how strong it is.
La Roque will fall tonight.
Only a prophet... or a fool could make such a claim.
In your case, it's probably the fool.
Whichever makes you smile like that.
Are you... married?
No.
We've been fighting the English since before I was born.
There's no time for marriage.
Of course.
Are you with... anyone?
- Am I with anyone?
- Yeah.
I'm with you.
I know. I know.
What I mean is, is there someone...?
Is there someone that you see?
- Do I see?
- Yeah.
Nobody. It is possible they are hiding on the shore or in the woods.
They could be anywhere.
Oh, God. You know, it's funny, but we're speaking the same language, but you don't understand anything I'm saying, do you?
Get them!
No, no.
It is good. They are French.
They will help us.
- You're Lady Claire.
- Lady?
I like that. It's charming.
Dame Claire.
Fire!
Fire!
Find them!
I killed that man.
I've gotta live with that.
- In here!
- We found them!
- We found them, my lord!
- Over here now!
- Come on!
- Don't let them go!
Come on!
Go inside!
Go around the back.
- Shut up and move over there.
- Come on.
- Burn it.
- No.
- No, you can't do that!
- Don't.
Chris, please get out of there.
Chris!
Chris! My son's in there!
Chris, get out of there!
Hold your man.
No! No!
All right, come on.
- Come on.
- Chris, wait up.
- Come on.
- Wait up.
- Claire!
- Arnaut.
He is very grateful you returned his sister...
- You're English.
- No, I'm Scottish.
Arnaut, he saved the life of one of your men.
- You're Scottish?
- Yes.
In that case, I do not know how to express my gratitude.
Well, you can. Just keep her close and keep her safe.
- I can take care of myself.
- Yes, that's obvious.
Please, do not let her out of your sight, especially tonight.
Do not worry, she will be well protected.
I must leave. I must return to Castlegard to search for my friends.
I need to ask you perhaps for a horse and a weapon.
You will not make it alive through the English lines.
They are moving from the village to La Roque. We attack tonight.
- You must not go back there.
- I must try and find my friends.
I'm sorry.
Very well. I will give you what you ask for.
- Thank you again.
- Thank you.
- Lady Claire...
- Claire.
I wish we had met at another time.
Andre Marek.
Are you married?
No.
Arnaut?
Arnaut has dismounted, and he's with his sister.
Well done.
In fast, kill Arnaut and out.
And may God be with you.
All right. I have to get inside
La Roque and find my dad.
- You'll never make it through.
- I'll find a way.
There is no way. You'll get killed.
Oh, Jesus. Go, go.
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.
There's another way.
- What, the tunnel?
- Yeah.
You never found it.
You don't know it exists.
- There's always been a rumor.
- Yeah, but that's a rumor.
- My dad's life is on the line.
- All of our lives are on the line.
Look, if that tunnel ever existed, it's going to exist now, 1357.
I know it's in that monastery. I know it.
I wanna save your father as much as you do.
You have to trust me,
I know it's there.
I know it.
You've got to trust me.
Stay in line.
- Move along.
- Keep the pace!
Kill Arnaut!
Claire!
Claire! Claire!
Move along!
Come on, lads.
That's Marek! Marek!
- Marek!
- I'm OK.
It's Chris and Kate, Marek.
- What about Chris and Kate?
- They didn't make it.
- They've killed them.
- What?
Been a while, hasn't it, Frank?
Oh, my God.
I thought you were dead.
Right, that's why you sent Taub to assassinate me.
Not to assassinate you, to bring you home.
- Right, just like you are.
- No, look... Listen.
- Listen to me, Will. I need your help.
- What's this?
Look, it's not working anyway.
It says here you got less than one and a half hours left.
- It doesn't work.
- Bullshit.
Look, you've got to believe me, it wasn't my fault, OK?
- I've got a family.
- Yeah?
- You've met my family.
- You got a family?
- You have a family.
- I've got a family.
- So did I!
- No!
- No!
- No! No!
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!
Last time I saw him, he was running with his marker for an open space.
I was on the ground, three arrows in me.
I used to be William Decker.
ITC employee number 273.
Now...
I'm Sir William De Kere.
Lord Oliver's aide-de-camp.
You looked pretty impressive today,
Marek, for an academic.
- How do you know my name?
- I know all of your names.
We read every report out of your dig before we made the first trip back.
How many times have you been here?
Enough to know transcription errors intimately.
Transcription errors?
Doniger, that son of a bitch.
He hasn't told you a thing, has he?
What are transcription errors?
Mistakes in the DNA reconstruction process.
- It's like faxing a fax.
- Distortions. Mistakes.
Only the distortions aren't in the letters.
It's body parts. The organs.
I've gone in too many times.
I'll never survive another trip.
All that damage, it can be repaired, but not here.
And not in this time.
You'd have to go back.
Why don't you press the marker?
We can all go home, Decker?
My name is De Kere.
This is my home.
Lord Oliver awaits his Greek fire.
After that, your survival depends on your knowledge of history.
How good you make me look.
I rise in favor, so do you.
I fall, you fall.
I fall, you fall.
Marek, where's your marker?
De Kere, Decker, whatever his name is, he took it off me.
Oh, God.
We're friends of
Edward De Johnness.
- Edward De Johnness.
- The magister.
He's my father.
- The Englishmen have harmed him?
- We don't know.
- We were gonna ask for your help.
- Yeah, we need your help.
Come.
We need to hurry.
We don't have much time.
Lord Oliver demands a demonstration before nightfall.
It would be best not to miss the deadline.
They've done it. The stuff's all there.
This stuff's a bit coarse, but it's good.
What am I talking about?
I can't do this.
I can't give them Greek fire and influence the course of history.
- I may already have done that.
- What do you mean?
When we first arrived here, we were helped by this girl who took us up to Castlegard.
In fact, that's who I went back to get when we escaped.
That girl turned out to be
Lady Claire, Arnaut's sister.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
I've delivered her to the French for safekeeping.
She's incredibly important.
Her death rallies the French to win.
- Don't you understand?
- Keep it down, OK?
Now we have to be on Oliver's side just to stay alive.
This is exactly where I was digging.
This is it. This is the place where...
We're here. We're...
What do you mean?
This is the chamber where I was working.
- I'm sorry, what did he say?
- The army of Arnaut is ready to attack.
- We're running out of time.
- Those are the stairs. It's under here.
Move them up here.
There's a goodly number of trebuchets, my lord.
What's a little fire to these stone walls?
- There's nothing down here.
- This is it.
This is the chamber.
This is where the hole was.
- We came down here...
- There's nothing here.
Marek would've been working there.
The box would've been...
Oh, my God. That is the box.
That's the parchment he wrote on.
My father's glasses.
- Yeah, we've got to go.
- No, no, put it back.
If we don't find this, in the future we're never gonna find your father.
Put it back.
We still gotta go.
We gotta get up to La Roque.
No, the stone relief was damaged.
Somebody had damaged it.
"What kind of son of a bitch would damage something so..."
It was me.
It was me.
I was the son of a...
What is she doing?
Wait! Get back! Stay back!
Watch out. Watch out.
It's the tunnel.
It's the tunnel!
Give me a torch.
Hey, give me that one,
Kate, watch out. Let me go in.
- Get Arnaut?
- Yes, get Arnaut. Go.
- Please, hurry, Hurry.
- Kate, get in here.
You got it?
Yeah, I do.
Careful, boys, this is Greek fire.
You can blow us all to hell here.
Smooth and easy, now.
No spills.
That's good.
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!
Shit.
- You OK?
- Yeah. Hurry, there's no time.
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet! Trebuchet!
Bring water!
Lord Oliver, the magister with your demonstration.
Oh, yes, I'll see it now.
- Understand, my lord, I've never...
- Show me now!
- Show him!
- Your fire of the Greeks.
- Marek, fire it!
- OK, come on, let's move it.
Trebuchet!
Just fire the damn thing!
I cannot fire it.
Fire it!
- Fire!
- Ready, fire!
Out of the way. Move.
Let me pass.
That's it?
So you betrayed me.
You promised me Greek fire.
I should have had you hung...
- What?
- With your permission, my lord.
The more water, the more fire.
Good.
Better.
My God, you are a magician, not a magister.
I want this for every cannon.
How many men will you need?
- Twenty.
- Twenty.
- Give this man 20 men.
- As you wish.
This way, magician.
Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!
- We have 81%.
- No, no. It's over.
I'm not gonna play with their lives like this.
We can't get 100% efficiency from patched-together coils.
What's the safest minimum percent?
- We've done successful tests at 80%.
- You just said we have 81%.
- They were inanimate objects.
- With reflectors up.
- How much time do we have?
- 28 minutes.
No room for error.
- They could be deformed.
- Can we?
- Yes, we can.
- It's too risky.
You think I'm gonna let you leave them?
- Think I want to?
- I don't think you care.
They have a chance, some kind of life.
No, you lost the chance for that decision a long time ago.
- This is no longer your decision.
- You know what? It is and I have.
I'm sorry.
- Fire the moat.
- Yes, my lord.
Fire the moat!
- Light your arrows.
- Light arrows.
- Archers, prepare.
- Archers, prepare.
- Stretch.
- Stretch.
Away!
- Night arrows.
- Night arrows.
A little surprise for the French.
- Ready!
- Stretch.
Away!
We're close now.
We're close. I know it.
Great.
Well done, my lord.
Trebuchet!
One more of them, and we become history.
Oh, no.
No.
We're going.
Forward, right maybe.
Maybe it's just...
Or we could go up, right?
We could go up.
- Kate...
- No, don't. No! No!
- Kate.
- No.
Kate.
Maybe we missed something.
Maybe we made a wrong turn.
- We could...
- It's too late.
It's just too late.
I said trust me, and I've let you down.
And I've let your father down. And...
- I've let everybody down.
- No.
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- No, you didn't.
Kate, come here.
Kate, come here.
Come here. Come here.
- Close the inner gates!
- Close the inner gates!
- This is growing tiresome.
- The courtyard is secure, my lord.
Good, but this Frenchman needs to be put in his place.
- It's time.
- Captain!
It is time!
Robert.
Thirteen minutes left.
Let's try and get them back.
Are we gonna go over all this again?
What are you doing?
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I'm protecting our interests.
- What's happened to you?
- How many lives are lost on the cutting edge of discovery?
- It's the price for great advances.
- These were kids, not astronauts!
- I know!
- They had no idea!
Even worse when they're deformed!
You know the media.
They'll twist it around and label it a "death machine".
- It has a serious flaw!
- And you'll fix it.
- No, I won't.
- Like you fixed everything else.
- No.
- What?
- You won't?
- No, I won't.
I can't believe you'd just throw away your place in history.
- I already have, we're cycling up.
- Think you can go behind my back?
Kramer!
Kramer?
- Make the prisoner ready.
- What is your will, my lord?
- Back to work.
- Secure her to the battlements.
I want to be sure the French can see her.
At once, my lord.
- I'll give your brother a choice.
- Oh, shit.
- You are to be tied to the battlements.
- What?
Either he lays down his arms or he kills you with his own weapons.
Let us hope a man who stoops to using his own sister as a spy still has some sense of decency left.
God be with you, lady.
It's her.
It's Lady Claire.
I delivered her to Arnaut for safekeeping.
- How did the English get her?
- It's history.
Then history will change.
Oliver.
Release Lady Claire and bring her down to me now, or by God.
I will destroy your arsenal.
- Marek! No!
- Get the hell out of here. Go now!
Halt!
For God's sake.
If that thing blows, it'll kill us all.
- Bring her down.
- No! Do not touch her!
My lord, if he drops the torch, he then kills her too. He will not do it.
Back off, De Kere.
Or Decker, or whatever your name is.
I will blow your arsenal to hell!
- There's no way out.
- You're English.
- No. No, no, we're not.
- You're English! This is a trap!
- Run, my lord!
- Marek!
- You are working for Oliver.
- No, we're not.
I will kill both of you!
Down!
- Yeah!
- Yahoo!
Be careful, my lord.
Archers, to the battlements!
Here.
- Hold the line on the east tower.
- Oliver!
Kill her! Now!
- Arnaut!
- Claire!
We've got to find the others.
Don't!
Hold your line!
- Dad.
- Chris, you're alive! Kate, thank God!
- Where's Marek?
- I don't know.
There goes Marek.
There's Marek.
It's OK. It's OK, Claire.
It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me. It's me.
- What are you doing?
- Open the gate.
Chris, stop!
- It's solid.
- Let me get up. I've gotta get up.
- Can you?
- Yeah.
This is for France.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where's Marek?
- I don't know.
- He went after Lady Claire. There.
No!
My ear! My ear!
It's me.
It's me.
- It's not working.
- Well, it's broken.
- OK.
- I gotta get Marek.
De Kere took his.

but want know you sincerely what with those people have happened there? bekijk this help it once, perhaps. you examine these link because many have disappeared, also children.
 onschuldigen in the eyes god have disappeared.
 we must fear, but not for disappeared people.
 they have trusted god and by Jesus to the sky have been brought.
in Thessalonicenzen stand that the lord with a gil comes to the ground. it is the voice of the archangel, on which the deads will arise. those who live then still will be incorporated by god in the sky...
 for afterwards for always at him to be.
think that vent that the bible explains everything? you then have not been persuaded? 
bowls on, the bible are this way vague that it can mean of everything. then must tell I still something you.
Pastoor Billings has also disappeared.
I these link has suffered three years with him made. that is nevertheless impossible.
How can he have blamed that? here answer it all.
And that also. Ezechiël 38.
 are those codes then bible feathers? 
 Ezechiël 38: The lord his people will guard north for the enemy from t.
he will do that by a wonder. it state all.
Exactly such as you have seen it.
and this then? These ten pieces country are soon of Jonathan Stonagal. are that also biblical? that is Daniël 7, the extase, disappearances.
 this is the beginning of the antichrist.
are ten kingdoms the world will master. ten waardelozen pieces country is no kingdoms.
 unless they have the oath formula.
 Stonagal want master the wereldvoedsel stock. And what is this?  
Thessalonicenzen 2: The antichrist in god temple will call itself god. the temple of Salomon in Jerusalem?  - That is correct.
 if that antichrist wants rebuild the temple, become it war.
 lustres nou to what I say.
Everything stand in the bible.
 he will rebuild the temple.
That gives I you on a note. the Arabs never allow that.
 peace will come.
- In the Middle East? 
Daniël 9.27. He will contract a treaty with many for seven years.
 admit that this captivating is.
Griezelig even.
 but niksdoen are not possible also.
Then changes there nothing.
 Buck, wait just as.
Wait nou.
Buck, where you go naartoe? - I cannot remain now real.
I must to V.N.to warn Chaim.
Williams, how you want that to do if you do not know truth? say the bible: Trust god, differently are deceived you. you are here not occasional and that weet you. You feel its presence. feel you how god draws to your heart. do not ignore him, Buck. ladies and lords, can I just as your attention? it is official. Nicolae Carpathia become the new Secretary-General.
Mr.. Carpathia soon n will give statement and your questions to answer. you must this side on.
- I come for Chaim.
I cannot let m. disturb. accompany Mr.. Williams.
- I have my orders, miss Durham.
I act now on behalf of Mr.. Carpathia.
- Of course, my excuses.
I thank it all to you.
Nicolae are a supporter of your. By your letter of recommendation I sit in his staff. he is a good man. this is indeed a good spot be. For us both.
Buck, I piled up already your arrival.
I can consider none person better... to tell this historical news. want guard you for an enormous error. will sit just as. cares that this news for the half hour is worldwide transmitted. with that are we already busy.
Stonagal and Cothren have you bel eyes.
Oaths belong to their plans. mines formula go to V.N...
That is last hope now our. but as V.N. bankruptcy is, has Stonagal and Cothren everything. the country and the formula. they master then the complete food stock of the world. this must know Carpathia. that is not nevertheless where? they have used our dreams against us, Nicolae. seem it this way unthinkable. after this tale the world will know truth. this way simple do not lie it.
Those men were my counsellors. it were friends of me. it are, however, assassins.
Buck, you have to no reason against me lie. mails this urgently to Mr.. Williams office. This must be now confessed. thank, Mr.. Carpathia.
- No care. I now protect you. pardon, but what is that? this is a dream which ends up for Israel. we will rebuild our temple. the temple? But that will permit the Moslems never. the exact spot where the temple stood has been found... and those spots lie beside the mosque in perfect harmonie. what a terrible omen, hé? We go work innovative soon. in the light of all this...
- We progress. we divide food and we rebuild the temple as a symbol. it not only becomes for the Jews, but for whole humanity. will start our seven years of peace. are not possible this nevertheless? in spite of your doubt become this a terrible day. we are ready, lords.
We will change the history. thank for everything what you have done. want you that construction continues? - Yes, allicht.
 there stood or turned out better than expected t peace plan.
Do you realise, however, what this mean? just as thought I of, however. excuse me just as.
- Does it go, however, well with your? value, go it, however, well with your?  
I feel myself this way helpless.
He rang but. he truth himself must discover. that weet I, however. But I would want that we could do also something. we can ask help zoeken god him. it is therefore where. it is therefore all where.
I have never prayed.
I weet what I must say. it regrets me this way.
Nevertheless forgives you me.
I weet simply that I have you necessary. and I believe also. show me nevertheless what I must do.
Ah Mr.. Williams, there are you. feel themselves you, however, good?  674 01:24:27,036 --> 01:24:31,729 come along you? For the press conference we must meet still. you must be if I unmask Stonagal and Cothren. the right will triumph.
Cole, remain at Mr.. Williams. nicely to weerzien you.
Finely that you are there. ladies and lords, my excuses for the delay. You will nevertheless sit.
Chaim, seat oneself.
Mr.. Williams, come sit you at our?  
Mr.. Carpathia, no press would be at this meeting.
Mr.. Williams are here as a liaison for our delegation. that would have had discuss you in avance with our.
Mr.. Williams journalistic state of service shows... that he is only interested in truth. and those interest our all.
There we are it nevertheless concerning once? we stand make a paradise on the point of this planet. a couple was suffered weeks this still unthinkable had been. ten oases... with an own delegate who has absolute power in its area. a truth world community.
A world where peace dominates. start our seven years of peace. this is the beginning of the antichrist. are ten kingdoms the world will master. the antichrist in god temple will call itself god.
I give of you power which belongs to your new position the to everyone. as kings and queens in own country... you will create prosperity and abundance for your volken. and that all in my name.
Nicolae, where it has you? This we have never agreed. in the court of oaths, were there the snake which seduced Eva. that led to the fact that people were repudiated from the paradise. those snakes stand since then between the our and paradise. where this goes for, Carpathia? - This goes for your tweeën. you are snakes that entity and prosperity for you yourselves uses. that is ridiculous, Nicolae.
- Do not lie against me.
I was manipulate this way null and void and this way easily. who is now the marionette, Jonathan?  Look s where I am and where you are.
Weet you in fact, however, against which you have it? 
Weet you, however, against which you have it?  
I necessary you from to connect you at this terrible team. accepted my invitations. we have made your, Nicolae.
You thank you exist to us.
I understand it already.
Donald m.. Alternus? - Yes Mr, who is I.
Newark, New Jersey? - Indeed. can say Don I against you?  
Don, want me give you your weapon? this is a clear lesson in leadership. you crazy person has become? What intends you?  
Nicolae...
- Will sit, Chaim.
 lustres nou.
We want nevertheless all the same? o, which gladly believe I. miss Durham, go you just as aside?  To spot its sin of your bundle. your knees, Jonathan. no, there come nothing of in. someone must make to this an end. we nevertheless sit in the same team? That is nevertheless this way? people will know that I fear nothing and nobody.
I will act and everywhere in battles without hesitation or tegenwerking. as from now can take nobody it more against me. that type had power you you like put, Jonathan. but 01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:18,245 indicated not frightened.
This becomes entirely painless.
I am no monster.
- Nicolae, alsjeblieft.
I was scared this way then Mr.. Stonagal the weapon of the keeper took away... and then his friends Mr.. Cothren shot. then he afterwards the weapon on itself aimed, everyone had been bewildered. but Jonathan were teased debt feeling and fear. then he heard that Williams would unmask m., was he in order Council. he knew that his boze plans from would come and that his life work... where he had done this way his best on, totals would be destroyed.
I would have wanted do weet that you this for Dirk and Alan. but pers-liaison with blood to his hands are possible I do not have.
I have large plans with your. your tales concerning Stonagal and Cothren transmit GNN at this moment. the complete world finds me quite now.
Everyone will follow me blindly.
I have to and thank that to you.
Thus thanks, Buck. are we it all once? to two lives in a tragic manner an end has come. and that all cupidity. that is nevertheless terrible sad? terribly sad.
- It is terribly sad. it is time change the history. no movements. why nou? ladies and lords, keep distance. They are dead. Take away those delegates. the room is clearred.
This side. go it, however, with your? - The everyone now room. Reverse. what has seen you?  
I saw how Stonagal caught the weapon of the keeper and Cothren shot. afterwards shouted he something concerning discharge... and aimed t weapon then at themselves.
But you have nevertheless also seen? and Nicolae then? - That poor man. he are this way by them deceived.
He is of it. put you once for, products his best friends.
Buck, go it, however, with your?  
Hattie, this are incredibly.
- And this way terrible tragic. then Stonagal seized that weapon...
Hattie, you are this way...
- I weet it. I have been favoured.
I want do really everything help Nicolae. It is a terrible man.
I must ervandoor. course but with me.
Nicolae Carpathia showed much courage by making plan this boze confessed. nevertheless give the head of V.N. not for his own security. he promises continue with his peace plans and disarmament. this way lack now we leaderships, are Carpathia the hope for the radelozen. the bible forecasts end up. if the antichrist comes to the power then are this still but the beginning. then become the coming seven years most terrible from the history. our only hopes are meet and god to trust
I do not know also all answers, but is provisional enough the belief.

Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this…
and you're going to listen, and you're going to stay on the line.
You're not going to interrupt.
You're not going to speak for any reason.
Now, some of this you know.
I'm going to start at the top of the page.
Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.
They were these things.
Nothing extreme.
Like anyone, they varied.
There were days of mistakes and laziness and infighting.
And there were days, good days, when by anyone's judgment…
they would have to be considered clever.
No one would say that what they were doing was complicated.
It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except for maybe in the geological sense.
They took from their surroundings what was needed…
and made of it something more.
–We haven't even set up an appointment.
–What order date did you put on this?
–The 28th. Why?
–I don't know…. Yeah, I'm putting 28th.
Have you thought any more about what you want to put forward?
–Not really.
–Because I was—
I mean I haven't changed my mind or anything.
Phillip and I were talking, and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.
The time for jacking around with tesla coils and ball lightning in the garage is over.
Maybe you should try it on your own in your free time.
My free time? The free time after the 50 hours a week at work… or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?
And it's not a tesla coil.
I could save a few minutes a day by eating on the toilet.
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?
–Did you sign the agreement?
–Nobody signed the agreement.
Doesn't matter, we're sticking to the agreement.
Name one thing out of that garage that's remotely profitable.
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs because of it. Are you?
Abe just means that right now the JTAG cards are it.
When you look at the addresses, we have a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.
But these are not the bulk orders to the OEMs or retail giants.
–These are the quiet basement—
–Hackers.
Yeah, hacker wannabes testing their dads' old motherboards.
And I know that a lot of that is my fault, admittedly, you know.
With everything last year, and the doubletalk we were getting from Platts… and all the stuff we won't get into now—
–We should get into it.
I'm sorry. What?
Go ahead. Tell him.
Maybe we should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.
He knows of at least two other cases like that at his firm.
–Let Platts know that we're talking about it.
–Look, forget Platts.
This has got to be about what has the best chance of going to market… and what is going to get us VC attention.
Look, I stuck by you guys when it was your turn.
And I wasn't 100% sure of what we were doing… or even if I didn't agree, maybe.
But if it's my turn… if we're still playing by the rules, then this is what I want to try.
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.
–It's going to go bad in my car.
–It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.
–Good night, all.
–See you.
–We just got done giving this huge speech—
–We gave the speech?
We just got done.
It was five minutes ago.
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're onto us because I suck as the bad cop.
You should do it. You could fake it better.
–I don't know about that.
As long as we're going down this road where it's eighth grade physics… and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs, and that's fine.
But you know I have no interest in that.
I know you have no interest, besides the fact… that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.
For what I want to do?
We don't need them.
Not even Phillip, because it doesn't need software.
–Is she asleep?
–No, and she needs a bath.
–She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
–That's fine.
You know, even if Robert's okay with it, and he won't be…
I don't understand what that thing will do.
–We'll let them go at it for two months.
–They do theirs, we do ours.
–They said it'd take 14 hours.
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.
What about crushed?
These guys are funded.
–These guys are…. What?
–Liquid helium. These guys are funded.
That's what this is.
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.
We don't have to play the game where we're going back and forth… coming up with innovative ways to make it colder and unusable in the process.
–Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
–This is unmarketable.
By coming at it from the back end, rather than changing… the surrounding temperature, we'll change the level it'll conduct… the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges—
They're dropping the ceramic, the temperature lower and lower.
It makes the ceramic less resistant and knocks out the interior magnetic field.
What I'm saying is we drop the box down on it.
Focus our own magnetic field to negate, knock out with the inverse… what's going on inside the ceramic.
That should change the transition temperature to something we can work with.
–What are we saying that is?
–Hopefully, near room temperature.
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?
–What did you ask for?
–I asked. I need the hexagonal set.
–What did you call it?
–Just come on.
–Are these Type One?
–The superconductors?
Yeah, they're Type One.
Is that going to be a problem?
There's plenty lying around at work, but they're all bar coded.
–If I have to, I'll buy the kits.
–What are you doing about the source?
What?
–I can get them.
–You can— Are you sure?
I thought you didn't like this idea.
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.
What about the source here?
You know that story about how NASA spent millions… developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?
–And how Russia solved the problem?
–Yeah, they used a pencil.
Right, a normal wooden pencil.
It just seems like Phillip takes the NASA route almost every time.
–Palladium?
–You've got their diagram, what does it say?
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.
That's not necessary with the changes I made.
They're just showing off.
If you have it, you gotta use it.
I want to get a replacement router.
–I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
–Did Robert look at it?
–I already got his.
–I can't fix it.
–Okay. Where are you getting it?
–Wal-Mart. It's $50.
–Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
–Yeah.
Wait, platinum or palladium is less resistant?
–Abe? It's not a—
–Yeah, I don't care.
So resistance doesn't matter.
–I need an aye or a yes.
–Did you jiggle the—
–The collet nut?
Robert did it.
–Well, yes. I guess.
–Well, then, which is cheaper?
–You're not going to buy it, are you?
Well, unless you've got a few grams of palladium lying around.
Why would they put it in there if you didn't need it?
One catalytic converter. It's fine.
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300%.
–Is there enough in here?
–Yeah, should be.
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, copper tubing.
–This will be out of commission, right?
–Without the tubing?
–We can use the Freon, too.
–No, it's going to be room temperature.
I know, just in case.
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money. Cut anything?
–Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
–Good.
Should we be wearing goggles?
–Should we be wearing goggles?
–What?
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?
Wait. Phillip, you don't want to come out here.
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?
It is, though, right? It's not just me?
No, it's definitely smaller, but it just seems that way. Take what they have.
Minus the coolant which we don't need.
The rest of it is the mercury bath… which you would know better than I do, but they're probably just showing off.
I mean, you have it, you got to use it, right?
–What? Does it hurt?
–No, I didn't feel anything.
That sound is just weirding me out.
–What does it feel like?
–I don't know.
I don't know if I'm making it up.
Here.
–Next part. Let's do the next part.
–Yeah.
Isn't there some sort of glass or a transparent….
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?
–Yeah, I'm in.
–Okay, drop it.
–I don't know of anything that won't leave a gap in the field.
But we got to see what's going on in there.
–How much did that cost?
–Yeah.
–What?
–You want to put my camcorder… inside the box that's so dangerous we can't look into it.
If something happens, would you pay me back?
So we have a slightly negative pressure in the box.
So we're ready for the argon.
–Which one is that?
–It's the blue one.
I weighed it at 77 grams.
I set the scale to decagrams, though.
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.
Ready for…
0.05 liters of argon.
–You ready?
–Just the plate first, right?
Right, first just the plate, and then we'll….
Let's just give it a second.
–You want to do the box now?
–Yeah.
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.
Just wait.
Okay.
Anything?
Is this normal?
–I don't know.
–I'm turning it off.
–Wait! No.
–Okay, I didn't do that.
–Did we blow something?
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.
–You want to check your camera?
–Yeah.
–Let's get this.
–You ready?
One, two, three.
Hey. Tell me you're hungry.
Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.
Yeah, I'm hungry. What….
Abe, it's 7:00.
Abe, it's 7:00 at night.
–Okay, yeah, I have food—
–Okay.
Wait, are those kids there?
–Just a sec.
Yeah, they're here.
Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.
Come up here first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.
All right, but meet me at the door.
–Okay, all right.
–Seriously, meet me at the door.
Okay. All right. See you.
–What's up, Abe?
–Hey, Brad. How are you?
Good.
–How long did he say he would be there?
–Not long.
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.
I know. I just thought it would be good to do something charitable.
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.
You feel like a steak? To eat.
I don't want a steak. Let's just grab some tacos on the way to the shop.
I have some stuff I want to try out.
–Okay.
We can get some tacos on the way, or we can get a steak afterwards.
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.
It's stable?
Aaron, it's stable?
–What did you do to this thing?
–What?
–It looks like a dog digested it.
–Okay, that's the plate.
I rigged this into the box so I could control the feed.
I figured it's the easiest way—
–It's just controlling the box.
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.
Okay. You hear that? How it's….
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.
It's like a feedback loop, and it just regulates itself.
And what you do is when it gets there, you bring it back… and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.
So it works?
–Yeah, it does.
–What is that, like 10%?
It knocks another couple of points by the time it reaches the peak.
You may want to come over here and take a look at this.
Okay, what am I looking at?
–What are we pulling out of the batteries?
–Probably 24 volts.
I mean, no more than that, right?
–Okay.
So your meter's jacked up.
That's what I figured. So I tried three others.
I got the exact same thing.
I spent all last night—
–What was it?
I spent last night and a two-hour break just double-checking everything.
There's something wrong here. We're not pulling out more than we're putting in.
–Slightly more.
–Well, yeah, whatever.
It's not like a volt and a half more than we're putting in.
It's probably the batteries.
They're cheap batteries, not regulated right.
That is weird, though.
You want to see something weirder?
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.
Twelve volts.
–How about this one?
–Should be 12 volts.
So, what the hell is this thing?
It doesn't stay like that.
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.
It should just be a day or two, anyways.
Unless you want to bring them in.
–No, they have their work in there, too.
If Phillip finds out about that, he's going to have to take it apart.
–No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
–Yeah, I know. No, you're right.
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.
There was value in the thing.
Clearly. Of that they were certain of.
But what is the application?
In a matter of hours…
they had pinned it to everything from mass transit to satellite launching.
Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.
Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical and they knew it.
But above all that, beyond the positives…
they knew that the easiest way to be exploited…
is to sell something they did not yet understand.
So they kept quiet.
The parties would continue.
Any birthday, anniversary, holiday…
maybe some obscure project launch.
It didn't matter. Any reason would do.
What was important is that Thomas Granger, their last best hope of funding, show up.
If he left a little earlier than they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.
He was only there to please his daughter Rachel.
And she was only there to please Abe.
What did you say to Mr Granger a while ago?
–Did you flip my burger?
–You can't call him Mr Granger.
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.
–Go ahead.
–No, because he won't take you seriously.
He thinks we're kids.
–If you call him Mr Granger… he looks at you like you're a 6-year-old kid.
He does it with me. It won't work anymore.
Abe had taken on the task of quantifying and explaining the device.
But as weeks became months…
their enthusiasm became a slow realization that they were out of their depth.
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.
–Where'd you call?
–Your work and your cell.
I'm not there.
Really?
–March Madness?
–It's Carolina and Michigan.
–Who's up?
–I don't even know what.
Do you have anything important at work today?
I hope you're not implying that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.
I was going to come give you this big speech about how we've been… friends for a long time and built up trust, that whole thing.
But how about this instead?
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise to do the few small things I ask you…
I will in return show you the most important thing… that any living organism has ever witnessed.
Well, it looks like mustard to me.
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein… secreted by a fungus called Aspergillus Ticor.
He told you that?
No, he knew it was a protein but didn't know where it came from.
All he really did was just take some pictures with their equipment.
Guess where we're going.
–Do you know where Will is?
–No, why?
The Ariel meeting is pushed back till Wednesday.
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?
What do they do with engineers when they turn 40?
–What, Bradshaw?
–Exactly. You know what?
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.
–Okay. Thanks.
–Can you meet me out front?
–You got to drive.
–Okay, here. Take my keys.
Okay, if you can, just pretend that this is the first time I came in.
And if you would just tell him exactly what you told me….
–Okay, so what is it?
–Protein buildup.
–Okay, can you just tell him?
–Protein buildup.
–But what kind?
–Some fungus.
–Some fungus.
–Where did it come from?
–I don't know. You were to take it to the lab.
–Yeah, that's next.
–You were in design, weren't you?
–Yeah.
How did you get over here?
Do you know what they do with engineers when they turn 40?
They take them out and shoot them.
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.
–I want you to believe it.
–Believe what, the protein?
–I believe you.
–Okay, look… this guy already thinks it's a joke, so he may be a little defensive.
Really? Why would he think that?
Please.
Aspergillus Ticor.
This is a fungus that's everywhere.
It's in our bed, our skin, sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.
It's basically the reason you don't leave things in dark, damp, closed-off places.
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.
Okay, when I showed you this, tell him what you thought.
–You thought it was a joke, right?
–It is a joke.
Right, but how did you know?
Will you show him? Please?
This is how I get protein A out of Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.
Takes about a month.
–To get the same amount I brought in.
To get the same amount I brought in.
So if it's an incubator for fungus, is that valuable?
–That's not what it is.
–Then what is it?
There's another way to secrete that much protein. Do it naturally.
But that takes a lot longer.
If it has a little moisture and it's left alone, it'll start secreting and it'll build up… and build up, but it takes a long time.
–How long?
–A long time.
–More than a few days? Then how long?
To get the same amount of protein that we have… the amount that I was wiping off every five days… and five days later it would accumulate… he says it would take about five to six years.
I don't want to belittle this guy.
So, I said screw it and I put my watch in there.
–And?
–I want you to do it.
–Where is it? The box?
–I took it back to the shop.
–Wait, digital or old mechanical?
–Exactly. I did both.
–And what?
–I want you to do it.
We thought that we were degrading gravity, right?
That we were blocking that information.
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.
When you were controlling the feed, did you notice it was parabolic?
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.
I don't know, Abe.
I'm going to start it up and let it run for 60 seconds… with nothing in it. It's empty this time.
That's 22—
In all the equations that describe motion and heat and entropy.
In all Feynman diagrams what's the one variable that you can turn negative… and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.
Twenty-two hours, 27 minutes in the box.
–It's an odd number.
–That's 1,347 minutes.
-1,347, man, you got that fast.
–How did you know it's odd?
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an “A” end and a “B” end.
Let's say the A end is 12:00, and the B end is 12:01.
All right? We start the machine with the Weeble at the A end.
–It travels forward—
–You got to write this down.
–There's nothing to write down.
–I'll write it down.
It travels forward normally towards the B end.
When it gets there, the feed runs down parabolically… until it should stop, but it curves back around towards the A end.
When it gets back to the A end….
Curve that around. The Weeble… has experienced a total of two minutes, and again it curves—
–Back around. It curves parabolically.
–Right.
It comes back around and it does this about 1,300 times.
When it finally exits on the B end… it's traveled an odd number of forward and backward trips.
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?
–This is not empirical.
–Here, give me that.
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.
Every time it hits the B end there's a chance… a small chance it won't curve back around towards the A end.
And for some reason, it takes about 1,300 trips before it finally does.
It does have to exit, or else we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.
Okay, let's take a look at this.
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.
–1,334 minutes.
–Even.
Enter at the B end.
Exit at the B end.
–I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
–I am trying, okay?
Everything we're putting in that box comes ungrounded.
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.
We're blocking whatever keeps it moving forward, so they flip-flop.
Inside the box, it's like a street, and both ends are cul-de-sacs.
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.
This is not mechanics and heat.
–We can publish.
–Yeah, we can publish.
No, I mean we can really publish.
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid. It can't move.
Even if we were to put the Weeble in at point B… it's still going to bounce back and forth until it's kicked out at the B end.
But if it were smart… it could enter at the B end and exit at the A end before it flips back.
You're talking about making a bigger one.
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.
So, you believe me?
No, I don't.
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.
–We're going to have to move it.
–We will.
We need a box big enough for a person to fit into. As far as turning it on—
I was testing the box. It turns out over half the rings are redundant.
The inner ring is strong enough on its own, so it makes the plate smaller.
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do… is take a lot of these small plates and surround a container with a web of them.
How small?
It should be accumulative so a lot of mini-fields equal one big one, right?
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.
What I was going to say is we need to find a place where we can put it… and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.
We could just lock it in a closet.
Someplace where someone's not going to go poking around and messing with it.
And climate-controlled.
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?
That's a lot of work. We'd have to….
I mean, how many days is that?
Abe, you know what we could use?
I know we've seen a lot of crazy things lately, okay?
I know you're still trying to put it all together in a way that makes sense.
Look, I just want you to understand that what's next is not a prank, okay?
I wouldn't do that to you and I'm not doing that to you.
So when you see this, you can't yell or make any noise or run anywhere.
I know you probably feel like you're being tricked or made fun of. But you're not.
I promise you, you're not. Okay?
Who was that, Abe?
Let's just wait. Six minutes.
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?
What did you do all day?
The first time through?
I spent the day in a hotel room in Russellfield.
I'll just meet you back at the shop.
–I wonder what I did.
I guess I went back to work.
–Yeah, probably.
Probably just worked, I guess.
Yeah, probably so.
Look, now that I know about this, Abe… don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.
Go ahead.
Hey, Rachel.
Why not the lottery?
We can if you want, but it's not until Saturday.
And even if we win the full $10 million, that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.
And that's just one good trade.
–A couple days like this.
–I was just running a test. In and out.
–I want to do what you did.
Exactly what you did.
–The first thing I did is call in sick.
–Okay, I did that.
–Then I drove to the storage facility.
–But I need to drop Lauren off at school first.
Then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.
We need to park yours down the road, out of sight of the facility.
–Why are we doing that?
–Because we need a ride home.
–What is that—
–It'll make sense.
Okay, I'll be patient.
When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon…
and I had to tighten it up to secure the leaks.
–There's leaks?
–There's always leaks.
At 8:30 a.m., I set the timer for 15 minutes…
I jumped in the car, and drove to Russellfield.
Okay, I lost it.
–What?
–Why the timer?
Because the moment we start those machines is the moment we'll end up…
getting out of them, and—
–Right. Got it. Sorry.
I don't want to be standing around when they do.
While I was on the road at 8:45, the machine kicked on by itself…
and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.
In Russellfield, I got a hotel room and tried to isolate myself.
Wait, what do you mean “isolate”?
I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room…
the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.
I didn't want to take the chance of running into someone I knew…
or seeing something on the news that might….
If we're dealing with causality, and I don't even know for sure.
I just….
–What?
–Took myself out of the equation.
–Err on the side of caution.
Yes.
Then what did you do all day?
–I just sat there. I had some books, but….
–What? Were you nervous?
Yeah. It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.
“Evacipate.”
At 3:30 p.m.,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.
Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.
I called my mutual fund company and asked which stock in their mid-cap fund…
had the greatest percentage gain that day.
The idea was just to get enough information for one good trade.
Can we just download chart data and trade on each movement?
But if we do that, I want to use the library in Russellfield, use their computers.
So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15 and cut off the power to the box.
It cycled down to a tolerable level at about 3:19.
The trick is to get in after it reaches a comfortable level…
but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.
So, does it hurt?
Yeah, it does a little.
It's not bad if you wait for the right time.
It's like a small static shock.
Once you're in, you're fine, though.
–What?
I know you've done it, and I can only assume that you don't have…
cancer or male impotence.
But what is your opinion on how safe this thing is?
I can imagine no way in which this thing would be…
considered anywhere remotely close to safe.
All I know is I spent six hours in there and I'm still alive.
You still want to do it?
I set the alarm on my stopwatch for six hours.
I regulated the O₂ tank, took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.
Did you?
–What?
–Did you sleep?
Not at first. I've never considered myself claustrophobic…
but I started sweating and I couldn't find the right flow rate on the tank…
and I was breathing differently than I was when I was testing it on the outside.
Eventually, I settled down, and…
I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine kicking in, but I remember this moment…
in the dark with the reverberation of the machine.
It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.
I woke up on my own without the alarm…
and waited for the machine to cool down.
Cool down from my perspective.
It got to a point where it sounded safe to get out…
but the stopwatch still showed a couple minutes…
so I trusted the math and waited.
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.
You got out too soon.
You have to wait for the stopwatch so that you know the gain is low enough.
So, we're back here?
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.
All right. Give me a few minutes.
From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.
I just left everything the way I found it.
I left the machine alone…
and didn't turn it off or anything, and just cleared out of there.
So your double would find everything the same later that day and get in the box?
Right, but also, I or my double or someone was in the box coming backwards.
So who knows what that would've done if I'd turned the machine off.
Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.
So then, at that moment, since my double was on the way to the hotel in my car…
I had to take a taxi home. But when we go, we'll be able to use your truck.
–You have a margin account, right?
–Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?
Good. Today, before 12:30, we'll buy as many shares as we can of RGWU.
They'll say their earnings that quarter are three and a half times consensus…
and the stock will nearly double in afternoon trading.
–What do they do?
–What do you mean?
What does this company do?
Do they make things or—
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.
The volume is so high that the number of shares we trade won't affect the price.
You really don't know what they do?
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund, so volume is high enough to hide us.
–Do you think it's too cautious?
–I don't know.
I know there's a lot of other stocks out there… that do a lot more than double, but this is my first day.
–My God.
–She's not going to answer.
I know, Abe. That's the question.
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion… you've gone the charity route, you have this perfect 100-room mansion… with matching his and her yachts and helicopter pads.
Basically, you have absolute impunity to do whatever you want… nobody can touch you.
You're back from a two-year—
–Above the law.
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back from this two-year world-galloping vacation.
How do you fill your day?
What do you do?
Abe, I know that's the question, but it's not a real question, so why does it matter?
So what's the answer?
Babe, he knows that's a question, okay?
He's asking you the question.
What do you mean? What would I do with my life or what would I do tomorrow?
My God, either.
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help… something that would make me feel good.
–I know. That's fantastic. Good.
My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
–Shut up. Why did you ask, then?
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning… and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc… and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist that I'm there to see him… and when he comes out…
I would ram my fist through the flat of his nose.
Just one good punch, one good pow.
–That's amazing. It's about time.
–That is so great.
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.
–It's unnatural.
–I'd only do it if I knew that… no one would find out or get hurt.
Like, I wish that there was a way that I could do it… and then I go back and tell myself not to.
Because I just want to know what it feels like. That's all, really.
I'm so proud.
Finally, my husband, the hero.
–We can't do that.
–I know.
Did you call pest control?
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch of dead baby birds up there, do you?
–They don't sound like birds.
–She thinks there are rats in the attic.
But the idea had been spoken…
and the words wouldn't go back after they had been uttered aloud.
So you are understanding this, right?
You don't have to sell me on not doing this, okay?
I don't think I really told you—
–Even if you do stop yourself… your double, from hitting Platts, why would he, your double, get in the box?
And with no need for it, no possible real-world application…
no advantage at all to be gained from it, the idea stayed.
–How would you do it?
–I wouldn't.
–Just for fun.
–I still wouldn't.
–But what if there was a way to—
–Look, Abe, look.
I'm not going to pretend like I know anything about paradoxes… or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.
Kill your mom before you were born, whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.
–I don't know.
–This is what I know for sure.
The worst thing in the world is to know that the moment you are experiencing… has already been defined, that this is the second… or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like….
I don't know, maybe things aren't right, like maybe your life is in disarray… or just not what you would like and you start to wonder what caused this.
People are always blaming their parents… as if, if their mom had breastfed them, their lives would be different.
Bunch of whiners.
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't something you wonder about?
What if you knew this is not the way things are supposed to be?
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
“destiny, there's-only-one-right-way” thing.
I'm not, either. But what's worse?
Thinking you're being paranoid or knowing you should be?
You don't have to look at me like that. I'm okay.
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.
I know that when I decided to tell you—
–Decided to tell?
I knew that you are married and that there's no secrets. Anything I tell you, she'll know.
–It's not a matter of trust.
–I know.
It's just how much better will it be if in a few days…
I surprise her and we all just fly to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping—
For now, you can tell her you had a good day in the market.
–You don't understand.
–No.
You don't understand the questions that come with that.
But we'll explain it to her, and we'll take some time… to figure out what's next… which, I think, should be building a bigger box, like the size of a room… where more than one person could fit in.
Safe or not, the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.
By the way, this is our guy.
–What's the volume?
–Five-and-a-half.
What's the return? Holy….
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.
I don't want to tell them.
I know they have a lot invested in the group—
I don't want to tell them.
If you need me to take the guilt on this one, fine, okay?
I accept it gladly. It's mine.
At the end of this week, they can have whatever they want.
I'll turn over patent rights on everything from the last two years.
They can have the equipment, the garage, the house.
They can have my truck if that makes you feel better.
But I am not telling them a thing about this. We're not.
God, everything is so different in there.
You can feel how cut off you are.
It's this entirely separate world and you encompass most of it.
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside—
–I had this dream in there.
–About what?
I was on or near the ocean, and I just kept hearing the surf.
It was so uneventful.
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?
–Are you bleeding?
–That is blood.
–Turn around.
–You see it?
Where is it coming from?
It's on your notebook.
–It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
–What is this?
–Your ear's bleeding. Man.
–Give me that. I got it.
Is that normal? This isn't normal.
–For the machine?
No, for people. You think it's the machine? I got it.
Great. I can actually get some work done today.
Hi, guys, what's going on?
I always seem to get a lot more done when I'm not locked out.
He says they had to spray again.
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?
You never see anything around here but those geckos.
–I know.
–I think it's for the geckos.
–What?
–Why?
–Hey, man, thanks for the present.
–How is that working out for you?
You know what? You guys, both of you, you make fun, but there is a difference.
Wait. What did you call him?
–What?
–When you walked in? What did you say?
–He didn't tell you about it?
–No.
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.
–What?
–Swear to God.
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.
–Filby!
–You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.
It's funny how you two are the only people that have a problem with it.
Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
–You didn't.
You can't risk your life and especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren… for someone like Rachel.
She practically begs for this to happen to her.
I figured at least you'd understand.
Understand what?
You've never been like this.
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.
Different? How are things different?
You see it, okay? I know you do.
Look, that was the night… you had told me everything about the machine.
Everything you showed me was so fresh in my head and when I saw this guy…
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.
I wasn't going to let him scare people like that.
I know it was stupid, okay?
But I mean, this whole idea, this whole thing that we're doing.
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.
But you have a family now, and God, especially now… anything like this would be crazy.
–I know, okay.
–I know you know that, but you've got to….
–I know, okay?
–Filby!
You little sack of….
Even if you see him, don't tell me.
It's not my fault if I don't know, and I just hope the thing runs away.
Then what are we doing out here?
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.
–I don't know.
–What do you mean?
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy sees us come in together… but he never sees us leave.
Yeah, but what do you think the receptionist thinks… about two guys that come and get a room for six hours every day?
Did you unplug this?
You brought your cell phone?
Can I check the caller ID?
Yeah, we're not back.
Yeah, but you can't take it back with you, okay?
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.
I'm not there. I had to come downtown and hold some of these guys' hands.
Tell me.
That sounds good.
No, I've got to eat with these offsite fags.
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.
–What?
–What?
We're supposed to win this by two, they just turned over with 12 on the clock.
–We have to foul.
–No.
What? No, we foul here, they miss the first free throw… and they come back with the three.
–Three points.
That's right.
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.
What's up, you guys?
–You have got to be kidding.
–I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.
–It's Kara?
–Yeah.
How do cell phones work?
If there's two duplicate phones and I call the same number… do they both ring at the same time, or is there….
–That's not how they work.
–It's a radio signal.
No, it's a network.
It checks each area and when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.
It rings the first one.
–This one is ringing.
–Right.
So the one your double has in Russellfield can't be.
Right. I think we broke symmetry.
–Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
–No.
You feel all right?
–I feel fine. Do you?
–Yeah.
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.
I think my body's getting used to these 36-hour days. What's going on?
We can do this, but we have to do it now.
Do you have his home address?
–Why now?
We were planning on taking a trip tomorrow, right? Just like today?
Yeah, for stocks.
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.
These kids were down skating by, hitting cars on the block.
So we go right now, do our business at Platts', get back in the box… and come back before those kids set off those alarms.
All we really have to do is stand there in plain sight. That should scare them off.
That way my double sleeps through the night… they don't have this conversation, and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.
–They'll be changed. But—
–Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.
Wait, how do we go back that far if the machines haven't been running?
Have they been running?
–Yeah.
I started going by at 5:00, and turning them on, 5:00 p.m.
I got tired of the whole unanswerable question—
Are we doing this as an experiment or are we doing this for me?
–A little of both.
If we get this done by 3:00, that's 10 hours in the box.
I've got the O₂ tanks in the car.
–Is that….
–Is that Rachel's car?
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.
Did you see that?
That's Mr Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.
What?
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing… sitting outside my house at 2:00 in the morning?
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?
–What are you doing?
–Let's just see what he wants.
No, let's just get out of my neighborhood first. Come on.
–Did you see him today?
–No.
I did. I saw him this afternoon… around 6:00.
Are you sure you didn't see him when we drove past?
No, what?
I'm positive this afternoon he was clean-shaven. I know he was.
He was ready to go to some function with his wife.
He looks like he's got a two or three-day growth now.
–Are you sure?
–No, I'm not sure, but I think so.
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?
Can I get your dad's number from you real quick?
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.
Yeah, thanks.
–What's he doing?
He's just sitting there.
He got out for a second and I thought he was coming over… and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.
Hi, sorry to call so late.
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?
Yeah, this is James Miller from Putney and Myers.
Hi, Mr Granger?
Thomas Granger?
What are you doing here? Come here!
What happened?
I'm okay. I slipped.
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.
Yeah. How many do you think I made?
These are set right. I turned them on at 5:00.
He could have used one and gone back to 5:00.
He could be in one of them right now.
I say we shut them off and see if he's in there.
Were you planning on talking to him?
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.
Are you sure you wouldn't?
You're the one he can't get near without passing out.
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.
–Can you think of any reason you might?
–No.
Sometimes we do things but don't know how we got to that point.
–No, I can't.
–Can't what?
I can't think of any reason why I would.
Well, I can't either.
What if it was an emergency?
–So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
–No, I don't know. What, so you might then?
I don't know. What kind of emergency?
The permutations were endless.
They tried again going to the source…
but even while keeping him separated from Abe by two rooms…
Ask him his name.
…Thomas Granger's condition could only be described as vegetative.
What did he say?
From this they deduced that the problem was recursive…
but beyond that, found themselves admitting, against their own nature…
and once again, that the answer was unknowable.
–What do you think he changed?
–Not much.
We didn't have any contact with him in the 3 hours he could've done anything.
I know he changed this. I know we weren't having this conversation the first time… so you don't know what we lost.
It really could not have been much.
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.
I know what you're saying.
The question should have been…
what to do with the comatose man in the guest bedroom.
But in Abe's mind he was already compiling the list.
Two mg of oral triazolam…
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state and a minimal metabolic rate.
At this continued state of rest…
the human body breathes
0.3 liters of oxygen a minute…
or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.
A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.
To maintain hydration…
the body cycles through a minimum of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.
Any food would be a luxury…
but the small tank of medical grade nitrous oxide…
would be needed on the other side.
Past the room that contained their machines and up two levels…
he made his way to another room…
where he had stored what I will refer to from here on as the Failsafe Machine.
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.
Really?
Your cell and work.
I'm not there.
Really?
I don't even know what.
I'm just tired.
I hope you're not implying that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.
I was going to come give you this big speech about how we've been…
friends for a long time and built up trust, that whole thing.
But how about this instead?
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise to do the few small things I ask you…
I will in return show you the most important thing…
that any living organism has ever witnessed.
At this point there would have been some… discussion.
Abe would, of course, want to know… how.
Aaron would have to explain all about the storage manifest…
and how it showed two rooms under the name Abram Terger.
Then Abe would need to know… how.
Aaron would explain that when he went up there…
and found the Failsafe running…
he knew exactly what it was.
But Abe would ask how.
And then the bit about the modular design of the coffins…
and how it meant he could fold one up and take it back inside another.
They are not one-time use only.
They are recyclable, Aaron would say.
How, Abe would ask.
And Aaron would describe how simple things become…
when you know precisely what someone will have for breakfast…
even in a world of tamper-proof lids.
How?
And that's where
I would have entered the story.
Or exited, depending on your reference.
Because when Aaron came back the second time, it wasn't so easy.
He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.
And by that time, he was too exhausted to take me.
But for reasons that are only evident to me now…
I understood that he simply wanted it more.
That he just had more invested. So I left.
He had already performed the task, as I had intended to…
of recording the conversations of the day just in case.
Through that earpiece he had a three-second lead on the world.
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.
I can't. I've got a schedule.
He had but to speak aloud the words that came into his head…
and those around him would fall in line.
This is Track 3.
Abe is bringing my car around and I am on my way to the court.
I'll see Will there.
I'll invite him to the party and make sure he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.
Will.
You pretentious prick.
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?
–No, it's a radio, man.
–You look like Secret Service.
–You look like Secret Service.
–Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.
What? What the hell am I hanging around here for?
Yeah, I know. Sorry.
Nice shot, Aaron.
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.
We could have used that last week against TI.
At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.
You come out here with your $3 tie and think you can play whiteball.
What are you doing tonight?
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you guys, I missed my flight.
–You know Robert?
–Yeah.
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?
–I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
–Bring him. Rachel will be there.
–Big reunion.
–Exactly.
I don't think I'm doing this.
Why not?
Because I can think of a million different ways that this can happen… and nobody comes anywhere near getting hurt.
I can call her and see if she wants to do something else… or better yet, not even talk to her about the party.
That's good for tonight. What about tomorrow? And every other day?
–I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
–You'll watch her always.
This guy is crazy enough to walk into a room full of people waving a shotgun.
What do you think he'll do if he ever finds her alone?
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.
At the end of the night, this guy is arrested and goes to jail.
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.
Now come on, it has to be you.
She said she was there because you told her you would be there.
Don't tell me I came back and did this for nothing.
He doesn't fire?
–No. He didn't fire.
–He never fires?
Not even when you rushed him?
–No. He didn't.
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.
And from what Robert tells you, he didn't do it tonight.
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.
Okay? We're prescient.
We can still be careful.
Maybe we can get to the gun without him knowing.
We definitely can.
He leaves it in the truck before he goes in. We don't even need to… but if it makes you feel better—
–What's wrong with our hands?
What do you mean?
Why can't we write like normal people?
I don't know. I can see the letters.
I know what they should look like.
I just can't get my hand to make them easily.
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.
Guess what today is.
No, no. It's your friend Robert's birthday.
He says he likes records, so I got him The Best of Bread.
No, real records, like vinyl.
I can tell you with certainty what I did that night when it was my turn.
But I think it would do little good, because what the world remembers…
the actuality, the last revision is what counts, apparently.
So how many times did it take Aaron…
as he cycled through the same conversations…
lip-synching trivia over and over?
How many times would it take before he got it right?
Three? Four?
Twenty?
I've decided to believe that only one more would have done it.
I can almost sleep at night if there is only one more.
Slowly and methodically, he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.
He took from his surroundings what was needed…
and made of it something more.
And once the details had been successfully navigated…
there would be nothing left to do but wait for the conflict.
Maybe the obligatory last-minute moral debate…
until the noise of the room escalates into panic…
and background screams as the gunman walks in.
And eventually he must have got it perfect and it must have been beautiful…
with all the praise and adoration he had coming.
He had probably saved lives, after all.
Who knows what would have happened if he hadn't been there?
I know that things are bad, okay?
I know that you don't agree with what I've done.
I know that you're upset.
And to be honest, I'm not too happy with you, either, right now.
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.
Let's go somewhere where we don't speak the language.
Aaron, we don't have the money back here… and we'd have to steal our own passports.
Money? We'll make money.
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March Madness.
We'll make enough in one night to finance a thousand vacations.
Passports. You know they're not using theirs, anyways.
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.
I'm staying here.
Why?
They'll be building their own boxes in another day.
And yours already knows what they've built.
You're not going to be able to watch them forever.
The box Abe is building won't work.
He's got it wired wrong.
And if they fix that…
I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.
It's just a gimmick.
It doesn't work anymore.
Your double will say they have to move on to something else.
And mine will agree. They're friends.
You're staying? Why?
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?
What possible reason could there be to be here?
I guess that it just won't go back far enough, will it?
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara and Lauren and put them in the box… and then you and Aaron can each keep a set and you can stop feeding off it.
–Don't come back.
–You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.
There hasn't been a reason to show you what I'm capable of… but I'm telling this you now.
Go out there.
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.
But don't come back here… and don't come near them.
Any of them.
Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.
You know all that I know.
My voice is the only proof that you will have of the truth of any of this.
I might have written a letter with my signature…
but my handwriting is not what it used to be.
Maybe you've had the presence of mind to record this.
That's your prerogative.
You will not be contacted by me again.
Good morning.
Every half-meter.
Everywhere.
And if you look, you will not find me.
{2094}{2167}Horror and devastation lay in their wake.
{2197}{2256}The source of their terrifying power...
{2259}{2339}lay within a chamber on planet Uroboris.
{2367}{2492}The waters it contained|held the promise of everlasting life.
{2537}{2623}The chamber could only be opened|with a single key...
{2625}{2680}which, if ever found...
{2692}{2818}would guide its bearer back|to the fountainhead of immortality.
{2860}{2971}However, the key would drive|all who touched it insane.
{3013}{3123}When the Arakacians were finally defeated,|the chamber was locked...
{3126}{3227}and the key, cast out deep into space.
{3246}{3306}It has never been found...
{3324}{3376}until now.
{5539}{5596}Give it up, why don't ya!
{5641}{5698}Damn! Not again!
{5786}{5855}I can't wait to get|those new matter munchers.
{5870}{5940}I've had just about enough|of these cheap heads.
{6294}{6366}Tyler, major find here!
{6373}{6400}What is it?
{6496}{6531}I don't know.
{6925}{6995}Careful, it could be a Class 4 biohazard.
{7013}{7056}What is that thing?
{7119}{7153}What's it doing?
{7703}{7756}It's weird.
{8090}{8123}What's going on?
{8150}{8179}Are you okay?
{8218}{8275}Should I call for a containment crew?
{8405}{8432}No, please!
{9158}{9227}The guardian has revealed himself!|The key has been found!
{9270}{9368}Odin, tell us. Is the day|of the great darkness at hand?
{9374}{9501}Yes. It is written in the Old Books.|The coming back time has begun.
{9573}{9622}Evil will descend upon us!
{9629}{9686}We must prepare to defend the chamber!
{10202}{10241}Sanders, sector 3!
{10249}{10250}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10250}{10318}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10320}{10381}What? How long|have they been down there?
{10386}{10457}Over 12 hours. They must be going nuts.
{10510}{10611}Weird. System checks out,|but no response. Deadsville.
{10619}{10700}Send someone down there.|I want to know what's going on.
{10718}{10776}I need a big ship to get somewhere.
{10780}{10830}What the hell do you think you're doing?
{10832}{10872}Security. To the bridge!
{11105}{11148}Any other stupid questions?
{11238}{11334}You, fat boy. Name and duties.
{11351}{11426}- Lambert, sir. Navigation's Officer.|- Drive.
{11480}{11513}Germain St. Germain.
{11515}{11590}When I want your name, shit brain,|I'll ask for it.
{11595}{11634}Take over engineering.
{11642}{11713}Plot a course for BR-549, sector 7.
{11734}{11797}And somebody better|get rid of this garbage.
{11911}{11940}By the way...
{11970}{12035}you have 20 seconds|to get us out of here.
{17720}{17745}Hi.
{17747}{17789}What are you still doing here?
{17791}{17852}I know. I'm going to be late for school.
{17858}{17887}Where's Dad?
{17890}{17964}He's at the council meeting.|I thought you were supposed to go.
{18361}{18425}Do you believe|any of that immortality crap?
{18444}{18501}Think about it. A stupid key?
{18524}{18572}Call him a liar, and see what happens.
{18574}{18636}Listen, this guy's getting weirder|by the day.
{18638}{18708}Imagine in 10 years? Hell, 100.
{18742}{18777}You've got a point.
{18781}{18875}I am getting sick of it.|Going all over the bloody place.
{18888}{18941}Looking for a stupid compound!
{19019}{19091}- What have you got?|- A FAKK 2 planet, sir.
{19114}{19181}Death to all carbon based life forms.
{19219}{19298}Federation Assigned Kitogenic Killzone|to the second level.
{19300}{19359}Which means it's a dead planet.
{19369}{19400}Scan it anyway.
{19457}{19493}I don't get it.
{19511}{19551}There's life out there.
{19553}{19626}The FAKK 2 must have been|from an old registry.
{19632}{19716}I want a bio-scan for compound H2O-471.
{19910}{19973}There are small traces in their systems.
{20010}{20067}Yeah. Immortality all over the place.
{20090}{20115}You!
{20128}{20186}Just remember you're not immortal yet!
{20222}{20266}What's this place called?
{20342}{20370}Eden, sir.
{20439}{20479}Welcome to paradise.
{20654}{20737}And our irrigation program|is already showing promise.
{20750}{20837}Agro-production is up five percent|in the last six months.
{20845}{20904}Phase two of our expansion project...
{20906}{21011}the development of the Noma Valley,|will begin in three weeks as scheduled.
{21023}{21111}Things look good, ladies and gentlemen.|Our future is bright.
{21475}{21588}- Help Kerrie. I'll get our air defences up!|- Be careful! I'll see you up there!
{21679}{21717}Quickly. This way!
{22562}{22589}Kerrie!
{25735}{25761}Julie.
{25800}{25827}Father!
{26844}{26919}Looks like the boys|got a little trigger-happy.
{26936}{27016}When making an omelette,|one breaks a few eggs.
{27219}{27269}Here, let me help you.
{27338}{27387}They attacked.
{27405}{27494}- You okay?|- We never had a chance.
{27521}{27609}Hey, look at this! A live one!
{27635}{27667}Leave her alone!
{27836}{27907}Get off of me! Let me go!
{28085}{28146}Feisty and sexy.
{28149}{28213}Careful boys, this one's a keeper.
{28258}{28304}- Pack 'em up!|- Yes, sir!
{28315}{28375}Splitsville, boys! We're moving out!
{28630}{28661}Wait for me!
{28673}{28738}Lover-boy, you're on your own.
{28746}{28806}You can't just leave me here like this!
{28834}{28876}Wait a minute, man...
{29018}{29091}Like the sign says, a dead planet.
{29838}{29906}This won't hurt. It's just a DNA test.
{29909}{29977}The good stuff comes later.
{30043}{30087}Start with the others, Doc.
{30093}{30188}- This one's special.|- But of course.
{30242}{30293}What I need is in your system.
{30305}{30347}Not enough to make you immortal...
{30349}{30474}but it probably keeps your people|beautiful and healthy. Especially you.
{30492}{30538}I'll save you for last.
{30543}{30619}And if you're lucky, my dear,|and play your cards right...
{30621}{30697}we'll spend a lot of quality time together.
{30903}{30981}Perfect. I knew|you wouldn't disappoint me.
{31055}{31085}Clean her up!
{31096}{31156}And I don't have to remind your kind...
{31174}{31209}she's mine.
{33793}{33836}I should have been a cook!
{33866}{33914}Try this for an appetiser!
{33916}{33998}- I didn't do anything! I swear!|- You're one of them!
{34000}{34082}No! I mean, I was, but I ran away!|I didn't kill anybody!
{34084}{34116}Who did this?
{34118}{34180}He took over our ship|and forced us to come here!
{34182}{34231}- Who?|- His name's Tyler!
{34233}{34263}Why did he attack?
{34265}{34332}He's nuts!|He thinks he's going to live forever!
{34335}{34431}Where did he go? You've got one second.
{34446}{34470}One....
{34504}{34550}Wait! I'll take you to him!
{34553}{34606}- Where?|- Do we have a deal?
{34674}{34786}- How long to fix this Spacehawk?|- Two hours, max! I'm almost there.
{34855}{34944}You dropped your wrench.|Aren't you going to pick it up?
{34967}{34991}Yeah.
{35115}{35152}What did I do?
{35576}{35616}I am a genius.
{35676}{35735}Doc, this had better work.
{35997}{36048}I like the hint of lemon.
{36075}{36108}I'm so glad.
{36159}{36187}Yes!
{36422}{36457}So, where are we going?
{36502}{36563}He said he needed to get to a jump port.
{36568}{36635}Computer, set co-ordinates|for the closest spaceport...
{36637}{36694}that can handle a class C vessel.
{36703}{36802}Searching. Confirmed.|Neo Calcutta. Course set.
{36809}{36859}ETA 93.7 hours.
{37218}{37255}So, what's your name?
{37293}{37369}Don't talk, don't touch,|don't even breathe...
{37372}{37463}or I kill you. Got it?|- I got it.
{38783}{38839}Request incoming docking co-ordinates.
{38851}{38901}Please continue holding pattern.
{38909}{39050}Lock in approach at ANUS-6370.

{39744}{39804}Confirmed. Cleared for docking.
{40679}{40725}You like this place?
{40736}{40783}Looks like a lot of your type.
{40823}{40911}After four days stuck in a Spacehawk,|getting the cold shoulder...
{40913}{40985}it's not so bad.|We could have a lot of fun here.
{40989}{41040}What are you, socially deprived?
{41042}{41131}I'm not socially deprived.|Well, maybe a little.
{41163}{41271}'´Sit down! What are you looking at?|You snore!
{41284}{41346}'´Get outta my face! Shut the fuck up!'´
{41376}{41439}This is heaven compared|to where I come from.
{41458}{41491}Shut the fuck up.
{41668}{41786}Are you sure this guy Tyler is looking|for a jump port? And to where?
{41905}{41977}We're talking high-grade,|silicone-rubber flesh here.
{41979}{42093}And a PVC skeleton with plastic ball|and socket joints for optimum movement.
{42105}{42185}You can customise her|with a choice of seven synthetic hair dyes.
{42187}{42287}And optional entry ports|with four speeds of suction!
{42323}{42359}Loveable, isn't she?
{42397}{42433}Check this out.
{42435}{42529}She's loaded with the latest micro-sensor|orgasmatronic technology...
{42534}{42585}and an expandable vocabulary...
{42587}{42669}of over 200 dirty words.
{42671}{42747}Test results indicate|she's better than the real thing.
{42758}{42828}Go on, Venus.|Show the gentleman what you got.
{42910}{42977}Please select your sexual preference.

{43219}{43306}Unless, of course,|you'd prefer the Fellation Blowfish.
{43326}{43439}Sick, twisted, low-life, scum sucking pig!
{43447}{43504}At least I'll have someone to talk to.
{43534}{43556}What?
{43562}{43625}That's him. The tall one.
{43683}{43759}- Let's go.|- I'll wait here.
{43768}{43849}But he'll see me.|You don't know what he's like.
{43865}{43894}Chicken shit.
{45153}{45193}God, this is fun!
{45717}{45757}Nobody touches these...
{45817}{45843}but me!
{45882}{45908}Bar towel!
{46293}{46368}Hello? Captain Tyler,|Metal Mammoth Mining.
{46372}{46416}We need some drinks!
{46529}{46605}We should make it fast.|We don't want to miss the jump.
{46623}{46654}Screw the jump!
{46665}{46718}I've got all the time in the world!
{46720}{46786}Besides, something just came up.
{46853}{46916}You just found the man of your dreams.
{48512}{48599}When you kill someone, darling,|make sure he's dead.
{48620}{48649}What the hell?
{49856}{49903}Looks like happy hour is over.
{49924}{50012}- Who's gonna pay for all of this?|- This ought to take care of it.
{50015}{50067}Here. Keep the change.
{50081}{50131}What? Holy shit!
{50144}{50169}Grenades!
{50647}{50673}Julie?
{50791}{50828}Are you all right?
{50903}{50986}He died! And then he was alive again!
{50999}{51031}Now you know.
{51062}{51122}I don't know dick! How does he do it?
{51124}{51171}He's got this weird potion!
{51173}{51236}And a key leading him|to the Chamber of lmmortality.
{51238}{51291}Why didn't you tell me that before?
{51294}{51370}'´Sit down. Get outta my face!|Shut the fuck up!'´
{51449}{51542}So if I take away his potion,|he'll stay dead, right?
{51544}{51616}If you can get close enough.
{51688}{51727}That's him, isn't it?
{51731}{51778}Son of a bitch, he's getting away!
{51796}{51868}What more could the universe want|in a tyrant?
{51889}{51957}Perfect body, perfect mind.
{51993}{52067}- Irresistible charm.|- Perfect psycho!
{52093}{52172}Psycho? Time to come out and play.
{52174}{52217}Don't even think about it!
{52307}{52385}The hyperspace jump.|There's always something.
{52420}{52481}I'll make it up to you later, sweetheart.
{52514}{52577}Let me out of here, you bastard!
{52981}{53063}Cortez to Jump Control.|Set lock-in for Uroboris.
{53067}{53142}No pre-set lock-in. Set co-ordinates.
{53152}{53240}Quadrant 9, sector 4013,|in the Terackian system.
{53250}{53293}Scanning location.
{53313}{53379}Warning. No returnjump port.
{53390}{53436}Please confirm lock-in.
{53451}{53481}Confirmed.
{53504}{53556}It'll take us forever to get back!
{53573}{53632}That won't be a problem,|once we get there.
{53716}{53777}We'll never make it!|This thing's a death trap!
{53811}{53896}- It's gotten us this far.|- This far is nowhere.
{53901}{53957}Spacehawk in hyperspace equals death!
{53961}{53996}Stow the bag.
{54582}{54670}- Are you nuts?|- I'm not going to lose him now.
{55356}{55428}You can't just piggyback their jump!
{55597}{55685}A tractor beam! Are you insane?|We're going to rip to...
{56294}{56364}- What the hell is that?|- We've got company.
{56373}{56440}Excuse me, '´company'´?|What do you mean '´company'´?
{56445}{56522}See that blip? It's like|somebody hitched onto our jump.
{56524}{56631}That could change our trajectory.|I want them dead! Now! Take 'em down!
{56638}{56713}But I've never heard of anyone|firing on a ship in hyperspace.
{56715}{56784}Do you have a better idea? Do it! Now!
{56789}{56828}Man, that's suicide.
{57080}{57161}- We lost them all. They're toast.|- Send the bomber.
{57197}{57271}One more word, and I'll send you.
{57466}{57547}We're hit! I knew it!
{57557}{57601}This is all your fault!
{57752}{57790}Do something!
{58119}{58160}The tunnel's breaking up!
{58172}{58225}We're not going to make it!
{58485}{58529}Yes! Do it!
{59288}{59348}I sense the key is here.
{59390}{59492}For the moment, it is best|if Zeek and I assess the threat alone.
{61608}{61640}My ampoules.
{61804}{61867}I'm afraid it's down to you.
{61889}{61941}No. Please.
{62139}{62181}Lambert, damage report.
{62237}{62278}I want a damage report!
{62552}{62591}Don't worry, I'm fine.
{62604}{62656}Yeah? Like I give a shit!
{62668}{62741}What's the status|on the double D-40s and munitions?
{62755}{62791}We found a wheel.
{62795}{62823}Personnel?
{62864}{62920}Seventy-eight percent dead or missing.
{62922}{62953}Life-scan?
{63008}{63104}There's a town, looks like|it's about 10 or 12 miles north of here.
{63119}{63150}Flight status?
{63165}{63207}You've got to be kidding.
{63211}{63273}Gather the weapons,|what's left of my men...
{63275}{63330}shoot the injured. We're moving on.
{64035}{64088}Was it good for you?
{64169}{64215}I'll start you off like this.
{64217}{64320}The next step, in three or four days,|depending on your production...
{64323}{64384}will be the body tank.
{64439}{64469}You're sick!
{64495}{64550}I'm a sick genius.
{65836}{65874}I can't breathe.
{65896}{65941}Get off my face!
{66017}{66049}What are you?
{66051}{66109}I'm Zeek, what are you?
{66210}{66249}You're so soft.
{66269}{66319}I'm harder than you think, stone man.
{66321}{66414}Please, you must not touch|my master Odin's property.
{66418}{66490}He's left me with the responsibility|to guard it.
{66500}{66597}Relax, your thing is safe with me.|Where is your master?
{66600}{66631}I am Odin.
{66640}{66747}Please excuse my little friend,|he takes his duties very seriously.
{66750}{66827}- What are you called?|- FAKK Julie.
{66870}{66964}Julie, soft. Very soft.
{66983}{67036}You're not from our world, are you?
{67043}{67098}Hardly. What is this place?
{67110}{67207}Uroboris. Some call it home.|Others call it hell.
{67216}{67275}My master says you come from the sky.
{67278}{67343}Do you have it? Do you have the key?
{67355}{67405}I don't know anything about a key.
{67407}{67473}I crashed here trying to kill a madman,|who won't die.
{67475}{67519}I did see two fireballs.
{67534}{67623}The other was headed in the direction|of a city called Shantaar.
{67646}{67713}It's not far from here. We'll take you there.
{67740}{67794}So please, come with us.
{67818}{67883}Tell me more about this madman.
{67908}{68000}Bastard named Tyler,|killed everyone I ever cared about.
{68005}{68120}Our legends say that|whoever carries the key, becomes insane.
{68145}{68190}That's him all right.
{68235}{68300}I'm sorry. I sense your sadness.
{68313}{68377}It's hard to be the last of your people.
{70009}{70079}Not much of an army. But it's a start.
{70099}{70190}Look. The ugliest one seems|to be sitting in my chair.
{70828}{70865}Hey, you, ugly!
{70901}{70975}Your mother is a Hectarian|whore's handbag!
{71818}{71903}Molten lava? We have to cross this?
{71910}{71989}Yes, Shantaar lies on the other side.
{72031}{72117}- I hate this place.|- How are we going to cross?
{72183}{72306}I am Chartog, guardian of the Red River.
{72314}{72356}I know the way across...
{72383}{72431}and I will tell you.
{72469}{72512}You just have to...
{72547}{72586}kiss me.
{72600}{72627}No way.
{72655}{72722}What's the matter, my precious?
{72758}{72836}Don't you find me attractive?
{72885}{72948}If this is what it takes to kill Tyler....
{72985}{73072}That's a good girl. Help your friends.
{73085}{73142}It will be over soon.
{73162}{73223}Who will I have to kiss to get back?
{73490}{73528}What are you doing?
{73557}{73596}We're waiting for you.
{73635}{73710}Son of a bitch! Kiss this!
{73819}{73881}Your people have strange customs.
{73936}{73975}Tell me about it.
{74574}{74662}Mortality sucks, immortality sucks.
{74675}{74716}Everything sucks.
{74789}{74816}Oh, shit.
{74877}{74922}This really sucks.
{75767}{75813}Is he the one you search for?
{75850}{75876}Oh, yeah.
{76061}{76107}Yeah! Come on, Tyler!
{76476}{76543}I'm your new leader! Me!
{76723}{76768}Now we're up the creek.
{77058}{77104}When you kill someone...
{77167}{77210}make sure they're dead!
{77394}{77423}Yo, baby.
{77704}{77819}I am Tyler! Your new lord!
{78118}{78197}Blind adulation makes me so horny.
{78226}{78259}Bring me a wench!
{78448}{78525}Master, he's the one with the key, isn't he?
{78572}{78642}He's far too powerful for us|to deal with alone.
{78644}{78678}Leave that to me.
{78683}{78795}Julie, you are too impulsive.|Please, think about this.
{78802}{78863}- Think about what?|- The key.
{78889}{78968}- You don't understand.|- You worry about the key.
{78977}{79016}Tyler's mine.
{79092}{79179}She is letting her thirst|for revenge rule her mind.
{79891}{79950}A little retro, but hey....
{80200}{80241}Where'd they find you?
{80273}{80386}I hear you're very special.|I've come a long way to meet you.
{80489}{80605}- You're not a robot, are you?|- Why don't you find out for yourself?
{80626}{80694}I could say I've died|and gone to heaven, but...
{80715}{80757}that wouldn't be true.
{80766}{80857}Which part, the dying or the heaven?
{80932}{80955}You.
{81080}{81158}I know I'm irresistible,|but what do you want?
{81166}{81208}I want you...
{81231}{81279}and what you have.
{81284}{81352}There's a price to pay for immortality...
{81356}{81424}and the universe is going|to pick up the tab.
{81455}{81490}How original.
{81505}{81559}Every king must have a queen.
{81597}{81632}Do you want me?
{81656}{81697}Take a wild guess.
{81815}{81843}Forever?
{81866}{81894}Shut up.
{82162}{82198}Not this time!
{82257}{82283}Bitch!
{82289}{82335}Time to die!
{82474}{82497}Die!
{82641}{82677}What are you doing?
{82707}{82801}- Stop!|- I can't! The master told me!
{82877}{82912}You stupid rock!
{83167}{83241}What does it take to get laid around here?
{83258}{83350}I had him! Ten more seconds,|and he was dead!
{83366}{83414}We thought you were in trouble.
{83424}{83492}Julie, it's too late.
{83507}{83567}It's not just about you and Tyler.
{83588}{83680}What Tyler seeks lies within the walls|of the Holylands.
{83705}{83806}He will come and we will all be judged.
{83845}{83912}What do you mean you can't find them?
{83932}{84038}How do you lose a 6-foot bitch|with a talking rock?
{84087}{84123}How do you do that?
{84126}{84210}- We looked everywhere.|- You idiots!
{84218}{84245}Gather the troops!
{84286}{84324}This is it?
{84362}{84459}I sure could use a drink|and a little social give and take.
{84520}{84565}There goes that idea.
{84961}{85065}Can we stop for a moment?|I'm not as young as I once was.
{85077}{85125}I'll see what lies beyond.
{85224}{85268}Eden was beautiful.
{85283}{85329}Then he destroyed it.
{85338}{85396}Master, come see!
{86012}{86081}It's time for the next phase.
{86156}{86179}Please.
{86188}{86262}In five minutes, you will lose all senses.
{86339}{86410}It will seem like a very peaceful dying.
{86426}{86492}What? We have company.
{87691}{87724}Do you like this?
{87948}{87994}You shouldn't have done that.
{88397}{88466}Now I'm really upset!
{88560}{88656}I am worried, Master.|The soft one has been inside too long.
{88706}{88767}Here, kitty.
{88799}{88847}I know where you are.
{88849}{88913}I can smell you.
{89076}{89104}Help me!
{89230}{89312}- Kerrie, what about the others?|- They're all dead.
{89361}{89391}Hang on to me.
{89528}{89554}It's okay.
{89599}{89628}Nearly there.
{89766}{89794}Hurry, run!
{90407}{90453}Isn't that where we crashed?
{90511}{90544}My ampoules!
{90798}{90862}I've had it up to here with that bitch!
{90874}{90995}When I find her, I'll make her immortal|so I can screw her and kill her...
{90999}{91093}every hour of every day for all eternity!
{91101}{91155}We march on the Holyland now!
{91349}{91417}Where the key goes, horror follows.
{91419}{91482}All in the sacred name of immortality.
{91511}{91537}Why us?
{91541}{91620}Do your ancient books|not teach you about the Arakacians?
{91623}{91664}We have no ancient books.
{91672}{91738}They were destroyed|so our people could live in peace...
{91740}{91793}without the memory of past evil.
{91822}{91914}To forget history is|to allow evil to rise again, Julie.
{91927}{91983}More sinister and ruthless than ever.
{91986}{92066}- Is Tyler an Arakacian?|- He is not.
{92072}{92174}Many centuries ago, the Arakacians|discovered an ancient tear...
{92179}{92263}in the fabric of the universe|from which flowed a liquid...
{92265}{92318}capable of bestowing immortality.
{92332}{92434}They enslaved my ancestors|and forced them to build a chamber...
{92437}{92524}in the Holylands to contain|this unnatural power.
{92548}{92628}And so it was that the Arakacians|ruled in infamy until...
{92630}{92751}my people were able to lock the chamber|and cast the key deep into space.
{92771}{92876}Without their life-giving waters,|the Arakacians became mortal...
{92895}{92958}and we were finally able to defeat them.
{92976}{93022}But now Tyler has the key.
{93025}{93107}Yes. The key which holds|the promise of immortality...
{93110}{93190}but also renders its bearer insane.
{93197}{93238}Such is the curse.
{93265}{93338}The promise of immortality?|He's already invincible.
{93340}{93392}No. He is not.
{93425}{93501}The key is guiding him|to the everlasting waters...
{93504}{93548}but he has yet to reach them.
{93550}{93601}Why did he have to destroy Eden?
{93606}{93678}The Arakacians also occupied your colony...
{93687}{93778}and stored some of the liquid there|as they ravaged the universe.
{93793}{93847}Over time it seeped into the earth.
{93851}{93930}Your people absorbed traces of it|into their systems.
{93937}{93997}Which Tyler distilled from their bodies!
{94032}{94088}Not enough to render him immortal...
{94090}{94160}but now he has the strength|to reach the chamber.
{94162}{94249}A whole people destroyed|because of the lust for power of one man.
{94260}{94356}It has happened before, Julie.|It will happen again.
{94385}{94417}Not with Tyler.
{95737}{95789}Welcome back, Master Odin!
{96153}{96240}- Odin, the key? ls it here?|- I'm afraid so.
{96256}{96299}As we speak, the carrier...
{96301}{96392}and the vile scum of Shantaar|descend upon our city.
{96414}{96516}We have done all we can to prepare.|We will fight to the death.
{99069}{99108}You know each other?
{99113}{99164}He tried to save me at the school.
{99177}{99210}It was nothing.
{99244}{99285}And where did you meet?
{99301}{99330}We're sisters.
{99361}{99389}Sisters!
{99419}{99488}The elders have been killed!|There's a traitor among us!
{99490}{99522}Warn the others!
{99583}{99611}There it is.
{99641}{99730}The Chamber of lmmortality,|that holds the everlasting waters.
{100686}{100716}The last one.
{101389}{101450}Everybody fight! Come on!
{102731}{102768}This is going to suck!
{104471}{104500}You fool!
{104514}{104565}That was my last one!
{105873}{105942}- Thank you, soft one.|- Anytime.
{106384}{106413}Hey, asshole!
{106452}{106478}You again!
{107855}{107894}Did you miss me?
{108273}{108331}You always hurt the ones you love.
{108340}{108371}Like this?
{108620}{108713}Hold that pose. I'll be right back.
{109364}{109451}It's mine. It's all mine!
{109934}{110029}Bring it on, bitch!|You're really starting to piss me off!
{110038}{110116}You are not worthy of the Holy Waters!
{110156}{110183}Not today.
{110802}{110869}Remember this on your way to hell!
{110942}{110974}FAKK 2!
{111021}{111114}The insanity has to end now.
{111255}{111305}We must destroy the key.
{111350}{111385}Perhaps not!
{111508}{111532}Why?
{111560}{111674}Because I am Arakacian!
{111680}{111761}My charade fooled|the insufferable Holylanders!
{111766}{111813}And even that little stone idiot!
{111815}{111889}What makes you think|a pathetic mortal could stop me?
{112735}{112774}You fools!
{113366}{113423}I must fulfil my destiny.
{113961}{114034}- You must!|- Zeek, I command you!
{114272}{114360}Good-bye, soft one. I'll never forget you.
{115194}{115220}It's over.
{115367}{115438}- Let me help you.|- Oh, no. He survived.
{115462}{115491}Are you okay?
{115507}{115570}What does it look like, you dickhead?
{115783}{115869}Eternity is a long time to spend alone.
{115886}{115930}What are you talking about?
{115966}{116031}Does this mean|we're all going to be immortal?
{116055}{116100}'Cause if that's true, you know....
{116102}{116168}Listen, I'm going to be around|for a long time.
{116185}{116219}Who took the key?
{116231}{116276}Does this mean we're friends now?
{116278}{116348}'Cause I've been putting up|with a lot of your crap, so...
{116364}{116448}l think it's payback time.|Come on, you know you love me.
{116919}{117026}And so the key to the chamber|of immortality...
{117028}{117149}was once again cast out|into the silent gulfs of space...
{117189}{117314}with a new stone protector|to guard it against evil.
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
Nothing but blue pills.
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know.
Sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible.
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.
Any change?
No.
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.
At least until he wakes up.
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.
He'd better have some good answers.
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.
But like I said, the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix.
- For what?
- For Neo.
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.
Please, for me.
This is what keeps bothering me.
What?
His neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?
Based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.
And make sure we are running on as few pads as possible.
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?
Operator.
It's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.
Good morning.
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.
My papa says you're not supposed to be here. He says you must be lost.
Are you lost, Neo?
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.
That's where we're going, but you cannot go with us.
- Why not?
- He won't let you.
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.
But my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says...
...or else he will leave us here forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming.
One thing I've learned in all my years...
...is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to.
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me...
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.
What choice?
To help you, to guide Neo.
Now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again...
...knowing full well what it might cost...
...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice...
...because here I am, at it again.
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.
He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.
The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.
He uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.
If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...
...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.
The Merovingian.
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.
For years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
Please, follow me.
Oracle...
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.
After everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.
All I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help.
He needs all our help.
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.
No.
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry. She is still very curious.
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.
We are most honored to meet you.
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager for recycling operations.
My wife is an interactive software programmer. She is highly creative.
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.
It's okay.
I don't have an answer.
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.
It is between your world and our world.
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.
Why did I know you would say that?
The Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...
...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.
Is that what you're doing here?
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
He may never see another face for the rest of his life.
I'm sorry.
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.
The answer is simple.
I love my daughter very much.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.
But where we are from, that is not enough.
Every program that is created must have a purpose.
If it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...
Heard a program speak of love.
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.
What matters is the connection the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
Anything.
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here.
That's him.
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.
I can't help you!
No one can help you!
Oh, no!
Damn it!
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.
It's not like the Trainman to be late.
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman.
She promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye.
Goodbye?
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.
Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?
Karma is a word, like love.
A way of saying:
"What I am here to do."
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.
Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.
They are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them.
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.
Can I carry that for you?
All right.
Hurry it up, I'm late!
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.
I know you.
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
You'll stay here until the Merovingian says different.
If I know him...
...you're gonna be here for a long, long time.
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.
I built this place.
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.
Down here, I'm God.
Get on the train or you'll stay here with him.
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.
No. We know what has to be done.
Shit.
You gotta be kidding.
Holy shit, it's wingless.
I get it.
You must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
Only way you're getting through this door is over my big, dead ass.
So be it.
There are no weapons allowed in the club.
At the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat-check girl...
...and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons.
And if we're unlucky?
There will be many men.
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.
What in the hell?
I don't believe this.
Hey!
The prodigal child returns.
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.
I'm sure you do. You have fought through Hel to do so. Yes?
I'll tell you what I will do.
Put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Of course.
Who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting?
The Fates are too kind, eh?
And since you, my little Judas, have brought them here...
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
Disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson...
...and to remember that there is no action without consequence.
And if you take something from me, you will pay the price.
You know why we are here?
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.
It is my business to know.
Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened.
- Do you know?
- No.
No?
I did not think so.
But it is always best to ask, huh?
We want to make a deal.
Always straight to business, huh, Morpheus?
Okay. I have something you want.
To make a deal...
...you must have something
I want, yes?
And it so happens there is something I want.
Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.
It is said they cannot be taken...
...they can only be given.
What?
The eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe.
It is that nature that has again brought you to me.
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.
Where others see chance...
...I see cost.
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...
...and I will give you back your savior.
It seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me.
Yes? No?
I don't have time for this shit.
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?
You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.
Interesting deal.
You are really ready to die for this man?
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.
If she has to, she'll kill every one of us.
She's in love.
It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity.
Time's up.
What's it gonna be, Merv?
Okay. You got yourself in here...
...you can get yourself out.
Are you ready for us?
Almost, sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here.
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?
No, sir. We read something, but I couldn't tell what.
I can't leave yet.
I have to see her.
Now?
It's my last chance.
That's it. That's the secret.
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?
Cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done before you got here. Oh, well.
Sati, honey, I think it's time for a tasting.
Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.
Okay.
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.
So do you recognize me?
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror...
...but I still love candy.
No, thank you.
Remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.
You sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do.
You gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
You helped me to get here, but my question is, why?
Where is this going?
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...
...no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and I mean no one.
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.
I have mine to make, same as you have yours.
Does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?
You know who.
I did.
Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.
So do I.
Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.
Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.
The power of the One extends beyond this world.
It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.
- Where?
- The source.
That's what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.
You should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that either.
The Architect said that if I didn't return to the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.
Please. You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...
...but that man can't see past any choice.
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.
To him, they are variables in an equation.
One at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered.
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.
What's your purpose?
To unbalance it.
Why? What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.
The end of the war.
Is it going to end?
One way or another.
Can Zion be saved?
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question, but...
If there is an answer, there's only one place you're going to find it.
- Where?
- You know where.
And if you can't find the answer...
...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.
What does that mean?
Everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
And you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
Very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world.
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.
He won't stop until there's nothing left at all.
What is he?
He is you.
Your opposite, your negative.
The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...
...this war is going to end.
Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands...
...or in his.
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?
I need time.
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
- Oracle.
- I know.
I know.
Sati, honey.
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I'm scared, Seraph.
Come.
He's following us.
Well, well, it's been a long time.
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.
And you must be the last exile.
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?
What did she say about me?
That you were a bad man.
Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me.
The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.
I suppose you've been expecting me, right?
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.
But if that's true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn't.
If you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there...
...deliberately, purposefully...
...which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.
What did you do with Sati?
"Cookies need love like everything does."
You are a bastard.
You would know, Mom.
Do what you're here to do.
Yes, ma'am.
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
You're right about that, sir.
They look like they might be self-inflicted.
But why would I do something like that to myself?
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.
But if I'm not me, then who am I?
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.
But he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity.
Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...
...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.
I want the truth. I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.
Sir, we found her.
- The Logos?
- Yes, sir.
About time we had some goddamn good news.
Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
No, sir. Nothing yet.
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.
Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.
Careful, sir.
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.
What was that?
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
We didn't know what happened after...
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I'm happy to see you too.
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.
Exactly what I needed to hear.
In 12 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls.
Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...
...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.
Thus, our primary objective must be...
...to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock.
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.
If not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense...
...will be at the entrance of the temple.
It is small and will force them into a bottleneck...
...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.
We understand that you've requested additional volunteers.
That is correct.
Precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...
...I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...
...and march them into that dock.
Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.
Time will tell, councillor.
Commander, just one more question.
Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezza?
None, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.
Perhaps.
But we can hope.
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.
- I'm not going with you.
- What?
They've called for volunteers to hold the dock.
Kids, you stay here.
I know how you feel, but you can't do this.
- I have to.
- Why?
Because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.
Maybe it is. But ask yourself, if it were Dozer...
...and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...
...what would you do?
Make shells.
What the shit is going on over here?
An accident, sir. I didn't see...
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?
A unit volunteer, sir.
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.
Okay, I'm 16.
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.
Ain't that the goddamn truth.
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.
You do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.
Okay, charge the igniter.
She lives again.
You want to reload the operations software, Sparky?
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.
Looking good, except...
Something's wrong with the Matrix feed.
No, there's not. You're looking at what we're looking at.
-What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.
The machines have taken Junction 21.
The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.
Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.
No, it's not.
There's another way. A support line.
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?
- I know what I have to do.
- What?
There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?
To go where?
To the machine city.
I know it's difficult to understand.
No, it's not. You're out of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
In 100 years, no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it.
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.
This is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, do it...
...but do it without wasting our ships.
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!
And this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.
Don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do...
...with my ship after that little speech.
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.
If we leave inside the hour, we should reach Zion as the machines do.
That's as good a plan as any.
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.
Two ships, two directions.
Sounds like providence, doesn't it, Morpheus?
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.
Then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
Thank you.
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.
To make it easier for you to remember.
What if I don't want to remember?
Why would you want that?
What if I blew that EMP?
What if I did destroy those ships...
...and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
If I did that...
...it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?
Of course, it might not be very safe for you either.
I'm ready.
Trinity...
...there's something I have to say.
Something you need to understand.
I know I'm supposed to go.
But beyond that...
...I don't know. I...
I know. You don't think you're coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave. I could see it in your face.
Just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you.
I'm scared, Trin.
So am I.
It took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot.
But I'll tell you something.
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...
...I was ready to give anything and everything for you.
Do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
No.
Nothing.
-Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.
Let's move it. We are out of time.
You're not leaving them anything?
He said he didn't need it.
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.
Thank you.
I can only hope you know what you're doing.
Me too.
It was an honor, sir.
No, the honor is still mine.
-We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.
We're already late, captain, so let's hit it and hit it hard.
Bye, baby.
Take good care of them.
Ready?
Engine's still firing.
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.
No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.
Every time, I thought it was the last.
Every time, I was sure we had you, but you'd slip through our fingers.
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.
What are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!
You're gonna pay for that.
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency.
- What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.
Goddamn it.
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.
He fired that EMP.
Goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him.
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.
- I know where he is.
- The Logos.
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...
...he'll control another EMP.
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.
- What?
- He's out of his mind.
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...
...that appearances can be deceiving.
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.
Don't do it.
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.
Look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't.
- He can't.
- Do it.
Back away from the gun and turn around.
Let her go.
Somehow familiar, isn't it?
We've been here before, you and I, remember?
I do. I think of nothing else.
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.
The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.
Disgusting.
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.
Look past the flesh.
Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.
There is nowhere I won't find you.
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.
Inevitable.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
This is it. It's gotta be.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.
Blind messiah.
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.
Helpless.
Pathetic.
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.
I can see you.
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.
It's not over.
- Trinity!
- Neo.
Neo.
Oh, no. Your eyes.
I'll be okay.
It's all right, Trin.
But I think you're gonna have to drive.
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.
Yes, sir.
Come on, move.
All right!
This is it.
Now, you all know me, so I'll just say this as simple as I can.
If it's our time to die, it's our time.
All I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives...
...we give them hell before we do!
Yeah!
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.
But I'll make you a deal.
You keep loading, I keep shooting.
Deal.
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.
If we can just get close enough...
Six hundred meters.
There.
Shit!
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.
Man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them. Go!
Ghost, you're the best gunner, go with them. Morpheus, take his place.
I'm coming, baby.
Here they come.
-Slow down, this ain't theLogos.
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.
Holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.
Breach! The dock is breached!
Knuckle up!
For Zion!
Shit.
Come on, let's go.
Knuckle up!
Reload!
Reload nine!
Go, go! Move, move!
Watch your left!
Don't let them through!
Zuka!
Oh, my God.
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!
Dig this!
Oh, shit!
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!
Shit, she's got a fat ass.
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!
Damn it!
Yeah.
Grab my belt.
Just give me one clean shot.
Damn it!
Charra!
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?
I think it's one of ours, sir.
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.
Contact them.
I want access codes.
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.
It's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be.
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer,sir.
How can that be?
It's under attack, sustaining damage.
At its present velocity, it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.
We blow an EMP inside, we lose the dock.
Sir, we already lost the dock.
Open the gate.
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!
We've lost control!
We can't open it!
There's the exit.
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.
Full power...
...ninety degrees.
Now!
Hold on, baby.
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?
Sentinels are inside the dock.
Are we too late?
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.
Reload!
He's pissing metal.
Go!
Go!
Heads up! They're coming around!
Behind you!
It's jammed!
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!
Got it!
Captain Mifune.
Oh, no.
They're coming.
They're coming.
The Hammer.
What?
You have to open that gate.
Cut the counterweights.
You can do it.
Hurry. There's no time.
Captain...
...I didn't finish the training program.
Neither did I.
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.
Come on, someone, please.
Keep the weight forward.
Light as a feather.
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU is up and moving to Gate Three.
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.
Mifune...
...this is Lock.
I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can...
... theHammer's two minutes away.
You've got two minutes, captain, to get that gate open.
Link.
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!
Do it, kid.
Neo. I believe.
- Yes!
- Can we make it?
We ain't come this far.
Almost home, almost home.
Burn it, Link!
- You did it.
- No.
We did it.
You're a hell of a pilot.
Some things in this world never change.
But some things do?
Luckily...
...some things do.
Link!
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!
I knew you'd come. I knew it.
I made a promise.
You did wear it.
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.
Three captains, one ship.
I'll assume the other ships were lost under equally pointless circumstances.
Good to see you too, Jason.
The Council's waiting to hear an explanation.
Forgive me for not attending, but I have to try to salvage this debacle.
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.
That's the problem with you people.
You can't think but five minutes in front of you.
That EMP knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every APU.
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.
Come on, get it cut.
The bridge is clear.
Do you hear that?
Get that cable run!
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.
Order everyone to fall back.
Seal the shaft. Now.
Move it!
Oh, my God.
- All clear.
- Do it.
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!
Your move.
So you gave them your ship?
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?
The Oracle said nothing of this?
She told me Neo would need my help, and I would choose to help him or not.
But what hope can a single vessel have against their entire defense system?
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.
No, he wasn't.
Neo is doing what he believes he must do.
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...
...if he'll reach the machine city.
And if he does, I don't know what he can do to save us.
But I do know that as long as there is a single breath in his body...
...he will not give up.
And neither can we.
Temperature's dropping.
Here we go.
We're over the fields, aren't we?
How do you know that?
I can feel them.
Over there.
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.
Power lines.
Follow them.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
Lieutenant?
Goddamn it.
What do we do now?
It is now a matter of time.
The machines will breach the walls of this city.
I recommend that the Council join the other non-military personnel inside the temple.
How long do we have?
Two hours. Maybe less.
My men have fortified the entrance with enough artillery to make our last stand.
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.
Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?
If I were you, I wouldn't ask me that question.
I would ask him.
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.
There. Those mountains.
That's it.
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.
We'll make it.
We have to.
Sentinels.
There's too many!
Gotcha!
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.
Then up we go.
Beautiful.
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.
Again. Slowly.
Now!
Trin?
Trinity?
Trinity?
- I'm here.
- Where?
Here.
We made it.
You said we would.
It's unbelievable, Trin.
Light everywhere.
Like the whole thing was built of light.
I wish you could see what I see.
You've already shown me so much.
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?
I can't go with you, Neo.
I've gone as far as I can.
What?
Oh, no.
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.
It's time.
I've done all that I could do.
Now you have to do the rest.
You have to finish it.
You have to save Zion.
I can't.
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.
You will.
I believe it. I always have.
Trinity.
Trinity, you can't die.
You can't.
You can't.
Yes, I can.
You brought me back once.
But not this time.
Do you remember...
...on that roof, after you caught me...
...the last thing I said to you?
You said, "I'm sorry."
I wish I hadn't.
That was my last thought.
I wished I had one more chance...
...to say what really mattered.
To say how much I loved you.
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.
But by the time I knew how to say what I wanted to, it was too late.
But you brought me back.
You gave me my wish.
One more chance to say what I really wanted to say.
Kiss me.
Once more...
...kiss me.
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.
Get that damn thing mounted!
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Neo...
...if you're gonna do something, do it quick.
I only ask to say what I've come to say.
After that, do what you want, and I won't try and stop you.
Speak.
The program Smith has grown beyond your control.
He will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix.
You cannot stop him.
- But I can.
- We don't need you!
We need nothing!
If that's true, then I've made a mistake, and you should kill me now.
What do you want?
Peace.
What are they doing?
What are you doing?
Morpheus!
And if you fail?
I won't.
Neo.
He fights for us.
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
You like what I've done with the place?
It ends tonight.
I know it does. I've seen it.
That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show...
...because we already know that I'm the one that beats you.
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...
...closing in on you?
Oh, I can.
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...
...that taught me the purpose of all life.
The purpose of life is to end.
Why, Mr. Anderson?
Why, why, why?
Why do you do it?
Why? Why get up?
Why keep fighting?
Do you believe you're fighting for something?
For more than your survival?
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?
Is it freedom or truth?
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.
Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect...
...trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose!
And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself...
...although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?
Because I choose to.
This is my world! My world!
Wait.
I've seen this.
This is it. This is the end.
Yes. You were laying right there, just like that.
And I...
I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something.
I say:
"Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."
What? What did I just say?
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.
Get away from me!
What are you afraid of?
It's a trick.
You were right, Smith.
You were always right.
It was inevitable.
Is it over?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's not fair.
It is done.
It doesn't make sense.
He did it.
He saved us.
He saved us.
It's over! He did it! He did it!
He did it! It's over!
It's over! He did it! He did it!
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.
- Did what?
- He ended the war.
The machines, they're gone.
The war is over, sir. The war is over.
Zion! Zion!
Zion, it's over!
It's over!
The war is over!
The war is over!
I have imagined this moment...
...for so long.
Is this real?
Neo, wherever you are...
...thank you.
Good morning.
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.
You played a very dangerous game.
Change always is.
Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?
As long as it can.
What about the others?
What others?
The ones that want out.
Obviously, they will be freed.
I have your word?
What do you think I am? Human?
Oracle!
We were afraid we might not find you.
Everything's okay now.
Look, look.
Just look at that.
Beautiful.
Did you do that?
For Neo.
That's nice.
I know he'd love it.
Will we ever see him again?
I suspect so.
Someday.
Did you always know?
Oh, no. No, I didn't.
But I believed.
I believed.
Moorgate Passage.
Moorgate Passage.
I see it over there!
Bleeding rat-wags!
What's gotten into them?
What in God's name is that?
Halt!
Halt!
- Blimey!
- Stop!
- Come on!
- Halt!
In the name of the law!
- Halt!
- How the hell do we stop this thing?
I said, halt!
Here.
Careful, mates. Careful.
There's men inside!
Please.
Bring the scientist with us.
Kill any who resist.
Do we have him?
Draper at your service, sir.
The world, Herr Draper.
I want the world.
Really?
That's so frightening.
Don't wander off.
Where's Quatermain?
That gentleman at the back.
Do I have the pleasure of addressing
Allan Quatermain?
Yes, you do, sir. Indeed you do.
You're not what I expected.
I presume you're another traveler...
...got it in your head to sample the Dark Continent.
And while you're at it, hunt down old Allan Quatermain...
...and have him tell his adventures.
- Well...
- You just fill a seat, sir.
You can fill my glass.
Bruce, double.
I'll regale you with how I found King
Solomon's Mines, or I could relate my...
It is not your past that interests me.
My name is Sanderson Reed.
I am a representative of Her Majesty's British government.
The empire needs you.
But the question is...
...do I need the empire?
Perhaps I should toddle off.
Should I, Allan?
Yes, of course, Nigel, you toddle off.
Toddling.
Nigel is useful for keeping the story seekers at bay.
I'm Quatermain.
The empire is in peril.
You're probably too young to know, but the empire is always in some peril.
We need you to lead a team of unique men like yourself...
...to combat this threat.
Regale me.
There is great unrest, countries set at each other's throats, baying for blood.
The trouble of which I speak could set a match to the whole thing. War.
- With whom, exactly?
- Everyone.
A world war.
- That notion makes you sweat?
- Heavens, man, doesn't it you?
This is Africa, dear boy.
Sweating is what we do.
Where is your sense of patriotism?
God save the queen.
- God save the queen. God bless her.
- God save the queen.
That's about as patriotic as it gets around here.
But you're Allan Quatermain.
Stories of your exploits have thrilled
English boys for decades.
That I know, and Nigel has done a grand job reminding me.
But with each past exploit...
...l've lost friends.
White men and black...
...and much more.
And I am not the man I once was.
The gentleman over there.
- We're in for the long haul.
- Exactly.
- Mr. Quatermain?
- Why, yes indeed, sir.
Wrong Quatermain.
That's him.
Get down!
- They're indestructible.
- No, just armor-plated.
Automatic rifles? Who in God's name has automatic rifles?
That's unsporting. Probably Belgium.
Allan!
Wicked waste.
Look out!
Good old Britannia.
Wasn't there another one of these buggers?
Mr. Quatermain!
Bruce, Matilda.
Our friend might have some information.
But he's so far away.
Yes, I thought he was.
God, I hate getting old.
- Did you mean to just wound him?
- Obviously.
Stop him! I need information!
Bloody poison.
You may have no love for the empire, but I know you love Africa.
A war in Europe will spread to its colonies.
It appears the war has arrived.
Very well, Reed...
...l'm in.
Excellent.
Pack for an English summer.
You made good time getting here.
Not as good as Phileas Fogg,
Around the World in 80 Days.
Where are we going, Australia?
And here we are, sir.
I don't like theatrics.
After Africa's veldts, London's weather isn't helping your mood, I see.
Identify yourself.
I'm known by many names,
Mr. Quatermain.
My underlings call me sir.
My superiors call me M.
M?
Just M.
I must say, the delight is mine, meeting so notable a recruit...
...to this newest generation of the
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
League of what?
There have been times when a danger upon the world...
...required the services of singular individuals.
How very curious.
This museum is full of the curious.
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo.
I know of Mr. Quatermain.
And I know of you, captain.
Rumor has it that you're a pirate.
I'd prefer a less provocative title.
- I'm sure you would.
- Gentlemen, please.
Nations are striking at nations.
Every attack marked by the use of highly advanced weaponry.
These attacks are all the work of one man...
...who calls himself the Fantom.
- Very operatic. What's in it for him?
Profit.
Those machines are his creations, the work of scientists he holds imprisoned.
His attacks have nations clamoring for the weapons that assail them.
- Then it's a race for arms.
- And millions will perish.
There's one last chance to avert war.
The leaders of Europe are to meet secretly in venice.
And you believe that this Fantom will attack that conference?
If he can find it.
We need a team to stop him in venice.
This team consists of six members.
- You'll have four days.
- Four days to get to venice?
- It's impossible.
- Let me worry about that.
Well now, extraordinary gentlemen indeed.
One of them is late.
- Harker, the chemist.
- Oh, chemist, eh?
Do we get to blow something up then?
My eyesight must be worse than I thought.
No, your eyesight's fine.
No games, M.
Some time ago, a talented, albeit misguided, man of science...
...discovered the means to become invisible.
- Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
- Well, he did, but his process didn't.
You see, I stole it, and here I stand for all to see.
- Is this some parlor game?
- Believe it.
Easy now, Allan.
I'm feeling a bit of a draft in my nether regions.
And I must say, it's quite refreshing.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief.
Now, I thought invisibility would be a boon to my work.
Well, you can imagine, it was my undoing.
Once you're invisible, it's bloody hard to turn back.
We finally caught him.
And they'll provide an antidote.
Well, that's if I'm a good boy.
And are you a good boy?
I guess you'll find out, won't you?
Am I late?
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.
Please tell me this is Harker's wife with a sick note.
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.
Gentlemen, Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker.
Mina's prior acquaintance with a reluctant League member...
...may prove useful.
- I'm waiting to be impressed.
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are two more members to recruit.
- The clock hands turn, gentlemen.
- Kicking us out already?
A moment ago, it was sherry and giggles.
- What in God's name is that?
- I call it an automobile.
Yeah, but what is it?
The future, gentlemen.
The future.
- This is my first mate.
- Call me Ishmael. Please.
So how did M get you?
None of your business.
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger the way I do.
And I imagine you with quite the library,
Mr. Quatermain.
All those books you must have read merely by looking at their covers.
I've had women along on past exploits and found them to be, at best...
...a distraction.
- Do I distract you?
My dear girl, I've buried two wives and many lovers...
...and I'm in no mood for more of either.
- You can send them my way...
- Skinner, shut up.
- Shall I wait, captain?
- No, bring my lady to me.
This is a charming spot.
Does Jack the Ripper live here?
- Good evening.
- Mr. Dorian Gray?
- I am indeed.
- We came by way of M.
M for mystery.
Well, I've told him and I'm telling you,
I'm not interested.
Dorian.
Mina?
Charming d¨¦cor.
You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.
And you don't miss a thing, do you?
Oh, sometimes.
Scotch, anyone?
Please, help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take
Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Yes, well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
Although, I must say
I was surprised to see you again.
Well, our last parting was such sweet sorrow.
So you're nothing more than an enticement.
Nevertheless, your presence intrigues me.
They say you're indestructible,
Quatermain.
Well, a witch doctor did bless me once.
I had saved his village.
He said Africa would never allow me to die.
But you're not in Africa now.
No.
I confess a curiosity as to what the files say about Mr. Gray.
We, all of us, have traits useful in this endeavor.
A hunter, scientist, even Skinner has stealth.
- Cheers.
- What have you?
I have experience.
Gray and I have met before, many years ago at Eton College.
A lecture, no doubt.
You, the nation's hero,
Dorian, the eager listening boy.
Quite the reverse.
It was Gray visiting Eton...
...and I was the boy.
What is it?
- Gray?
- They are not mine.
They're mine.
First meetings usually warrant introductions.
Of course. I am the Fantom.
You are the League of so-called
Extraordinary Gentlemen.
Introductions made.
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quatermain, not blind.
Drop the gun.
Your mission is to stop me.
That, of course, I cannot permit.
So I give to you all a special one-time invitation.
Join me.
You think we'll help start a war that will consume the planet?
While you profit from your arms race?
I cannot deny that fortunes are made in war.
Imagine the riches a world war will yield.
- He's not wrong.
- Speak for yourself.
Draw your pistol!
I walk a different path.
Run, James!
Hang on.
Night-night.
Dorian!
What are you?
I'm complicated.
Damn.
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Mina?
Oh, she's probably hip-deep in some sort of trouble.
Don't be such an alarmist, Mr. Q.
And my hips are none of your business.
Shoot!
Go on!
I guessed as much, that they would do anything to protect you.
See, now that's your biggest mistake.
Thinking that I need them to protect me.
Extraordinary.
Boy, they told me European women had funny ways.
You missed a spot.
Excuse me.
And you are?
Special Agent Sawyer of the American Secret Service.
Then America is aware of the situation?
If war starts in Europe, how long will it take until it crosses the Atlantic?
I followed you. I knocked out a straggler, and I took his place.
Very noble. But this is a private party, and you're not invited.
Actually, Dorian has declined...
...so we are one shy of a full deck.
On the contrary, the battle was just the spur I needed.
That and the thrill of a friendship renewed.
So you're not needed.
- Winchester.
- That's right.
- It's modified, American style.
- American-style shooting too.
Well, whatever it takes.
You like it, I brought two.
You're in.
- So, what's the next port of call?
- Paris.
Just one last member to recruit.
Capture is more the word, and it will be quite a hunt.
You make him sound like some kind of animal.
Oh, speaking thus, Mrs. Harker, your conduct a moment ago?
Indeed. We are all aquiver with curiosity.
Well...
My husband was Jonathan Harker.
With a professor named van Helsing, we fought a dangerous evil.
It had a name, Dracula.
He was Transylvanian.
European?
One of those radicals the newspapers love to report on?
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.
Is the vampiric sucking of people's blood radical behavior?
Our transportation is forthcoming.
A boat?
It travels on water, if that's what you mean.
And beneath it.
Behold Nautilus, the Sword of the Ocean.
Next stop, Paris.
I don't see what we need a big monkey for.
Well, this big monkey has terrorized the Rue Morgue for months.
Imagine the mayhem he'll give the enemy.
- You missed!
- I'm not trying to hit him.
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.
Make him turn left, boy.
If you can't do it with one bullet, don't do it at all.
- He's doubled back.
- Precisely. Come on.
Look out!
That was naughty.
- Thanks.
- Eyes open, boy.
I can't protect you all the time.
He's afraid.
I can't smell anything.
Perfect.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hyde.
"This hunt's too dangerous for a woman, even one such as you. Leave it to me."
Good God.
Hello, Dorian.
The great white hunter's bagged his prize.
Or the prize bagged him.
Stay back, if you value your life.
- You scratched me.
- Better me than him.
Well, this is nice.
Mr. Hyde.
You've done terrible things in England.
So terrible that you fled the country.
Now, I'm ashamed to say that
Her Majesty's government...
...is willing to offer you amnesty...
...in return for your services.
Do you want to go home?
Home?
"Home's where the heart is," that's what they say.
And I have been missing London so.
Its sorrow is as sweet to me as a rare wine.
I am yours.
Don't be afraid.
- Who says I'm afraid?
- You do!
You stink of fear!
Quite the parlor trick.
You wait till you see my next one.
Dr. Jekyll...
...at your service.
So...
...the League is set.
So is the date for the conference.
- We have three days.
- Three days?
Can this canoe do that?
You underestimate the Nautilus, sir.
You underestimate her greatly.
She's out of your league.
Mina?
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.
Fortune rewards the bold.
If you require help during the voyage,
Mrs. Harker, just let me know.
I'm curious how you think you'll assist me, Agent Sawyer.
Heavy lifting.
Light banter.
- I'm a useful kind of guy.
- You're sweet.
And you're young.
Neither are traits that I hold in high regard.
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.
Mr. Quatermain.
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Skinner.
- Captain.
- Nemo.
The plans the Fantom stole from the Bank of England. These are copies.
Da vinci's blueprints of venice.
Its foundations...
...and waterways.
So he'll attack the conference by sea.
Easy, Allan, easy.
Skinner! I want you dressed at all times!
Or it's my boot up your ass!
Dinner is served, Mr. Quatermain.
I can offer you a jacket, if you require.
Oh, thank you, no.
But thank you for your contributions so far.
I may have been overly rude earlier...
...when I called you a pirate.
And I may have been overly charitable when I said I wasn't.
But I try to live in the now...
...where the ghosts of old wrongs do not abide. What of you?
I don't believe in ghosts, although I've seen my share.
Your past haunts you.
Vanity, pride...
...mistakes that cost me someone dear.
So now you throw yourself in harm's way?
Old tigers, sensing the end, they're at their most fierce.
And they go down fighting.
They're not how I left them, captain.
That's all I'm saying.
Powder?
You think sabotage?
We ain't that far off course.
Did you want something?
No, I was just wondering why you signed up for all this.
Nemo told me you hate the British Empire.
They called, and I answered.
Yeah, well that ain't all of it, though, is it?
Sorry I asked.
A few years ago...
...the British approached me with a mission for queen and country.
That sounds like the morning ride to work for you.
I signed on without hesitation.
I even took my son along.
I led and my son followed.
He died in my arms.
After that, I washed my hands of England and the empire and...
...the legend of
Allan-bloody-Quatermain.
Now...
...would you like to learn how to shoot?
- I can already.
- I saw, it was very American.
Fire enough bullets and hope to hit the target.
Sawyer, I'm talking about pipping the ace...
...at 900 yards.
Try.
Easy, easy.
- Aim.
- That's easy.
Allow for wind, target movement.
- Yeah, that's easy too.
- This is the part that's not.
You have to feel the shot.
Take your time with it.
You have all the time you need.
All the time in the world.
Take your...
Too soon.
But that was bloody close.
And at 500 yards too.
Again.
Did you teach your son to shoot like this?
Quatermain?
That's Kali.
Goddess of death.
Nemo worships death, can we trust him?
He's not the one I'm worried about.
Mina.
I'm identifying a powder that Nemo found.
Magnesium phosphorus.
Photographers use it to create a flash.
A camera, perhaps?
It appears that someone wishes to capture this vessel's secrets.
I was surprised you ultimately joined the League.
I mean to undo the flaws in my character.
I want to face my demons.
And what do you know of demons?
Do you recall a space on the wall of my home?
A picture was missing.
Although the picture is my portrait...
...I doubt you'd recognize the face upon it.
Every year that passes, my portrait ages...
...instead of me.
When did you last see it?
I dare not look upon it myself...
...or the magic of the painting would be undone.
Nightcap?
I'm not much of a drinker.
Just a small one then.
How clumsy of me.
We don't want blood everywhere.
- Do we?
- No.
Not blood.
Yes, Henry. Look, but don't touch.
That's your way.
Just shut up.
- I won't be tricked again.
- Tricked?
You've known what I was about each time you drank the formula.
Liar! I'm a good man, a good man!
Well, who's lying now?
You want it!
Even more than you want her.
You can't shut me out forever!
- Drink the elixir!
- No!
- She barely even looks at you!
- Be quiet!
She looked at me!
Contain your evil, doctor!
I'll not have the brute free upon my ship.
Must I take drastic steps?
- I am in control.
- I very much doubt it.
Your talk is all well and good, sir, but your own past is far from laudable.
Let me out.
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I already had.
One of the vials is missing.
Oh, God.
So it's clear. With da vinci's blueprints and enough explosives...
...he could set a bomb that would blow venice's foundations to rubble.
- He's gonna sink the whole city.
- Yes, and spark off his world war.
I'm afraid that's not the sum of our problems.
Skinner, he's taken a vial of my formula.
- Are you sure?
- Who else?
You've seen the way the sneaky blackguard operates.
It's the carnival.
My God, we must locate that bomb.
We can go no further, captain.
All ahead, stop.
Deploy the divers beneath the city.
- The explosives must be found.
- Aye, aye, sir.
The city is vast. It could be anywhere.
- What about Skinner?
- I'd be alert for his treachery.
Bloody carnival.
God, I feared the worst.
It's all right. We still have...
- The buildings are falling like dominoes!
- We're too late!
There must be more than one bomb.
Nemo!
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.
- Get ahead and destroy the next building!
- Interrupt the chain!
With a beacon at the coordinates, I could launch a rocket and take out the domino.
That's ridiculous!
We'd never get there in time.
- No room for error, but it could work.
- What are you talking about?
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle.
How can we outrun this?
Care for a spin?
Come on, Jekyll, get in!
- I'll need coordinates.
- Can you track this?
- Of course.
- Then this is the target.
- Launch when you see the flare.
- Right.
- Jekyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
- No!
Hyde will never use me again.
Then what good are you?
Straight ahead, then turn left.
No, no, take a right after the canal ports.
We must turn left to get ahead of the...
Snipers!
Damn Skinner, he must have told them we were coming.
Dorian!
- Can't get a clear shot!
- Then take the wheel!
Sawyer!
Sit down, you buffoon. I don't know how to drive this bloody thing!
Get down!
Got it!
Save your bullets. These men are mine!
Did you see that?
- Did you see what she just did?
- Keep your eyes on the road!
It's a gauntlet!
The vampire lady has us covered!
The collapse has reached the carnival.
Time's running out.
Tune the tracer to the car's frequency.
- The rocket must be ready to launch.
- Aye, aye, captain.
Come on, Sawyer, come on!
- Captain, we must pull out!
- No, we stay and do our job!
Remember the flare. I'm off!
- What?
- Don't forget, you're the target.
- We'll be smashed apart!
- Nemo says we stay, we stay.
He's overtaken the collapse!
Be ready to launch!
Launch!
Bravo, boy.
He's done it.
Venice still stands.
You've failed.
You see yourself as the brave
John Bull.
But you're weak.
You run from the memory of your son's death.
You should have trained him a little better.
You may as well have put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger yourself.
Oh, yes, I know all about you.
I know all about your spy.
Do you?
Mr. Gray? What happened?
Misadventure. Have the others returned?
You're the first, hopefully not the last.
That bastard, Skinner.
A lot to answer for.
Skinner? No.
Me.
You?
You don't know the half of it.
The Fantom is M.
And the hunt is still on.
- What are you talking about?
- The Fantom is M...
...the man who recruited us.
- Let me see that.
- But how?
- We'll get our answers.
- Where are the others?
- Dorian's missing in action.
And Mr. Skinner must have fled when he realized we knew.
And Sawyer?
He'll live to fight another day.
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats for this evening.
Captain!
It was Gray...
...not Skinner.
Gray has tricked us all.
What is it?
The sound of treachery!
What is that thing?
My exploration pod.
- We could track it.
- I intend to catch it!
That is us.
That is the Nautiloid.
We will be upon them soon.
You okay?
Just a little shaken.
Nemo?
It's nothing of mine.
Captain, the noise came from this.
A recording disk?
Ready, professor?
Recording.
Gentlemen, if you're hearing this...
...then every step leading up to it has gone as planned.
And I have been true to the goals set to me.
Yes, it's me, Dorian.
As you know by now,
I'm no loyal son of the Empire.
My loyalty to Mr. M comes in no small part from his possession...
...of something I hold very dear to my heart...
...something I would do anything to regain.
- Are you all right?
- My ears hurt. It's nothing.
Everything so far has been misdirection.
Sanderson Reed, the assassins in Kenya...
...your recruitment and mission, the secret conference, a myth.
Even the League itself. There is no League. There never was.
It was a ruse to get me closer to my goals.
He likes the sound of his own voice.
You see, I want you, each of you, even tired old Ouatermain.
He'll capture Hyde where all others have failed.
The question is why.
Why all this mask and mystery?
Because in the war to come, I intend to wield the greatest weapon of all:
The power of the League itself.
Turn it off, Henry.
Please, turn it off.
To that end, I set my wolf among you sheep...
Growl.
...who'll gain your trust, quietly lead you astray.
And all the while, I'll collect you, the parts of you I need.
Nemo's science.
Magnesium phosphorus.
Skinner's skin sample.
You scratched me.
Jekyll's potion.
And Mina's blood.
He's stolen us, and we let him.
If you fail to save venice, then I get my war.
And if you succeed...
...well, it's a small price to pay for Gray to go about his task.
War will come, sooner or later...
...as inevitable as summer into autumn.
Now, some of you, perhaps Ouatermain if he isn't dead...
...will pause to ask why I'm letting you know all this.
What fool reveals his stratagem before the game is over?
It is over, for you...
...because my voice isn't the only sound being made.
While I've rambled on, a secondary layer of inaudible sound...
...higher than humans can hear, audible to dogs and lower animals...
...has been heard by crystal sensors dotted about your vessel.
Sensors attached to bombs.
"Bomb" voyage.
Out of the way!
We have to surface!
We're taking in water!
Controls are not responding!
Primary engine room almost full!
Aft bulkhead open. Pump valves jammed!
- Seal it off!
- There are men in there!
For the greater good, we must seal it!
We can do it, Henry.
What are you talking about?
You know we can do it, together!
Seal it! Seal it up!
Wait!
Don't close it!
- What are you doing?
- It's our last chance.
But I'm ordered to close it!
Then close it.
Seal it up.
Bravo, Edward. Bravo!
Let's not make a saint out of a sinner.
Next time, he may not be so helpful.
Can we still follow Gray?
Well, we were the faster, but now we're the tortoise to his hare.
- So we're done?
- No, we're alive.
If M has any ideas to the contrary, that gives us an edge.
We're getting a signal.
Morse code.
- What's it say?
- "Hello, my freaky darlings."
Skinner?
"Hiding onboard little fish with Gray and M.
On way to base, east by northeast.
Follow my lead."
Good work...
...all of you.
Captain?
All ahead, full!
If Skinner's headings are correct...
...we will pass through the treacherous Straits of Tartary...
...and enter the Amur River, which empties out...
...into the frozen lakes of Mongolia, virtually inaccessible to outsiders.
Peasant settlements.
They're all deserted.
Why deserted?
Fear, no doubt.
M's summer retreat.
This is where Skinner signaled he'd meet us.
So we wait.
Skinner?
- We heard a noise.
- It was nothing.
Just an old tiger sensing his end.
Perhaps this was not his time to die after all.
- I've been waiting all week to do that.
- Get a grip, man.
Well, I thought I just did.
Mina.
- Report!
- Well, hello to you too.
And need I remind you,
I am naked in the snow.
I can't feel any of my extremities, and I mean any of them.
With all the suspicion on the ship...
...I knew you wouldn't believe
I wasn't the spy.
I thought it was best to disappear.
So, what are we dealing with?
The fortress is vast.
Furnaces produce iron for making
M's weapons of destruction.
They're pieced together on the factory floor by a private army of ruthless men...
...who share his vision.
But the worst was to come.
In the dry dock, M's best minds pervert Nemo's dream.
- The Nautilus?
- Nautili. There's eight, for now.
- What about the kidnapped scientists?
- M holds their families hostage.
The men work, or the women and children die.
- Monstrous!
- That isn't the half of it.
The scientists are forced to work night and day to make new versions of us.
Invisible spies, an army of Hydes, vampiric assassins.
M leaves for Europe today with a sample of the chemicals...
...to sell to the most eager nation.
- I'll not let my evil infect the world.
- Do you think any of us feel differently?
Chimney pipes laced to buildings...
...and bombs in the furnaces would make quite a bang.
But someone needs to blow that place to hell, and I am least likely to be seen.
Skinner, I didn't know that you were such a bare-faced liar.
All that time pretending that you weren't a hero?
Shut up, or I'll come to my senses.
And besides, any more like me, and I'll lose the franchise.
No, this cannot be a hunt to the death, more's the pity.
We must take M alive if his secrets are to be uncovered.
Not Gray.
He's lived long enough.
- Oh, I'll handle him.
- No.
Nemo, you and Hyde will free the prisoners.
Sawyer and I will deal with M.
Then the game is on.
Do you mind?
Night-night.
Your painting's in your room.
In return for the League, that was our deal, and I'm glad to see you honor it.
So, what now?
London. I've had my fill of violence.
Now I'm in the mood for vice.
You could stay, share my dream.
I've lived long enough to see the future become history, professor.
Empires crumble.
There are no exceptions.
You think you're better than me.
You forget, I've seen your painting.
Skinner said turn right at the column.
Oh, great. Which one?
This way.
You lead, and I'll follow.
The scientists.
They're for Nemo.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
They're moving out.
Let's hope Skinner's up to the task.
You, help him out!
Release them!
Quietly!
Get them back to the ship.
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!
James, here's your box of tricks!
The brute's potion, the vampire's blood...
...the Indian's science and mounted samples of invisible skin.
They'll be all the rage in Europe.
The Nautiloid is fueled and ready.
- We have trouble.
- Trouble? I call it sport.
Intruders! Indians! I think it's
Captain Nemo and his men!
The prisoners are escaping!
How many times do I have to kill these cretins?
- Make this the last.
- Damn them.
Nemo, get the scientists!
Is that all you've got?
Do not move, M.
Or would you prefer
Professor James Moriarty?
James Moriarty, the so-called Napoleon of crime?
That man died at Reichenbach Falls.
He died, and I was reborn.
Watch out!
Eyes open, boy.
Can't protect you all of the time.
Hello, lover.
Mina.
You're alive.
It's possible I can't die.
The same could be said of you.
Let's put it to the test.
- Minx.
- Do you realize what you've done?
What you've let out of me?
A woman's wrath. Oh, I'm petrified!
We'll be at this all day.
The bedroom, Mina, does it give you memories or ideas?
Ideas.
If that had been permanent,
I'd have been very upset.
Your painting.
I hoped I'd get to nail you one more time.
I didn't think it'd be literally.
Skinner?
It's okay. It's Skinner.
What the hell are you doing here?
What makes you think I'm Skinner?
Sawyer!
Run for it!
Keep moving!
Go over! Go, quickly!
Come on! You want more?
No!
Not the whole thing.
You are so lovely.
Thank you.
You broke my heart once.
This time you missed.
You spoke once of wanting to meet your demon.
Here he is.
Skinner?
That's the last time I play with matches.
End of the line, Moriarty.
To the death, but you'll need Hyde to make it mine.
He'll be making his own fun.
Nemo!
Here!
Nemo!
Nemo, run!
What is that thing?
It's me on a bad day.
He's too strong. We're trapped.
No, he's burning through the formula at an accelerated rate.
He'll soon change back.
Nemo!
I hope I've got your fire when I'm your age.
You will not live beyond today.
That I promise you.
Hyde. Come on.
My formula's done.
Watch out!
Think you'll come in here and wreck this? I'll rebuild it.
There'll be others like me,
Quatermain.
You can't kill the future.
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?
The League, me, Skinner.
Wrong.
Wrong about your little
American friend as well.
Do you really think he's ready for action?
I think you've trained him about as well as you trained your son.
Get him.
- It's too far.
- Take your time.
You're ready.
Take your time.
I got him.
May this new century be yours, son...
...as the old one was mine.
You remember he swore Africa wouldn't let him die?
I wish the old boy had been right.
What's next?
I have long hidden away from the world.
Now I wish to see it anew as the century turns.
You're all welcome to join me.
We've all been hiding in one form or another.
The Nautilus awaits.
So who's coming?
So long, old chap.
Goodbye, Allan.
Goodbye.
Thanks.

Mysteries in History, with your host, Peter Graves.
Although no one has ever been able to prove their existence,
a quasi-government agency, the Men in Black,
supposedly carries out operations here on Earth
in order to keep us safe from aliens throughout the galaxies.
Here is one of their stories that "never happened"
from one of their files that doesn't exist.
1978. The leaders of Zartha flee their planet
in order to escape the clutches of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.
- Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring-
The Light of Zartha, a cosmic force so powerful,
that in the wrong hands it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha.
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna, beseeched the Men in Black,
to hide the Light from Serleena.
But they had no choice.
Intervention would have meant the destruction of the Earth.
However, in an act of galactic bravery, the Men in Black subdued Serleena,
allowing the Zarthans to escape
so they might hide the Light on another planet.
Serleena, released from her captors, vowed that the Light would be hers,
and that she would destroy any planet that stood in her way.
And so, never knowing what happened,
the people of Earth were saved by a secret society of protectors
known as the Men in Black.
Harvey!
Harvey, get over here!
Harvey. Heel, heel!
You're barking at the moon, moron.
Harvey. Harvey!
Harvey!
Hey, pretty lady.
You taste good.
Hey, what the...?
Yeah, you too.
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.
Got it. Hey!
Ooh. Hey, Jeff.
What's happening, buddy?
We were wondering why you're here.
The man's talking to you.
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines and you get all the garbage you want.
What the hell are you doing here, worm boy?
Uh, Tee. Jeff, uh...
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...
- ...Kind of stupid.
- Whoa!
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?
Oh. You like jokes, huh?
Jeffrey!
Ah!
All right.
Sweet dreams, big boy.
Sweet dreams...
...big boy.
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.
We got a bug in the electrical system.
Yo! People! We got a bug in the electrical system!
Now y'all running'?
No, no, no! Sit down!
It's only a 600-foot worm.
Everybody out before I knock heads.
Put the hammer down on this thing.
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.
Oh, oh. You decide? Oh.
Okay, come here. Come here.
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.
Larry just made a decision.
Larry need to take his ass in there.
Don't make me do this, Jeff!
Eighty-first Street.
Just a second.
May I have your attention, please?
We thank you for participating in our drill.
Had this been an emergency, you'd have been eaten.
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.
How a man gonna bash through...?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"
I ask you nice, "Move to the next car." You just sit there like...
Thank you for participating.
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller, energy-efficient subway cars.
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.
I need a cleanup crew at 81st and Central Park West.
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.
Have him escorted to the Chambers Street station.
And please check the expiration date on the unipod worm tranquilizers.
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.
Emergency drill. For your safety.
Do you believe these putzes?
You're welcome.
I know, by the book.
Tee, when was the last time we just looked at the stars?
This is a test. I can do this.
Ever feel like you're alone in the universe?
Yes.
No.
Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
Really?
Thanks.
Hey, you're not alone in the universe.
Remove the arm.
Okay.
Please, shut up, Charlie.
I'm tired of you constantly talking behind my back.
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:
"Wanna come back to my place for some tonsil hockey and egg salad?"
Whoa! Who are you and how'd you get in?
You like egg salad?
Serleena!
Why didn't you say it was you?
- Where's the Light?
- Here's the deal.
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First...
Where is the Light?
We couldn't find it, but we found a guy who might know where it is.
He runs a pizza parlor on Spring Street.
Let's go.
And wipe your nose, idiot.
Mmm. Oh. Good pie.
Yeah.
Crowded.
Well, they got good pie.
What is wrong with you?
You're gonna neuralyze me.
No, I'm not.
You took me here so I wouldn't make a scene.
You making a scene.
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.
You ever heard of James Edwards?
No.
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people on the subway tonight.
No one knows he exists.
And if no one knows he exists, how can anyone ever love him?
Hey, how long we been partners?
Feb 1.
Five months, three days.
Started at noon.
Nine hours.
Get married.
Have a bunch of kids.
Okay.
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy, but he thinks you are hot.
Here it is. Ta-da.
Ben, I don't know what to say.
Years from now, you know what people'll say?
"Employee" is spelled wrong?
Eh, they charge by the letter.
They'll say, "imagine that. Big shot like her used to work here."
Ben...
You deserve it.
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew from the basement.
Hey, Bruno.
Two slices of pepperoni and information about the Light of Zartha.
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
- Where's the Light, Ben?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me down, ma'am.
I want to report a robbery...
There.
Noise.
Kitchen!
Oh.
You idiots see anything?
Wind blew the door open.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
For 25 years, I've traveled the universe looking for it.
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.
What are you talking about?
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Listen, Zarthan.
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight, the Light will leave the third planet and be back home.
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.
Now we don't know if it's on Earth or not.
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.
Third Rock from the Sun.
I never got that till now.
It's on Earth, and I know who's gonna tell me where it is.
Don't you ever go home?
Nope.
I see you neuralyzed another partner.
Bee, Dee, when you use a fission carbonizer, attach a de-atomizer so it doesn't sound like a cannon.
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.
Check his visa.
The Cephalopods have been making counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.
Why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph going through passport control?
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing, sir.
Good work in the subway.
I remember Jeff when he was yea high.
What you got for me?
Look. See those guys in black suits?
They work here. We got it covered.
Zed, what you got?
Dedication's one thing, but this job will eat you up and spit you out.
You want to look like me when you hit 50... ish?
I'll be in the gym if you need me.
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.
Alien-on-alien.
Take Tee with you and make a report.
Um... Tee. Right.
What happened...
What happened with Tee...
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.
He was crying in the middle of the diner.
I hate that.
And plus, you can't count Elle.
She wanted to go back to the morgue. I helped her.
You need a partner.
I'm cool.
I'll be his partner.
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.
Thought I'd never get out.
Lose the suit.
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.
Not that I've had problems with the ladies.
When you get down to... Whoa.
Nice sled, very swank.
Heated seats?
Sometimes I get hives.
Frank!
Bring your head in this window before I roll it up in there.
Got it.
Frank!
My money? It's missionary.
I was in the Bowery, and I meet this Great Dane.
A little thick in the body, but pretty.
That's just not appealing to me, man. Seriously.
I say we do the good cop, bad cop thing.
You interrogate the witness and I growl. Grrr!
How about we do the good cop, dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?
You got it, partner.
Total silence.
Absolute quiet.
Not a word out of me.
What do we got?
Zip.
What do we got?
There's residue on the wall.
We sent samples to Em for analysis.
Hey, Jay, zero percent body fat.
Funny.
Witness?
Girl. Saw everything.
She's taking it well.
I won't answer any more questions.
I want to know what happened here.
- I'll handle this one.
- You got it.
Alone. A talking dog might be a bit much for her now.
What do you want me to do?
Sniff around.
What?
Funny.
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.
What part is she supposed to feel all right about?
I'm Agent Jay.
Tell me what you saw.
A two-headed guy and a woman.
Caucasian?
Gray, with tentacles that she used to rip...
His skin off.
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer similar to the gum in baseball cards.
What was the last thing you ate?
Calzone.
What time?
Lunch.
Spinach?
Mushroom.
Hm.
You need pie.
They kept asking Ben about a light.
Light of Zartha, something like that.
You okay?
An hour ago, a man I've known my whole life vanished because of a woman with things coming out her fingers and a two-headed guy with the IQ of a cannoli.
So yeah, everything's okay.
When we're kids, before we're taught how to think, our hearts tell us there is something else out there.
I know what I saw. Tell me what I'm supposed to believe.
I'm a member of a secret organization that monitors alien activity on Earth.
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.
I don't know why they did it, but I promise I'm gonna find out.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Uh... Uh...
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to...
Kill me.
No! Ha-ha.
Just a little flash and everything goes back the way it was.
After you flash me, if I see you again, will I know it's you?
I'll see you.
But you won't see me.
Must be hard.
Must be very lonely.
Excuse me.
I gotta go.
What about the flashy thing?
Uh... I'll flash you some other time.
What?
Did you tell the girl you love her?
She's a witness to a crime. That's it.
Yada, yada. You're attracted. She's not my species, and I'm attracted.
I should take advice on love from a dude that chases his own ass?
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling, and I resent it.
Hey, Jay, wait up.
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing, huh?
Frank, just cool out, dog.
Got kids?
No.
Want them?
Get him off me!
Talk to me.
It's Kylothian, class C.
Serleena.
Serleena. Old girlfriend?
She wishes.
The perps were looking for the Light of...
Zartha.
Yeah, what is it?
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.
We took care of this a long time ago.
Obviously not.
That is very bad news.
The Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena.
We don't do that.
Right. I ordered it off the planet.
Well, Zed...
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.
It's as if I gave the order to you.
Ask the agent.
Can't.
Dead?
Sort of. He works at the post office.
No.
If Serleena gets to Kay before we do, he's dead.
The Earth's very existence may rest on what Kay knows.
Too bad you wiped out his memory of it.
Bring him in.
Now.
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.
Your mentor, the guy who taught you everything you know.
- The greatest agent in MiB history!
- Frank! Stop talking.
Stay.
Listen, partner. I may look like a dog, but I only play one here on Earth.
Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
Hey, babe.
People of Truro, may I kindly have your attention?
To facilitate your shipping needs, all packages must be properly wrapped.
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again."
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin. Heh, heh.
Brown paper and triple-twist twine are the preferred media.
Thank you for your time.
Kay.
C. Express mail, two-day air.
Kevin. Heh. Wow.
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"...
You don't remember.
We worked together.
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?
Straight to the point.
You were an agent of an organization that monitors aliens on Earth.
We're the Men in Black. We have a situation. We need your help.
There is a free mental health clinic on the corner of Lilac and East Valley.
- Next.
- Excuse me.
- Twenty Rugrats stamps.
- Elizabeth.
The Postal Service hasn't kept up with today's youth, but we have
Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?
No. No.
American Samoa? Amish quilts.
No.
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.
There was no coma.
It was a cover.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts, and I'm ordering you to leave.
Is that decaf?
Sorry.
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.
Full perimeter wipe-down, right here, right now.
Get a mop and escort all civilian personnel from this site immediately.
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?
Boo.
Why do you think you're so comfortable here?
Just about everybody who works in a post office is an alien.
No smoking.
Kay.
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy fly a tiger around a room.
You're nothing special.
When you look at the stars, you get a feeling, like you don't know who you are.
Like you know more about out there than you do down here.
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
You want to know who you really are, take a ride with me.
If not, people are waiting for their TV Guides.
Think he'll bite?
I'm just going for a ride. If things don't add up, it's hasta luego.
Hey, Kay.
How's it hanging?
Good to see you, Kay.
Good to see you too, whoever you are.
Well, let's see what you got here, chief.
Welcome back, Agent Kay.
Agent Kay.
Greetings, Kay.
Wow, look who's back.
I don't mean to bother you...
You're Agent Kay!
That's what they tell me.
This is an honor. Agent Gee.
The most respected agent in MiB history.
The most feared human in the universe.
Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee?
Black, two sugars, if you're going.
An honor.
- Yeah, I'll take a... My man?
- Good to see you, Kay.
How'd it go?
The Drolacks are gone and the treaty is signed.
Good work.
What about that position you promised me in Men in Black?
Still working on the alien affirmative action program.
That's not what you promised me.
You're breaking up
Zed? Hello?
I'll call you back.
I could be Agent Em. Zed, you...
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.
Well, neither rain, sleet, snow...
Good man.
Get him armed and up to speed and over to deneuralyzation.
Frank?
Yeah?
I'm gonna need them together on this one.
Ouch.
I need an assistant. It's not field work, but you get dental.
Dental?
The most advanced technologies from all over the universe are in this room.
What's this?
All is lost! All is lost!
Don't touch that!
I didn't do anything.
Hands in your pockets.
Your favorite weapon.
That?
Yep.
Let's go put it on.
What?
The last suit you'll ever wear.
Again.
The...
The deneuralyzer.
Magneto-energy will surge through your brain, unlocking information that could hold the key to Earth's very survival.
Okay. What's that thing?
The deneuralyzer.
Welcome to planet Earth. There are some rules and regulations.
Go out only at night.
If you must go out during the daylight, only the East Village.
Hey, hey, hey!
Name and planet of origin?
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.
Any fruits or vegetables?
Yeah, two heads of cabbage.
Reason for visit?
Education. I want to learn how to be an underwear model.
They told me I've got real potential.
Hmm?
Help! Heart attack!
Clear!
Wake up, champ!
Oh, jeez.
Lockdown. Code 101.
Lockdown.
This is not good.
This is not good.
Breach! We're being flushed.
Flushed?
Yep.
Ever been to a water park?
I don't know.
Whoo! Heh. Flushed. Heh.
Yeah, man, back when you was an agent, you loved getting flushed.
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me."
I'd be like, "No."
You can't quit on me.
I save the world, you tell me why I stare at the stars.
Cool.
Hop in.
Hop in what?
Does that come standard?
It came with a black dude, but he kept getting pulled over.
Yep.
Silly little planet. I could rule the place with the right set of mammary glands.
Trapped like rats in a Chia Pet.
Computer, surveillance MiB.
Hmm. MiB is locked down.
Computer, magnify. Times 10.
Communicator. Frank.
- Jay, where are you?
- We got flushed.
MiB is code 101.
Yeah, who did it?
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?
Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.
Find Kay?
Neuralyzed.
Not active. Civilian.
What?
He was...
Here.
To get...
Deneuralyzed.
Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
Don't put anything in our ears.
What?
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?
Yeah, you're smiling.
Is that the only deneuralyzer?
Officially. The plans leaked out on the Internet.
Computer, Internet.
Deneuralyzer.
Perfect. It's an old friend.
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.
Did you peep that drop-top thing out front?
My business is banging, dog.
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot...
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?
We need the deneuralyzer.
You're kidding.
The meter's running, Jeebs.
Do you remember me?
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.
Heh. I think I'd remember that.
The great Kay's a neutral.
You're between me and my memories. Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?
No.
Fresh out.
Can't help you. Heh.
Don't got it.
Even if I did, if it doesn't work, he dies, you blow my head off.
If it does, I've brought back Kay, who, for fun, blows my head oh'.
So, what's my incentive?
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs next to the snow blowers.
Alien prisoners released, armed and ready for your orders.
Prisoners of MiB, the scum of the universe.
Now it's the scum's turn.
I'm in a jam, so I'll make this simple.
I need the Light of Zartha, and Kay knows where it is.
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.
Check.
Now.
Jarra, good to see you.
Okay, that should do it.
If I could have your attention while we go over the safety procedures.
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.
If, during the ride, you become disoriented, there's nothing we can do about it.
Have you removed all your jewelry?
Are you allergic to shellfish?
Jeebs!
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
Have you used this before?
I used it to make some hot-air popcorn. That's about it.
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!
Hm.
Perfect.
You're back.
No.
How'd you know his head grows back?
It grows back?
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time I help out a friend.
Kay, you remember anything?
Goodbye.
Kay, Wait! Kay!
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.
Your brain needs to reboot.
Give it a minute.
Kay!
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.
All those years of loyalty and trust, respect for one another.
Right over there!
- Where's Kay?
- He's not here! He went...
Kay's retired. I'm his trigger-happy replacement.
Right in the pie hole. Now nothing's gonna taste right.
Lower your weapon.
No.
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?
These guys really need Kay.
He's a neutral.
Tell me something we don't know.
Yeah, tell me something... Achoo!
I am so sorry.
God bless you.
Thank you.
If I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.
Now, where is he?
Where is who?
You don't look too good.
Yeah, and you look like crap.
I take that back. He look like crap.
Bend him!
Bend him.
Wait, don't bend him.
Hey, honey, how you doing?
Damn decent of you.
Don't mention it.
I'm gonna be sick.
You don't wanna do that.
Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
Then he's no good to us.
Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
Pineal eye!
Go for the mosh tendrils!
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.
Oh.
You were in a tight spot.
I handled it.
You need a partner.
I had one. Job got too tough.
I'm back. You got some dust on your coat.
So you got your memory back.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
Don't know.
The Light of Zartha?
Never heard of it.
Cool.
You don't remember the Light of Zartha?
Must've neuralyzed myself to keep it from myself.
Good plan. What you doing?
I do the driving.
Wait, no. Whoa, whoa.
I remember that.
What you remember is you used to drive that old, busted jawn.
I drive the new hotness.
Old and busted, new hotness.
Old busted hotness.
- Serleena, please.
- Been a long time, Zed.
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.
Never forget a pretty whatever you are.
Unh!
Zed?
Zed? Look at you.
Twenty-five years, and you're still such a looker.
Cut out the meat and dairy.
And you, still a pile of squirmy crap in a different wrapper.
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.
Bring him in.
Don't think so.
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight, it self-destructs, annihilating your little planet.
I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.
You don't want the Light on Earth any more than I do.
All right, Serleena.
You win.
Zed? Is that you?
I could be Agent Em.
Zed. Hello?
So feisty.
Fastest way back to MiB, you take this right on 39th.
Right here. Right.
Next right on 37th.
Right here.
Thirty... Thirty... Right!
We're not going back to MiB.
Headquarters has been breached. We need to peel caps and split wigs.
Not ready.
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.
I understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.
I'm not scared.
Me neither.
I just thought we was bonding.
You're acting like a rookie
. Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.
No wonder Zed brought me back.
He did it because you messed up.
Your attitude makes for a stressful environment.
Tell it to the hand. Stressful is what we got back at MiB.
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB in order to lure me back.
Into a trap.
Which is why we can't bust in there.
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?
You're the boss.
Scene of the crime. That's a left.
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.
Things have changed. We used to neuralyze witnesses.
See, originally, I'd, um...
No, I was going to, uh...
I interrogated her.
- Then neuralyzed her?
- What?
MiB code 773/I-1 clearly states that all civilian personnel...
Drop that weapon!
No, no, no!
Jay, I'm... I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.
Uh... Uh...
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.
Pleasure.
Thanks for sending those agents over to keep an eye on me last night.
MiB procedural code 594-B states that MiB personnel shall never be used...
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
I assume the perp was over here.
Ben.
Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
You knew him?
Nope. Never seen him before in my life.
That is a hell of a fish.
Wait a minute.
You left yourself clues?
In case I was deneuralyzed because my replacement couldn't handle it.
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed hadn't created the situation...
Boys.
All right.
You pointing at something.
Okay.
Excuse me.
The astronaut.
Jay?
Okay, all right. He's pointing...
He's like... He like...
Who would stack boxes like this?
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes. He's leaving clues.
It's an arrow.
Jay?
You're slowing me down, slick.
Whatever we're looking for is in these cabinets, right here.
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.
I hope I'm not slowing you down.
Good work, partner. Yeah.
We gotta figure out where it goes.
I know where.
Whoa. No. Not yet.
MiB code 773 clearly says...
I know the code, but she might be important to me.
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.
You can stay with friends of mine.
People like you?
Kind of.
Jay!
Low bridge!
What's going on, man?
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.
Bad.
Very bad.
- I need your help. This is Laura.
- Laura!
Easy, easy!
They're worms.
Once you go worm, that's what you'll yearn.
Yaah.
I've dated worse.
They're suspended for stealing from duty-free shop.
We were framed.
Zed's wormophobic.
- Kay!
- You're back!
They said you were dead.
We're double-parked.
Laura's very important to me.
To us. To the stuff... Me and you, man, the stuff we're doing.
Keep an eye on her.
I'll keep both on her.
No problem!
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you sit here?
Like you got a shot.
Hey, shut up!
My communicator, in case you need it.
Ooh. Ha-ha.
Nice move.
Okay. Um...
Oh. Uh...
Just watch out for Neeble.
Which one's Neeble?
Um, he's...
Which one of y'all is Neeble?
Yo, mama!
Ah. Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.
Don't fall asleep.
Twister!
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.
You neuralyzed memory of the
Light but left yourself clues.
Right.
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria which opens a locker at Grand Central.
In the locker, we'll find another clue.
That's the plan.
Ah.
I like to keep my enemies confused.
We all confused, Kay.
Are you gonna slow me down?
Your brain's working on old software.
Why don't you go grab us some coffee?
Sure. How do you take it? Black?
Couple cubes of kiss my ass?
I don't know what's in there, so step back.
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.
Kay! He's back! The light giver!
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!
You are the man who would be king of the train locker.
Praise Kay!
Oh, good and gentle townfolk of Locker C-18, did I leave anything here?
Yes. The timekeeper.
Left to illuminate our streets and hearts.
- I've been looking everywhere for this.
- Merciful one! The clock tower!
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.
That's banging.
Who are you, stranger?
- Jay.
- Hmm.
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!
Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of...
Come on.
- Wait! The commandments!
- The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!
We have lived by its word, and peace has reigned throughout our world.
Pass it on to others! So that they too may be enlightened!
Be kind! Rewind!
Reconcile your past, in order to move tranquilly into your future!
Two for one every Wednesday.
Give twice as much as ye receive on our most sacred of days.
Every Wednesday.
Large adult entertainment section in the back.
That's just nasty.
What's with the video card?
Don't know.
The watch?
A reminder.
Of what?
Can't remember.
Guess.
I guess we have till midnight, that's 59 minutes to figure it out.
Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop chasing butt-backwards clues, get a couple fission carbonizers and get our headquarters back.
It's all about to make sense, kid.
Is this card valid?
- This card hasn't been used in years.
- I've been away on business.
- Billions of frequent flier miles.
- Try and use them.
I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can get a lobster dinner for a dollar.
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean...
Can you tell us anything about the account?
You never checked out a tape.
You reserved one once, but you never picked it up.
Newton.
There's a rat in the toilet.
It's all stopped up. You're gonna have to pee in the sin...
Still think I'm paranoid?
Yeah.
Gentlemen, my name is Newton. I run the place.
Seen any aliens lately?
You need professional help.
He's getting it. It's not working.
Okay, so, new case, huh?
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.
Got it.
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept a genius like you locked away.
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning ozone to sell on the black market.
They're touchy about global warming.
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.
I'll give you whatever you want.
Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
Groovy.
You've got till midnight.
Gatbot, I got a little something special for you.
Newton? Newton, is that you?
Yes, Mom, I'm up here with some friends.
I wanna have your baby.
Would you like some mini-pizza?
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.
They're like mini-bagels, with pizza stuff on them.
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.
She has palsy, so she ends up putting a lot of cheese on.
No, thanks, we're cool.
All right.
Over here.
- This is it.
- Hm.
Finally some hard evidence.
Gentlemen, before I play the tape, one question:
What's up with anal probing?
Aliens travel billions of light years just to check out our...
Boy, move.
Okay. Just a question.
Here is one of their stories that "never happened"
from one of their files that doesn't exist.
1978. Devastating war of Zartha had raged on for 50 years.
Hm, looks like Spielberg's work.
But the Zarthans had a great treasure, the Light of Zartha.
A source of power so awesome, it alone
could mean victory and restoration for the Zarthans
or complete annihilation, if it fell into the hands of the Kylothians.
A group of Zarthans made the journey,
led by the Keeper of the Light...
Lauranna.
Princess Lauranna.
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black to help her hide the Light on Earth.
But they could not intervene.
No.
It was night.
And it was raining.
You've been very wise.
Kay, please. If Serleena takes the Light, it's the end of our world.
If we extend protection for the Light beyond Earth,
we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.
- Where is it?
- We're neutral, remember?
If you want it, go get it.
No!
And so never knowing it happened,
the people of Earth were once again saved
by a secret society of protectors...
I shouldn't have.
You never sent it off the planet.
You hid it here.
The worm guys.
Are you one of Newton's friends from therapy?
Yes, ma'am, I am.
Look here, please.
Would you like some mini-pizz...?
A neuralyz...
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.
Joints look like they pick up cable.
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.
Third, the second y'all get back from Cambodia, move your bum ass out of your mom's house.
- Let's go.
- Boy, you like 40 years old.
Agent Jay?
All right, all right.
Oh. And there ain't no such thing as aliens or Men in Black.
You wanna go to Cambodia?
Yeah.
Hey, Mom?
Communicator, Jay.
Laura, it's me.
Jay, we're playing Twister.
What's up, Jay?
Quit touching my butt!
I thought it was your face.
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.
Oh. They were telling me about
Oprah, from Chicago.
Maybe landed in Chicago. Ha-ha-ha.
- Are you wearing a bracelet?
- Yeah.
Is it glowing?
It's never done that before.
We're on our way.
Communicator, Frank.
Frank, get down to Level C.
Deactivate lockdown.
We're headed to the worm guys.
We found the Light.
Got it, Jay.
Scrad?
Bitch.
Why didn't you say I love you?
He's a dog. I don't even like him.
No, the girl. You're sweet on her.
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.
Like you did with Lauranna?
I put the entire planet in danger.
I don't want to see you making my mistakes.
Whatever, man.
Laura?
Oi.
Damn!
Never stood half a chance.
Oh, boy.
Unh. That's gonna leave a scar.
Where's Laura?
MiB headquarters.
Some dumb two-headed guy.
They got the bracelet.
We got 39 minutes.
You guys, um, pull yourselves together.
Damn.
Oh, that's feeling better.
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Let me grab my drink!
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?
She also wants me.
What's the book say?
We're off book. I say split some wigs.
We need wig-splitting weapons.
Got them.
Ah. Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.
Paw Paw and ZuZu love to see what's going on in the garden.
Don't worry, folks. I used to live here. Came to pick up a few things.
Nice place.
Hoo-ah.
Hoo-eeh.
Yah!
See you.
You did not see a room full of weapons or four aliens.
You will cherish and love each other for the rest of your lives.
Which could be the next 28 minutes, so get to loving and cherishing.
Oh. And she can stay up as late as she want and have cookies and candy and stuff.
Four minutes to launch.
Four minutes to launch.
Your ship is ready.
Good. Send it to Kyloth now.
Ready, guys?
Lock and load, baby.
You ready, kid?
Kid?
I saved the world from a Kreelon invasion.
They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe.
They throw snowballs?
Know what you're doing?
I'm about to attack one of the most feared aliens with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.
No, no, wait!
A code 101 lockdown!
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!
You got it.
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet shows the departure point.
Do not come back for me.
What do you mean?
Do not come back for me.
Worm guys, give me some cover fire.
Too scared, can't move.
Go!
Limber.
Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.
Shut off power so they can't take off.
Can't. Too scared.
Oh, that way.
Away from the bullets.
No problem. Hoo-ah.
Alley-oop.
Nice to see you again, Kay.
3 minutes to launch.
Jay!
Three minutes to launch.
Hello, Jay. Long time.
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.
What's it been? Five years?
And 42 days.
You count every one when you're locked away.
You shouldn't have tried to steal our ozone. Be there in one minute.
Over our dead titanium bodies!
Two minutes.
Uh, let's play this one by ear.
I should have vaporized you before.
You really did love Lauranna.
Didn't you, Kay?
You silly little man.
Unh! Aah!
Ha-ha.
Ow! Aah!
Two minutes to launch.
Just go, I'll be fine!
What you talking about?
I'm winning.
Jarra, you are under arrest for being that ugly, and for making that many copies.
Surrender!
I want him in pieces.
Aah! Whoo!
Jarra Jr. is going, going, gone!
- Rectum.
- Damn near killed him!
Never get tired of that one.
Where do we shut off the power?
I don't know.
- I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
- No, he won't.
Uh-huh. Down to one now, Jarra!
Thirty seconds to launch.
Fifteen seconds to launch.
Ten seconds to launch.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three. Two.
Launch terminated.
What did you mean, leave you?
Well, he took your gun.
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.
Half the time you were on your back.
Look, that's how I fight.
You've lost, you insignificant speck.
You've wasted 25 years of my time, and for what?
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.
I'll give you one last chance to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.
What are you gonna do to stop me?
Not me. Him.
Your flight's been canceled.
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing, uh...
Yeah.
- Worms!
- Sorry.
Give me the bracelet.
I'm going with you.
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.
This bracelet is what everybody's been after?
It's often something small.
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.
What?
If we don't get there in 11 minutes, that bracelet will go nuclear and destroy Earth.
What?!
Hello.
Oh.
Wait, Kay, no.
I know what I'm doing.
Damn.
Modified to hyper-speed!
Seat belts.
What's that?
At hyper-speed, you have to use the navigational stalk.
Toggle switches for the ailerons
. Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.
Okay.
I just want you to know...
Hold on to that for one second.
Computer, worms.
I said, "Bitch, if you don't want me to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass, turn around and exit the planet."
Frank, where are you?
Main hall, egg display.
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.
Computer at MiB can destroy bogey. I'll walk you through it.
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn partner a Remoolian could ever have.
Godspeed.
Frank? Frank?
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.
It is not automatic piloting.
He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.
I could use a steering wheel here!
This is what we got.
Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
What is a Game Boy?
You know what? Move. Move.
Okay.
Oh! Hey, that is not the navigational stalk!
Okay, straight down.
Idiots.
Subway may not be the best place to lose her.
Shh.
Where is he?
He?
Jeff. Hang on!
Oops.
Teeth.
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?
Right here.
What?
What, I'm the Light?
No. No way.
You have a planet to save.
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.
Two days ago, I was running a post office. You are who you are.
Laura, you are the Light.
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.
The power is within you to save a planet.
I protected you until it was your time. Your time is now.
You will save a world. You know things before they happen.
I'm a Libra.
You're Zarthan.
When you get sad, it rains.
Lots of people get sad when it rains.
It rains because you're sad, baby.
It's not fair.
Never is.
We are who we are, even if we sometimes forget.
Jeff, I am so not in the mood for you!
Get back in the subway!
Now!
That's not good.
Wait! No! Aah!
Jay!
I cannot emphasize enough how much we need you on that transport.
Laura! You have to go!
Oh, jeez.
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.
Nope!
About to lay the smackdown on your candy ass.
Laura! It's your destiny!
I was talking, Kay! Aah!
Hey! No biting.
If you don't go, we all die.
You're just as beautiful as your mother.
Kay? A little help?
Kay?
Might I suggest a bigger gun?
Kid?
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing me back.
No problem.
Why didn't you tell me?
Would you have let her go?
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?
It's nice.
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.
I did miss this city.
So Laura is Princess
Lauranna's daughter.
Did y'all...?
MiB is a mess. Let's go, kid.
Let's go?
Thousands of people in New York and New Jersey saw our little event.
Plan needs to be thought out. Plan needs to be cool. What you...?
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.
I want one of those.
Damn!
Hey
Hey.
How you doing?
I'm good, man.
We've all been there. The girl is gone and it hurts. Wanna talk'?
No.
I can help.
No.
Still sulking?
No.
Yeah.
Hell, you miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.
When our bodies were in the positions of the Kamasutra...
Zed!
Ah...
Come on, man! Damn!
I'll tell you about dames. They say they want to be scratched, but they really want is:
Hey! Frank.
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?
No. No advice.
No talking.
Hell, no.
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!
I brought them from Grand Central.
Why put them in my locker?
I thought it would put things in perspective.
It's kind of sad.
We need to let them out.
They need to know the world is bigger than that.
Still a rookie.
Whoa.
{4573}{4620}When it's yours.
{4623}{4692}That's me, Ray Adams-
{4695}{4771}young, gifted and dead.
{4773}{4819}These are my remains.
{4821}{4887}And these three|mournful brothers,
{4890}{4947}they're the men who killed me.
{4949}{5046}Aw, they look so sad,|don't they?
{5048}{5095}But this is how|they really feel.
{5260}{5318}But they're not|the real reason I'm dead.
{5320}{5401}These are their women.|Fine, ain't they?
{5404}{5459}Some families|are blessed with great genes,
{5461}{5527}and the Dandridge sisters|had it all.
{5530}{5618}But they're not the reason|I'm dead either. She is.
{5620}{5704}How did this sweet-faced woman|cause a man to die?
{5707}{5781}Well, it began six months ago.|Go! Go! Go!
{5784}{5870}- Now Howard comes up the middle,
{5872}{5975}- breaks the tackle and gets the first down.
{5977}{6086}Hey, baby, that's really nice of you,|sweetie, but we already have some food here.
{6090}{6171}- What are you doing in here?|- Trying to watch the game that's right behind you.
{6173}{6229}My book club is meeting|in here tonight.
{6231}{6281}Baby, remember when we|talked last month?
{6283}{6339}You said it was okay|if we watched the game.
{6342}{6400}Oh, yeah. Eva changed all that.|She was supposed to tell you.
{6403}{6485}- Well, she didn't.|- Hey, it's the men. What are you doing here?
{6488}{6574}Are you joining our book club?|It's gonna be very enlightening.
{6576}{6662}Sweetness, precious,|listen.
{6665}{6763}Would it be okay, you know, if you|could take it in the other room?
{6766}{6823}- Because we're all settled in.|- Yeah, the other room.
{6827}{6913}- Well, I guess we could.|- You got a great girl!
{6916}{6994}I love you, baby.|No! No, we cannot!
{6996}{7042}Oh, yeah- Oh.
{7143}{7212}Michael, Timothy, Darrell.
{7215}{7294}Our book club|is reading Beloved,
{7296}{7387}and we're gonna need the television|to watch the film when we're done.
{7389}{7474}Oh, yeah, that's right,|honey. We need the room.
{7520}{7614}You did not tell me you wanted|to use the room in my house, Eva.
{7618}{7745}Well, I'm telling you|right now, Timothy.
{7747}{7799}And it is half|my sister's house too.
{7802}{7848}Community property.
{7851}{7932}See, 'cause I want Kareenah to make|a good impression on the book club.
{7935}{7977}Don't you?|No!
{7979}{8056}- Excuse me?|- Yes.
{8083}{8183}Look, we were|here first, Eva.
{8186}{8257}Yes, but certainly the temporal|proximity of our advents...
{8260}{8322}isn't determinative, is it?
{8416}{8487}- I'll get back to you on that one.|- Yeah.
{8490}{8566}Do you know what|she just said right there?
{8568}{8680}- You don't get to me with your $50 words, Eva.|- That's right.
{8683}{8791}What would you say if I|demanded you to leave this room?
{8794}{8839}Yeah.|Yeah.
{8842}{8928}I would say I find your particular|brand of crack very amusing.
{8931}{9000}This isn't about a book...
{9003}{9052}versus a football game, fellas.
{9055}{9141}Oh, no. This is about men|versus women.
{9144}{9191}Women who aspire to culture...
{9195}{9254}and men who aspire|to scratch themselves.
{9257}{9330}Women who bear the burdens in life|and men who create those burdens.
{9333}{9438}Women who uplift humanity|and men who uplift lap dances.
{9440}{9486}If society were left|to the whims of men,
{9488}{9549}we'd still be in caves carving|pictures with our non-opposable thumbs.
{9551}{9640}So, today, gentlemen,
{9643}{9702}is the day|for civilized behavior.
{9705}{9815}Today we women raise our voices against|tyranny, crudeness and play-off games.
{9818}{9884}And that is it, gentlemen.
{9887}{9983}End of story. The fat lady's|singing! Out of the room.
{9986}{10077}By the way, if any of that was lost upon|you, then I've just proven my point again.
{10079}{10154}Excuse me.
{10157}{10220}Kareenah, baby,
{10223}{10286}I am putting|my foot down.
{10373}{10454}Damn! Damn!|I can't stand her.
{10456}{10529}I can't stand her either, but|you really need to calm down.
{10531}{10620}You're making me stressed. You need|to stand up to your wife, Timothy.
{10623}{10688}It's like she tookyour balls|and turned them into earrings.
{10691}{10737}Your wife is bling-blingin'|with your nuts.
{10739}{10797}This is what we get for being|with Eva's little sisters.
{10800}{10840}They could never stand up|to us without Eva.
{10843}{10926}I really did think I was getting|one of the fabulous Dandridge girls.
{10928}{10981}I didn't know it came with|the sister-in-law from hell.
{10983}{11051}You gotta admit, they were the|finest women in the neighborhood.
{11054}{11135}We used to say their daddy's johnson|- Should be bronzed. Right.
{11138}{11183}Did you notice how they|stuck together in an argument?
{11186}{11263}One for all and all for Eva.|That's how they're getting down.
{11266}{11318}Come on, fellas. We need|to be more compassionate.
{11320}{11377}Their parents died when they|were young and left them alone,
{11380}{11434}so they have to stick together. Yeah.
{11436}{11495}I should've used that argument to|get on Eva about that Dandridge fund.
{11498}{11556}- You know what? I would've done it.|- Look at you cosigning.
{11559}{11647}Mike, please, you need to|let that go. Every time. Okay.
{11651}{11721}They've been putting money in that|account ever since they were teenagers.
{11723}{11769}- What are they doing with it? Nothing.|- Step away from my man.
{11771}{11816}I bet they don't even know|how much is in there.
{11819}{11932}- There's no need for this.|- If he's your man, then what's he doing here with me?
{11935}{12005}Charity work, heifer.|Look- Look- Hey, hey, hey!
{12008}{12064}This is just|a big misunderstanding, okay?
{12067}{12149}Fellas, I know that brother.|Yo, Ray!
{12152}{12204}Hey!
{12207}{12266}I didn't even know|he was back in town.
{12268}{12319}You should be mad at me,|not each other.
{12322}{12399}I've been dating both of you, and|- True, we don't have a commitment.
{12403}{12469}But I couldn't decide|between you. Hey, fellas.
{12472}{12546}I think he might be the man|to rid us of Eva.
{12550}{12641}That dude? Aw, hell, no. You'd|be better off getting Ike Turner.
{12643}{12712}They're about to cuss his ass out|and leave him high and dry. Watch.
{12715}{12774}- Yeah, he's right.|- Let's go, all right?
{12776}{12822}Oh, me too?|Uh-huh.
{12824}{12887}- Get out of here!|- Be right back.
{12890}{12938}- Did you see that? Did you see that?|- Wow!
{12941}{13031}- Good to see you, man.|- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
{13033}{13112}Fellas, he said he'll meet us|here the day after tomorrow.
{13115}{13171}So he's a freak.|How does that help us with Eva?
{13174}{13240}- Eva just needs a man.|- Come on, now.
{13243}{13322}Remember, we tried that?|Remember Rashaun? Yeah.
{13324}{13379}All I said was,|you was a little uptight.
{13381}{13427}But I like that though.
{13429}{13510}So it was like a compliment|in reverse.
{13512}{13587}Oh, reverse. Right. I see. Yeah. Yeah.
{13590}{13662}You feeling me.|Yeah, sure.
{13665}{13755}Did you know that female spiders eat|the male when she's done with him?
{13757}{13842}Yeah. They date, they laugh, and then|she turns his ass into a crab cake.
{13844}{13925}Now, while the prospect of biting|your head off makes me happy,
{13928}{14004}I am sure that ultimately|you are not a Happy Meal.
{14007}{14056}So, I'm moving on|to better cuisine.
{14059}{14105}Good-bye, Rashaun.
{14107}{14171}Eva, wait. You're just|gonna say good-bye?
{14174}{14290}Oh, no, it's not good-bye.|It's hello in reverse.
{14292}{14392}Eva. Come on, girl.
{14395}{14508}- Eva put that man in the mental ward.|- You're always exaggerating.
{14511}{14597}Eva drove the brother insane.|I seen him last week.
{14600}{14681}Dude sound like Ron Hopper.|Now he t-t-talk like th-th-this.
{14683}{14740}This can work with Ray.|The boy is a specialist.
{14743}{14788}He is a master player.
{14791}{14862}Listen, Ray can get Eva|to let go ofher sisters.
{14865}{14966}Then when it's just us and|them, we can have all their love.
{14968}{15021}- Right, right.|- We can get him to seduce her.
{15023}{15095}- Yes! - 'Cause all she really|needs is some you- know-what.
{15097}{15162}Hold up. What Eva really|needs is a sensitive man-
{15164}{15211}somebody that can help her|with her personality problems.
{15213}{15310}What she needs is a dude that can hit that|ass till she starts speaking in tongues.
{15313}{15382}- Amen.
{15384}{15464}Right, right, right.|Can Ray do that?
{15467}{15519}Okay, later,|after we finish doing it,
{15521}{15604}we're gonna lie together and hold|each other and talk for a while, right?
{15608}{15721}Okay. We can do it, but|I have to study. Come on.
{15723}{15811}Eva says if I stick to a study schedule|- Don't say the "E" word.
{15814}{15892}- Not in this house.|- I have to stick to my study schedule, okay?
{15895}{15976}All of us agreed. What is|with you Dandridge women?
{15979}{16062}I love my sisters, okay?|I'm sorry.
{16064}{16124}I love you too.|It's just in a different way.
{16127}{16233}Okay. Then I demand that you love|me the same way that you love them.
{16235}{16310}You and them-|it's like apples and oranges.
{16312}{16405}What? Lady, I am your husband,|okay? I pledged my life to you...
{16408}{16482}before God and a bunch of ugly|- ass relatives I don't even like.
{16485}{16579}I gave up all my wild ways for you,|and, baby, I had a hell of a lot of them.
{16583}{16662}I never told you about the roses and the|butt-naked midgets or none of that shit.
{16664}{16738}I had midget pros in different area codes. Uh|- huh.
{16741}{16833}Therefore, I demands|to be a damn orange.
{16835}{16916}You can stop playing now.|You know what? Fine.
{16919}{16982}If a brother can't be an orange,|then you're cut off.
{16984}{17068}I'm cut off? For real?|Yeah. That's right. Back up.
{17071}{17116}I'm cut off? You gonna|cut me off? Don't touch me.
{17119}{17182}Don't do that. Don't do it. Oh, damn.
{17184}{17239}Don't do this. Don't.
{17242}{17308}Oh, damn,|the flesh is weak. Oh.
{17311}{17362}Mmm.
{17366}{17435}Up.
{17438}{17527}Down.
{17657}{17765}Right there.
{17823}{17883}- I have a dreadful problem. I need your help.
{17886}{17945}- Gosh, you're doing it.|- How the hell did you get in here?
{17947}{18010}Jacqui gave me a key|in case of an emergency.
{18013}{18100}- Are you okay?|- Don't mind us. We're just having sex.
{18103}{18157}So I should just come back in,|what, two minutes?
{18159}{18229}- Is it really important?|- Get your ass out!
{18231}{18354}- Just give us one minute.|- Oh,just one minute? Damn, it's worse than I thought.
{18390}{18466}Man, what the|- She probably had a bad day or something.
{18468}{18514}Look, hold on.|Where you going?
{18516}{18607}Eva needs me. But we need you too! No-
{18609}{18670}Wait a minute!|Damn you, Eva!
{18767}{18859}- So,you two still talking about having a baby?|- Shh.
{18862}{18907}Not so loud.
{18910}{18986}IfTim even hears the word|"baby," he jumps on top of me.
{18988}{19044}Oh, that's just|his male biological clock.
{19047}{19115}It's when a man begins having|baby fever, like a woman.
{19118}{19165}I read about it|in Psychology Today.
{19167}{19242}All I know is that every time we|argue about it, he ends up drinking.
{19244}{19318}The drinking|isn't serious, is it?
{19320}{19366}No, but-
{19402}{19507}Well, you know, his father|had a drinking problem. Mmm.
{19510}{19568}Mmm. Ah! What do you think I should do?
{19571}{19622}I don't like getting in|married people's business.
{19625}{19717}There's nothing wrong with a grown|man having an occasional drink.
{19719}{19769}Mmm.
{19772}{19846}Although a study did show that a|drinking problem can be hereditary.
{19848}{19926}You don't want your baby coming out of the|womb talking about, "Where the liquor at?"
{19928}{19978}It wouldn't be right.
{20073}{20152}Oh, hey, hey, hey. Baby,|I was still drinking that.
{20155}{20229}Honey, I know, but you shouldn't|drink so much, you know?
{20231}{20323}Eva and I werejust talking, and|- This is not what you need.
{20325}{20397}Do you wanna do the breathing|exercises Bethany talked about?
{20400}{20461}I don't wanna breathe. I just|want a drink. I want that drink.
{20464}{20536}Baby, I don't like|to bring up the past,
{20539}{20595}but you know that little problem|your daddy has.
{20598}{20712}- I'm not my father.|- Oh, sweetie, I know. I know.
{20715}{20783}It's just, tonight,|no more drinking for me.
{20785}{20882}- Thank you. Thank you.|- Baby, can I just-
{21544}{21613}Aw, come on, honey. Sing|it with me. Please? No.
{21615}{21679}It's our theme song. Aw, party|- poop. No. No. No. No.
{21812}{21860}Hey, I'm in here! Get out of|here!
{21862}{21943}I hate that damn song!|Yeah! Smell that! Ew!
{23092}{23138}This is Ray Adams,|y'all. What's happening?
{23141}{23198}I thought you moved to Florida. I did.
{23200}{23271}I worked at a car dealership down|there, but that was a year ago.
{23274}{23319}I never keep a job|more than a year.
{23322}{23398}- I work for Jomo's Meats in L.A. now.|- I know Jomo's.
{23400}{23467}Why do you quit your job every|year? What's that about, brother?
{23470}{23574}Well, I have to service|my many talents. Oh.
{23576}{23639}I was brought up an orphan.|No mama, no daddy.
{23642}{23688}No ties.|That's how I do it.
{23690}{23762}If you guys hadn't noticed,|Ray is quite the player.
{23765}{23843}- As we saw the other night.|- Yeah. Love your work, baby.
{23846}{23908}You ought to be exempt|from taxes for that shit.
{23910}{23989}Nothing Mike couldn't do. No,|I turned in my player card.
{23991}{24083}I'm practically engaged to|a beautiful woman named Bethany.
{24086}{24139}Congratulations.|Thank you, thank you.
{24142}{24213}She's gorgeous too, but not|as fine as her sister, Eva.
{24215}{24304}- Yeah, I can't even front.|- I wish I was good enough for Eva.
{24306}{24368}- I wish I was her garbage, man. Look.|- Pow!
{24438}{24534}She's cute. But why is|she scowling like that?
{24538}{24605}Her face is so tight.|That's her sexy smirk.
{24607}{24666}She ain't scowling.|Right. Right.
{24668}{24738}W-W-What's c-c-cracking,|f-fellas?
{24741}{24786}B-Bitch!
{24789}{24854}Whoa!|Bitch!
{24857}{24905}Hey! Hey!
{24907}{24975}Back over here, man.|Don't pay the retard-
{24978}{25023}The drinking|- He got out early. That's all.
{25026}{25108}Ray, how would you like|to meet Eva?
{25110}{25185}- Is she giving it up?|- "Is she giving it up?"
{25189}{25295}- Man, she's double-jointed. - She's|lookin' up at her feet every night.
{25298}{25387}- Bumping her head on the headboard, all that.|- That's right.
{25390}{25469}So I only have one question:|What's wrong with her?
{25527}{25575}Nothing.|Nothing. Nothing.
{25578}{25631}So three grown men|walk into a bar...
{25634}{25704}to hook up a man|for a perfectly good woman.
{25706}{25788}What is it? She got five kids, a violent ex|- con boyfriend?
{25790}{25885}Is she one of those evil, nasty sisters|who beats a brother down till he's dust?
{25887}{25963}- What is it?|- It's the ex- con thing, bro.
{25966}{26054}- Darrell!|- Ray, Ray, look, I gotta be honest with you.
{26058}{26183}Eva is a piece of work, but we're prepared|to make it worth your while to take her out.
{26186}{26242}You're gonna pay me|to go out with her?
{26245}{26290}Are you worried that that|makes you look like a gigolo?
{26293}{26384}- No. I mean, I kind of like that aspect.|- Okay!
{26386}{26454}All right.|I'm in a financial bind.
{26457}{26504}My landlord is selling my house.|I need cash to buy it.
{26506}{26592}Man, that is perfect. Then we|all can benefit from this deal.
{26594}{26654}Here's what we need you to do:|Take her out for a couple of months.
{26657}{26705}Not just distract her,|but make her fall hard for you.
{26708}{26766}I can definitely do that.|And I love a challenge.
{26769}{26814}Really, she can't be|all that bad, can she?
{26818}{26905}Eva's sisters gave her a cross|with Jesus on it for her birthday.
{26908}{26996}- The next day,Jesus was gone.|- You're kidding, right?
{26998}{27063}No. When you do it, you have to|make her fall in love with you,
{27066}{27117}then you tell her you're leaving|town and get her to go with you.
{27120}{27169}- Then you can dump her. It'll take her years to relocate.|- Yes!
{27171}{27287}Time out. I'm sorry. This ain't|my kind of thing, you know.
{27290}{27372}I'm a lover, not a con man. Mike,|let's hang out sometime, okay?
{27374}{27420}But, Ray-|Get him a drink.
{27422}{27470}Take another look at her.|That's not a zero.
{27472}{27517}But think about it, Ray.
{27519}{27587}You just had to bring up|theJesus thing.
{27590}{27650}He got muscles. I didn't|think he'd be scared of her.
{27772}{27884}Hey, I went out with that construction|guy yesterday. The cute one?
{27886}{27958}Mm-hmm. And you know|we ended up in the bed.
{27960}{28014}Did he have to take a number,|or was the line moving briskly?
{28016}{28084}Ooh!
{28086}{28143}No, no, tell it, please.|Ormandy, go.
{28146}{28242}Thank you, Eva.|Honey, he dropped his pants,
{28245}{28308}and he whipped it out|all proud.
{28310}{28390}And I said, "Oh, no.|Where's the rest of it?"
{28441}{28508}Ya have to put man in place|sometime, ya hear that?
{28510}{28593}- Did she just call me a bitch?|- Right.
{28597}{28647}What's up?
{28650}{28727}- Hey!
{28730}{28777}Hey, baby.
{28779}{28870}Listen, Eva, I need to have a little|talk with you about the Dandridge fund.
{28873}{28924}Why is that, Michael?|You're not in our family.
{28926}{28986}- But I'm almost in.|- Almost isn't in, now, is it?
{28988}{29083}Mike, honey, do you really want|to get into an argument...
{29086}{29131}with a woman in here, hmm?
{29134}{29232}Got some Frosted Mini-Wheats|in your scalp. Hey! You're fine.
{29235}{29318}You're right, baby. You got|that thing for me? Oh, yeah.
{29444}{29507}Fiber? "Fiber Power."
{29510}{29588}Are you okay, Mike?|Is everything moving all right?
{29590}{29657}He's a little irregular. All right.|You don't have to announce it.
{29659}{29760}- Hey, I got somethin'for that.|- And if she can't fix you, I know I can.
{29762}{29841}You need to quit, Telly, 'cause I|ain't even close to going your way.
{29843}{29894}Damn.|Let me call headquarters.
{29897}{29978}Hello. Yeah, it's me.|Listen, take Mike off the list.
{29980}{30025}Mm-hmm.
{30028}{30113}Sixty-nine out.|Ooh-hoo-hoo!
{30117}{30222}I should've never came to this|place, better known as "Man Hell."
{30225}{30284}No, this is|a female sanctuary.
{30286}{30374}- Way the whole world ought to be.|Ain't that right, ladies? - Mm-hmm.
{30377}{30422}See you.|Bye.
{30425}{30475}Get some milk for them cornflakes. Hey.
{30478}{30588}You should start making him take better care|ofhimself if you guys are gonna get married.
{30590}{30693}He should get a colonic or see a|specialist. And I know a good one.
{30999}{31058}Hey, got your order.|Where do you want it?
{31061}{31128}Freezer number one.|Make sure you stack them neatly.
{31195}{31241}Excuse me.
{31358}{31409}Hello.|Where's Leonard?
{31412}{31463}He's sick. I'm Oscar,|the assistant manager.
{31466}{31559}Okay, Oscar, I'm Inspector|Dandridge from the health department.
{31562}{31645}Yes, I've heard about you.|Good. Then you know the drill.
{31881}{31938}Let's get clean.
{32303}{32385}It does not look good,|Oscar.
{32388}{32440}I found contamination|in red zones.
{32443}{32491}Your glass freezer door|has a hairline break in it.
{32494}{32559}And I found black pellets behind|the food containers in the back.
{32562}{32651}That is probably just graphite|from the new units we put in.
{32654}{32717}Your water's only 105 degrees.|Can you just let that slide?
{32719}{32792}The requirement is 110,|because science tells us...
{32794}{32871}at that temperature all|dangerous organisms will die.
{32874}{32984}That means in your water, some will|live. And not just any germs, Oscar.
{32986}{33088}No. The bad-ass ones, the ones that can|swim in 1 05- degree-temperature water...
{33090}{33141}and live to party on|some child's french fries.
{33143}{33196}We don't serve fries.|Are you mocking me?
{33199}{33266}No, ma'am. That's good,|because I'm not done yet.
{33269}{33342}This entire kitchen gets a level|four sanitation or you get written up.
{33346}{33434}What? No, that means|it's in the newspaper.
{33437}{33522}Thank goodness for you I've|got a soft heart. Heart?
{33525}{33576}You don't have a heart.
{33578}{33674}You got a hole with an ice pump in|it. You know, I don't understand you.
{33677}{33740}Why do you have to be|so goddamn uncompromising?
{33794}{33842}It's called principle,|Oscar.
{33845}{33898}Maybe the world is in|short supply, but I am not.
{33900}{33954}People pay their tax dollars|for my principle...
{33957}{34011}so they can go into a restaurant|and not eat chicken fried rat...
{34014}{34066}or bite into a bacon,|lettuce and ptomaine sandwich.
{34070}{34125}If I slack up on you, then I|have to cut everyone a break,
{34127}{34185}and pretty soon, the almonds|on your salad have legs.
{34187}{34283}If that makes me uncompromising,|well, I wear it as a badge of honor,
{34286}{34332}because I'm in|damn good company.
{34334}{34426}Martin Luther King was uncompromising,|Nelson Mandela was uncompromising,
{34428}{34480}and I'm sure your mother|was uncompromising,
{34482}{34540}although the evidence of that|is not apparent today.
{34542}{34630}So, why don't you think of me|as your mom right now?
{34633}{34698}And Mama says,|"Clean it up!"
{34722}{34779}See you in 48 hours.
{34861}{34941}All right.|I'll go on the date with Eva.
{34943}{35062}Mmm! Yes! Yes! What made|you change your mind, Ray?
{35065}{35113}I saw her|at a restaurant.
{35115}{35179}If I can get that woman, I'll go|down in the Player Hall of Fame.
{35182}{35244}You sure will.|Okay, okay.
{35246}{35303}So what's your price? I need|five grand to get the house.
{35306}{35405}Five thousand dollars? I|don't know, man. Hey, hey, hey-
{35408}{35483}Forty-five, what did you say|about five thousand dollars?
{35486}{35542}Um, I said,
{35545}{35628}"Five pounds|of collard greens, man.
{35630}{35687}No ham."|Ordering soul food.
{35690}{35763}Five thousand dollars?|Yes, man.
{35766}{35815}I saw her in action.|You're getting off cheap.
{35818}{35902}I don't know. I gotta talk|to the guys about this, Ray.
{35905}{35969}All right. Well, let me know. I'm ready.
{35970}{36023}Ooh.
{36026}{36098}Thank you. Thank you.
{36098}{36166}- I want to talk to you for a second, Eva.|- What about, sir?
{36168}{36240}I was offered a position as|deputy health inspector in Chicago.
{36270}{36327}- That's great.|- I'm not taking the job,
{36330}{36381}but I think|you should consider it.
{36384}{36430}Me, Theo?
{36433}{36539}The representative from Chicago's been here|all week checking out my best inspectors.
{36542}{36631}- He liked you. Send in Mr. Tillman.|- Yes, sir.
{36667}{36747}- Oh, goodness.|- Hello, Eva.
{36750}{36815}- You were checking me out the other day.|- Yes, I was.
{36818}{36877}And you were amazing.
{36880}{36928}You passed|with flying colors.
{36930}{37025}I should have worn my diaper.|Chicago's a tough town.
{37027}{37118}- We need our inspectors to have your intensity.|- Okay!
{37120}{37186}- I'm at a loss for words.|- And that doesn't happen often.
{37189}{37253}You don't have to|say anything now.
{37257}{37302}I've still got a few more candidates|in other cities to look at.
{37305}{37371}But I'll let you know in a few|weeks when I make my decision.
{37373}{37458}Meeting you was...|an experience.
{37489}{37571}Uh, Theo.|Right. Bye.
{37606}{37662}That's great. I wanted your|job, but this is way better.
{37665}{37736}- Oh, my God!|- This will be very exciting for you.
{37739}{37787}Better job,|more money in a new city.
{37789}{37837}Yeah, my sisters are-
{37865}{37947}- What?|- Nothing.
{37949}{38000}I'm sure they're gonna be|really happy for me.
{38004}{38061}Thank you|for recommending me.
{38064}{38139}Thanks.
{38142}{38195}I will see you in two weeks. Thank you.
{38197}{38243}Great.|Bye.
{38245}{38300}How come I can never get|my toes done on girls'night?
{38303}{38349}'Cause it's only|for the Dandridge sisters.
{38352}{38442}- And nobody wants to|touch your funky-ass feet. -
{38477}{38581}Oh! Ladies, ladies,|guess who I saw.
{38583}{38638}Lucius Johnson.
{38641}{38687}- Lucious Lucius.|- Hmm.
{38689}{38750}I wouldn't mind|seeing him again.
{38753}{38822}Me neither.|I wonder if he's married.
{38825}{38892}Eva, are you okay?
{38894}{38944}Yeah, sure.|Why wouldn't I be?
{38947}{39015}- Are you still stuck on Lucius?|- No! G-God!
{39017}{39077}Come on. Ancient history. Eva,
{39080}{39179}once you give a man some of|your energy, he always has it.
{39181}{39247}- Well, yeah.|- Especially if he popped that cherry.
{39249}{39297}- Pop, pop, pop!|- No, no, no!
{39299}{39393}- There was no pop, pop, popping of any cherries, Ormandy.
{39395}{39474}Lucius was my first,|and I was his. That's all.
{39477}{39531}Listen, the best way|to get over an old man-
{39533}{39589}Is to get under a new one.
{39592}{39670}Yeah! I am not thinking about Lucius.
{39673}{39745}Okay?|It's girls'night, right?
{39749}{39843}I'm sure that a group of intelligent...|women can come together...
{39846}{39925}and talk about something|besides men.
{39976}{40097}- Sad.
{40100}{40176}Well, Tim did introduce me to|somebody new in his department.
{40178}{40240}- Do you wanna meet him?|- I do need a date...
{40242}{40315}to the mayor's formal|fund-raiser in a couple weeks.
{40317}{40378}All right. I'll bite.|What are his vitals?
{40381}{40469}Thirty-six, divorced, two kids.|I hear he's in group therapy.
{40473}{40519}- Pass -|Mmm. - Uh-uh.
{40521}{40577}Girl, messed-up men|are the best ones.
{40580}{40697}- A messed-up man is redundant.|- I don't need to be set up, okay?
{40699}{40748}I'm good.|I prayed on this.
{40750}{40805}God- God is gonna|take care of it.
{40807}{40853}God ain't shipping out|no men.
{40856}{40933}Like hell he ain't.|Look here, when you talk to God,
{40936}{41031}tell him a sister needs|a tall, fine one.
{41033}{41143}- And not gay.|- You know you want the soul pole.
{41145}{41220}No, he didn't. No, he didn't! Bam!
{41223}{41316}A star for a star.
{41318}{41401}You shouldn't let Eva stop us|from moving in together, Beth.
{41434}{41495}See, I just don't sense|that we're spiritually...
{41497}{41580}in tune with each other...|completely.
{41583}{41670}And besides,|we're not married. Hmm?
{41673}{41739}I'm not gonna propose|just to spend the night.
{41741}{41803}Okay. Have I ever|pressured you about that?
{41857}{41903}Of course not.
{41961}{42061}And Eva says cohabitation does not increase|the chances of a lasting relationship.
{42064}{42126}Oh, my God. Will you stop|it with the "Evaisms"?
{42129}{42189}That woman with her statistics|and her philosophy- Mike, honey-
{42192}{42284}She's very intelligent.|Don't hate on her for it.
{42286}{42353}If she's so smart, why doesn't|she dissolve the fund...
{42356}{42409}and let you live your own lives|with your own money?
{42412}{42509}You know what? This is stress.|You wanna do some meditation, hmm?
{42512}{42611}No. No meditation.
{42613}{42676}Stress is why your colon|is all clogged up.
{42678}{42733}Thanks to Eva's doctor,|my colon is a freeway.
{42809}{42900}Look, all I wanna do|is spend the night with you...
{42902}{42971}and not have to get up in the middle|of the night like some criminal.
{43006}{43053}I enjoy spending time|with you.
{43087}{43149}I love the way you blink.
{43152}{43199}I love that smile.
{43261}{43308}I love you.
{43453}{43513}I love you too.
{43515}{43594}But why should a man buy the software|when he can download for free?
{43650}{43717}That is Eva talking. That is|not you talking. No, actually-
{43720}{43772}Jacqui said it,|but it doesn't matter.
{43775}{43877}You know, Eva took charge of the|family after our parents died.
{43931}{44037}If we wanna have a child, it|should be our decision, not Eva's.
{44040}{44149}All she said was that most marriages|fail within the first five years.
{44152}{44232}Fifty-two percent. We've|only been married for three.
{44234}{44288}If we had a baby|and something were to go wrong,
{44290}{44358}then there's an innocent life|hanging in the balance of our failure.
{44361}{44446}Nothing... is going...
{44449}{44512}to go... wrong.
{44515}{44564}Mmm. Hmm?
{44567}{44653}Besides,you know I didn't have a|good relationship with my father.
{44656}{44751}Honey, I know, but-|And all I want...
{44753}{44836}is my chance...|to be a good daddy,
{44838}{44927}to have|a little brown bundle...
{44929}{45025}of love... and life.
{45053}{45128}And I want it|because I love you.
{45176}{45253}Now, tell me,|is that so wrong?
{45256}{45318}Fifty-two percent.
{45321}{45369}Honey,|Eva gives great advice.
{45371}{45417}She put me through med school,|you know?
{45419}{45482}God, do I know that!
{45485}{45541}You know what?|You're not married to me.
{45543}{45621}You're married to Eva. I'm|just a handyman with a penis.
{45623}{45701}Tim, like you ever fix|anything around here!
{45781}{45829}What- What did I say?
{46750}{46821}I cannot believe we are paying|five grand to this man.
{46824}{46883}Just think of it as an investment.
{46886}{46971}Once Eva's gone, we'll all be happy.
{47038}{47130}It was a great idea-you having|him meet Eva at church.
{47133}{47201}- She is going to love that.|- Well-
{47204}{47267}Fellas, I don't think we should|be talking about this here.
{47269}{47388}God might hear us. God|made Eva, so we're even.
{47391}{47440}Speaking of which, where is this guy?
{47443}{47496}Church is almost over.
{47498}{47579}Tim, this is a black church.|It's never over.
{48023}{48074}Excuse me.
{48121}{48172}Yo, what took you|so long?
{48175}{48229}I'm not the churchgoing type.|You people get up early.
{48232}{48320}Nice job with the choir,|Eva, girl. They were bangin'.
{48323}{48430}You know, Reverend, your sermon|today was great. I mean, bang-up job.
{48433}{48495}Although you did miss a word of|that verse from the Book of Acts.
{48498}{48561}I think I was the only one who|caught it, and, well, God, of course.
{48565}{48635}So I took the liberty of|jotting down a few suggestions...
{48637}{48720}on how you can do better|in the future. Say what?
{48723}{48790}My child, please.|I appreciate that.
{48793}{48847}But you know what?|I got this.
{48849}{48917}- Praise the Lord.
{48920}{48986}Praise him. Eva, we're|all waiting for you.
{48989}{49077}Can't you see I'm busy, Michael?|I am speaking with the reverend.
{49080}{49125}Oh, no, no, honey.|Please, go.
{49128}{49205}Go back to your friends.|Please- No. Go.
{49209}{49278}Actually, Reverend, I needed to|talk to you and get your advice...
{49281}{49370}for a friend of mine who has a|dilemma about a job she's considering.
{49373}{49452}Mmm. I've got people who have|much bigger problems, Eva.
{49454}{49586}People whose souls need to be saved|from eternal damnation. Stuff like that.
{49589}{49660}A soul lasts forever,|Reverend, and this job may not.
{49662}{49739}Please, I need to tell her|what to do. Tell your friend I-
{49769}{49814}Follow her heart.
{49817}{49933}Now, please, excuse me.
{49936}{49994}Amen.
{50035}{50104}Eva, this is Ray Adams,|a friend of mine.
{50106}{50180}Hello.|Hello, Raymond.
{50183}{50255}Call me Ray. No one calls me|Raymond. Well, I do, Raymond.
{50257}{50337}What's so funny?
{50339}{50418}I love a woman|who speaks her mind.
{50421}{50474}My girlfriend's the same way.
{50477}{50534}Oh. Well, good for her.
{50537}{50614}Ray, I didn't know|you were seeing anyone.
{50617}{50688}Oh, yeah,|about six months now.
{50691}{50776}I see a friend of mine over there.|It's nice to meet you. All of you.
{50918}{50964}What the hell|was that, man?
{50966}{51045}Why did you tell her you had a|woman? We gave you half the money.
{51047}{51139}If you're thinking about screwing us|- Mmm! Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.
{51141}{51229}No woman wants a man who another|woman doesn't already want.
{51232}{51301}The next time I meet her,|I'll make my move.
{51303}{51366}I'm sure me and my girlfriend|will be having trouble by then.
{51467}{51525}You're good. I should've known. Yeah.
{51528}{51607}Look, Tim is having some people|over next week for a barbecue.
{51610}{51672}Why don't you come by?|I will.
{51676}{51748}Just let the master|handle his business.
{51751}{51805}By the way, I'm gonna need|a little expense money.
{51808}{51899}Expenses for what? I need|funding to take Eva on a date.
{51901}{51979}What about the five|grand? That was my fee.
{51981}{52069}"Fee." "Expenses."|See how the words are different?
{52072}{52150}Three hundred should|do it. Three hundred?
{52153}{52225}Three hundred dollars?
{52310}{52369}All right. Fine. Fine.
{52372}{52423}But you're on it.|Like wet paint.
{52426}{52477}Okay.
{52661}{52772}- Ray was pretty fine. - Yeah, and he|has a girlfriend. - Leave him alone.
{52774}{52842}- All the good prospects are all taken.|- Or gay.
{52845}{52908}You should always use an opportunity|like this to swoop on a man.
{52910}{53008}When Mr. Mason left his wife|last year, I jumped right on it.
{53010}{53131}- Ormandy, Mr. Mason is 70.|- Are you crazy? See, an old man is a perfect man.
{53133}{53212}You give him a little Viagra|so he can handle his business,
{53215}{53318}and right before he gets on your nerves,|honey, he dies and leaves you his cash.
{53321}{53396}That's like having a dick with|a lottery number on it! Yeah!
{53398}{53481}- Mm-mmm, that's nasty. -|Eva isn't a home wrecker.
{53484}{53565}So don't worry about them.|You can do much better.
{53567}{53657}- Jacqui, you are always blocking on Eva.|- I do not.
{53660}{53714}You do too. You're spoiled.
{53716}{53794}- You always wanna keep Eva to yourself.|- No, that's ridiculous.
{53796}{53856}- Isn't that, Eva?|- Of course it is, honey.
{53858}{53904}Jacqui, you are a big-ass baby.
{53907}{54006}- The queen ofbig-ass babies. - So why|are you guys always ganging up on me?
{54009}{54091}- Because you're an evil, twisted little heifer.|- Twisted!
{54093}{54172}- Ladies, is this how we behave?|- It has been this way since we were little!
{54174}{54249}When you cut off my baby doll's|head when I was 10!
{54252}{54315}You broke my Boo-Boo Kitty,|so the bitch had to die!
{54380}{54472}- I'm moving to Chicago.
{54475}{54587}- Eva, what did you just say?|- I'm moving to Chicago.
{54589}{54687}I might be getting a betterjob|and moving...
{54690}{54756}to Chicago.
{54796}{54859}My boss told me|the other day.
{54863}{54945}Come on. I mean, it's deputy|health inspector of Chicago!
{54948}{55008}It's a great opportunity.
{55010}{55082}Look, I've been looking|for a way to tell you guys.
{55108}{55182}So there it is...|in a nutshell.
{55184}{55254}Th-That-|That's great for you.
{55256}{55324}Yeah, it- it is.
{55363}{55442}Girl, there's some fine brothers|up in Chicago.
{55444}{55505}So you're just gonna up|and leave, just like that?
{55508}{55576}No, I have to get|the job first.
{55580}{55692}I'll find out in a few|weeks. Oh, I'm sorry.
{55696}{55787}First you get the job, then you pack|up and leave like a thief in the night?
{55789}{55878}You're just gonna leave us|like that? Do not attack Eva.
{55880}{55929}She has sacrificed for us. I'm not!
{55932}{55982}Okay, okay, stop!
{55984}{56047}Please, stop it! Stop it!
{56076}{56139}If you don't want me to go,|Jacqui, I won't.
{56141}{56220}- It's not my decision.|- It is if you're gonna hate me for it.
{56263}{56361}I don't wanna lose your|friendship, any of you.
{56364}{56446}Jacqui doesn't mean it,|do you?
{56496}{56543}I do want you|to be happy, Eva.
{56598}{56704}So if going...|makes you happy,
{56754}{56815}I'm happy.
{56884}{56955}You sure?
{56958}{57021}- You promise?
{57024}{57071}Yeah.
{57124}{57171}Oh!
{57174}{57240}I love you, sister.|I love you too, sister.
{57244}{57295}Mm-hmm. We so pretty,|perfect and shit.
{57600}{57651}Hey, make sure you|cook that meat thoroughly.
{57654}{57722}I'd hate to tell you what kind|of things live in raw meat.
{57724}{57792}Please don't.|Thank you very much.
{57842}{57900}Babe. Is he eating those beans again?
{57903}{58001}What's wrong? I see Darrell|found my spicy baked beans.
{58004}{58098}- Give him the Heimlich.|- Separates the men from the boys.
{58100}{58196}- He knows better.|- No. See, give him some bread, you guys. Bread.
{58200}{58268}Baby, here, eat this. Eat|this. Here, here, here.
{58271}{58345}If you wanna help, stop making|these damn beans every function, Eva!
{58348}{58430}- What did you put in that stuff?|- Special recipe.
{58432}{58484}- It's only for a real man.|- I just wanna hear him talk.
{58487}{58547}Give him some more beans. Can he talk?
{58550}{58624}Oh, hey. I didn't know|Mike's friend was coming.
{58627}{58676}Oh, baby, listen. Why|don't you take care of this?
{58679}{58736}I'm gonna go over and say hello. Okay.
{58738}{58812}Excuse me, Eva.|Thankyou.
{58816}{58870}Ray, what's up? Yo!
{58873}{58940}He's really fine, Eva.
{58942}{59017}I'm not impressed|by that... much.
{59020}{59067}You say hi to Ray, man?
{59070}{59158}Give him a chance.|You gotta bend a little, girl.
{59183}{59229}Are you saying|I'm not accessible?
{59232}{59312}Yes, that is what|I'm saying, Eva.
{59314}{59396}You know, you're too good|of a person to be alone.
{59399}{59471}What's going on?|Everything's cool? Yeah.
{59474}{59561}I'm your sister, I love you,|and I'm asking you to bend.
{59564}{59609}Okay, but it's the fine ones|who leave you broke,
{59612}{59660}with bad credit|and a hair weave you don't need.
{59662}{59711}Mm-mm-mm!
{59715}{59792}Hello again, Eva.|Hi, Raymond.
{59794}{59870}Look here, I hope you don't|mind, but I invited Ray.
{59872}{59920}No, he's most welcome.
{59976}{60079}Look, I have to|go tell Darrell something.
{60081}{60133}I'll be right back.
{60136}{60194}Yeah, you know what? These|- We don't need to cook these.
{60196}{60254}Excuse us.
{60256}{60304}Good to see you.
{60343}{60388}So, Raymond, what is it|that you do again?
{60392}{60488}I deliver meat...|forJomo's.
{60492}{60565}Meat delivery.|Interesting.
{60568}{60672}Jomo's deals in only premium|meats, high-end clientele.
{60674}{60732}What about you?|I'm a health inspector.
{60734}{60816}- That sounds interesting too.|- I need a gurney for my ass.
{60818}{60870}See the man with flames|coming out of his ass?
{60872}{60930}We're gonna need backup.|Thank you. Squeeze and pull.
{60932}{61021}- How about we go get a plate of food?|- Sure. A nice hot one.
{61103}{61160}Two minutes and she|has not insulted him.
{61163}{61270}This could be very promising.|Mm-hmm. They feel good together to me.
{61307}{61389}So, you wanna go out|with me sometime?
{61392}{61460}Is your girlfriend coming too?|'Cause we could all play canasta...
{61463}{61513}or Parcheesi|or Taboo or something.
{61516}{61587}Well, she's, uh-
{61590}{61687}Actually, it's not working out.|We're not together anymore.
{61690}{61736}Oh.
{61738}{61799}As one car breaks down,|you just hop into another one?
{61802}{61865}I'd like to think that going|out with you is riding in a limo.
{61909}{62002}- I'm sorry. Did I insult you?|- No. No, it was very funny.
{62005}{62052}I just don't laugh a lot.
{62054}{62142}Lord, help me.|That's a good-looking man.
{62145}{62204}I can't keep|my legs together.
{62207}{62276}The sun comes up and you|can't keep your legs together.
{62279}{62362}Telly.|He's got sneaky eyes.
{62364}{62434}Jacqui,|don't you start.
{62436}{62507}I didn't make the man's eyes|all beady and shifty. Shh!
{62509}{62567}- What?|- You never answered my question.
{62569}{62640}What question was that?|Will you go out with me?
{62683}{62767}Look, Raymond, I know we just met,|and you seem like a really nice guy,
{62769}{62865}but I think I should tell you a|little something about myself. Okay.
{62868}{62917}I know the one thing|that scares men to death.
{62920}{62976}- What's that?|- I know the truth about them.
{62978}{63048}And the truth is, most men|don't really know what they want.
{63050}{63099}I've been through|all the basic types.
{63101}{63180}The playa-playas, who|think women are disposable toys.
{63183}{63277}The confused man, who doesn't know if|he wants to date you or your brother.
{63280}{63338}The lazy ones, who live with their mother|and expect you to pick up the check.
{63340}{63421}So if you really|wanna go out with me,
{63424}{63484}realize that it means|being a gentleman,
{63487}{63576}understand that it means|respecting my mind, body and spirit.
{63579}{63636}Eva, I'm not afraid|of you.
{63640}{63711}And I wanna go on record as|saying I totally respect...
{63713}{63796}your mind and your spirit.
{63799}{63854}- What about my body?|- It's beautiful.
{63856}{63963}- But will you respect it?|- I'll do anything to it you want me to.
{63965}{64032}Look at that. The corners of|your mouth actually turn up.
{64035}{64088}A smart-ass.|I like that.
{64091}{64139}So, will you|go out with me?
{64176}{64221}He's eating the beans.|He's eating the beans.
{64224}{64288}Oh, no, brother.|Don't do it, brother.
{64320}{64365}Ahhh!
{64368}{64484}Whoo! That's good.|That's really good.
{64487}{64546}- Kareenah sure can cook, huh?|- Actually, I made those beans.
{64548}{64598}Really?
{64601}{64692}You put your foot in them, girl.|Damn, I love spicy food.
{64695}{64787}- How about we go out this weekend?|- Sounds good.
{64789}{64835}Fabulous.
{64995}{65041}You're late.|I know.
{65044}{65122}I left early, but there was a|real bad accident on the street.
{65124}{65192}Really?
{65196}{65299}- Who told you I like lilies?|- Sometimes a man gets lucky.
{65528}{65592}Looks like somebody likes-
{65595}{65659}I was noticing all the pictures|of the horses.
{65688}{65740}You look good.
{65743}{65816}I love horses.|And thank you.
{65819}{65900}Here, uh,|let me take these from you.
{65974}{66029}You ever see the accident rates|on these things?
{66032}{66089}They're very dangerous.|No.
{66092}{66182}That's why I drive this.|Okay.
{66184}{66252}You're joking, right?
{66255}{66320}Nope.
{66564}{66616}This is what you drive|when you take out a woman?
{66619}{66676}Yeah. It's clean|and it's free.
{66718}{66787}I'm saving to buy a house. Oh.
{66790}{66868}I can understand that. Home|ownership is very important.
{66872}{66917}Does your mother live with you? No.
{66920}{66970}Even better.
{67026}{67091}My boss has been hinting|he might want to slow down.
{67094}{67140}Let somebody run|the day-to-day for him.
{67142}{67235}I think he might want me to do it.|That's great. When do you start?
{67237}{67324}I'm thinking about it. There is|nothing wrong with a little ambition.
{67327}{67400}I was a secretary in my department.|Now I'm the lead inspector.
{67403}{67490}I gave myself five years to|get there. I did it in four.
{67544}{67600}There you go, doing that thing|you do with your face again.
{67603}{67647}Just drive|your meat wagon, man.
{67649}{67699}Did you hear about the|black caveman they found?
{67703}{67760}They knew he was black by the curve|of his jaw, length of his spine,
{67763}{67830}Cadillac he was buried in.
{67832}{67957}You tell me a joke now. I'm not|a jokey-joke type person, so-
{67984}{68040}Okay.|How about a little music?
{68075}{68158}Ahh!
{68160}{68212}All right, all right.
{68215}{68271}Yeah.
{68308}{68359}I love this record.
{69431}{69502}This must be a pretty good restaurant,|you being a health inspector and all.
{69504}{69560}Oh, yeah. Most places|I can't even go to.
{69563}{69652}They try to poison me. But this place|- Oh, God, it's different.
{69655}{69725}The manager has O.C.D.|Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
{69728}{69781}He cleans all day long.|You could eat off the floors.
{69784}{69887}Sounds appetizing.|Oh, you think that's funny?
{69888}{69945}Did you know that if food|isn't prepared just right...
{69947}{70009}your throat can close up and|you can drown in your own vomit?
{70012}{70070}Oh, I'm hungry now.
{70112}{70216}Mmm!Just like|Mama used to make.
{70392}{70496}Okay. That's really funny, Raymond,|but I know when somebody's choking.
{70606}{70668}You can stop now.
{70749}{70797}Oh, my God. Call 911!
{70915}{70991}That's not the hug I was hoping|for, but it'll do for now.
{71056}{71102}I'm just playing.
{71104}{71150}Is everything all right?|Yes.
{71152}{71206}Yes. My friend here|was just telling a littlejoke.
{71286}{71371}- What are you doing here?|- Well, well, Inspector Dandridge.
{71374}{71462}Now, you-you manage the Red|Leaf restaurant across town.
{71464}{71543}Oh, no, not after|your last inspection.
{71546}{71658}I was fired for a broken light|bulb in a freezer. Remember?
{71661}{71710}No. No, no, no,|I don't want you.
{71713}{71760}I want the man with O.C.D.
{71763}{71808}Eva, relax.|It's all right.
{71811}{71889}The old manager's not here.|How's that salad working?
{71891}{71974}You know, we used our special|house dressing just for you.
{71977}{72078}- Creamy, isn't it?|- I'm not eating here. Let's go.
{72080}{72164}I'm sure it's okay.|Did you hear what I just said?
{72167}{72286}I am not eating here.|Let's go! Okay. Okay.
{72360}{72408}Don't forget to validate.
{72487}{72533}Don't be mad at me.|I just wanted to stay.
{72535}{72589}And have her|put things in my food?
{72591}{72666}I don't think so, pal. I just|think you overreacted a little bit.
{72669}{72715}You're a civil servant,|not the F.B.I.
{72717}{72799}Well, excuse the hell|out of me.
{72801}{72869}Why don't you tell me about the|demanding world of meat delivery?
{72871}{72947}So, you just basically pick it up|and deliver it to a guy named Bob?
{72950}{73026}Or is there some sort of math|involved? You don't need to be so nasty.
{73029}{73091}Oh, there is definitely a need|for me to get nasty.
{73094}{73163}My job is serious.|It is not a hobby.
{73166}{73252}Guess what, meat boy? I'm sure|my job pays more than yours does.
{73255}{73303}So in my eyes, the eyes|of society and the I.R.S.,
{73306}{73351}that makes me bigger|and better than you.
{73354}{73399}So why don't you think about|that the next time you're out...
{73402}{73486}doing the complex work|of toting around a pig's ass.
{73536}{73586}'Cause that's like|a family thing.
{73589}{73635}You know, with the thing|- Excuse me.
{73637}{73702}Hello. Kareenah, it's|Eva. I need to talk.
{73705}{73804}Hey.
{73807}{73868}It's Eva. And Kareenah.|We got an emergency.
{73877}{73923}Jacqui, it's Eva.
{73925}{73976}And Kareenah. And|Bethany. Code seven, girl.
{73979}{74021}No!
{74024}{74084}- What's up?|- The date was catastrophic.
{74087}{74154}Wait till I tell you what happened.|This fool had the nerve to-
{74156}{74237}- What the hell went wrong?|- Kareenah was falling in love with having a baby.
{74240}{74301}And me and my wife|were cuddling. I mean,
{74304}{74354}I was hitting it real manly,|and I didn't get to finish.
{74356}{74432}They had a four-way phone|conference about your date all night.
{74435}{74498}I thought you was the master|player. The master player.
{74500}{74597}I can't get to her. Most women have|a few barriers around their hearts.
{74600}{74716}Eva has an electrified fence|with rabid pit bulls. Okay?
{74718}{74779}And that mouth!|My ears are still bleeding.
{74781}{74863}We got to do something about this, 'cause|we can't have Eva messing up our plan.
{74866}{74967}Ray, listen, all you have to do is find a|way to get back on her good side. That's all.
{74969}{75032}- He's gotta sleep with her. That's what you gotta do.|- Yeah, that's it.
{75035}{75110}Look, I would love to have|another shot with her, all right?
{75112}{75180}My pride was hurt. But I'm|sure it's out of the question.
{75183}{75249}What, you don't like women?|Watch yourself now.
{75252}{75324}- You have to have sex with her.|- I don't think that's the answer.
{75327}{75396}Oh, man, he don't like women!|I told you this dude was-
{75398}{75494}Hey, hey! I do like women,|all right? How are you?
{75496}{75588}Look, fellas, I'm sorry,
{75592}{75638}but there's no way she's|gonna go out with me again.
{75640}{75739}Hmph. No way. I'll|give you your money back.
{75743}{75796}You're damn right|you will.
{76614}{76668}'Cause I'm in|damn good company.
{76671}{76737}Martin Luther King|was uncompromising.
{76740}{76799}Nelson Mandela:|uncompromising.
{76802}{76875}Confucius: uncompromising.
{76878}{76969}And so am I. Here is your citation. Eva.
{76972}{77046}What, Raymond? I am working.|So am I.
{77048}{77104}And you're right.|There's no math involved.
{77107}{77154}Why did I stop her|from leaving?
{77156}{77219}It wasn'tjust curiosity|that made me go after her.
{77223}{77305}Now that I'm dead, I know it was|something special about Eva.
{77308}{77387}I know you're upset with me, but|I want you to go out with me again.
{77389}{77448}And why is that?|'Cause you're pretty.
{77480}{77528}That's the most shallow thing|I've ever heard.
{77530}{77615}It's not like I got to really know you.|So basically, I'm working on beauty here.
{77617}{77720}Well, you know what? I am so much|more than what's on the outside, okay?
{77723}{77787}More than what appeals|to some... meat man.
{77789}{77854}And thank you|for the compliment.
{77856}{77943}I feel like I owe you.|We can do anything you want.
{77946}{78022}Anything?|Anything. Sky's the limit.
{78286}{78386}Wait. Okay. Okay.|Whoa. Whoa.
{78883}{78975}Whoa! Oh, God. Oh, God.|Hang on! Hang on!
{79060}{79136}My ass feels like it got|caught in a blender.
{79139}{79198}You did good. You only|fell what, four times?
{79200}{79242}Yeah.
{79244}{79322}I have a confession to make.|I used you.
{79324}{79375}I can't afford to|come here all the time.
{79378}{79427}I come but once a month|when I save my pennies.
{79429}{79503}When you asked to go out again,|I didn't really want to, but...
{79506}{79566}I thought, you know-
{79568}{79630}I guess that makes me|a bad person, right?
{79633}{79729}No. I just wanted to make up|for the other night.
{79732}{79827}Did you know I wanted to be a horse|trainer when I was a little girl?
{79829}{79882}No. But I could have guessed.
{79884}{79941}What happened?
{79944}{80026}I had to take care of my sisters, and a|beginning horse trainer doesn't pay big bucks,
{80028}{80111}so I took a job with the city|and another as a waitress.
{80114}{80184}And there you go.|Steady pay checks.
{80186}{80284}So why didn't you go back to it|after your sisters were okay?
{80344}{80415}You know what? Let's do|something you want to do.
{80469}{80517}Anything?
{80552}{80630}Yeah, sure.
{80710}{80787}I have to say, this is exactly|how I thought you'd be living.
{80790}{80837}What, you got something|against pool?
{80840}{80897}No, but a sofa wouldn't|kill you, would it?
{80933}{80980}Uh-uh.
{80982}{81031}Your turn.
{81033}{81111}So how does|a meat delivery man...
{81114}{81186}afford a nice place like this?
{81189}{81242}He struggles and makes do.
{81245}{81307}Did I tell you my boss and I are|going to the mayor's mansion...
{81310}{81371}so we can show him cuts for|a private dinner he's having?
{81374}{81426}You're doing a meat show|for the mayor?
{81428}{81542}Meat presentation. There's a|subtle difference of humiliation.
{81544}{81592}So you never did|answer my question:
{81594}{81676}why you didn't go back into horse training|after your sisters got on their feet?
{81678}{81766}I don't want to talk|about it, okay?
{81768}{81838}It's hard to get to know someone|when they won't talk to you.
{81840}{81903}You know, we're having a really|good time right now, Raymond.
{81905}{81983}Let's just drop it, okay?
{82016}{82073}Did you know...
{82107}{82175}that I was an orphan|just like you and your sisters?
{82177}{82275}My mom gave me up after I was born. I|don't think she even knew who my father was.
{82278}{82348}Yeah, so that explains it,
{82350}{82449}why the idea of staying|in one place scares you so much.
{82452}{82533}Scares me? I said I was a multi|- talented guy that liked to travel.
{82536}{82612}- I didn't say I was scared.|- I read about it.
{82615}{82671}When a child is abandoned,
{82673}{82758}he becomes afraid that his|entire life will fall apart again.
{82803}{82869}I don't think|you should feel bad about it.
{82872}{82935}It's a completely|natural reaction.
{82938}{83024}Okay then. I won't|feel bad about it.
{83060}{83144}What about you?
{83180}{83220}Okay.
{83264}{83338}Our parents died|in a car accident when I was 18.
{83340}{83388}Insurance paid for the house,
{83390}{83503}and we started a bank account|that we called the Dandridge fund.
{83505}{83577}I guess as they grew older,
{83580}{83658}I settled into this cushy|little life I have now.
{83661}{83748}And I didn't wanna go back and chase|dreams of becoming a horse trainer.
{83752}{83831}So I guess if it doesn't kill|you, it makes you stronger, huh?
{83834}{83895}I think what people mean|when they say that...
{83897}{84011}is that you deal with whatever pain that|you have by building a bridge over it...
{84014}{84074}with all the things that life|hasn't taken away from you.
{84077}{84139}So if it doesn't kill you,|it makes you build a bridge.
{84141}{84230}Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I|like that. I'm gonna use that.
{84232}{84263}You should be proud of yourself.
{84266}{84331}No. I'm proud|of my sisters.
{84334}{84452}What about you, Eva? I know|all that devotion cost you.
{84455}{84519}It did.
{84522}{84631}There was this guy,|Lucius Johnson. Lucius.
{84634}{84709}Anyway, he was|our local Mr. Everything.
{84712}{84796}You know. We were young,|but it was serious.
{84799}{84911}We were gonna get married, and Ready for|the World was gonna sing at our wedding.
{84914}{85039}But... he asked me to choose|between him and my sisters.
{85041}{85146}And when I didn't choose him, he|dumped me. Why didn't you choose him?
{85148}{85243}Because my sisters needed me more than|he did, and what I needed didn't matter.
{85247}{85371}So, what about you, Raymond? What has|the tragedy in your life given you?
{85484}{85551}You know!
{85553}{85621}Just cough up the damn money|so I can get goin'.
{85716}{85793}Uh, okay. I didn't mean|to interrupt.
{85796}{85901}- Yeah, you never do, Mike.|- Pay you on the bet later, Mike.
{85904}{85949}No problem, Ray.
{85952}{86006}It's all good, baby.
{86009}{86071}Mike's a lucky pool player.|That I am.
{86074}{86156}Look, I'm gonna let you two|get back to your date.
{86158}{86216}See you later.
{86362}{86439}You know, Mike and his little|buddies are not fooling me.
{86442}{86501}I didn't think so. No.|They set us up, you and me.
{86503}{86570}They want us to date so|I'll stay out of their hair.
{86572}{86681}You might not believe this. They|don't really like me very much.
{86683}{86753}I didn't get that.|Really?
{86798}{86880}So, uh, do you mind that|they set you up with me?
{86937}{87017}Just show me how to|hit the ball straight.
{87019}{87079}You want me to show you how|to hit the ball straight? Yeah.
{87082}{87130}First, hold|the stick straight.
{87132}{87227}That's it. Now slide the|stick between your fingers.
{87304}{87360}Eva never misses our night.
{87363}{87414}Something must|have happened.
{87417}{87511}- Maybe she had an accident.|- Oh, please. Eva would call from the ambulance.
{87555}{87611}- Eva's with Ray.|- What?
{87615}{87702}But... she hates him.|We all agreed.
{87705}{87772}- How do you know that?|- She called me on her cell phone to say that...
{87775}{87834}she and Ray were going|horseback riding.
{87836}{87934}- I guess it went well. -|Horses? Three words: e- rot-ic.
{87936}{88034}Horses make me feel|all tingly.
{88036}{88095}Shut up. Shut up.
{88126}{88173}Oh, my God.
{88206}{88263}Eva has a man.
{89968}{90030}- Hey, guys.|- Eva.
{90034}{90086}Chi-town is calling you.
{90090}{90139}Congratulations, Eva.
{90143}{90228}I don't know what to say.|Um, wow.
{90231}{90290}Can I have some time|to think about it?
{90293}{90396}- Sure, but why? This is a great opportunity.|- I know, I know.
{90399}{90462}A lot's changed in my life|since all this happened.
{90464}{90532}I know how|relocation can be.
{90535}{90598}Take some time.|Thanks.
{90729}{90858}Ray, you are the messiah.
{90860}{90923}I haven't seen Eva|in a week, bro.
{90927}{91002}And Kareenah and I are having baby|talk, my blood pressure's down,
{91005}{91070}and fellas, I do believe|I am growing another penis.
{91072}{91157}Eva's cool because Ray got|her into bed. Right, player?
{91159}{91219}That's right. No, no.|We're just hanging out.
{91222}{91304}- He's modest.|- Now you have to tell her you're moving to another state...
{91307}{91354}so she can get out|of our lives forever.
{91356}{91418}Yeah. Tell her you're going|to somewhere like Delaware.
{91421}{91514}Can't nobody find that shit|on the map. I know I can't.
{91516}{91602}- Do you have to be so gleeful about it?|- What did he say?
{91606}{91665}Hey, Ray, Ray, Ray,|Ray, Ray.
{91669}{91751}- You gotta be tough. You gotta stay strong for all of us.|- Yeah.
{91754}{91834}Men who get away with shit are the|backbones of this here country, Ray.
{91837}{91903}Yeah, life, liberty and|getting away with shit, Ray.
{91953}{92032}Did you know that Eva does charity|work, teaches Bible studies?
{92035}{92126}She loves animals. She|rides this horse named Romeo.
{92129}{92184}He reacts to her|like he understands.
{92187}{92268}We didn't say she was a bad person.|We said she was an irritating person.
{92271}{92326}Yeah, and that horse|is probably retarded, man.
{92329}{92405}- I'm just saying-|- Just saying what, Ray?
{92408}{92479}We had a deal, Ray.
{92482}{92575}- Remember your motto?|Player first- - Women second.
{92577}{92645}- Now, are you the man or what, Ray?|- Come on, Ray.
{92647}{92717}You're not hearing me.|Are you the man or what, Ray?
{92755}{92816}- You know I'm your man.|- Yeah! All right!
{92819}{92880}That's a player.|I wasn't worried.
{92883}{92942}That's my money working|right there.
{93747}{93801}Eva, you flying solo|tonight?
{93803}{93923}Yeah, my boyfriend Ray had some|kind of inventory thing tonight, so-
{93926}{93989}So you given any thought|to the offer?
{93991}{94045}I'm still thinking|about it, sir.
{94048}{94150}Don't let me rush you, Eva.|We do have a small window here.
{94153}{94223}I'll keep that in mind.|Thanks.
{94226}{94287}Excuse me.
{94479}{94526}Hi.
{94528}{94582}Um, let me get a white wine|spritzer, please.
{94584}{94633}You got it.
{94661}{94719}Eva. Eva Dandridge?
{94722}{94830}- Lucius?|- I thought that was you. How you been?
{94834}{94926}I'm fine, Lucius.|It's nice to see you again.
{94928}{94984}I want you to meet somebody.
{94987}{95066}My wife, Renee.|Baby, this is Eva.
{95069}{95185}- The one I told you about.|- Oh, the love of his life.
{95187}{95270}I've heard so much about you.|I hate you.
{95272}{95382}Yeah, Eva and I were engaged after|high school, but it didn't work out.
{95385}{95486}- You dumped me, Lucius.|- Right. Didn't you have to go work for your baby sisters?
{95489}{95537}Eva,you broke|Lucius's heart.
{95539}{95620}Thank God you did though. Or|else I never would have got him.
{95669}{95717}These are our kids.
{95720}{95799}They're cute.|Real cute.
{95802}{95907}I'm assistant to the mayor now.|Hired me right out of General Motors.
{95910}{95973}At a very generous salary.
{95975}{96069}- So, Eva, what is it that you do?|- I'm a health inspector.
{96130}{96218}Great. So you go look at dirty|kitchens and public restrooms...
{96220}{96263}and stufflike that?
{96266}{96334}- Sounds fascinating, girl.|- It pays the bills, yeah.
{96337}{96407}So where's your date?
{96411}{96469}He's running late.
{96471}{96519}Sorry, baby. I had that thing.
{96521}{96582}You okay?|Yeah.
{96586}{96633}Hi. Ray Adams.
{96635}{96726}How you doing, man? Lucius|Johnson. My wife, Renee. Hello.
{96729}{96804}Lucius. Heard a lot about you.
{96807}{96856}- So how long you two been going out?|- Not long.
{96859}{96947}I was in Africa on business. The city|is trading with the brothers over there.
{96950}{97004}I came all the way back|to escort Eva.
{97062}{97154}I had no idea the city of Los|Angeles was a trade partner in Africa.
{97156}{97260}You wouldn't. It's on the|highest levels of city government.
{97263}{97341}Really? Well, let's hear all|about this so-called trade program.
{97343}{97446}Ray, shush. It's fun|time now. Mr. Mayor!
{97479}{97525}Hey.
{97527}{97599}Ray, how is my main man?|Good, sir. Good, good.
{97602}{97649}Good to see you.|This is my date, Eva.
{97651}{97715}So this is Eva?
{97718}{97778}Ray, you didn't|do her justice.
{97808}{97846}Thank you, sir.
{97983}{98124}- And this is, uh, Lumpy and Reeses.|- Lucius and Renee, sir.
{98127}{98194}I'm one of your new assistants and I thought that|- Ray.
{98197}{98264}I want you to bring this beautiful|young lady up to the house sometime.
{98267}{98314}Will do, sir.|Great to meet you.
{98316}{98382}Nice to meet you too.|Thank you, sir. Thank you.
{98436}{98495}Ray, my man.|I'm sorry about that-
{98497}{98575}You can have a rain check|on kissing my ass, Leo.
{98578}{98660}I have to dance|with the prettiest girl here.
{98663}{98733}Right.|Good seeing you again, Eva.
{98763}{98810}If you don't stop|staring at her,
{98814}{98894}I'm gonna slap the taste|out of your mouth.
{99328}{99442}Was that okay? The question|is, how did you do it?
{99444}{99530}Well, first I got home|from work early,
{99533}{99618}then I watched you from across the|room looking like you wanted to die.
{99622}{99669}Okay. And what|about the mayor?
{99671}{99755}I did a hell of a meat presentation|for him. Remember? That's right.
{99759}{99817}He's a really nice guy.|I only had to beg him once.
{99819}{99895}You know you look good|in that tux, right?
{99898}{99945}Your hair looks fine.
{99947}{100014}Thank you. Bethany did it.|Really?
{100016}{100098}I should go by there one day. No.|Promise me you will not go in there.
{100100}{100156}Okay. Okay.
{100199}{100254}You know, you're a good dancer.
{100288}{100372}You know. Body movement's|my specialty.
{100462}{100505}Smooth.
{100507}{100574}You know, they once banned|dipping in some countries...
{100577}{100647}because it was considered|a form of foreplay.
{100650}{100713}I didn't know that.
{100766}{100837}Okay.
{100839}{100925}You learn something new|every day, huh? Yeah.
{100963}{101014}How long do you|wanna stay here?
{101016}{101086}After watching Lucius grovel,
{101088}{101135}not long.
{101167}{101214}What you wanna do?
{101241}{101289}Something fun.
{101529}{101588}Nice sofa.
{101591}{101660}I bought it just for you.
{101663}{101710}Just a second.|Let me get this off.
{101712}{101783}No, Eva. Don't take|your clothes off.
{101785}{101855}You wanna do it with them on? I'm|into that. Let me hike this up.
{101858}{101950}No. No, no, no, no.|I can't do this.
{101952}{102038}The bulge in your pants|didn't get that memo, so-
{102042}{102111}No, no, no, no. I- I need|to tell you something.
{102114}{102214}Yes. Whatever it is, yes. Yes. No, look.
{102217}{102275}I don't wanna move too fast.
{102278}{102361}Fast? No. The average American couple|has sex on their third date, and...
{102363}{102478}we have been dating way,|way, way longer than that.
{102481}{102528}I just-
{102531}{102587}Look, you've been through|so much stuff with men.
{102589}{102642}And I don't wanna mess things|up. I want it to be perfect.
{102645}{102693}I just think|we should wait a while.
{102734}{102804}I have to respect that,|don't I?
{102807}{102869}Yeah, I guess you do.
{102906}{102957}I have to go.
{102961}{103073}Please, don't be mad at me.|No, I'm not. It's just-
{103076}{103172}I just never had a guy who cared so|much about my feelings. It's kind of-
{103175}{103245}Oooh. It's making me|want you even more.
{103247}{103295}And if I don't leave|right now,
{103298}{103365}I'm gonna start saying all kinds|of hot, nasty, dirty things.
{103367}{103434}How hot and nasty?|Real freaky.
{103437}{103486}Go. Go.|Oh, God. Okay.
{103489}{103582}Stay.|Yeah? Oh, God.
{103609}{103652}No.|Okay.
{103697}{103744}Look-
{104366}{104414}Yes!
{104778}{104832}Oh, my God.
{104834}{104896}Did I hurt you?|Yes.
{104898}{104946}But I liked it.|Yeah?
{104997}{105061}Maybe next time we'll|actually make it to the bed.
{105063}{105140}Oh, my God.|Oh, my God.
{105142}{105207}That was good.
{105210}{105264}Ray,
{105267}{105374}I wanted to say, the stuff I said|before, I just wanted to apologize.
{105377}{105440}I mean, how I acted.
{105442}{105525}That was|a beautiful apology.
{105527}{105601}The best part was when|you called me Ray.
{105603}{105689}That's 'cause there's not a lot of|need to be formal right about now.
{105691}{105753}'Cause I'm a big ho.
{105755}{105802}If you really wanna make|it up to me, tell me a joke.
{105804}{105890}No. I'm not a good joke teller. I'm|terrible. That's what makes it so special.
{105937}{106029}Okay. Oh, God.|Okay. Okay. Okay.
{106033}{106092}Okay. Okay.
{106095}{106168}This guy goes|to a zoo, right?
{106171}{106237}You're gonna like it.|Okay, he goes to a zoo.
{106240}{106324}And he sees this gorilla.|Okay.
{106326}{106433}Okay. And he says to the gorilla, "Yo, brother. Can you give."
{106435}{106516}No. He says,|"Yo, brother. Can you loan-"
{106518}{106568}Yeah. "Yo, brother.|Can you loan me a dollar?"
{106570}{106680}And the gorilla says,|"That's why I don't wear pants."
{106682}{106757}Right.|Oh, my God.
{106759}{106826}Don't you get it?|The pants and the gorilla.
{106830}{106899}Yeah. Best joke|I ever heard.
{106902}{106978}Best joke I ever heard.|I forgot about that joke.
{106981}{107074}Oh, my God.|Oh, my goodness.
{107157}{107218}Ray?|Hmm?
{107221}{107285}Thinking about what you told me|about your parents.
{107287}{107420}God, I mean, my folks died, but I|had my sisters to live for, you know?
{107422}{107473}I just think it might be-
{107476}{107572}it might be easier for you to get|over your fear of building a life...
{107574}{107640}if you had someone there|to help you do it.
{107643}{107701}I see.
{107703}{107750}You wanna be my bridge.
{107753}{107835}It's not like I wanna get|married to you or anything.
{107876}{107961}I can- I can be a really|good friend, that's all.
{108005}{108100}You give me your body, and then|you offer me your friendship?
{108103}{108157}My priorities are straight.|Thank you very much.
{108160}{108244}I'm offering you|the best of me right now.
{108246}{108332}Eva.
{108334}{108405}I'm not the person|you think I am.
{108474}{108576}I know most women think their|man is the one that's different.
{108609}{108661}None of us are different.
{108663}{108725}I'm just like other men.
{108769}{108816}Maybe not as good as most.
{108819}{108894}I want you to think about what it|would take to build a bridge with me.
{108990}{109113}I can handle it, Ray. Okay?|I can handle it.
{109116}{109232}As long as you keep giving|me what I need, I am good.
{109235}{109289}You got all you want?|Yeah.
{109292}{109369}That. That.|A whole lot of that.
{109371}{109444}A lot of that?|A lot of that.
{109446}{109497}And all the other stuff too.
{109556}{109603}You hear me?
{109606}{109676}How can I turn down|a deal like that?
{109708}{109755}You can't.
{109782}{109829}Can you?
{109926}{109976}What's up?
{109978}{110030}Hey, girl. Nice shoes.
{110034}{110090}Ormandy. You look good.
{110093}{110188}Telly, baby,|give me some love.
{110192}{110256}Eva, what has gotten|into you?
{110258}{110336}- Not "what," "who."|- What are you wearing?
{110338}{110405}- Eva, you're glowing.|- What did you do?
{110407}{110464}Shit, I ain't sharing|my "bidness" with you.
{110466}{110565}- Oh, my God. She said "shit. "|- And "bidness."
{110567}{110696}- She gone mad to her ass.|- Y'all need to stop trippin'. I'm just in a good mood.
{110698}{110811}It's a beautiful day out. I'm with my|girls. Stop sweatin' me. My joints is hot.
{110814}{110877}And my cakes is moist.
{110881}{110954}Can a sister get some water, or|a fan or iceberg or something?
{110958}{111052}- Okay, Eva, for real. You're scaring me.|- Did you and Ray do it or not?
{111055}{111102}Well,
{111105}{111164}he did show up|at the mayor's fund- raiser.
{111167}{111283}Just when I was trapped|by Lucius Johnson...
{111286}{111333}and his wife.
{111336}{111396}- You saw Lucius? What did you do?|- Nothing. Ray did it.
{111398}{111453}He put that little sucker|in his place.
{111455}{111521}Excuse me, is there|like some, um, boning...
{111523}{111601}or salad tossing or something|in this story? Stop it.
{111604}{111705}Come on.|Okay. After he rescued me,
{111708}{111778}we danced all night long.
{111781}{111842}Slow, close,
{111845}{111898}just pelvis to pelvis.
{111931}{111975}And then we went back|to my place...
{111978}{112040}and had a nice|respectable evening.
{112081}{112133}And then we burned|a hole in the floor!
{112238}{112329}Wow. There's my baby.|Let's get freaky- deaky.
{112331}{112382}Come on, to the bedroom.|Follow me.
{112385}{112471}You know what Eva told me?|Here we go.
{112474}{112571}She told me that Ray drives his|old van from his job to save money.
{112574}{112637}So what? I mean, what's that|got to do with freaky-deaky?
{112639}{112703}I don't feel like|I sacrifice like Ray does.
{112706}{112780}You know, when I need to get|back into being focused on school.
{112782}{112881}Look. First off, Ray and|Eva, they ain't you and me.
{112884}{112928}I know that.|They're not married.
{112930}{113007}They ain't phone-boning. They're|not having sex. None of that.
{113010}{113061}Actually, they do have sex.
{113064}{113132}He hit that?|Mm-hmm.
{113134}{113192}And from what I hear,
{113195}{113277}you could take a little lesson|from him in that department.
{113330}{113377}What the-
{113380}{113449}What's that supposed to mean?|He got some tricks and shit?
{113452}{113506}I seen the dude|lickin' his lips and stuff.
{113509}{113612}Come on, sexy. Let's play doctor.|Tim, listen to me, all right?
{113614}{113693}I have been thinking a lot|about Ray and Eva.
{113695}{113759}And how they have this wonderful|new relationship, right?
{113762}{113833}And it's made me think about myself|and the plan that I had for my life...
{113835}{113882}and how I let it go.
{113885}{113964}What? But, baby,|I threw all my condoms out.
{113966}{114009}Honey.|Ohh.
{114012}{114072}I'll get you some more.|They're on sale at Target.
{114076}{114123}Come on, Kareenah!|Sweetie, listen.
{114126}{114219}I am ready. Baby, I am so damn fertile|that if you kiss me you'll get pregnant.
{114222}{114281}This isn't like buying a coat.|If you have a baby,
{114283}{114340}you can't give it back|if you don't want it.
{114385}{114459}Who said that, Ray or|Eva? I don't remember.
{114504}{114564}Honey, why is my potpourri|on the bed?
{114566}{114614}See-|Get the DustBuster.
{114616}{114685}It was- I was gonna-|It's hot in here.
{114687}{114758}Baby, I thought we've|been through this already.
{114760}{114820}Ray and Eva have a good relationship|and they don't cohabitate.
{114824}{114914}Oh, my God. That's all I've been|hearing lately. Ray and Eva. Ray and Eva.
{114917}{115024}It's not like they're Will|and Jada or George and Weezy.
{115027}{115114}They each have their own place.|They have respect for each other.
{115117}{115212}Ray doesn't even|care about Eva. I paid-
{115215}{115285}I paid close attention to him.|He does not like her.
{115287}{115335}Sure. That's why Ray|calls her every day.
{115338}{115390}That's why they have lunch|together three times a week.
{115393}{115497}That's why Eva's thinking about|passing on a new job to stay. What job?
{115499}{115560}Eva was offered|a new job in Chicago.
{115562}{115620}But she's gonna say no|because she found Ray.
{115623}{115721}- Ain't that a- - But here's|something that'll make you happy.
{115724}{115830}- We're dissolving the Dandridge fund.|- Really? That's great.
{115833}{115885}- Eva's gonna keep it all.|- What?
{115887}{116001}You know. She has a new life, a new man.|She's gonna need that money. Okay, baby.
{116004}{116117}Here's all your stuff. Let|yourself out, okay? Love you.
{117510}{117590}Is there something wrong?
{117593}{117680}I took your advice and convinced|my boss to let me run his company.
{117682}{117734}He told me I could|start next week.
{117737}{117833}He did? That's great.|Congratulations.
{117894}{117964}That's good news, right?
{117966}{118028}Yeah.
{118031}{118090}You made me realize|I can't run from myself.
{118092}{118173}It's like someone gave me|a pair of glasses...
{118176}{118253}that filter out all the foolishness|and stupidity in my life.
{118256}{118324}What have I given you|for that gift, Eva?
{118326}{118403}Nothing.
{118406}{118468}You taught me how to trust again,|Ray. I wouldn't call that nothing.
{118539}{118646}And you've helped me come|to a decision of my own.
{118648}{118706}What?
{118734}{118777}Baby, if you're|gonna be here,
{118851}{118945}then this is exactly|where I wanna be.
{119438}{119510}Crossed the line with|Eva, didn't you, Ray? No.
{119513}{119564}Don't lie, you lyin'|bald- headed son of a bitch.
{119567}{119615}All I did was what|you paid me for.
{119617}{119681}And now that Eva's in a relationship,|our women are even worse.
{119685}{119739}Everything that you do|comes back on us.
{119741}{119796}And Eva's keeping|all the money, Ray.
{119798}{119864}That's not my fault. Like|hell it ain't your fault, Ray!
{119867}{119966}Something's wrong with you, Ray. You've|been having too much damn fun with Eva.
{119969}{120016}You haven't asked for any|expenses lately. Why's that?
{120018}{120078}You pay for the woman.|You must like the woman.
{120081}{120186}That's ridiculous. I'm a player. I'm on|the job. What's in the garment bag, Ray?
{120189}{120269}Nothing. A suit.|I got a promotion at work.
{120272}{120375}A promotion? That is Eva|all the way. No, that's me.
{120377}{120443}Then what the hell is this?|Tupperware.
{120446}{120496}That's Eva's middle name.
{120500}{120558}I just needed|to organize a few things.
{120561}{120620}Organization is Eva's|second middle name.
{120622}{120684}Look, Eva got a job offer|in Chicago.
{120686}{120770}You're gonna dump her. That way, she|has no reason to stay here, get it?
{120773}{120844}Yes. Say "yes," Ray.|She's staying because of me?
{120846}{120933}Uh-uh. She's staying because|you boned her. You boned her!
{120936}{121018}We know all about it, partner. And|that is like stealing from your job.
{121021}{121104}You have embezzled the booty. Now, look.
{121107}{121193}You're gonna call her tomorrow,|and you're gonna tell her it's over.
{121197}{121260}No. He did not just say "no," did he?
{121263}{121369}- No, I said "no."|- Listen, now! Hold up for a second!
{121373}{121440}You're supposed to be a master|player. You forgot the rules.
{121443}{121532}Players don't feel. That's like a|pimp with a health plan, brother.
{121535}{121606}Mike, where did you find|this big-ass bamba, man?
{121609}{121699}You done went from DMX to Babyface|on us, man. What's up with that?
{121701}{121794}Wait. They done gave you|a copy of their theme song.
{121797}{121859}They done made you an|orange. Okay, okay, look.
{121861}{121927}I'm sorry. I do like her,|all right?
{121929}{122031}I had to open my heart to get to her,|and when I did, she got to me first.
{122070}{122134}- I think I might love her.|- Love?
{122137}{122228}Love is an excuse, an alibi,|a justification for sex.
{122230}{122326}But it is not something that should|stop a man from keeping his promise, Ray.
{122329}{122401}Look. I'm sorry, fellas.
{122404}{122461}I'm going to|see Eva tonight,
{122464}{122520}and the least I can do is|tell her in person what I did.
{122523}{122570}So... that's it.
{122613}{122650}What?
{122653}{122717}Come on. Let's go.
{122720}{122767}Mike. Mike!
{122839}{122919}So, is she real good, man? Does|she have some methods that she did?
{122921}{122994}'Cause I'm trying|to getJacqui-
{123317}{123372}Ha!
{123509}{123552}This is bull-
{123621}{123713}Thank you, Thomas.|No problem.
{123716}{123780}I need to get up out of here so y'all|can get back to dissin' us brothers.
{123783}{123859}I know how y'all is.|Excuse us?
{123861}{123914}Aw, man. Y'all females|be trippin', man.
{123917}{123966}Look. First y'all|drive men away,
{123969}{124030}then y'all wanna bitch and moan|when y'all ain't got one.
{124033}{124079}Hold up. Hold up.|Code 12.
{124081}{124165}You know why I complain,|Thomas?
{124168}{124251}- 'Cause I need a real man.|- Here we go.
{124253}{124345}I need a real man,|not a child or a boy.
{124348}{124443}Give me a hard rock, not|a soft little toy. Wow.
{124446}{124559}You think women are hard?|You think we're evil and mean?
{124561}{124643}- Well, I think maybe you don't need us.|- Maybe you on the wrong team.
{124717}{124817}So I need a real man,|and my standards are high.
{124820}{124914}Don't like what you just heard?|Then you need not apply.
{125094}{125178}Wait a second. Fresh meat.
{125181}{125242}Come on.|Leave 'em alone, ladies.
{125245}{125342}Mike. Honey, is something|wrong? I got some bad news.
{125345}{125420}It's, uh- It's about Ray.
{125422}{125491}Ray!|My Ray?
{125648}{125735}What- Is he okay?
{126174}{126257}Some story, huh?|Well, it's not quite complete.
{126259}{126358}We got three hours before the funeral,|fellas. Is all the food and water okay?
{126361}{126438}Everything is okay. Darrell,|where did you find this place?
{126441}{126523}This is an old postal storage|warehouse, but we don't use it anymore,
{126526}{126606}not till now.
{126609}{126693}Look here, Ray. You got everything|you need. You even have two bathrooms.
{126696}{126768}Bucket number one,|and bucket number two.
{126771}{126870}You'll be a little gamey in a|few days, but you'll be alive.
{126873}{126950}This won't work. Oh, yes|it will, baby muscles.
{126953}{127058}See, you've died in a car accident|according to this police report.
{127061}{127108}Show him. Right here.|Yeah, yeah.
{127110}{127183}Eva needed to know that your|body was immediately cremated.
{127185}{127256}What about my family? Did you|think about that, smart guys?
{127258}{127363}You ain't got no relatives, Ray, and very|little friends, thanks to your job-hopping.
{127365}{127478}And Eva took that job in Chi-town|after she found out you were dead.
{127481}{127539}It's not fair for you to|make her leave under a lie.
{127541}{127634}It wasn't fair for you|to screw us on that deal.
{127637}{127725}No, Ray. Let him go.|Let him go!
{127757}{127820}Come on. Fellas,|fellas, fellas, listen.
{127822}{127918}Listen. Maybe we need to just think|about this for one minute, all right?
{127921}{127992}No, you think about this.|It's our word against his.
{127994}{128075}By the time he tells Eva the|truth, she'll be long gone.
{128077}{128199}And then we can say we didn't know anything|about this sick joke that he played on her.
{128201}{128257}What the hell are you doing|falling in love with Eva?
{128260}{128348}I think it's 'cause she got some good booty,|man. See all that aggression he got in him?
{128351}{128431}That's 'cause he ain't|gettin' none. Let's go.
{128434}{128484}Come on, Tim.
{128488}{128539}Tim, come on!
{128616}{128714}First of all, I'd like to thank|all of you for coming today.
{128717}{128810}You know, Ray and I didn't|really know each other very long,
{128813}{128909}but... in that short amount|of time,
{128939}{129006}we became really close.
{129009}{129111}You know, when someone|enters your life,you-
{129113}{129163}you don't really know|how it changes you...
{129197}{129244}until they're gone.
{129246}{129306}I thought you said this was|gonna be a simple funeral.
{129309}{129357}Who are all these people?
{129359}{129418}Eva. She invited|all her friends from work.
{129421}{129474}Where the hell does|Eva work at, Soul Train?
{129477}{129531}Look at all these black|people in here. It's packed.
{129533}{129608}Look.Just hang in there.|It's gonna be okay. I promise.
{129636}{129695}I've, uh,
{129698}{129788}invited my friend Valerie|from my church choir...
{129809}{129862}to sing a song.
{131864}{131905}Eva!
{132029}{132072}Lord, it's a miracle.
{132174}{132253}Oh, my God. Baby.
{132256}{132351}What happened? Oh, my God.
{132353}{132441}This whole thing was a lie.|It's all a lie.
{132445}{132554}No, I wasn't in on this, okay?|Y'all did this on your own.
{132669}{132768}Tim, Mike and Darrell...|faked my death...
{132797}{132852}so that you'd leave town.|That's a lie!
{132854}{132960}Eva, he wanted to dump you, but he didn't|have the guts to tell you face-to-face.
{132962}{133018}That's what happened. Mm-hmm. Ray?
{133057}{133114}Is that true?
{133141}{133211}No, it isn't.|Don't, Tim!
{133214}{133264}- Please!|- It's over.
{133268}{133355}Eva, we did take Ray.
{133403}{133448}And we lied about him|being dead.
{133451}{133576}This is the best funeral I've ever|been to in my life. You got that right.
{133578}{133629}I'm sorry.
{133632}{133696}It's not their fault.|Like hell it isn't.
{133698}{133760}You three...
{133762}{133829}have yet to feel my rage.
{133832}{133891}Eva,you don't understand.
{133921}{133969}It's because of me.
{133972}{134051}The only reason|I went out with you...
{134054}{134119}is because they paid me to.
{134201}{134294}I was supposed to...|make you like me,
{134297}{134356}then trick you|into moving away.
{134359}{134412}But I didn't know you then.
{134414}{134516}I didn't realize|how wonderful you are.
{134519}{134591}How much you changed me,|make me wanna change.
{134633}{134708}I know I was wrong,|but...
{134711}{134775}what we have is bigger|than all the mistakes I've made.
{134777}{134837}I'm certain of that.
{134883}{134935}How much did they pay you?
{135010}{135064}Eva, that's not-|How much?
{135161}{135213}Five thousand dollars.
{135216}{135309}But, Eva, I'm giving them|that money back, and I promise-
{135368}{135441}Oooh!
{135476}{135561}You are exactly|who I thought you were.
{135796}{135909}So, I guess|you're single now, huh?
{135912}{135960}Excuse me.
{136788}{136833}Police!
{136836}{136893}Eva, please. Let me|have a minute. Stalker!
{136896}{137005}Sixty seconds, Eva. Okay,|okay, one minute. Go, Raymond.
{137008}{137092}Raymond? How did I get all|the way back to Raymond? Right.
{137095}{137144}I don't want you|to stop being mad.
{137147}{137199}I understand how you feel.
{137202}{137273}I'm upset, too,|at myself.
{137276}{137381}But we need to remember what we're|losing here. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
{137384}{137431}I know you still have|feelings for me.
{137434}{137505}I have feelings for you.
{137508}{137614}Life is hard, Eva. We both|passed up on a lot of good things.
{137617}{137685}We are too wise|for that now.
{137688}{137802}I am never, ever gonna find|another woman like you.
{137848}{137915}I love you.
{138025}{138074}You know what I learned|about love, Raymond?
{138078}{138139}It isn't a virus that|infects you. It's a choice.
{138143}{138266}We choose to be in love, and|we choose what love makes us do.
{138268}{138359}I earned your choice,|and you stole mine.
{138408}{138467}I was ready to give up|my entire life for you,
{138469}{138546}and all you were|ready to do was let me.
{138548}{138603}So are you sure?
{138605}{138658}Are you sure you love me?
{138660}{138717}Or are you just upset that...
{138720}{138767}I found out what you were...
{138769}{138863}and... made a different choice?
{138984}{139079}That's what I thought.|Excuse me, I have travel plans.
{139153}{139202}What's up, fellas?
{139248}{139335}Eva, you don't|have to rub it in.
{139338}{139465}We've been trying to apologize to your|sisters for weeks. They still hate us.
{139468}{139535}My sisters love you.
{139580}{139661}They love you so much.
{139664}{139802}I was just a distraction|and a huge pain in the ass.
{139804}{139860}And I am so sorry.
{139907}{139975}We dissolved the Dandridge fund|and split it up yesterday.
{140329}{140406}Let's go home.|Let's get out of here.
{140409}{140463}And I can read you a book.
{140466}{140529}Yeah. As long as|it's not a scary book.
{140532}{140595}I don't like scary books.
{140700}{140781}Maybe we could have|some, uh- some make-up sex.
{140784}{140849}Don't worry.|I have plenty of protection.
{140892}{140947}We don't need it.
{141124}{141223}I wanna do this right now|before I lose my nerve.
{141308}{141351}What are you doing?
{141353}{141475}Oh, my God. Oh, my God!|Oh, my God.
{141477}{141535}Will you?|Yes.
{141645}{141698}Congratulations.
{141700}{141774}You know what? We should all go to dinner. Eva, let's|- Yeah.
{142328}{142377}Holy mother of God.
{142446}{142491}Hey, Eva!
{142655}{142707}Whoa. Whoa.
{142972}{143031}I quit my job, sold my|house and bought him.
{143033}{143118}You shouldn't have.|I can't be bought.
{143120}{143213}I got him a home in a stable just|outside of town. It's paid up for a year.
{143216}{143283}Are you even|listening to me?
{143285}{143345}Yes. Now you listen to me.
{143348}{143421}You said love is a|choice. Well, I love you.
{143424}{143521}And I'm not leaving. I'm gonna|show up at your job every day.
{143524}{143572}I'm gonna send you gifts,|and tell you I'm sorry...
{143575}{143681}until you understand that|I will not live without you.
{143684}{143759}Or until you call|the cops on me, but...
{143762}{143820}even that won't stop me.
{143873}{143921}Excuse me, ma'am.|Is this your animal?
{144064}{144123}Yes, Officer.|This is my horse.
{144165}{144219}My horse.
{144409}{144467}You're gonna have|to move him off the street.
{144749}{144798}Will you buy|a horse for me?
{144800}{144886}No.
{150820}{150870}Hello, is Linda there?
{150898}{150938}Hey, babe.
{150941}{150995}Listen, I'll pick you up|over on Fairfax.
{151036}{151083}I'm at work.
{151085}{151161}No, you know you can't come by.
{151163}{151221}I'm pretending to be gay.
{151224}{151342}Because in L.A., a straight hairdresser|is an unemployed hairdresser.
{151345}{151399}Well, at least|until I get my own place.
{151426}{151495}Absolutely.|Okay, I love you too.
{151497}{151572}Telly, honey. Would it kill you|to come in there and do some work?
{151575}{151675}Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to check|on my honey. You know how they are.
In a world where the messengers of truth... the couriers of justice, bra vely go forth... to complete their appointed routes...
Your mission... complete paper route in 30 minutes.
One lone hero stands out among the rest.
One fearless rider has the fortitude... to deliver the goods.
To stand up to the forces of darkness... the legions of doom, the armies of oppression... and the evil Ice Cream Man.
Paperboy.
Welcome to the ice age, paperboy!.
/ I scream, you scream /
We all scream for ice cream!
Oh, nuts!
I forgot the sprinkles!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hey, Max.
Ohh!
A Tony Hawk sundae!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, that Ice Cream Man sure is evil.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Huh!
Hah!
I will defeat you... with my complicated fighting move.
We shall see whose kung fu is superior. Hyah!
Yah!
Ohh.
Yah! Paperboy power!
Aah!
Ha.
Didn't hurt!
You can run, but you can't hide, paperboy!.
/ Everywhere /
/ Gonna do everything /
/ Gonna do my best to reach your sky /
/ 'Cause I don't care /
Whoo-hoo!
Huh?
Yeah!
Paper?
What took you so long?
I stopped for some ice cream.
Aah!
Get out of bed, jabrodie.
Get out of bed-Ow!
Heh.
OK, I dreamed it.
So maybe my life really isn't like that.
And maybe I'm not the coolest kid ever.
But today was the first day of junior high... and I was sure that things were gonna be different.
Ya-ha-ha!
I had a new look.
I was a baller, a shot-caller.
I was a player with phat attitude.
Or, as I like to call it...
Phat-itude.
Hi, Mom.
It's finished.
The house is perfect.
Just as
I'd always pictured it.
But let's keep that between you and me.
Meet my mom.
She's been putting the "finishing touches"... on our house for, like, six years.
You could say she's a bit obsessed.
This is my house.
My kitchen! Mine!
Morning.
This is my dad.
He works in advertising.
His boss, Mr. Foge, makes him wear goofy costumes sometimes.
Luckily, he's got us for support.
What is that?
Heh.
I'm Lieutenant Lobster.
For the Lobster Shack pitch today?
Do you really have to wear that?
Lily, come on.
Foge has got a dozen junior ad execs... lined up who'd be happy to be
Lieutenant Lobster.
Foged again.
But just for this pitch.
I better be off.
Off to junior high... my little soldier all grown up.
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Don't break anything.
- OK, Mom.
Hey, Max?
You want a ride?
Um... that's OK.
I'll take the bus.
Yeah, the bus. Right.
You know that kid everyone thinks is weird... but he doesn't care what everyone thinks?
This is him.
He's my best friend.
His name's Robert, but we call him Robe.
Guess why?
Hey, you guys!
This is my other best friend.
Her name's Megan.
She never goes anywhere without her clarinet...
Aah! Oh!
Even when she takes a trip.
You OK?
Y eah, I'm tough like a tank.
Yeah, the septic tank.
Says the freak in the robe that smells like diapers.
Max, where's your bassoon?
Um... My bassoon...
I thought we were taking band together.
I've been thinking.
It's junior high.
Is band still cool?
Cool?
What are you talking about?
Since when have we been cool?
All I'm saying is, let's try to act cool.
Sweet! A can.
Mmm.
- Blech!
- Eww!
/ Today /
/ I changed /
/ But too late /
/ 'Cause every town feels the same /
/ I'm different /
/ And you're distant /
/ Add it up and it makes no difference /
For the yearbook.
How's this?
"Sheep arrive for slaughter"?
No, no, no!
Please!. Please!.
Don't make me go!
I don't want to go!
Does he know something we don't?
Here they come.
With their pimples and their braces... and their rickets and their lice.
Their snot-nosed, baggy-pantsed... high-pitched, squealing voices.
And yet, each one a rung on the ladder of my success.
A ladder that ends in a vast neon sign... that stretches across the night sky.
Principal Jindraike?
These came from your real-estate agent.
The sign, Mrs. Rangoon.
What does it say?
"Superintendent Jindraike. "
The sign on my office door.
That's what it should say.
Sounds so much better than
"Superintendent Knebworth. "
It's classier, too.
When Knebworth sees what I've done in his honor... the old dinosaur is sure to make me his successor.
But, first things first,
Mrs. Rangoon.
Set up the video broadcast machine device.
I want to address the acne-strafed masses.
Ooh-Aah!
Ow!
Curtis Junior High has a long... and fascinating history of colorful bullies.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
In 1985, Tomato-face Callahan.
He'd walk right up and shove a tomato in your face.
1991, Wedgie Jackson.
He invented the world wide wedge.
Which brings us to this year.
Troy McGinty.
Word is, he's gonna pound... on a different kid every day.
And he's devised his own special way... of letting the world know who he's coming after.
Max Keeble?
Here.
All right.
Julius Klinghoffer.
- Here.
- All right.
Lil' Romeo?
Yo, whuzzup?
I'm over here, wo dat.
OK.
Lil' Romeo's in the house.
I'm down with that.
Tina Michaels?
And now...
This is Principal Jindraike.
All students will report to the assembly hall... during third period for a special presentation.
Attendance is mandatory.
All must attend.
Not attending is prohibited.
That is all. Thank you.
Yes! The reviews are in.
Ha! Jindraike, two thumbs up.
I laughed, I cried.
The man's a genius.
- Principal Jindraike!
- What now, Rangoon?
The red light's still on.
I'm well aware of that.
Didn't even notice!
Good morning.
I'm Ms. Dingman, and welcome to Life Science.
You OK?
I can't feel my fingers.
...like this.
Pheromones.
Nature's dating service.
Odorless, colorless.
It's how many species attract mates.
A chemical process which causes... an irresistible attraction... in the opposite sex.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Would someone like to open the window for me, please?
You in the robe.
Aww.
Wow, that's cool!
You see? Irresistible.
/ Oh, baby, baby /
/ Eh, eh /
Are you OK?
Yeah! Yeah.
I'm fine.
You look kind of familiar.
I deliver your paper.
I'm Max, Jenna.
Oh, yeah.
You go to school here now?
You play the clarinet.
First chair.
I'm in band, too.
I play the bassoon.
Hmm. Well, I'll see you later.
I'll see you bassoon.
See you bassoon?
Ecch! Stupid!
Max Keeble.
Troy!
Troy McGinty, how are you?
First victim of the year there, buddy.
It's a big honor.
Know the guy you hung out with when you were little... but as you got older you went in opposite directions?
Troy McGinty wasn't always a bully.
I remember when he came to my fourth birthday.
The theme was
MacGoogles the Frog.
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ It's time to play a game /
/ With your favorite
Highland frog /
I don't like MacGoogles!
He's not real, Troy.
He's just a TV character.
Is there a wee laddie having his birthday today?
MacGoogles!
He's trying to eat me!
Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.
Troy, it's me, Mr. Keeble.
MacGoogles ate Max's daddy!
Aah!
Troy had grown a lot since then.
Whoa! What are you doing?
Where's Max?
I don't know.
Wasn't it your turn to watch him?
McGINTY:
Welcome to cooking with Troy.
First, you want to dip your little piece of chicken... in a nice, thick batter.
No. Troy, no!
- Hold it! Stop!
- OK, we're set.
Yaah!
No! Troy!
Aah!
Now you want to roll your piece of dead meat... in some bread crumbs.
Perfect.
And now that that's done... our bird should be ready to go in.
Aah!
Oh, gross! Ecch!
Hope you like lasagna.
Settle down.
Cease!
This Thursday,
Superintendent Knebworth... will be here to inspect the school.
And so I am upgrading my policy ofzero tolerance... to one of sub-zero tolerance.
Which is more than zero.
Cease!
And now, without any further ado... what's that I hear?
The pitter-patter of little feet?
Allow me to introduce to you the newest addition... to the Curtis Junior
High School Cottontails- three foreign exchange students from eastern Europe... and their names are... unimportant, because they're here... to lead us to gridiron glory.
Why, all they need is a place to play.
Students, I give you your new football stadium.
Ooh-yah!
Ha!
Eww!
You, there! Little boy!
Prankster!
What is your name?
Uh, Max Keeble.
I've got my eye on you,
Max Keeble.
You're on my list.
- It wasn't my-
- Sit!
Heh heh heh.
This is a bad junior high.
I can't believe what McGinty did to you.
Mr. Jindraike says if someone tries... to start a fight with you, just ignore them.
Ew! Robe! Ew!
Max, you can't go through the rest of the day like that.
I don't plan on it.
Where's he going?
How great.
/ Hey baby, hey baby /
/ Yeah baby, yeah baby /
/ Hey baby /
Cool.
Hey, man, you got any spare air?
/ Yeah, baby /
/ Yeah baby /
Whoo!
He calls his victims
"Investors"?
He's got all the latest technology... and he's looking to make a killing... in the stock market.
M- m-m-marching call!
/ You know the fella's good for the moola /
This guy, Dobbs, was once a stock-market whiz kid.
By age 10, he was a millionaire.
15. Meeting with Keeble.
Keeble.
By age 12, he'd lost it all.
Now he's obsessed with getting it back... one kid at a time.
Keeble!
Caught your act in the assembly.
Looks like you can use some help... with managing your portfolio.
That's my lunch money!
And you have it all in cash.
Kid, let me hold this for a while... and I'll set you up with a nice mutual fund.
What's going on here?
He's taking Max's lu-lunch money.
Is this true, Mr. Dobbs?
No. I'm just spreading some investment wisdom.
Speaking of which... how did Biomorph Systems work out for you?
Heh heh.
Best money I ever spent.
By the way, what do you think of Handspring?
Handspring?
It's moving today. I'd say buy.
- Thanks.
- No prob.
Uh...
Don't miss me. Ha!
Excuse me!
Anybody want my carrots?
What?
Keeble!
You may be under the impression... that I encourage horseplay and malarkey.
I don't encourage it.
I excourage it.
Excourage?
It means the opposite of encourage.
Look it up.
Elliot!
And so, young man, remember...
"Study" rhymes with "Buddy. "
Scram.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
I thought you said band wasn't cool enough for you.
Yeah, but I thought it over... and I've decided that band is pretty...
Hot.
Excuse me.
What?
What are you doing sitting in my seat?
Does it say your name on it or something?
Yes.
So, if you don't mind, shoo-shoo. Let's go.
Can you believe her?
- Hi, Jenna.
- Hey.
Welcome, everyone.
Settle, please.
I should tell you right away... you'll notice that we are a bit cramped in here... thanks to some temporary storage foisted on us... by someone who has absolutely no appreciation... of what we do in here.
Now, if you'll go to the beginning of the piece...
Can I help you football guys?
Yes, please.
Careful!
Jindraike. I'd like to-
/ Standin' here lookin' out on the world /
/ For a second nobody's lookin'back at me /
/ I never even notice where they go /
/ The sun is shining down and /
/ There's no one else around now /
/ Wish you were here to hear me say /
/ This is gonna be /
/ My greatest day /
/ How far would I go /
/ Just to hear everybody say /
/ This is gonna be /
/ My greatest day /
Hey, Tad. Did you miss me?
This is Tad.
He totally rules the animal shelter.
I helped nurse him when he was a baby chimp... and we've been buds ever since.
Hey, Max!
Hi, Marley. What's up?
Could you do me a favor and feed the goat?
Sure. What's going on?
Didn't you hear?
We're closing down.
Some creep bought up the property... and canceled our lease.
What's gonna happen to the animals?
We're doing the best we can to find homes for them... but we only got until the end of the week.
It's messed up, I know.
It's real messed up.
I couldn't believe it.
Something had to be done, but what?
I thought maybe my parents might have an idea.
They did.
We're moving?!
Yeah.
Foge wants me to head up the new division.
I can't believe this. When?
- Friday.
- This Friday?
Man, this is totally unfair!
I mean, my life is here, my friends are here.
We know that, Max.
But you'll make plenty of new friends in Chicago.
Chicago?!
This was gonna be my year.
Here.
Sweetie, we know this is hard on you.
It's hard on all of us.
Well, then I have a great, great idea.
Let's not go.
Foge is my boss.
He's counting on me.
Can't you just say no?
No. It's not that simple.
This bites.
He'll be fine.
But, Max,
Chicago's 1,000 miles away.
Better tell your parents to watch out for carjackers.
These guys'll just come up to you... at stoplights and take your car away.
I saw it on "20/20."
That's why they call it the Motor City.
Maybe you could hire a lawyer and legally emancipate yourself.
You can stay with me.
I'll ask my mom.
My dad'll give you a job here at the junkyard.
You know what?
Nice try, guys.
You know what?
Face it, I've been foged.
Ugh.
We meet again, paperboy.
OK.
Evil Ice Cream Man, me.
You're wondering why, right?
Ohh!
I once found a cockroach in my snow cone.
My mom called the health department... and he got nailed.
He's been trying to nail me ever since.
Drat! The fuzz!
This isn't over, paperboy!
Hello, officer.
Snow doodle?
Hey, look, it's dumpster boy.
It's Rinky Stinko, the garbage kid.
Ha, Rinky Stinko.
He just made that up.
Now, that's good.
Hey, Max, check it out.
I made some flyers to help save the animal shelter.
I thought you and I could put them up around school.
Why bother?
A flyer's not gonna make any difference.
He didn't mean that.
Cover me. I'm going in.
Aaah.
He moves, he fakes.
Rangoon, think fast.
Nice hands.
Now, pick up the ball... and put it in the case.
It's from Knebworth's
City Championship game.
I'm going on my walkabout.
Mrs. Rangoon, what's this?
Some of the kids are trying to save... the animal shelter down the street.
Kids? What kids?
The ones with the sense of caring and civic duty.
You there. Cease!
What is the meaning of this?
Hey, I didn't do that.
So you want to save the filthy little beasts, eh?
Perhaps you want me to give the animals my car?
Do you want me to give my car to the smelly goat?
Goats don't drive, sir.
I don't care what you want me to do.
The smelly goat will never get my car.
Ever.
The animals have nowhere to go.
Some creep's closing down the shelter.
I'm closing down the shelter, silly boy.
What?
All I need now is the right bulldozer.
I'm thinking big and yellow.
Where did you think
I was going to build...
Knebworth stadium, in your house? Ha ha.
Your house. That's rich.
There wouldn't be room.
Whoa.
/ Better watch out for the king of the hill /
/ He's really bad and totally chill /
/ Better watch out for the king of the hill /
Freak with robe?
All right, guys.
Hit the showers.
Come on, ladies.
Hello, freak.
Let me out!
Come on, let me out!
What's going on, huh?
McGinty's latest victim.
You gotta check this out.
Ha ha ha.
Let me out! Come on!
Let me out!
Come on, let me out.
- All right, OK.
- Come on, Max.
OK. It's OK.
He's a little claustrophobic, so he might...
Hurl.
What a waste of a perfectly good chili omelet.
Let me check the latest rates.
That's $3.00 for number one... and $5.00 for number two.
I have a bladder problem.
Sorry to hear it.
- Keeble.
- Get off me!
I worked really hard on that display.
Excuse me. New customers.
Can I help you, gentlemen?
- No, thanks.
- Keeble, shut up.
How much for a swirlie?
Take stall number 4.
No, no. Come on, Troy.
- No charge.
- Thanks, man.
Can we talk about this?
I'm gonna get my hair wet.
Come on, Troy!
Ow! Come on!
Water.
A recurring geographical feature which allows... a civilized society to develop.
For example, rivers, springs...
Mr. Keeble?
You're tardy, and you're dripping.
I have rules against both.
Now, class, another feature which allows... a civilized society to develop is a code of rules.
Without rules, society would completely collapse.
Do you agree with that statement, Mr. Keeble?
I guess so.
I guess you'll write me a 2,000-word essay... on the subject.
That's not fair!
Which I will look forward to seeing on my desk... drip-dry Friday!
This Friday?
This Friday!
Wait.
Friday was the day
I was moving... and this teacher was mean.
She let Dobbs steal my money.
She wanted to punish me when it wasn't my fault.
But if I wasn't gonna be here... what could she really do to me, right?
It was time to take a stand.
How come I can't do the essay right now?
Now, class...
Mmm. That's good.
A civilized society does need a set of rules.
Otherwise, people could do this.
Oops.
Did I say 2,000 words?
Make that 4,000!
Or... this.
Make that 8,000 words, and take your seat now!
8,000 words?
That's kid stuff.
How about 12,000 words?
Do I hear 12,000 words, ladies and gentlemen?
12,000 words!
Sold! For 12,000 words!
Get off my desk!
Okee-day.
Ohhh.
You're in serious trouble,
Mr. Keeble.
/ Yeah /
See ya.
Hello, sweetheart.
No consequences.
I could do anything
I wanted.
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?
If you're ever in the windy city... look me up.
Anything.
And now, all the people who had tried to run us down... mess us up, push us around... were in for a real surprise.
Told you it was gonna happen sooner or later.
Didn't I?
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
/ Wait, see /
/ I do whatever moves me /
I'm closing down the shelter.
Pheromones- nature's dating service.
I keep my money in a piggy bank.
It just looks like you.
After all, I had to do something about the bullies.
All I needed was a little bit of help.
Because
I'm outta here in 2 days.
Don't you see?
This isn't just a plan.
It's-it's a planetarium.
Look, I'm gonna be the one they come after... but I'm not gonna be here... and that is the beauty of it.
I mean, you guys won't even know what I'm up to.
All you have to do is help me out.
And we'll have- what do you call it?
Plausible deniability.
Did you just make that up?
So we all down for the cause?
One question.
Can't we just have a going-away party instead?
We will, a huge blowout... when this is over.
So?
Marching call!
/ You know a fella's good for the moola /
Looks like somebody froze your assets, man.
Let's see what we can do about that.
Hey!
Step off, capitalist tool.
Man, why don't you go get a real job, fool?
I told you, their lunch money is mine, vendor.
Ha ha ha.
Yeah, that's right.
Trading hours are over.
Aah-Ohh!
Hello, Vladimir.
Aah!

And let me just remind... the citizens of Curtis Junior High... that we are now
T- minus... several hours... until the
Superintendent Knebworth visit.
That is all. Thank you.
I'm a walrus, hey.
The camera's still on!
OK.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I know.
It's just that we have to be... very careful with the lab equipment.
Our budget is very tight... thanks to the new football program.
45 cents. Cool.
Let's check my grosses today.
Where's my handheld?
Hey, mister, my Fudgsicle's melting!
Oh, it's supposed to be melting.
People pay extra for that.
Now, beat it!
All of you, beat it!
The heat is on!
Fartknocker!
Evil Ice Cream Man's going down.
How great.
I sure am gonna miss you guys.
I guess you'll make new friends in Chicago.
Right, Max?
I guess so. I don't know.
I never really thought about it.
Hey, maybe you'll meet kids... exactly like us in every way.
You know, like clones.
Yeah. Maybe I will.
Well, there's still your going-away party.
There's gonna be a cake and everything.
- I baked it.
- Yeah, don't forget.
Tomorrow,
4:00, House of Robe.
I'm providing the ice cream.
What's going on?!
It's melting!
Hey, Max?
What are you doing?
Stuff.
Getting ready for the big move kind of stuff?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry we sprung this on you, Max... but it was sort of sprung on me the same way.
Uh-huh.
OK. Tsk.
What if I didn't take the job?
What then? A home... the food we eat, the clothes you wear- that takes a lot of money.
I just can't see why we can't stay.
Well, sometimes in life... you gotta do things that you don't want to do... because other people who have power over you... tell you to do them.
No, Dad, I mean, if you rise up... and-and show that you're not afraid... those people will no longer have control over your life.
What have you done with Max?
Who are you? Really?
Good night, kiddo.
See ya.
Unhh.
Ohh.
The window was open.
Whoa!
Robe.
The computer.
I'll get the breath spray.
Nature's dating service.
Whoa.
- What?
- Check it out.
Jindraike's using all the school's money... to build his stupid football stadium.
We can't let him get away with that.
Now his breath'll be pheromone fresh.
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
Here you go.
And now we add a little decoration.
Whoa!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Ow! Ow!
Robe!
Come on, man! Let's go!
Yeah, I'm trying.
Morning, Mom.
Hi, sweetie.
Whatcha doing?
You know, you just start out... by trying to pack everything really fast... and then you get caught up in all this old stuff.
Remember how the kitchen looked... when we first moved in?
Before it was perfect?
Not really. I was four.
Right. Mmm.
Sorry about the short notice, Max.
You having to leave your friends and everything.
Ah, it's OK.
At first,
I was really bummed out... but not everything's bad about moving.
That's what your father keeps saying.
I hope you're both right.
Troy McGinty?
How about that?
OK, no,
I won't do that anymore.
I promise. I promise.
Ohh. I lied. Sorry.
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
No.
/ With your favorite
Highland frog /
No.
No, not you.
You're not even real!
Get away from me!
Aaah! Aaah!
Faster, janitor!
More commemorative red, white, and blue streamers.
Crazy Legs Knebworth.
What a champion he was.
Come on, you idiot.
He's coming!
Straighten up.
Straighten up.
Better. Ready? And...
Ahh!
At last! At last!
The moment we've all been waiting for.
Ah ha ha ha ha.
Crazy Legs. You look fit.
Elliot. It's been too long.
I agree completely.
Slip me that biscuit.
Ooh, that's a hot one.
Smile.
The reason Jindraike has a new football program... is to impress this guy-
Superintendent Knebworth.
You see, Jindraike wants his job so bad... he'd eat his socks.
How it saddens me... to think of your retirement,
Crazy Legs.
What an inspiration you've been to us all.
In fact, I've collected some mementos... from your glory days.
Well.
Remember this?
Eww!
It's your championship jockstrap.
We washed it. Ha ha.
Wash it again.
What's this?
Allow me to present...
Knebworth Stadium.
Knebworth Stadium.
How can you afford to do something like this?
I didn't approve any capital expenditures for Curtis.
The usual- bake sales, car washes... and cutting back on a few non-essential items.
- Fire extinguishers, milk.
- Excuse me?
Moving along- have you seen the toilets?
No complaints.
I need five laps to-
All right, that's weird.
Who turned out the lights?
Hey, check it out.
It's McGinty!
What the-
Hey, break it up.
Break it up.
McGinty.
He's... gonna eat me.
What?
MacGoogles.
"Look who's crying now. "
Would you guys get out of here?
So the second teacher says, "I agree.
"That's why they call it a lounge. " Ha.
Well, here we are... in the Curtis
Junior High library.
Hmm. Smallish.
Yes, but we're biggish on books.
Especially sports books.
Hmm.
The one we're waiting for is "Crazy Legs"-
"The Bobby Knebworth Story. "
Ohh! Ooh! Oh!
Ohh!
Didn't I order new computer workstations this year?
Jindraike?
We're having them upgraded.
Hmm. OK.
Well... if it isn't my favorite customer.
What can I get you, plump daddy?
What's this?
Who are you working for?
"If you want the ice back in your ice cream...
"meet me at the junkyard at 3:00."
Somebody's messing with me.
Hey, can I try the soup?
Everything set?
I guess so, but I still don't see... how this is gonna help save the animal shelter.
It's all part of the plan.
Max...
What?
I don't know.
I'd just rather spend our last day... hanging out than doing all this spy stuff.
- Uhh!
- Ow! What the-Big oaf.
They're coming!
Right on schedule.
- You ready?
- Check.
Lunch... is... served.
Check and mate.
Who threw that?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
/ Aim for me /
Food fight!
/ Aim for me, hit it /
/ It's a great big world /
Not on my watch!
/ Nothing /
/ Don't believe in nothing anyway /
/ Still got a lot to learn /
/ But we started out with nothing /
/ With my friends we 're going on our way /
Stop that this instant!
/ Your life will rearrange /
Oh! I saw that, young man!
Aah!
I'm taking names!
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
/ Aim for me /
/ They'll try to count you out /
/ But you gotta count yourself in /
If I get my shirt dirty, my mom's gonna kill me!
/ Not saying that I'm right /
/ See the trouble that we've been in /
"Jell-O Hello. "
No. "Cafeteria Hysteria. "
/ When it's said and done /
/ And you've got us on the run /
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
Aah!
/ Some people change /
You're all suspended!
/ You're so far from home /

Ha ha ha ha ha!
/ Aim for me, aim for me /
/ Aim for me, aaah /
Aaah!
Aah!

/ When it's said and done /
Ohh! Aah!
Not having fun! Ow!
Aah!
And now, onto the piece de resistance.
The jewel in the crown of Curtis.
The cafeteria.
Let me tell you something about this school.
It blows!
It's mustard!
You can't ketchup, because it's mustard!
Yeah!
/ Some people change, and your life will rearrange /
/ Even when you're so far from home /
Please believe me when I tell you... this is my gift to you.
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
/ Aim for me /
Cease!
Sir, I assure you, this behavior... is utterly without precedent.
Plus, it never happened before.
Who?
Who started this?
If the culprit does not step forward... this instant... swift and horrible retribution... awaits each and every one of you.
Aah!
This place is nuts.
Crazy Legs!
Wait!
Uhh!
Pbbbt!
I pound on kids.
That's what I do.
That's what I do.
This can't happen to me.
You know what they're calling me out there?
The MacGoogler.
Troy, easy. Now,
I'd like to take you through... a childhood regression process.
It may bring up some unpleasant memories... but I think you'll find it helpful in the end.
All righty?
Mm-hmm.
Now, give
Mr. MacGoogles a hug.
Aah! Aah!
He's gonna eat me!
We've got some work to do.
$300 for a new handheld?
There goes my third quarter.
"Meet me 3 P.M. today at the junkyard...
"if you want to put your handheld back in your hand. "
"P.S. Bring the metal coil. "
Son, your mama found a metal coil... on the front porch.
Is it yours?
Metal coil.
I want my coil.
I want my handheld!
What did you say, punk?
I said, "I want my handheld. "
You want your handheld?
Yeah. You heard me.
I said, "I want my handheld. "
You want me to hold your hand?
No!
Need somebody to hold his hand. Little baby.
Little-
Give me the coil!
Oh, this? Huh? Huh?
Uhh!
No!
Oh!
Huh?
Huh?
Aah!
Yeehaw!
Meh-meh-meh.
Good, Troy! Now... can you help me find a link... between MacGoogles and your fears?
Was it something from your past... or somebody?
Keeble!
Keeble.
Hey, Max.
Hi, Jenna.
Do you want to hang out?
I'm meeting some friends at Buddies.
You know what?
I actually gotta kinda be somewhere.
Oh, come on.
Stay for one milk shake.
It'll be fun.
Well...
One milk shake.
You know what?
OK. All right.
One... milk shake.
/ Hit me, baby, one more time /
Ha ha ha!
So, you actually did set up... that whole monkey thing at the cafeteria?
Well, actually,
Tad is a chimpanzee.
You're so devious.
Well, it's really part of my whole new attitude- what I like to call my phat-itude.
Yo! Don't crowd the man, dude.
He has phat-itude. Git!
Yeehaw!
I wonder where Max is?
Don't worry. He'll be here.
/ School is out, let's enjoy the heat /
/ It's all you now, do it like you're playin' for keeps /
/ Destroyed right here for you to makin ' it cheap /
/ Old school, new school, come on, wiggle with me /
/ Jump and slide /
/ Now dip, that's right /
/ Now jump and slide /
/ Now dip, that's right /
/ You want it, you got it, ahh /
/ You want it, baby, you got it /
Megan, wait!
/ You want it, you got it, ahh /
Don't worry about us.
Just go back to your party.
It's not a party.
I was just-
I was just coming to see you guys.
Whatever.
I guess we're just not cool enough for you.
Don't say that.
But Megan-she likes you.
She really likes you.
Robe, wait.
You know what?
I've been waiting.
Now I'm going home.
Have a nice life in Chicago.
Well, can you tell her that I called?
And that
I'm really, really sorry.
- I'll tell her, Max.
- Thanks.
And don't forget the sorry part, please.
- I won't.
- Thank you. Bye.
Hey, champ.
You seen your mom?
Hey, honey, can you come here quick?
I got big news.
What's up?
Guess what?
We're not moving.
We're not?
Uh-uh. I finally gave Foge some of his own medicine.
You foged Foge?
Yeah. I quit.
We're gonna stay here.
I'm gonna start my own business.
Oh, sweetie!
Now you're gonna be the big cheese!
Not anymore!
Wait! We're not moving?
Uh-uh.
Oh, look at him.
He's so happy, he can't speak!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, honey, can you help me get this off?
I sure can!
I can't get it over my head with the gloves.
What was I gonna do?
I had to get out of this.
Max, this is gonna be great.
I finally get to be my own boss.
But, Dad, what about your responsibilities- the house, the food, my clothes?
What about my clothes?
Do I wear rags?
Max, I owe it all to you.
You're the one that helped me realize...
Foge was nothing but a bully.
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have had... the courage to stand up to him.
I'm just a kid!
What do I know?
You OK?
You seem a little jumpy.
Yes! Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm cool.
So, see you tonight.
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe?
Who was I kidding?
I was Grade-A dead meat, and I knew it.
What I didn't know... is that I've left my friends in the same boat.
It's gonna be a long year for you, slim.
I'm gonna pound you every day.
And all thanks to your good friend Keeble.
Catch you around, huh?
Great.
Let's just round it off to all your money forever.
From here on in, you work for me.
Heh heh! Yeah.
In fact, the entire school was going to suffer... because of me.
Oh, stop smiling.
This is not a happy place.
Find Max Keeble.
I'd like to speak to him.
You better book a flight.
What?
Max Keeble moved to Chicago.
I just forwarded his file.
Mrs. Rangoon, a moment of your time, please.
Someone's got something important... to say to the students.
Someone's got something very important... to say to the students, and do you know... who that someone is,
Mrs. Rangoon?
It's me, Mrs. Rangoon.
Hmm. Yeah.
And wait till they hear it.
Attention, students.
Because of yesterday's crimes against the school... instigated by your former classmate Max Keeble... the following extracurricular activities... are now suspended- art, music, P.E... fun!
Suspended, discontinued, defunct!
Great. Your boyfriend
Max Keeble... just got us hosed.
He's just my paperboy.
I never really liked him.
Keeble!
OK. Today, class, we're going to review... some of the elements of grammar.
McGinty says he's gonna pound me... every day for the rest of my life.
Dobbs says I have to give him all of my money... forever.
Some plausible deniability.
Hi. Do you mind if I hang here for a while... because there's some people after me.
I did some stuff.
Yeah. You probably...
Yeah. I'm really sorry about the cafeteria.
But Jindraike has no right to do what he's doing... and now my friends are gonna get whaled on because of me... and I can't do anything about it.
Any kid can make a mess.
Takes a man to clean it up.
It took a man with a plunger... to make me realize that I had to do something.
I thought I'd stood up to the bullies... but all I'd really done was hit and run.
That's not courage.
That's ex-courage.
As you know, verbs are words that describe actions... so who can name a few?
Betray, deceive, lie.
How about burn... screw over, stab in the back?
Heh! Uh-huh.
Attention, students, this is Max Keeble speaking.
First I'd like to say to my friends Megan and Robe... that I know that I acted like a jerk... and I'm sorry for ever getting you involved in this.
I screwed up, but you guys are my best friends... and that's forever.
I don't know what else to say, but I'm sorry.
It probably doesn't matter to you anymore... but I'm not moving.
Keeble!
And McGinty and Dobbs... it's me you want, so leave my friends alone.
I may have run before, but I am all through running now.
You want me, I'll be in the parking lot, 3:00.
Cut!
End of broadcast!
That is all. Thank you.
Ah!
Hello, Max. Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Please, have a seat.
Anything I can get for you?
Sparkling water? Soda?
No? OK.
You've acted like a criminal... so I'm going to treat you like a criminal.
I'm not a criminal.
People who do crimes are criminals, like you.
You should be careful before slandering... your principal's spotless reputation... with wild and groundless claims.
They're not groundless, they're ground-full.
- Ground-full?
- Look it up!
I saw it on the screen.
You have been stealing from all the school budgets... to fund your stupid football stuff.
Saw it on the screen, did you?
Yeah, and it's true.
You're a smart little boy... but so am I!
So I fiddled with the budget.
Fiddlesticks.
It's my budget.
So we have fewer textbooks.
Big deal.
Textbooks are for nerds.
Fewer band instruments- who cares?
Band is for losers.
- Come on!
- Oh!
So the janitor has to work overtime for no pay.
He should pay me for the privilege!
Now, let me describe your next 24 hours.
I'm going to mete out a punishment to you... that is so severe, future generations... will refer to it as "The Keeble. "
They will beg on bended knee-
"Oh, please, sir.
Not the Keeble, sir.
"I swear I'll never misbehave again...
"if you'll just spare me... the Keeble. "
And spare them I shall, Max... for I am a merciful man.
Your transgressions are so immense... that I would be delinquent-
My bulldozer!
Oh, goody.
Oh, that's right!
You don't know!
You thought you saved the animal shelter.
It would appear-not!
Now stay there!
Don't go away.
Uhh! Hmm.
Uhh!
What do you think
Jindraike'll do to him?
What do you think
McGinty and Dobbs'll do to him?
/ We got evil trouble /
Maybe they'll just forget the whole thing.
/ Evil trouble /
/ We got evil trouble /
Or maybe they'll rip his head off.
We've got to do something.
Come on.
/ We got evil trouble /
/ We got evil trouble /
Good afternoon, Mr. Dobbs.
Always a pleasure, McGinty.
This is gonna be epic.
"Keeble canceled. "
Here's Jinny.
Keeble?
Keeble!
Sacrilege!
Open this door immediately!
Caged like an animal.
Ironic.
Aah!
Ow!
So, is my watch running fast... or is our Keeble friend running scared?
Somebody looking for me?
Keeble, welcome to our parking lot of pain.
Ha ha ha!
You know how doctors say,
"This won't hurt a bit"?
Well, I'm not a doctor, and neither is McGinty here.
He's right.
I'm not a doctor.
Yeah!
Oh, you know, that's too bad... because you're gonna need one.
Uhh!
Hold him!
Let him go!
Megan, I'm handling this!
So am I.
Ha ha ha!
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
This.
McGINTY: Oh.
OK.
Ha ha ha ha!
I'm so scared.
You should be.
We're taking back our school.
Yeah. No more being pushed around.
No more being stepped on.
No more Mr. Not-nice Guy.
Your reign of terror over the student body... has come to an abrupt halt.
What?
Yes, please.
From now on, you have to pay us... to use the restroom.
We're pulling your plug!
Throw them in the dumpster!
- Swirlie!
- Yeah!
Get them!
Aha! Aha! Ah!
It was all his idea!
It was his idea!
It was all McGinty!
Put me down!
Wait! Wait!
What are we doing?!
Getting revenge on the bullies.
But that makes us the same as them.
Don't you see?
I mean, I went about all this the wrong way.
We are no better than the bullies... if we do exactly what the bullies do.
I mean, we need to stand together... and make our school a better place for everyone!
For you and you and you and even you, worried kid.
- Man's got a point.
- Yeah!
What should we do with them?
Let them go.
No!
Ha ha ha!
Wow! How cool are you?
You know. Just-
A bunch of us are having a party this weekend.
Ninth graders only.
Except for you, Max.
I'm sorry. I can't come.
I'm meeting somebody.
Shoo shoo!
Whatever.
Nice move, Max.
You know what?
I think not moving... was the best move of all.
It's Jindraike!
He's heading for the animal shelter!
That's it! Run!
Scatter like the children you are!
Knock, knock. Anybody home?
Whoa!
Huh?
Giddyap!
All right! Who's first?!
I know!
How about the smelly goat?!
Baa!
Not today, Jindraike.
That's far enough.
On second thought, why don't we start with the boy... who tried to save the smelly goat?
I do not fear your dark powers, bald one.
Your kung fu's no good here, Max.
Oh, what is that-
Eek! Eek! Pbbbt! Pbbbt!
Traitor!
Uhh! Hah!
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Cease!
He did it!
All right, Max!
Yep! I did it!
The animal shelter was safe... the bullies were cooked... and Jindraike got fired for fiddling with the budget.
As for me and my friends, we were just happy... that the first week of school was over.
Now we could chill for the rest of the year.

A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.
Come on, little man. I fought the war with your daddy.
Y'all ain't paid me for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.
Jackie Chan!
Jackie Chan!
Shanghai Noon.
I take traveler's checks.
Arigato to you too. Thank you, sugar.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Oh! You kids!
- Here.
- Hold it right there!
- What happened?
- Step away from her.
Oh, man, he ain't done nothing.
Those kids. Who took your bag?
This man?
No, it was a couple of punks.
They came and they just ran off.
Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim... with facial wound at East 42nd entrance.
Sir, I'd like you to just stand right there.
- Certainly.
- Are you traveling somewhere?
I have arrived. My travels are over for the time being.
Where's your luggage?
- I don't require luggage.
- Do you have a ticket?
Train ticket?
Ticket stub?
I didn't arrive by train.
Would you remove your sunglasses for me, please?
Oh, I'd rather not.
I'd forgotten, but I mean, wow,
Your planet is really bright.
I see.
East 42, we have an E.D.P.
I have to ask you to come with us, sir.
Of course.
Freddy!
Did you see this fella come out of a gate?
He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, Freddy,
I know what you're saying.
I don't wanna go outside, because there's things that can kill you...
Thank you.
If you breathe all those chemicals out there, not to mention the cosmic rays and the West Nile virus, and that other one... the new airborne pigeon disease nobody wants to talk about.
The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.
Another thing that's been bothering me is the food.
The cafeteria serves lukewarm food, full of germs.
You really need to do something about that, Dr. Powell.
Heat is the only thing that kills germs. Heat.
Point taken.
We'll look into that right away.
In the meantime, I want you to start taking your medication again.
It'll help you sleep.
And you need the sleep, Ernie.
Sleep is good.
Is our time up?
Only for today, Ernie.
Two calls: Your wife, bring home a bottle of wine.
- Yeah.
- And Dr. Chakraborty.
A transfer from Bellevue he wants you to take a look at.
Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc?
Dr. Chakraborty didn't say.
He arrived at Bellevue a month ago,
suspicion of hallucinogenic intoxication.
But, uh, he was found negative for substances of any kind.
His EKG, his blood value are all normal.
There's no sign of concussion, no brain tumor, no temporal lobe, epilepsy, no indication of organic abnormality whatsoever.
However, after one month, his amnesia and his delusion have persisted.
He claims to be not human.
A visitor from another planet.
They administered Thorazine on this guy for three weeks... at 300 milligrams a day, and he was unresponsive?
How can you be unresponsive to 300 milligrams of Thorazine?
It's impossible.
That's why they sent him to you.
Terrific.
No I.D., no missing persons report matching his description.
What's this?
He had it on him.
Well, let's hope extraterrestrials qualify for Medicaid.
He's here, Doctor.
Thank you, Joyce.
Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself Prot.
This one's as gentle as a pussycat, Doc.
Come in.
Have a seat.
"Have a seat".
Curious expression.
Well, let me introduce myself. I'm...
Dr. Mark Powell,
Chief of Clinical Psychiatry... of the Manhattan
Psychiatric Institute.
Good. You know where you are.
Well, now, uh...
Prot, is it?
- "Prote".
- I see, "Prote".
- Well, Prot, we're here to...
- May I?
Please.
Red delicious.
You call this variety.
It's my favorite.
I'd like to begin by asking you... if you know why you're here.
Of course.
You think I'm crazy.
We prefer the term "ill".
Do you think you are ill?
A little homesick, perhaps.
Really.
Where is home?
K-PAX.
K-PAX?
Capital "K", hyphen, capitals "P-A-X".
K-PAX is a planet.
But don't worry, I'm not going to leap out of your chest.
I'm not worried.
It's just that I'm only familiar with nine planets.
Well, actually, there are ten, but that doesn't matter.
I'm not from your solar system.
K-PAX is about 1,000 of your light-years away from here... in what you would call
Your constellation Lyra.
That's quite a ways.
I'm curious.
How did you get to Earth?
It's a matter of harnessing the energy of light.
I know that sounds crazy to you.
You beings are eons away from discovering light travel.
You travel at the speed of light?
Oh, no. We can travel many times that speed. Various multiples of "C".
Otherwise, the trip here would have taken about 1,000 years now, wouldn't it?
What if, um, I were to tell you... that according to a man who lived on our planet named Einstein, that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light?
I would say that you misread Einstein,
Dr. Powell. May I call you Mark?
You see, Mark, what Einstein actually said... was that nothing can accelerate to the speed of light, because its mass would become infinite.
Einstein said nothing about entities already traveling at the speed of light or faster,
- at tachyon speeds.
- Tachyon?
I detect a note of skepticism, Dr. Powell.
Oh, not at all.
It's just that you...
You speak English so well.
I'm amazed. Well, English isn't that difficult a language to learn.
You should try speaking...
I'm...
I'm confused.
Maybe you can explain it to me. Uh... how is it that being a visitor from space, that you-you look so much like me... or anyone else from Earth?
Why is a soap bubble round?
Why is a soap bubble round?
You know, for an educated person,
Mark, you repeat things quite a bit.
Are you aware of that?
A soap bubble is round... because it is the most energy-efficient configuration.
Similarly, on your planet,
I look like you.
On K-PAX,
I look like a K-PAXian.
Prot, why did you want to come to our planet?
Well, I've been here many times before.
But what brought me here first? I don't know.
Pure curiosity, I guess.
I'd never been to a Class BA-3 planet before.
Class BA-3?
Early stage of evolution.
Future uncertain.
And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor...
Howie. Go on.
Talk to him.
Go on.
You're really from... up there?
Indeed.
I am from K-PAX.
What...
What sort of place is it?
K-PAX is bigger than your planet.
But we are circled by seven purple moons.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Go on.
Well, K-PAX is most lovely when
K-MON and K-RIL are in conjunction.
Those are our two suns. What you would call Agape and Satori.
- You finish your homework, Abby?
- Yeah.
I lost another tooth.
Oh, yeah? Let me see.
Hey! Maybe the tooth fairy will come tonight, huh?
There's no such thing as the tooth fairy, Dad.
There's just you and Mom.
I fed them already. I couldn't wait.
How was your day?
Oh, 6:15 was late.
Didn't leave the station till 6:30.
Should have caught the nearest beam of light.
You should have caught what?
- Oh, nothing. How was your day?
- Good.
Sent the deposit in for the house on the cape for the last two weeks of August.
Which works out perfectly,
'cause Abby doesn't get out of camp till the 15th.
Sent the deposit in?
- Yeah.
- Come on, Rache.
That wasn't definite. We were just talking. I said maybe.
Maybe sometime in August we'll clear it.
Maybe. Maybe we should start paying you for your time.
You got a family rate?
Oh, look.
They published my letter.
I spoke with Natalie about going into the after-school program next year, in case I go back to teaching.
And this morning my head fell off, but I was able to sew it back on with dental floss.
Waxed, of course.
Dental floss?
Sorry.
I wasn't I listening.
Yeah, I know.
Let's just eat.
Train was late.
I'm tired.
And to top it off, the city is dumping patients on us.
I know.
You stink.
Have a nice day, Sal.
I've been to 64 planets within our galaxy.
Earth is the only one with your species, Homo sapiens,
that I've visited so far.
And when did you arrive on Earth?
Four years and nine months ago.
So that makes you how old?
In Earth terms, 337 years old.
I aged about seven getting here, traveling at six multiples of "C".
But really, Marko, it only seemed like an instant.
- Marko?
- Time may warp at super light speed.
I'd say access one psychosis NOS.
That's glib to call him a psychotic.
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.
Oh, yeah? He believes he traveled here from another planet.
What's your diagnosis, jet lag?
Well, how come he didn't respond to the Haldol?
Haldol can make you more psychotic.
It's rare, but it does happen.
Look. I'm not saying that medication can't be a useful tool... to help somebody like this, but you can't...
He maybe a good subject for the "Betazine" protocol.
The drug's on clinical trial.
You want to experiment on him before we have a diagnosis?
Do you have some other idea?
He's not a danger to anyone.
How about getting to know him first?
In the meantime, we have ten new transfers to take care of.
You know, maybe what's wrong with him...
- is that he is.
- Is what?
From the planet K-PAX.
Mmm.
Your produce alone has been worth the trip.
Could you tell me... a bit about your boyhood on K-PAX?
Where were you born?
You were, uh, born, right?
K-PAXians have babies?
Oh, yes, much like on Earth, but unlike you humans, the reproductive process is quite unpleasant for us.
Could you compare the effect to something that I might understand?
Like a toothache? - It's more like having your nuts in a vise, except we feel it all over.
And to make matters worse, the sensation is associated... with something like your nausea, accompanied by a very bad smell.
The moment of climax is like being kicked in the stomach, and then falling into a pool of mod droppings.
Mod droppings?
A mod is a being, much like your skunk, only far more potent.
Uh, if it's such a terrible experience, uh, how do you reproduce?
As carefully as possible.
What are you doing?
Well, you just reminded me of something
I want to include in my report.
Your report.
Yes, it's our custom... to compile descriptions of the various places and people we encounter... throughout the galaxy.
- Morning, Betty.
- Good morning, Prot.
- Morning, Navarro.
- Hey, what's up, man?
Mr. Friedman.
Morning, Maria.
- I'm Vanessa.
- Just chill.
Morning, Bess.
She doesn't talk to anybody.
Afraid smoke will come out of her mouth when she talks.
Been here since she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.
Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.
It was an electrical fire. Why do you make up stories like that?
Ernie has a very powerful imagination.
Philistine!
Come on, Doris. You gotta come out of your room sometime.
Look what I brought just for you.
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.
Do that again, you go up to three.
Her Royal Highness never, ever comes out of her room.
Not even to eat.
No wonder she's here.
I'm sick and tired of this shit.
Everyday, coming up here and shooting food at me. I hate this.
The service here is atrocious!
Good morning, Mrs. Archer.
Doris.
I wasn't expecting any gentleman callers... until this afternoon.
Excuse me.
You have a place set for two.
Oh, yes. Um...
I'm expecting someone.
How long have you been waiting?
Eleven years.
For some around here might... call that crazy, but I prefer to call it... romantic.
- Romantic.
- Like a, uh... waltz in the moonlight, or a... candlelit dinner... or a sunset.
- Oh, we have those.
On K-PAX, we have two suns.
They rise together only once every 200 years.
And that is quite a sight.
He most definitely has a sensitivity to white light, but I think it's his range that you'll find interesting.
What am I looking at?
He can detect light at a wavelength of up to 300 to 400 angstroms.
Ultraviolet.
Of course,
Prot's explanation is that... due to his planet's peculiar quality of light caused by its two suns,
K-PAXians are used to light conditions much like our twilight most of the time.
W-Wait a minute.
Chuck, I didn't think... human beings could see ultraviolet light.
We can't.
Good morning, Joyce.
That's a lovely configuration you're wearing today.
Thank you.
- Macy's.
- Come in.
This is so much better.
It's a lot like home.
Well, uh, Prot,
I was hoping you'd tell me more about home.
Well, what would you like to know?
Well, uh, do you, um,
do you have a family on K-PAX?
It doesn't work on K-PAX the same way it works here, Mark.
On K-PAX, we don't have families in the way that you think of them.
In fact, a family would be a non sequitur on our planet, as it would on most others.
In other words, um,
You, uh, you never knew your parents.
On K-PAX, children are not raised by their biological parents, Mark, but by everyone.
They circulate among us, learning from one and then another.
- Do you have a child?
- No.
Do you have a wife waiting back for you on K-PAX?
Mark. Mark. Mark.
You are not really listening to what I'm saying to you, are you?
We do not have marriage on K-PAX.
There are no wives.
There are no husbands.
There are no families.
I see. So, um, what about... societal structure?
- Government.
- No, there's no need for one.
- You have no laws?
- No laws. No lawyers.
How do you know right from wrong?
Every being in the universe knows right from wrong, Mark.
But what if... if someone did do something wrong... committed murder or rape... how would you punish them?
Let me tell you something, Mark.
You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of "an eye for an eye, a life for a life", which is known throughout the universe... for its stupidity.
Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision, but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians.
You humans, sometimes it's hard to imagine how you've made it this far.
Josh, be careful.
Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.
Hey. Where were you just now?
- Come on.
- Okay.
Hey, kids, come on.
Wash up.
Okay!
Josh. Now come on, quit teasing the dog.
Josh, let's go.
Settle down now.
- Here we are.
- Oh, park that right here.
- Boy, that looks terrific.
- That looks great.
Steve, how was, uh, how was your trip up from Princeton?
Not too bad.
We even stopped by to see Michael.
Oh, that was nice of you, Sis.
Quite a detour for you guys.
Well, it was his birthday.
I know it was his birthday.
I sent him a card and a nice, uh, a nice, big check as usual.
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone every once in a while... and talk to your own son.
Thank you, Abby. You wanna pass the potato salad, please?
There you go.
By the way, I put him through Dartmouth.
He knows how to pick up a phone too.
I'm thinking of inviting him for Christmas. - Oh, great.
He spends Christmas with his mother.
- He won't come here.
- How do you know?
When was the last time you asked him?
Am I on the couch here, or what?
You want a beer?
Please and thank you.
- You want some more?
- Can I have corn, darling?
Steve, I, uh,
I have a rather unusual favor to ask you.
- What can I do you for, Dr. "P"?
- Well, I have a patient.
Sit down. I have this patient, who, uh, seems to know quite a bit about your field.
A patient who's an astronomer?
So, tell me about this patient of yours.
Well, he, uh, he claims to come from a planet he calls K-PAX.
What kind of name is that?
K-PAX?
He says it's a thousand light-years away, near the constellation Lyra.
Uh-huh. Bighead?
Green? About this high?
Yeah, I think
I know the guy.
No, he's, uh, he's very convincing.
I mean, of course, he's, uh, he's human.
It's just that he's, um, well, he's-he's the most convincing delusional I've ever come across.
If I can prove to him that this K-PAX is just a figment of his imagination, then maybe I can find out who he really is.
Well, sure.
I can give you... a whole list of questions to ask your fella. - Wonderful.
All his books and papers and everything... are spread all over the desk like always, but he's just sitting there.
Someone change his medication?
I gave him his usual,
Anafronil, 250 milligrams.
Hmm. Well, something's wrong with him.
An obsessive-compulsive doesn't just sit there looking out the window.
Howie?
Good morning, Dr. Powell.
Good morning.
But are you looking for something?
Bluebird.
The bluebird?
The bluebird of happiness.
Prot told me to find the bluebird of happiness.
Prot told you.
It's a task.
The first of three.
I don't know what the other two are yet.
He'll tell me.
If I complete all three,
I'll be cured.
There.
Maintain your breathing.
That's it.
Now you see?
There are none of these ammonia particles that you're so worried about.
In the first place, I would be able to see them. - Good morning, Sal.
- And I don't.
- Good morning, Dr. Stinky.
Ringed monkey, 7:00.
Take a bath.
Take a bath.
Ernie, could you excuse us for a moment, please? - Mm-hmm.
Good to, uh, see you outside, Ernie.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Ernie, you stink.
Prot, it's one thing to take an interest in your fellow patients.
It's quite another to make them think that you can cure them.
You seem overly upset, Mark.
To borrow a phrase from Navarro,
You need to chill.
For your information, all beings have the capacity to cure themselves, Mark.
This is something we've known on K-PAX for millions of years.
Listen to me. On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.
Doctor. Patient.
Curious human distinction.
It's not your job to cure Howie.
Or Ernie or Maria or anyone else.
It's mine.
Then why haven't you cured them yet?
Oh, by the way, here are the answers to the questions you asked me.
I hope they meet your satisfaction.
I don't know what to say, Mark.
I mean, this is... this is pretty wild stuff.
Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.
I mean, see, your patient indicates his planet, K-PAX, orbiting an eclipsing binary star system... Agape and Satori.
Yeah.
Near the Constellation Lyra.
He could have looked that up, right?
That's the funny thing, Mark.
Not really.
I mean, except for my boss,
Duncan Flynn, one of the foremost astrophysicists in the world... and maybe two or three of his colleagues, nobody knows much about the possibility of planets in this star system yet.
It hasn't even been reported in any journals.
Tell me, honestly,
did Duncan put you up to this?
You know...
You know, like a joke?
No. It's no joke, Steve.
Uh, tell me, do you know of any missing astrophysicists?
Can't say I do.
But there's one or two around here who'd sure like to meet this fella of yours.
Thanks a lot, Steve.
I sure appreciate it.
But unlike you humans, the reproductive process...
is an unpleasant one for us.
Start again.
What way is it unpleasant?
It's a pain...
Good. Not too fast.
Okay.
So, this is your neighborhood, huh?
Hello, gentlemen. Sure appreciate you meeting with us.
Thank you, Dr. Powell.
We'd like to get to the bottom of this just as much as you would.
Thank you, Doctor. Great.
Let me introduce you to Prot.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.
This is Dr. Flynn.
Drs. Patel and Hessler.
Doctor. Doctor.
Doctor. Doctor.
How many doctors are there on this planet?
Here, Prot.
Have a seat.
- "Have a seat."
- Oh, shit!
Feel at home?
We found your notes quite interesting, Prot, and we'd like to ask you some questions, if that's all right.
Be my guest.
Good.
Then I'll jump right in.
Make sure you can swim.
Yes, well, let's start with this idea of light travel, shall we?
What can you tell us about that?
Absolutely nothing.
If I told you, you'd blow yourselves up.
Or worse, someone else.
You'd be surprised how much energy is in a beam of light.
Hmm. Well, then, maybe you could show us how this light travel works.
You mean a demonstration.
That would be... fine.
Adios. Aloha.
Well, when are you gonna...
I'm already back.
See, where I come from,
Prot, that's called
"the fastest gun in the West" routine.
Well, I don't come from where you come from, Dr. Becker.
Prot, you've indicated in your notes that your planet K-PAX... orbits around the twin stars of Agape and Satori, near the constellation Lyra.
Well, frankly, we're a bit mystified... as to how you gained knowledge there's such a planetary system around these stars.
Professor, where I come from, that's common knowledge.
This was taken from the Hubble.
We've computer enhanced it, based on Dr. Patel's readings... from telescopes in Chile and Hawaii.
It's the clearest picture we have of where you come from.
What we'd like is if you could diagram on the light pad... the orbital pattern that your planet takes through this system.
- Mm-hmm.
- My pleasure.
I think that's right.
Steven, could you input that?
Already on it.
Wh-What's going on?
I take it my calculations help explain the "protabations"
you've been seeing...
in the rotation pattern of your binary star, but have been unable to explain until... this moment.
How...
How could you know this?
How could you...
Every K-PAXian knows this.
Just as every child on Earth knows... that your planet revolves around your sun.
It's common knowledge.
Isn't it?
What, um, what happened in there?
I mean, you...
He could be a savant.
There- there are savants who have painted flawless copies of Rembrandt, who couldn't... who couldn't remember their own names.
You don't believe him, Steve.
I don't know what I believe,
Mark, but I know what I saw.
I moved. I moved.
It's your move.
One and two. Your move.
Bluebird.
Bluebird.
- You just wait till next game.
- Bluebird.
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!
- Howie!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!
- Howie.
- Bluebird. Bluebird. Bluebird.
- Okay. Okay.
- Bluebird!
Where's the bluebird?
Look, bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Oh, my God.
- Bluebird! Bluebird! Howie!
- Howie, get back here!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!
Do bluebirds bite, Sal?
Nah, they don't bite, stinkhead.
Hey, Bess, it's a bluebird.
- Shit!
- Disturbance on two.
- It's the bluebird!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!
It's mass hysteria.
Betty! Betty, what the hell is going on here?
- Come here! Come here!
- Dr. Powell, come and see!
You see it?
Do you see it?
Lookit! Lookit!
Lookit!
What's going on here, Dr. Powell?
What on Earth is out there?
- Just a bluejay.
- A bluejay?
A bluejay.
Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.
Mrs. Archer... come out of her room.
Bluebird?
It's a bluebird?
Come on over here.
I know who you are.
You're the bluebird.
Good night, Bess.
- And how are we today?
- Oh, just fine.
- That's good, Maria.
- My man.
Psst.
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.
About that light travel thing.
I was wondering if maybe you could show me how to do that.
I put up with the stinkin this place for ten years.
I wanna get out, if you know what I mean.
I used to be the doorman at The Plaza.
F-Fifteen years.
That's when I started to notice it.
Notice what?
The smell.
They all stank.
I-I tried to tell 'em, but, uh, they put me here.
And, um, and-and...
And this-this place smells worse than all.
Except for you.
Y-you don't smell, so I figured maybe you could help me.
You should smell the york blossoms on my planet... in a gentle breeze.
Pretty much like your sugarplums.
I would... I would like to smell that.
I would like to go there, to-to your, um, planet.
I'm afraid I can only take one person back with me when I go.
Uh, I had my weekly session with Sal today.
He says you're taking him to K-PAX.
In fact, I've heard from most of the patients on ward two, they all tell me that they're going to K-PAX.
I wonder if that's a wise thing to be promising patients in a psychiatric facility.
No, no, no, Mark. I made it clear to each and every one of them,
I can only take one person back with me when I return.
- Return?
- Mark, don't get me wrong.
I mean, you've been very hospitable.
Hospital.
Hospitable.
But my time here is almost up, and I can't wait to get back.
Back?
To K-PAX?
Yes, of course.
Where else?
You're planning to return to K-PAX.
You're repeating yourself again, Mark.
Yes, I have one trip to take up north, and then I am planning on returning to K-PAX.
Joyce gave me these strawberries this morning from her garden in Hoboken.
They're delicious.
You'll have to forgive me, but, um, but this is a bit confusing.
- When are you planning on...
- I'm departing on July 27.
Why? Why, uh, why July 27?
Safety reasons.
You see, I can go anywhere on Earth without fear of bumping into someone... traveling at super light speed, but beings are coming and going all the time from K-PAX.
It has to be coordinated.
You're telling me...
You're beaming back to K-PAX on July 27.
At 5:51 a.m.,
Eastern time.
Hey, hey, hey, honey.
Mark, you were just dreaming.
You were just dreaming.
- Daddy?
- Mark.
Mark, what's going on?
Daddy's okay.
- Go back to bed, honey.
- Where is Daddy going?
Daddy's all right. He has a tummy ache. He's all right.
- Daddy!
- Get in bed!
And when did you arrive on Earth?
- Four years and nine months ago.
- What's going on?
Shh! Listen.
And when did you arrive on Earth?
Four years and nine months ago.
Your years.
Four years, nine months and three days ago.
That'll be five years to the date on July 27. That's when he's leaving.
- What?
- To go back to K-PAX.
Mark, what is the matter with you?
- Rachel...
- Mark, it is 2:00 in the morning.
What is... What is this patient doing to you?
He's telling me that five years ago on July 27... something terrible happened to him.
Some horrible trauma.
I gotta get to him before that date.
- Mom, what's happening?
- Unbelievable.
Nothing. Come on.
Come on. Let's all go back to bed.
Ah, I've got it!
Come on. Let's eat.
- Is the spaceman here yet?
- Shh. Don't call him that.
- Spaceman. Spaceman.
- No, no. No, no.
- Whoo!
- Everybody, come here.
Listen, everybody, look.
He's going to be here any minute.
I want you guys to just calm down.
Be yourselves. Act natural.
Okay. Spaceman.
Why, is he going to zap us with his laser gun?
I mean it. I do.
Here.
Oh, Mom.
I can't believe
I agreed to this.
I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.
I want him to spend
4th of July with us... to see if a normal family environment might bring something out of him.
Since when did we become a normal family?
Please.
Look. They're here.
- I just feel uncomfortable.
- Well, don't.
Joyce's son, he's on the high school wrestling team, and Betty's husband's an ex-cop.
- Hey!
- Hi.
- Hey, Joyce.
- Hey, buddy.
Glad you could make it.
- Wow.
- This is my husband, Dominic.
- He looks like Data.
- That's right, embarrass him.
Welcome, Prot.
This is my wife Rachel.
- How do you do?
- Rachel.
Thank you so much for inviting me today.
Thanks for coming.
- Watch out. Watch out.
- No.
Shasta, no.
Shasta, no. Shasta!
Come here, good dog.
I know. I know.
Damn dog's never liked anyone. Shh.
Oh. Okay. Kids.
- Girls. Girls.
- Come here.
Okay.
She says she doesn't like it when you hide her favorite tennis shoe.
And she doesn't hear so well in her left side, so... so don't sneak up on her anymore.
No way.
Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.
Let's go eat.
It's good, Rachel.
Okay, you guys, come on.
Careful, careful,
Gabby.
All right. Come on.
Somebody else want some?
There we go.
So, Prot, Mark tells me you don't eat meat.
- That's very healthy.
- Speak for yourself.
Burger.
Burger.
You got it?
Yes, I want burgers, thank you. It's good.
Everything looks so good.
Pass me one of those hamburgers.
Come on.
Give me a push.
There's a photograph on the piano of a young man with all the others.
That's Michael.
That's Mark's son from his first marriage.
How many marriages has he had?
Just the two... so far.
So far?
No, I mean, he's not out to set a world record or anything.
But the young man in the photograph, he's not here today.
No, um, he doesn't live with us.
You know, he's away at college and... and the truth is, he and Mark don't talk to each other.
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
Probably because I'm a locked-up lunatic, so what harm could it do.
Maybe.
Maybe that's it.
Dr. Powell's been trying to teach me the importance... you beings place on your biological connections.
Hmm.
You think he means it?
You don't?
Do you know what a family is?
You worry.
They don't tell you that, you know.
You don't have a family.
No.
We don't have families on K-PAX.
Well, you don't know what you're missing.
I'll get you some more lemonade.
Hula, hula
All right. Incoming.
That's beautiful.
Thank you.
Fourth of July.
Thank you for inviting me here today, Mark.
You're most welcome, Prot.
Come push me on the swing!
I'll show you a trick.
This is called...
go to the Table.
Okay, but first you have to hold on very tight.
- Okay.
- Ready?
This is fun!
Come on, let's go!
Come on! Come on!
Watch out.
Watch out.
Let's go in the water!
- No, don't.
- Come on!
No, don't go.
Don't go. Let's go!
- Hey! Let go!
- Don't go in the water!
- Don't! No, don't!
- Let go!
Mom! No!
No, you stay! No!
Natalie? Natalie!
Mark! Mark!
Prot!
- Hey, this guy's as strong as an ox!
- Betty, quick!
Turn off the goddamn water!
- Stay there, Josh.
- I'll turn it off! - I got it.
It's okay.
Prot?
It's okay. It's okay.
No, no, no, it's okay, Betty.
Where are his glasses?
- I got it.
- Are you all right?
Prot?
You're okay.
Is that apple pie I smell?
- Sweetheart, you all right?
- Yeah.
He was pushing my daughter on a swing, like he had done a hundred times before.
Not like he was some alien from K-PAX.
I saw him.
He was connecting with something.
- Some kind of normal life.
- That's not enough.
He's a violent patient,
Mark.
He's not violent.
Something violent happened to him.
Something in his past.
When he was going after Natalie, he wasn't trying to harm her, he was trying to protect her.
From the sprinklers?
I'm not sure from what.
I need more than a hunch to go on, otherwise I have to send him upstairs.
We need to regress him... take him back into the past, find out what happened and have him confront it.
Regress him? Do you have any idea how risky it is to regress a patient like this one?
It's his only chance.
Claudia, we have to push him.
There's no time.
He told me that he's going back to K-PAX on July 27.
That's in three weeks.
I think that he could become violent on that day.
Hurt himself, somebody else.
You know what the problem is, Mark.
You're too close to this patient.
Everybody else can see it but you.
I am transferring him to the fourth floor, and that's final.
I know I'm too close to him.
All right, fine. I admit it.
Why choose this one to save, Mark?
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe because I feel... he chose me.
Has anyone seen Prot?
He went up north for a few days.
North?
Greenland. Iceland.
You know.
He had a few countries left to visit before he could finish his report.
Don't worry, Dr. Powell.
He'll be back.
How do you know, Ernie?
Because he took his glasses with him, darling.
When he returns to K-PAX, he won't need them.
Patients do not escape from this institution. They don't escape.
There has been no evidence of escape, but obviously, I've notified the police, social services.
I'm gonna have a great time explaining this to the state board.
I got psychotics on the fourth floor packing up their sneakers... because they all think they're going off to K-PAX.
- Claudia...
- Find him.
Well, what about city shelters?
Have you...
Have you checked?
No.
No, I'm not telling you how to do your job.
Uh... Thank...
Thank you.
Dr. Powell,
I presume.
Where the hell have you been?
Newfoundland, Greenland,
Iceland, uh, Labrador...
All right, cut the crap. We've been looking for you for three days.
I believe I mentioned my taking a trip up north, Mark, in this very garden.
"Taking a trip"?
You're a patient here.
You don't leave here without a discharge.
And don't give me this beam-of-light shit, because I don't buy it.
What would you say if I were to tell you... that I don't believe you took any trip at all... to Iceland or Greenland or anywhere?
That I don't believe you're from K-PAX?
I believe you're as human as I am.
I would say you're in need of a Thorazine drip, Doctor.
Well, there... there is one way...
You could convince me beyond any doubt.
Of course,
I would need your consent.
It's called hypnosis.
I just don't see the point.
Let me tell you what your alternative is.
A trip to a place where they'll stick a needle in your ass every morning, which may or may not leave you with a stupid grin on your face... for the rest of your days here on Earth.
Is that what you'd like?
Prot?
I want to help you.
What we're going to be doing,
Prot, is a bit like daydreaming.
I'm gonna count from one to five.
On the count of three, your eyes will close, and you will find yourself in a very nice, deep, comfortable, relaxed state of hypnosis.
One. Your eyes are starting to get very heavy now.
Two. I want you to use your imagination...
and imagine small lead weights on your eyelids...
that are just making them so... heavy.
- Pulse rate is 40 B.P.M.
- Three.
- Keep your eyes closed.
- I'd be concerned if he were human.
Let yourself go way, way down deep.
Four. Let a wave of relaxation move through your body now...
as you go down even deeper.
And five, going way, way down deep.
You are in a relaxed state of hypnosis now.
How do you feel?
Like... nothing.
I want you to go back in time.
I want you to recall the first experience that you can remember.
What do you see?
What was that?
What do you see?
Uh...
I see... casket.
Silver... with a blue lining.
Whose casket is it?
It's the father of a friend of mine.
What's your friend's name?
I'm not telling.
Do you know how your friend's father died?
He had an accident at the place that he worked at.
He was killed in an accident?
He... He was hurt and then died later?
Where did he work?
The place where they kill cows.
Where is this place?
The pulse rate just shot up ten B.P.M.s.
Do you know...
Do you know where this place is?
I-I want you to relax.
I want to move forward in time now.
Where are you?
It's nighttime.
We're in his house.
- At the other boy's house?
- Yeah.
I want him to come outside.
Why?
To look at the stars.
That's where I come from, you know.
Is your name Prot?
Wow.
How did you know that?
Where are you from, Prot?
I'm from the planet K-PAX.
It's in the constellation Lyra.
Do you know all the constellations?
Yeah. Most of 'em.
And does your friend know them too?
Yes, he does.
When his dad got sick and had to stay home, they got a telescope, and his dad taught him about all the constellations.
But he's not interested in those right now.
Why not?
Something happened.
That's why he called me.
He calls me when something bad happens.
Like when his father died?
That's right.
How do you know to come?
How does the boy call you?
I don't know. I just come.
I just... I just know.
How do you get to Earth?
I wanna go outside.
Can I go outside?
Uh, read... read his body language, Mark.
I-I don't think he wants to talk anymore today.
All right. Prot?
I want you to just relax now.
Think about the stars.
That's right. I'm gonna count backwards now from five to one, and you'll find yourself wide-awake and refreshed.
Five. You're starting to come out of it now.
Four.
You're feeling more alert.
Three.
Even more alert.
Two.
You're becoming awake now.
And one.
So when do we begin?
It's already over.
Oh, the old "fastest gun in the West" routine, huh?
Let's find the locations of all the slaughter houses operating in the United States.
I mean, how many can there be?
I don't know.
We eliminate, uh, the ones in or near big cities... and we concentrate on small towns, rural areas,
You know, places where you can see the stars.
Joyce, we only have six days.
Shall I bring the crystal or leave it here?
I suppose I won't really need it on K-PAX.
I don't even know what they drink.
Dream on, sister.
He can only take one of us with him.
Why the hell would he take a stinker like you? He's taking me.
How dare you!
I do not stink.
Nah, forget it, ho.
I'm the one goin'.
Yeah?
Which one of you?
Okay.
Who would like to begin?
Ernie. Uh, I-I was...
I was wondering if it was possible... for us to have Cream of Wheat instead of oatmeal.
Not again.
Howie.
I have a suggestion, because there's really, really not much time.
I would like to propose an essay contest... to decide once and for all who will go with Prot.
I've spoken with him, and he's agreed to read them all by July 27.
So if anyone would like to be considered, please state your reasons in a clear, legible hand... and return them to me.
Russell.
Yes?
Would I get to take my bible to K-PAX?
Of course you would.
We can finish the essays later.
Now, I want you to go back in time again,
but not so far back as last time.
Is your friend there?
Is he with you now?
Yeah.
What's his name?
I'm not tellin'.
Prot, I would like to know your friend's name.
Well, I ain't gonna tell ya.
Well, we have to call him something.
How about Pete?
Well, that's not his name, but whatever thrills you.
What year is it?
It's 1985.
How old are you?
One hundred and seventy-five.
- How old is Pete?
- Seventeen.
Tell me about Pete.
What happened?
Is there a problem?
Is that why he called you?
He's got a girlfriend.
- And the problem is with the girlfriend? - She's pregnant.
He can see it all coming right down the road. You get married, have a bunch of kids, wind up in the same job that killed your dad.
- He blames her for this?
- Oh, no, no, no.
He doesn't blame her.
No, he just...
He...
How did he put it?
He hates the chains that people shackle themselves with.
I mean, we don't have all that crap on K-PAX.
All right, Prot.
I want you to listen to me carefully.
I want to move forward in time again.
Oh, say, two weeks.
You...
If you would like to open your eyes or move around, you may.
- Would you like to?
- I know that.
Prot?
- Prot, when...
- It's, uh,
1991, according to your earth calendar.
And your friend Pete called you?
Not for anything in particular.
He just... sometimes wants to talk things over... with someone every now and then.
Tell me about Pete now.
- He's a knocker.
- A "knocker"?
A knocker is the guy that knocks the cow inside of the head... so it won't struggle while they slit its throat.
I know.
It's barbaric, isn't it?
Does he still live in the same town?
Oh, just outside of town.
He's got a little place, but he's fixed it up nice.
It's got some... trees and a couple of acres, and... and a river.
It reminds me of K-PAX, except for the river.
Tell me, did he ever marry that pregnant girl?
Wow, what a memory.
Yeah, they got married, but she's no longer pregnant.
Why, that was six years ago.
I've forgotten her name.
S...
I didn't tell you her name.
Can you tell me now?
Sara.
Did they have a son or a daughter?
Rebecca.
Rebecca.
It's her birthday next week.
- Chak, what's happened?
- Howie tried to kill Ernie.
- What?
- He's fine.
- Ernie?
- I feel wonderful, Dr. Powell.
- For heaven's sake.
- What happened?
Absolutely wonderful.
My good friend Howie, he just about strangled me to death.
What?
Son of a bitch,
I love him.
Ernie, I don't understand.
You should've seen it.
I was asleep.
You know, the way I like... my hands tied and everything.
He wrapped something around my neck... a handkerchief or something...
and then tightened it.
There wasn't a damn thing
I could do about it.
Well, when I stopped breathing, he lifted me onto the gurney, rushed me up here, and they brought me back as quick as they could.
And when I woke up,
You know what I realized,
Dr. Powell?
Dying.
Dying's something you have no control over.
Why waste your life being afraid of it?
I'll sleep on my stomach from now on.
I'll eat fish with bones in it.
I'll swallow the biggest pill you can find. Bring it on.
I feel good.
That's terrific, Ernie.
- See you at our session tomorrow? - Yes.
I cured him, didn't I?
Prot says one more task and I'll be cured too.
And then it's... bon voyage.
Tell me your name, damn it.
I'm gonna give you a specific date, and I want you to remember where you were and what you were doing on that day.
Do you understand?
Perfectly well, my dear sir.
The date is July 27, 1996.
I'm on K-PAX.
Are you sure?
Quite sure, governor.
I'm harvesting croppins for a meal.
Croppins are a fungi, like, uh, your truffles.
Big truffles. Delicious.
Do you like tru...
Wait a minute.
- There it is.
- What? Is it Pete?
Yes.
I sense something is wrong.
He needs me.
I'm now on Earth.
I'm with him.
And where are you?
What are you doing?
By a river... in the back of his house.
It's dark.
He's taking off his clothes.
Why is he doing that?
- He's...
- What?
What is he doing?
He's trying to kill himself.
Why does he want to kill himself?
Because something terrible has happened.
Has he done something?
Has he done something he shouldn't have?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Prot, I'm trying to help him.
I can't help him unless he tells me what happened.
He knows that.
Well, then, why won't he tell me?
Because then you would know... what even he doesn't want to know.
Then you have to help him, Prot.
You have to help him tell me what happened.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Are you fucking deaf?
Time is running out for him.
Time is running out for everyone.
He jumps in.
He's floating.
Pulse is up to 140.
Respiration's at 30.
For God's sake, man, bring him back.
All right.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
You can save him.
You're his friend.
I am his friend.
That's why I won't try.
- Save him!
- No.
I can't.
The cur...
The current is too strong.
There's no chance.
- I... cannot.
- Listen to me.
You've helped a lot of patients here.
You've helped Mrs. Archer.
You've helped Howie and Ernie.
I'm gonna ask you to help cure Pete now.
Let's call it a task.
I want you to let me speak to him.
If he's listening, I want him to know that he can trust me.
I want him to know that if it was Sara or Rebecca that he did something...
- Get in there. - No, no, no, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No. No, stay back.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Shh.
That's okay.
It's all right now.
I'm gonna count backwards now from five to one, and as I count, you'll become more and more alert.
On the count of one
I'll snap my fingers, and you'll wake up feeling refreshed.
Five. You're starting to come out of it.
Four. You're becoming more alert.
Three.
Even more alert.
Two. You're starting to wake up now.
And one.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Feeling fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Is this... Is this area code 5-0-5?
Where are you?
New Mexico, sir.
New Mexico?
"Salva."
Salvation.
Salvation!
There are a dozen Salvation Army shelters in New Mexico.
Albuquerque,
Las Cruces, Roswell.
Wait a minute.
There's one in Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa.
Guelph.
That's pretty damn close to Santa Rosa.
What's the biggest local newspaper for that region?
Guadalupe County Observer, covering Guadalupe County.
All right.
Bring that up.
Go to July 27, 1996.
"'Swap meet, livestock sale."'
Wait.
Go to the 28th.
Okay.
There it is!
"Robert Porter. Drowned!"
His name... is Robert Porter.
Robert Porter.
Ah, here it is.
Yeah, I do remember this case.
It was about the biggest thing ever happened around these parts.
He was a quiet type.
As I recall, he was a real smart fella.
Kind of brainy.
Strong as a horse, though, and worked as a knocker.
Lived about 20 miles outside of town with his-his wife and child.
Sarah.
His wife's name was Sarah.
That's right.
Damn shame what happened.
You got time to take a ride?
Yeah.
Well, it's been empty.
Yeah, nobody comes around here much anymore... since all that happened.
Ain't no livin' next of kin to give the place to anyway.
I had detectives come down from Albuquerque... to try and piece this one together.
Well, accordin' to the official story,
Porter, he was at work when this, uh, this drifter,
Darryl Walker, come by the house.
Two-time parolee lookin' for trouble.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Started out as a robbery.
The wife and the daughter were out back.
Sarah?
Sarah?
From what we can gather from forensics and all, this Walker, he, uh... he forced the two women into the house.
Raped the wife,
killed 'em both.
Porter, he must've come home and found Walker still here.
God.
Snapped a grown man's neck like it was a twig.
Can't say I wouldn't have done the same myself.
Uh, the river's this way.
They found the clothes there.
That's probably where he jumped in.
And this river can be pretty treacherous.
Even in July it's got a hell of a current.
Still, I suppose it might have been a mistake, officially, to declare it a drowning when the body was never found.
Doc, if that boy you got back there in
New York is really Robert Porter,
I'd just as soon not know about it.
Know what I mean?
Mark.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Never do that again.
I won't.
What happened?
I found what
I was looking for.
- You sure?
- Yeah.

Prot.
Have a seat.
You all packed?
Ready to go?
Quite ready.
I travel light.
That's a joke,
Mark.
You humans.
There's just no sense of humour.
I doubt, uh,
Freud ever tried this, but before someone goes away, we usually like to send them off with a little toast.
Scotch okay, or would you prefer something more fruity?
I will try the scotch.
Well, here's to a... safe journey.
Tell you the truth,
K-PAX sounds like a beautiful place.
I'd like to see it sometime.
Think there's a chance of that?
I think you should see more of your world.
As a matter of fact, I think you should see more of your own family.
Invite your son for Christmas.
I may just do that, Prot.
You know what I've learned about your planet?
There's enough life on Earth to fill 50 planets... plants, animals, people, fungi, viruses... all jostling to find their place, bouncing off each other, feeding off each other, connected.
You don't have that kind of connection on K-PAX?
Nobody wants, nobody needs.
On K-PAX, when I'm gone, nobody misses me.
There would be no reason to.
And yet I sense that when I leave here,
I will be missed.
Yes.
Strange feeling.
You don't have to leave, Prot.
I'm sure there must be some way that I can help you... to stay as one of us.
I will miss you, Dr. Powell.
Oh.
And I have to finish my report, but...
I seem to have misplaced my pencil.
Take mine.
A much more efficient writing tool.
Adios, my friend.
Prot?
I wanna show you something.
That is Robert Porter.
Prot, that's you.
You and Robert Porter are the same person.
That's patently absurd.
I'm not even human.
Can't you at least admit the possibility?
I will admit the possibility that I am Robert Porter... if you will admit the possibility... that I am from K-PAX.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a beam of light to catch.
Oh, Mark.
Now that you've found Robert, please take good care of him.

I can't stand it.
I... I can't stand this!
I demand to know... which one of us is goin' with you.
Well, I can tell you this.
There's extra points for the one who goes to sleep first.
Out of my way!
Oh, my gosh.
You never gave me my last task.
What's my last task?
To stay here.
And be prepared... for anything.
You look tired, Doc. Why don't you get a few hours of rest?
- He's not goin' anywhere.
- Uh...
We got seven hours.
I'll see you in four, hmm?
Get some rest.
You're gonna eat.
You need some food and you need to sleep.
Chow Fun.
Oh, the place on Broadway with the ugly lanterns in the window?
The mean waiter always shouted at us.
Their fortune cookies never had any fortunes in 'em.
We never needed any.
I knew my fortune that night.
He was sitting right in front of me.
Hope he still is.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
- Look, 20 says he goes.
- You're on.
Shit!
Oh, damn it!
Two minutes.
You know where Dr. Powell is?
I'll buzz him.
One minute.
Here comes Dr. Powell!
He's moving.
Repeat:
He's moving!
What the hell?
Wait for me, you...
Son of a bitch.
Oh, God.
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
- Call a code blue.
- Help me. Let's get him.
- Who's that? - Beats me.
How'd he get in here?
- That's not Prot.
- He's definitely not Prot.
Certainly not.
Prot's gone.
Where's Bess?
Where's Bess? Bess?
He chose Bess.
Bitch!
Good-bye, Bess.
Good for you, homegirl.
Bess went to K-PAX.
Patient 287, Robert Porter.
How I wish I could say that
Robert sat up one fine day... and said, "'I'm hungry.
Got any fruit?"'
Like most catatonics, he probably hears every word we say... but refuses or is unable to respond.
Nevertheless,
I keep him up to date.
Let's see.
I told you about Howie.
He got that job at the public library.
And Ernie, he's determined to be a crisis counselor.
The only one we're, uh, really concerned about is Bess.
You know, we've checked halfway houses, shelters, churches, bus stops.
Nothing.
Uh, we don't understand.
It's like... people don't just disappear.
July 27th?
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Robert?
No.
Well, maybe it'll come to you.
Whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.
I want to tell you something, Mark, something you do not yet know, but we K-PAXians have been around long enough to have discovered.
The universe will expand, then it will collapse back on itself, and then it will expand again.
It will repeat this process forever.
What you don't know is that when the universe expands again, everything will be as it is now.
What ever mistakes you make this time around, you will live through on your next pass.
Every mistake you make... you will live through... again and again, forever.
So my advice to you is to get it right this time around, because this time... is all you have.
- You're lookin' great,
Michael. - Think so?
Thanks.
How you doin'?
Good. How was your...
How was your trip?
Was it...
Was it good?

{1236}{1278}exists a magical place...
{1279}{1343}where wondrous creatures|with incredible powers...
{1343}{1387}help make dreams come true.
{1415}{1483}It's the world of Pokemon.
{2261}{2353}People can capture Pokemon|to be more than just pets.
{2354}{2393}Human trainers|and their Pokemon...
{2394}{2464}compete against others|in amazing contests...
{2465}{2509}of skill and strategy.
{2510}{2613}The best trainers one day|become Pokemon masters.
{2614}{2681}That's a dream that|burns brightly for many...
{2682}{2753}but none more so|than Ash Ketchum.
{2800}{2865}The pride of Pallet Town|began his Pokemon journey...
{2866}{2907}on his tenth birthday.
{2908}{2994}That's the day he qualified|to become a Pokemon trainer.
{3008}{3084}Professor Oak gave Ash|his very first Pokeball.
{3085}{3136}Inside was|an electric Pokemon...
{3137}{3225}with whom Ash would spark|a lifelong friendship--Pikachu.
{3226}{3255}Pikachu!
{3256}{3301}Together, Ash and Pikachu|are determined...
{3302}{3340}to fulfill his dream...
{3341}{3399}of becoming the world's|greatest Pokemon master.
{3400}{3448}Joining them on their quest|are Misty...

{5517}{5542}don't move a muscle.
{5543}{5566}Huh?
{5567}{5611}Don't tell me|you haven't heard about it.
{5612}{5637}No, I haven't.
{5638}{5673}What's the Voice|of the Forest?
{5674}{5706}Well, it's only a legend...
{5707}{5764}but everyone around here|believes it.
{5765}{5815}They say there's a sound|you can hear...
{5816}{5857}when the spirit|that protects the forest...
{5858}{5884}is time-traveling.
{5885}{5920}Time-traveling?
{5921}{5964}That's one of|its special powers.
{5965}{6043}It can go back and forth|between the past and the future.
{6044}{6077}Wow.
{6078}{6123}So if you hear|a weird sound...
{6124}{6174}stop and stay|completely still.
{6175}{6208}If the spirit|catches you...
{6209}{6257}it could carry you off|to a different time.
{6258}{6300}Don't worry.|I'll be careful.
{6301}{6326}Mm.
{6327}{6363}Thanks. Bye.
{6390}{6415}Wait.

{6571}{6608}that's full of berries|from the forest.
{6609}{6653}It might come in handy|if you get hungry.
{6677}{6708}Here.

{9821}{9858}Celebi?
{9886}{9940}Why should I hand it over?|What do you want with it?
{9941}{9984}I'm a Pokemon hunter, kid.
{9985}{10040}I make good money|off of rare Pokemon.
{10041}{10088}First I catch 'em,|then I auction 'em off...
{10089}{10118}to the highest bidders.
{10119}{10176}Well, you're not gonna get|your hands on this Pokemon!
{10177}{10204}Give it to me!

{10944}{10988}Huh?
{10989}{11034}Bi-i-i-i-i-i!
{12291}{12355}I'll tell you why I'm here.
{12385}{12426}I'm here|because I heard a story...
{12427}{12465}that you almost|caught a Celebi...
{12466}{12538}somewhere in this forest|about 40 years ago--true?
{12539}{12590}I'm still a Pokemon hunter!
{12591}{12637}I'm not gonna tell you anything!
{12638}{12704}Heh heh.|We'll see about that.
{12929}{12955}OK.
{12956}{12993}Sneasel! Sneasel!
{12994}{13026}Sneasel!
{13230}{13274}What's that thing?
{13275}{13303}A Dark Ball.
{13304}{13330}What's it do?
{13331}{13384}Allow me to demonstrate.
{13532}{13590}The Pokemon I catch|with the Dark Ball...
{13591}{13628}become evil Pokemon...
{13629}{13718}and their power instantly|increases to the highest level.
{13719}{13777}Come on out, Tyranitar!
{14016}{14055}Hyper Beam Attack!
{14506}{14533}No, please!
{14534}{14579}It's gonna destroy everything!
{14580}{14606}Uhh!
{14607}{14678}Aah! Aah! All right!|All right!
{14679}{14728}I'll show you!|I'll show you the spot...
{14729}{14771}where I found that Celebi!
{14772}{14811}Heh heh heh heh heh.
{14812}{14869}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14870}{14913}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14914}{14986}I thought|you'd see it my way.
{15781}{15823}Today we find our friends...
{15824}{15868}waiting for a ferry|that will carry them...
{15869}{15910}to yet another Pokemon gym...
{15911}{15972}as they continue|their Johto League journey.
{15973}{16012}Brock and Misty are ready.
{16013}{16068}The passengers|are hurrying aboard...
{16069}{16135}and it's almost time|for the boat to leave.
{16135}{16178}But where are|Ash and Pikachu?
{16196}{16270}Well, if they don't come soon|they're gonna miss the boat.
{16271}{16303}T ogepi!
{16303}{16336}Crobat, go!
{16405}{16431}Crobat!
{16459}{16491}Cro!
{16491}{16522}My name's Dundee...
{16523}{16587}and I'm the best Pokemon|trainer in the whole town.
{16587}{16615}Well, my name's Ash...
{16616}{16680}and I'm a pretty good|Pokemon trainer, too.
{16681}{16744}Why don't you pick a Pokemon,|and we can have a battle.
{16745}{16768}Pika!
{16769}{16809}Croconaw, go!
{16841}{16875}Croconaw!
{16921}{16951}A Croconaw, huh?
{16951}{17001}Never battled|one of those before.
{17002}{17067}OK, Pikachu, let's go!
{17067}{17095}Pika!
{17096}{17194}Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon,|Pokemon, Pokemon
{17195}{17231}Let's do it
{18137}{18179}Thunder Shock Attack!
{20519}{20558}So, sounds like|you're all...
{20559}{20610}pretty interested|in Pokemon, huh?
{20611}{20635}Yeah.
{20636}{20681}I come from a place|just up the river...
{20682}{20717}and a lot|of real unusual ones...
{20718}{20753}Iive in the forest nearby.
{20754}{20793}Hey, if you could show us|where it is...
{20794}{20832}maybe we could stop|and check it out.
{20833}{20875}No problem.|We can get off...
{20876}{20908}at the next stop,|and I'll take you...
{20909}{20943}the rest of the way|in my boat.
{20944}{20982}Great. Thanks.
{20983}{21006}Pika!
{21007}{21042}ALL: Huh?
{21043}{21075}ASH: Ohh.
{21101}{21162}Hey, was that a Pokemon?
{21163}{21196}Looked like one to me.
{21197}{21276}You'll see the woods|around here are full of them.
{21336}{21401}There's one more possibility.
{21402}{21442}Did it look|anything like this?
{21443}{21491}Yeah, that's it, Professor.
{21507}{21545}It was a Suicune.
{21546}{21574}A Suicune?
{21575}{21617}What kind of Pokemon|is that, Professor?
{21618}{21664}It's one of the legendary|Pokemon, Brock...
{21665}{21701}and not very much|is known about it.
{21702}{21742}And according|to folk tales...
{21743}{21794}Suicune personifies|the north wind...
{21795}{21840}and it's believed|to have the power...
{21841}{21883}to purify tainted waters.
{21884}{21938}Wow, I hope I get|to see Suicune again.
{21939}{21996}Its sounds like|it's a pretty cool one.
{21997}{22039}Believe you me, kids...
{22040}{22096}those tales|are definitely true.
{22097}{22160}Really? How do you know that|for sure, Professor?
{22161}{22213}Have you ever seen|a Suicune before?
{22214}{22280}Yes, I sure have,|but only one time.
{22281}{22311}Wow! Where?
{22312}{22363}Hey, Ash, come on!
{22364}{22395}We've gotta go!
{22395}{22425}OK!
{22426}{22468}Uh, bye, Professor.
{22737}{22819}I wonder if I should've told him|before he hung up.
{22820}{22855}Hmm.
{22937}{22974}The quicker we get|into that forest...
{22975}{23025}the quicker we can look|for those Pokemon.
{23026}{23072}Maybe even that Suicune.
{23160}{23206}Those twerps won't get away now.
{23207}{23238}They're right beneath us.
{23239}{23285}Of course, they're|beneath us. They're twerps.
{23286}{23354}Now all we do is|swoop in and swipe Pikachu.
{23355}{23403}Uh-oh. Something's wrong|with my leg.
{23404}{23445}All this pedaling|is giving me a cramp.
{23446}{23470}Oh! Ow!
{23471}{23533}Aah! You can't cramp!|We'll crash!
{23967}{23993}All right.
{23994}{24042}What do we do now?
{24043}{24091}Don't worry, Misty.|You'll see.
{24125}{24148}-Whoa.|-Pi?
{24149}{24179}Toge?
{24289}{24343}Toge! Toge!|Toge! Toge!
{24547}{24571}Ha ha ha!
{24571}{24605}Toge-togepi!
{24710}{24746}Well, we're here.
{24747}{24801}Here? Where?
{24802}{24837}Look closer.
{24872}{24904}Tree houses?
{24905}{24938}Togepi!
{24939}{25014}That's right, Brock.|Welcome to Arborville.
{25347}{25370}Pika?
{25371}{25397}-Whoa.|-Prrri!
{25467}{25499}Stop right there!
{25500}{25534}Huh?
{25562}{25610}I suppose you kids|are heading into the forest...
{25611}{25643}to look for Pokemon.
{25644}{25680}Yes, ma'am.
{25681}{25730}Then you're gonna love|what you see in there.
{25731}{25787}I love what I see here!|My name's Brock...
{25788}{25831}and I'm studying to|become a Pokemon breeder...
{25832}{25881}but my specialty|is human relations.
{25882}{25904}Oh?
{25905}{25939}Please tell me your name!
{25940}{26003}My name's Diana,|and that's my grandma.
{26004}{26042}She's been guarding|the entrance to the forest...
{26043}{26073}since she was my age.
{26074}{26121}Listen for The Voice|of the Forest...
{26122}{26179}and if you hear it,|stop and be still...
{26180}{26227}or you will not get away.
{26228}{26263}The Voice of the Forest?
{26264}{26303}It's an old village legend.
{26304}{26353}Yes, it's a legend,|and a true one.
{26354}{26409}If you hear The Voice,|stop where you are.
{26410}{26440}Uh, we gotta hurry...
{26441}{26492}but thanks a lot for|the warning, ma'am.
{26493}{26519}Pika!
{26520}{26587}Diana, why don't you|come, too, and protect us?
{26588}{26640}Then she'd need|protection from you.
{26853}{26906}I wonder what|Diana's grandmother meant...
{26907}{26959}by 'The Voice|of the Forest. "
{26960}{27015}Maybe the sound of the wind|or the trees...
{27016}{27085}the water, or maybe|the voices of the Pokemon.
{27156}{27179}Pi?
{27180}{27247}Ohh. I wonder what that is.
{27248}{27282}Maybe it's The Voice|of the Forest.
{27283}{27311}-Come on!|-Pika!
{27312}{27337}Ash, no!
{27338}{27387}Hey, shouldn't we stand still?
{27388}{27435}Uh...wait up!
{27906}{27949}Bi.
{27950}{27974}Bi.
{28001}{28028}Bi.
{28097}{28139}Hey, it's a kid.
{28151}{28176}Is he OK?
{28177}{28202}He's still breathing.
{28203}{28234}Yeah.
{28235}{28269}Let's take him|back to Diana's house.
{28270}{28294}Good idea.
{28295}{28323}Yeah.
{28324}{28359}Bi...
{28360}{28426}I wonder what that light was.
{28459}{28528}Hey! Diana!
{28529}{28611}Diana! We need help!
{28611}{28668}Oh, dear. What's happened?
{28699}{28750}Hey, Ash, he's waking up.
{28811}{28862}Take it easy.|You're gonna be OK.
{28863}{28892}Pika.
{28893}{28923}Uhh.
{28951}{28976}Uhh!
{28977}{29032}What'd you do with that Celebi?
{29055}{29096}Hey, I'm trying to help you!
{29097}{29139}That's enough, you two.|Knock it off.
{29140}{29166}Settle down!
{29167}{29201}Who are you anyway?
{29202}{29226}Huh?
{29227}{29275}Where am l?
{29275}{29314}Howd I get here?
{29315}{29367}I carried you here|on my back, that's how!
{29368}{29398}What's going on?
{29399}{29430}MlSTY:|We found him unconscious...
{29431}{29478}when we were out|in the forest.
{29479}{29503}Oh!
{29503}{29552}Oh-oh-oh!
{29553}{29611}I can't believe it.|It's really you.
{29612}{29635}Huh?
{29636}{29670}You've come back.
{29671}{29729}Oh, thank goodness!
{29730}{29753}Uh, Grandma...
{29754}{29804}where did he|come back from?
{29805}{29850}Diana, I've told you|the story...
{29851}{29900}about what happened|when I was a young girl.
{29901}{29956}A little boy disappeared|from the forest.
{29957}{30011}But this boy can't be him.
{30011}{30051}Well, maybe it can't be...
{30052}{30092}-but it is.|-Huh?
{30191}{30233}Ah! You're the girl...
{30234}{30284}who gave me|the loaf of bread.
{30285}{30321}Yes.
{30367}{30397}Here.
{30398}{30477}I've kept this all these years|in case you ever came back.
{30607}{30677}This is my sketchbook.|How--
{30678}{30705}You've been away...
{30706}{30760}on a 40-year-long journey,|young man.
{30761}{30790}40 years?
{30791}{30818}What do you mean?
{30819}{30857}The legend says|The Voice of the Forest...
{30858}{30924}can catch a person and take them|on a trip through time.
{30925}{30973}-Huh?|-Through time?
{31133}{31156}Stantler?|Stan--
{31157}{31192}Stantler!
{31393}{31416}Uhh!
{31417}{31450}Where's Celebi?
{31451}{31486}What happened to Celebi?
{31487}{31511}Celebi?
{31512}{31567}Was there a Pokemon|with me in the forest?
{31567}{31609}We didn't see any.
{31610}{31668}The Pokemon you met|that day was a Celebi?
{31669}{31702}Yes.
{31703}{31764}We know Celebi|as The Voice of the Forest...
{31765}{31815}the spirit that protects it.
{31816}{31866}They say that Celebi|can travel through time.
{31867}{31903}You two must've been|in danger...
{31904}{31942}and Celebi just picked|the fastest way...
{31943}{31969}to get you out of it.
{31970}{32006}It's must've|escaped to the future...
{32007}{32039}and taken you along with it.
{32039}{32070}I'm afraid you're right.
{32071}{32138}Celebi lives|deep in the forest...
{32139}{32206}in a place we call|"The Lake of Life."
{32207}{32275}That's probably where|it's gone back to now.
{32275}{32342}I've got a feeling Celebi|still may be hurt.
{32355}{32427}I have to go back into|that forest and find Celebi.
{32427}{32452}I'll go, too!
{32453}{32478}Me, too!
{32479}{32503}So will l!
{32504}{32530}Togepi!
{32531}{32558}My name's Brock...
{32559}{32591}and I'm a Pokemon breeder.
{32591}{32615}I'm Sam.
{32616}{32639}And I'm Misty.
{32640}{32695}My specialty is water Pokemon.
{32695}{32726}My name's Ash Ketchum...
{32727}{32776}and I'm trying|to be a Pokemon master.
{32777}{32802}Pika!
{32803}{32851}Oh, yeah,|and this is Pikachu.
{32851}{32880}Pikachu!
{32881}{32931}Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam.
{32954}{33019}Our glider|didn't glide very well.
{33019}{33087}Next time|we spring for a motor.
{33088}{33135}I wonder where|those twerps are.
{33136}{33192}We may never know.|Huh?
{33193}{33217}-Huh?|-Huh?
{33218}{33278}Well, well.
{33279}{33320}I can't believe my eyes.
{33321}{33355}Looks like it's a good thing...
{33356}{33398}we crashed after|all, eh, Meowth?
{33399}{33449}Come on, let's get down|and tail them twerps!
{33492}{33517}Pika!
{33518}{33554}Pikachu!
{33598}{33640}Pi--pi--pi--pi--
{33641}{33670}Pi--Pika!
{33671}{33700}Guys, look up there!
{33857}{33913}The Pokemon|are all together.
{33973}{34021}I'm coming, too!
{34133}{34179}Ash climbs just like a Mankey.
{34180}{34207}Togepi!
{34237}{34260}Pi!
{34303}{34332}-Aah!|-Pika!
{34401}{34466}Sam, maybe you should wait|down with Brock and Misty.
{34467}{34516}No. I have to find Celebi.
{34517}{34559}I couldn't|protect it before...
{34559}{34595}so I've gotta help it now.
{34645}{34747}I know how you feel, Sam,|but take it easy.
{34764}{34844}Pi! Pi! Pi! Pi!
{35024}{35063}Uh. Ah!
{35064}{35169}Bi...bi.
{35170}{35206}Hey.
{35207}{35237}Is this the Celebi?
{35238}{35261}Mm-hmm.
{35262}{35293}Come on, Celebi.
{35294}{35339}Bi. Bi!
{35375}{35435}Whoa! Unh!
{35435}{35491}Hey! What'd you do that for?
{35546}{35609}I think Ash just evolved|into a primate.
{35610}{35651}We're only trying to help you.
{35652}{35689}Bi!
{35721}{35746}Whoa!
{35747}{35795}What's going on?
{35795}{35851}Pika--
{35851}{35896}No, Pikachu, don't!
{35925}{35959}Don't be mad at it.
{35959}{35997}It's just afraid...
{35998}{36031}and it's hurt, too.
{36031}{36067}A hunter attacked it.
{36067}{36101}That's why it's scared.
{36102}{36151}OK. Here goes.
{36247}{36289}Celebi, we're your friends.
{36290}{36333}We don't want to hurt you.
{36334}{36369}We just want to help you.
{36370}{36396}Bi!
{36423}{36462}I tried to help you before.
{36463}{36508}Don't you remember, Celebi?
{36509}{36556}I got you away|from the Pokemon hunter.
{36557}{36591}It's OK.
{36591}{36637}Bi?
{36674}{36728}You just take it easy.
{36729}{36767}And we will, too.
{36768}{36802}There...
{36838}{36863}Bi.
{36895}{36921}Bi?
{36947}{36993}Uh...
{36994}{37035}Ha ha!
{37273}{37331}You're safe with me, Celebi.
{37331}{37355}Bi.
{37387}{37425}Bi.
{37466}{37502}Pik--Pik--Pik...
{37558}{37591}Brock, it seems really weak.
{37592}{37636}Yeah, we better hurry.
{37637}{37675}We'll take it|to a Pokemon center.
{37676}{37699}Pika-pi!
{37700}{37736}Who are they?
{37737}{37799}Prepare for trouble.|Your future looks grim.
{37800}{37855}And we're not afraid|to go out on a limb.
{37856}{37915}To protect the world|from devastation.
{37916}{37975}To unite all peoples|within our nation.

{38155}{38187}Team Rocket...
{38187}{38228}blast off|at the speed of light.
{38261}{38319}Surrender now|or prepare to fight.
{38319}{38360}Meowth--that's right.
{38361}{38411}Wobbuffet!|Wobbuffet!
{38412}{38451}Aah!
{38484}{38507}Hmm.
{38508}{38543}Do you think|they're gonna be OK?
{38544}{38579}Unfortunately, yes.
{38580}{38610}Hmm.
{38611}{38660}You twerps got lucky this time.
{38661}{38707}They're always lucky.
{38707}{38751}Wobbuffet!
{38777}{38820}Don't press your luck, blubbo.
{38843}{38879}Hang in there, Celebi.
{38903}{38958}Look, that's|the village up there!
{39001}{39047}Aah!
{39048}{39127}I've been looking|for that little Celebi.
{39127}{39157}Who are you?
{39158}{39196}A Pokemon lover.
{39197}{39225}Leave us alone!
{39262}{39295}What does he want?
{39296}{39363}He must be trying to steal|our Pikachu away.
{39364}{39403}Well, we won't let him!
{39451}{39497}Weezing. Weezing.
{39592}{39623}Huhh!
{39722}{39750}What's that?
{39751}{39779}A Tyranitar...
{39780}{39815}but there's something|funny about it.
{39816}{39846}Hyper-beam!
{40055}{40086}Here it comes!
{40087}{40127}Pika! Pika!
{40128}{40219}Weezing!
{40219}{40300}Two can play|the Celebi-stealing game.
{40523}{40567}Who are you three?
{40568}{40603}Look at that mask.
{40604}{40633}I've seen him before.
{40634}{40696}Yeah, wasn't he in|that Mexican wrestling movie?
{40697}{40744}No, Meowth,|he's from Team Rocket.
{40745}{40795}The lron Mask Marauder!
{40796}{40848}So you heard about me.
{40849}{40876}Yeah!
{40877}{40918}Oh, yes, we've heard|a lot about you.
{40919}{40953}As you can tell|from the uniforms...
{40954}{41002}we're also members|of Team Rocket.

{41440}{41504}I think Misty's hurt.
{41505}{41580}Brock, I twisted my knee.
{41581}{41623}You better stay off it.
{41624}{41662}Pi--Pika!

{50301}{50348}This must be the Lake of Life.
{50349}{50395}Hey, that's it!|The lake water...

{54292}{54323}They're delicious.
{54324}{54350}Bi!
{54393}{54420}Bi!
{54421}{54463}I'm gonna keep some for later.
{54464}{54487}Pikachu!
{54488}{54522}Thanks for taking us here,|Celebi.
{54523}{54559}Yeah.
{54560}{54595}These are good ones.
{54596}{54640}Have some, Celebi.
{54694}{54741}Bi-bi-bi-bi!
{54742}{54790}Bi-bi-bi-bi!
{55012}{55071}Don't you worry.|We'll find Celebi.
{55119}{55166}I'd rather find some lunch.
{55167}{55194}So would l.
{55195}{55226}Or a bathroom.
{55227}{55250}-Huh?|-Huh?
{55299}{55329}Lucky us!
{55330}{55358}It's a peach tree!
{55407}{55453}Grab that big one there, Meowth.
{55454}{55478}You got it, Jessie!
{55479}{55527}Eee!
{55647}{55699}Ah! Ah!
{55700}{55732}-Hey!|-Hey!
{55863}{55907}Nice catch.
{55907}{55941}It was peachy.
{55975}{56000}Huh?
{56049}{56094}There goes our driver!
{56095}{56147}Wait! Come back!|Don't leave us!
{56148}{56196}We'll even chip in for gas!
{56578}{56625}Sammy, it's the middle|of the night.
{56626}{56671}I know, but I can't sleep.
{56801}{56832}Hey, that's great.
{56833}{56876}Thanks. When I meet|a new Pokemon...
{56877}{56916}I sketch him in this book.
{56917}{56948}Can I take a look?
{56949}{56977}Mm-hmm.
{57013}{57041}Hmm.
{57089}{57168}Oh, these are amazing!
{57169}{57222}This is like|a handmade Pokedex.
{57223}{57288}That's this machine that|has pictures of Pokemon.
{57289}{57351}I guess you know a lot|about the future, huh, Ash?
{57352}{57407}At least more than I do.
{57407}{57461}Yeah, I guess so...
{57462}{57534}but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck|in it like you are.
{57574}{57621}Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
{57838}{57922}Hey, I didn't mean|to make you feel bad, Sam.
{57923}{57956}Honest, I didn't.
{57957}{57988}That's OK.
{57989}{58035}I think I'll like|living in the future...
{58035}{58079}but it'll take|some getting used to.
{58079}{58111}Yeah. Probably.
{58112}{58185}But then I think about my mother|worrying about me...
{58186}{58234}and wondering where I am.
{58235}{58283}And I wonder|if she still wonders.
{58301}{58393}Oh. Yeah, me, too.
{58394}{58446}Hey, what about your mom, Ash?
{58447}{58489}I bet she worries about you...
{58490}{58538}when you're out on|your Pokemon journey.
{58539}{58603}Yeah, she worries, I guess.
{58633}{58689}Maybe that's just what moms do.
{58690}{58713}Mm.
{58757}{58798}Thinking about my mom...
{58799}{58842}gets me thinking|about her cooking.
{58843}{58876}Hey, I have something.
{58877}{58903}Huh?
{59042}{59095}Diana's grandmother made this...
{59096}{59149}but that was about|40 years ago.
{59150}{59195}Still looks|pretty fresh, though.
{59195}{59243}-Mm.|-Mm.
{59243}{59275}It's great!
{59275}{59323}Tastes like it was|made yesterday.
{59359}{59386}Pika?
{59387}{59435}Pika?
{59435}{59483}Bi? Bi?
{59588}{59628}What's the matter, Pikachu?
{59629}{59660}Hey, Ash, look.
{59661}{59685}Huh?
{59795}{59819}Oh.
{59819}{59843}Oh.
{60129}{60178}Oh, cool.
{60179}{60225}Wow.
{60314}{60373}Look at all the Butterfree.
{60405}{60447}I hope you'll be free, Sam.
{60448}{60471}Huh?
{60472}{60516}I mean, to go back in time.
{60517}{60540}Oh.
{60746}{60806}-Oh.|-Oh.
{60807}{60846}Free!
{60847}{60872}Wait for me!

{61139}{61169}Pika!
{61221}{61258}Ah. Whoa.
{61259}{61292}Oh, cool.
{61508}{61551}Pika!
{61967}{62002}Bi!
{62043}{62105}Well, the village|is real close now.
{62106}{62131}Bi! Bi!
{62132}{62155}Look!
{62156}{62187}Pika!
{62188}{62242}Bi-i!
{62278}{62326}Bi! Bi!
{62359}{62389}Bi!
{62390}{62435}Thought you'd gotten rid of us...
{62436}{62474}didn't you, twerps?
{62475}{62528}But Team Rocket doesn't|give up so easily!
{62529}{62565}Not you again.
{62611}{62659}All right...
{62660}{62733}we ain't leaving|without that Celebi.
{62734}{62839}Pikachu!
{62875}{62917}Nice try!
{62918}{62976}Togepi!
{63085}{63124}Oh!
{63224}{63251}Bi!
{63252}{63277}Celebi!
{63316}{63375}This ought to calm you down.
{63376}{63419}Bi!
{63420}{63458}Hey!
{63459}{63486}Pika-pi!
{63644}{63691}Dark Ball, go!
{63776}{63815}-Aah!|-Aah!

{64082}{64117}Stupid kids.
{64118}{64163}Aah! Hey! Aah!
{64396}{64424}Pika!
{64633}{64678}-Whoa!|-Aah!
{64771}{64828}Don't worry. I got ya.
{64829}{64857}Aah!
{64858}{64942}I think that Dark Ball|belongs to me.
{64943}{64985}Aah--aah!
{65227}{65250}Ash!
{65251}{65275}-Pika-pi!|-Toge!
{65276}{65319}Huh?
{65546}{65593}Don't waste your time.
{65594}{65666}It's too late to save|your friend Celebi.
{65741}{65766}Stantler.
{65804}{65885}Because the sweet little|Pokemon you used to know...
{65886}{65934}doesn't exist anymore.
{65935}{65972}Here, see for yourself!
{66114}{66186}Celebi, get rid of them all!
{66422}{66458}Aah!
{66505}{66542}Pika!
{66912}{66942}I don't understand.
{66943}{67021}If Celebi's their friend,|I'd hate to see their enemies.
{67022}{67063}Excellent.
{67064}{67123}You're very strong, Celebi.
{67124}{67212}Now show me even|more of your power!
{67413}{67454}[Laughs]
{67455}{67539}With a Pokemon like you,|no one will ever stop me!
{67540}{67593}Celebi.
{67722}{67801}Celebi's building a nasty nest.
{67802}{67841}Oh, no!
{68102}{68125}Oh.
{68126}{68174}Oh, what is that?
{68175}{68199}I don't know.
{68200}{68229}Grandma.
{68230}{68269}We'd better go find out.
{68270}{68298}Right.
{68356}{68386}Mm...uhh.
{68387}{68413}Uhh!
{68414}{68459}Celebi! Uhh!
{68460}{68492}I've gotta--
{68493}{68523}Uhh!
{68524}{68555}Take it easy, Ash.
{68556}{68608}You might be hurt.
{68686}{68717}Hey!
{68718}{68785}Hi, guys! Just stay|right where you are.
{68786}{68837}We're coming down to get you!
{68838}{68883}Diana!
{68883}{68939}I can't believe|they found us!
{69681}{69722}Uhh, this is awful.
{69723}{69771}Forcing the Spirit|of the Forest...
{69771}{69814}to destroy the forest.
{69815}{69872}This is just despicable.
{69931}{69988}Do you think Jessie's|going to be all right?
{69989}{70067}Yeah, but I ain't so sure|about Celebi. Heh.
{70401}{70466}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{70467}{70524}Uh, excuse me,|Mr. Masked Person...
{70525}{70563}but could you let me|out of here?
{70564}{70666}Not yet. I need a witness who|can report back to Giovanni.
{70667}{70716}I want the head|of Team Rocket to know...
{70717}{70771}just how powerful Celebi is...
{70772}{70827}and how powerful I am, too.
{70828}{70910}Celebi, the time has come!
{72360}{72398}I'm very impressed.
{72399}{72461}You and Celebi|are extremely powerful!
{72462}{72498}Now just get me down|from here...
{72499}{72546}and I'll recommend you|for a big promotion...
{72547}{72598}when you give Celebi|to the boss.
{72599}{72632}Ha ha ha ha ha!
{72633}{72724}I control the most powerful|Pokemon in the world!
{72725}{72780}Why would I want to give|something that valuable...
{72781}{72809}to the boss?
{72810}{72840}What do you mean?
{72841}{72902}Now the boss|has to be afraid of me...
{72903}{72978}because Celebi gives me|the power to destroy him!
{72979}{73044}With Celebi,|I can rule Team Rocket...
{73045}{73104}and the whole world,|if I want to!
{73105}{73209}Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{73210}{73246}What is that?
{73247}{73304}The evil Celebi|must've created it.
{73305}{73336}Pika?
{73605}{73632}Celebi!
{73633}{73664}Pika!
{73665}{73704}Oh, you again.
{73705}{73757}Celebi, get rid of 'em now!
{73899}{73922}Celebi!
{73923}{73954}Hold on! Uhh!
{74739}{74774}Is everybody OK?
{74775}{74805}I think so.
{74806}{74835}I'm still alive.
{74836}{74862}SAM: Me, too.
{74863}{74886}ASH: So am l.
{74887}{74918}Pika!
{74919}{74954}Grandma!
{74955}{75033}I'm alive, too, but just barely.
{75034}{75062}Hmm.
{75063}{75143}We have to stop|that horrible thing.
{75224}{75293}We're no match for|that big twig monster.
{75294}{75328}I know.
{75329}{75366}Poor Jessie.
{75500}{75554}All right, Pikachu,|try a Thunder Bolt.
{75555}{75591}Pika...
{75592}{75636}chuuu!
{75668}{75744}Celebi, get rid|of these children!
{75920}{75960}Pika!
{75961}{76018}Celebi, do it now!
{76140}{76170}Huh?
{76171}{76195}Toge?
{76512}{76539}The north wind.
{76540}{76582}The north wind saved them.
{76583}{76613}Suicune!
{76723}{76759}Uhh! Uhh!
{76760}{76785}Aah!
{76831}{76855}Hmm.
{76856}{76930}You must've come here|to help us out.
{76968}{77038}Then we need you to take us|to Celebi right away!
{77108}{77162}Heh heh heh heh.|Nows my chance...
{77163}{77211}to capture a Suicune, too!
{77392}{77463}Tyranitar, Hyper Beam!
{77500}{77524}We've gotta stop him!
{77525}{77559}Go, Onix! Uhh!
{78068}{78111}Hmm.
{78112}{78146}Ohh.
{78185}{78215}Celebi.
{78216}{78256}Celebi!
{79549}{79602}Good work, Onix. Return!
{79659}{79682}Heh heh heh heh.
{79683}{79730}Playtime is over, children.
{79731}{79766}Get them, Celebi.
{79800}{79860}Be careful. This thing could|destroy the whole forest!
{79861}{79894}And the Pokemon!
{79895}{79947}Suicune!
{80363}{80423}Good job!|Now teach 'em a lesson!
{80592}{80675}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!|That's what'll happen...
{80676}{80724}to anybody|who tries to stop me!
{80725}{80766}Pika!
{80890}{80916}Huh?
{80917}{80956}You have to be careful.
{80957}{81002}Celebi's just above us.
{81003}{81029}Thanks a lot.
{81030}{81061}Let's go, Sam.
{81062}{81102}-Right.|-Pika!
{81143}{81206}Uhh! Where are you going?
{81207}{81251}Get me out of here! Hey!
{81365}{81411}Celebi, you have to stop!
{81411}{81441}You're supposed|to protect the forest...
{81442}{81465}not destroy it!
{81466}{81493}Celebi!
{81634}{81660}Bi!
{81661}{81688}Bi.
{81858}{81939}Bi! Bi-i-i-i!
{81940}{81990}What are you|waiting for, Celebi?
{81991}{82021}They're your enemies!

{82185}{82236}-Uhh!|-Pikachu!

{84546}{84600}Celebi, don't help that hunter.
{84601}{84627}Fight him.
{84628}{84658}-Aah!|-Pika!
{84659}{84706}Pika!
{84707}{84752}I won't give up!

{85345}{85379}Huh?

{85448}{85484}What's going on?
{85485}{85508}Aah!

{85578}{85601}Huh?
{85602}{85627}Bi?
{85628}{85661}Celebi!
{85662}{85687}Pika!
{85688}{85720}We did it!
{85721}{85788}Oh, no! Aah!

{87223}{87267}Yeah, and so is Sam.
{87268}{87310}They've got Celebi, too.
{87311}{87334}Huh?
{87446}{87498}What's wrong?
{87499}{87562}I don't know.|Something bad.
{87736}{87760}The water.
{87761}{87793}Get it into the water!
{87929}{87975}ASH: It's not working.
{87975}{88011}But why not?
{88011}{88055}The forest is hurt.
{88056}{88097}The water's tainted.
{88098}{88148}The lake is dying.
{88149}{88197}But then-wait a second.
{88233}{88308}Suicune has the power to make|the water clean again.
{88309}{88363}Suicune,|if you clean the water...
{88364}{88394}we can save Celebi.
{89249}{89291}The legend's true.
{89292}{89356}The north wind|saved the lake.
{89473}{89558}Celebi, the water's clean again.
{89559}{89608}Pika.
{89707}{89748}It isn't working.
{89797}{89876}All right, then.|We'll keep trying.
{90014}{90114}See? These are those berries|we found in the forest.
{90115}{90161}Here you go.
{90204}{90228}Uhh.
{90286}{90314}Uh...
{90348}{90398}Heh. That's OK.
{90399}{90438}Uhh.
{90505}{90561}Uh, Celebi?
{90702}{90745}Celebi, you can't die!
{91003}{91052}Pika?
{91129}{91194}Celebi didn't do|anything wrong.
{91195}{91251}It was a human being|who forced Celebi...
{91252}{91294}to destroy the forest.
{91295}{91370}Celebi never even had a choice.
{91371}{91418}Uhh! And now--uhh--
{91419}{91482}it can't have a choice.
{91483}{91557}Now it's too late to choose|'cause Celebi is gonna die!
{92762}{92786}Toge-to?
{92787}{92811}Huh?
{92811}{92850}Huh?
{92851}{92877}Pika.

{99603}{99642}Huh? Huh!
{99643}{99697}You tried to destroy|our forest, mister...
{99698}{99764}and we don't take kindly|to that kind of behavior.
{99843}{99905}Scizor, Sneasel!
{99906}{99937}Uhh!
{99995}{100060}This is all a mistake--
{100061}{100113}a big misunderstanding.
{100114}{100152}Ohh!
{100153}{100185}Weedle!
{100255}{100331}I think the Pokemon|understand perfectly.
{100332}{100383}Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
{100465}{100495}Suicune!
{100496}{100526}Thank you!
{100527}{100586}Maybe we'll see you|again someday.
{100587}{100621}Pika!
{100813}{100855}Good-bye, Suicune!
{100979}{101006}Bi.
{101007}{101034}-Huh?|-Bi?
{101035}{101064}Uh...
{101191}{101227}Bi-i-i-i-i!
{101227}{101266}It looks like|Celebi's getting ready...
{101267}{101306}to travel back in time...
{101307}{101386}and I think it wants|to take you along, Sam.
{101387}{101459}Can you really|bring me back, Celebi?
{101460}{101512}Bi!
{101541}{101605}Looks like|you're goin' home, Sam.
{101606}{101663}Yeah, I guess so.
{101663}{101722}Don't worry.|It won't matter...
{101723}{101815}'cause wherever you are,|or whenever you are--heh--
{101815}{101852}we'll always be friends.
{101979}{102007}Bi.
{102098}{102166}Thank you, Ash.|You're a great friend.
{102167}{102221}Thank you all|for everything.
{102222}{102303}Maybe I'll see you|again...someday!
{102303}{102352}I knowwe will!
{102532}{102580}I'll see you!
{102611}{102683}Good-bye!
{103011}{103080}Pikachu!
{103571}{103608}You were right,|Professor.
{103609}{103667}That Pokemon we saw|was a Suicune.
{103667}{103722}Yeah, and we met|a Celebi, too.
{103723}{103761}It even traveled through time.
{103762}{103804}Well, well,|it sounds like you saw...
{103805}{103885}some very rare and highly|unusual Pokemon out there.
{103886}{103933}Huh? What's the matter, Ash?
{103934}{103961}Uh...
{103962}{104002}You haven't said|a single word yet.
{104003}{104076}Didn't you enjoy your little|adventure in the forest, too?
{104077}{104123}Oh, sure, Professor.
{104123}{104153}But, you see...
{104154}{104197}I met this Pokemon trainer...
{104198}{104231}and we got to be friends.
{104232}{104281}But l--|I just don't think...
{104282}{104327}I'm ever gonna|see him again.
{104327}{104360}He decided to go back...
{104361}{104406}to where he came from,|Professor--
{104407}{104438}to another time.
{104439}{104466}Pika.
{104467}{104506}I wouldn't worry, Ash.
{104507}{104533}Oh?
{104534}{104595}True friendships can withstand|the test of time...
{104596}{104644}and I have a feeling|this one will.
{104645}{104729}I'm sure you and Sammy|will be friends forever.
{104730}{104773}Mm. Heh heh.
{104774}{104830}Thanks, Professor.|I think so, too.
{104831}{104865}Pikachu!
{104914}{104954}I think we'd better|get going.
{104955}{105003}Yeah, I don't want|to miss the boat again.
{105003}{105030}We'll tell you everything...
{105031}{105072}when we get|to Pallet Town, OK?
{105073}{105130}Fine. I'm looking forward to it.
{105185}{105210}Hey.
{105211}{105262}What's the matter, Misty?
{105263}{105320}Howd Professor Oak|know Sammy's name?
{105321}{105353}We never mentioned|it to him.
{105354}{105380}Yeah, that's right.
{105381}{105407}[Toot]|Pika!
{105447}{105555}Professor Oak's amazing!|He knows everything!
{105556}{105605}Pika!
{105606}{105641}Pikachu!
{105849}{105945}Hmm. It seems like|it happened only yesterday.
{106153}{106232}This is amazing.
{106233}{106280}This wonderful water's|washed away...
{106281}{106330}all my annoying aches|and pains.
{106331}{106398}I could just float along|like this forever.
{106399}{106444}Ahoy!|-Huh?
{106445}{106505}Jessie, thank goodness|you're safe.
{106506}{106550}Hurry up. Climb aboard.
{106551}{106577}What took you so long?
{106578}{106605}What have you been doing?
{106606}{106650}We had to wait|till it was safe.
{106651}{106686}But now the coast is clear.
{106687}{106715}Oh, good.
{107153}{107205}Hey, guys,|I feel all tingly.
{107206}{107234}So do l.
{107235}{107295}Heh. Isn't it fabulous?
{107343}{107429}Looks like Team Rocket's|floating away.
{111402}{111454}Yo, man,|we forgot to vamp out.
{111455}{111495}This ain't|the end of the song?
{111496}{111558}-No.|-Oh, man.
{111600}{111900}{C:$00FFFF}Translation and subtitles:|Blake_rsh (Mormegil.inc)
Every night, the same dream, the same strange planet.
But why?
What are they trying to tell me?
It's been 34 years since they arrived on this planet.
And not a day passes that the survivors...
...forced to live in barrier cities, do not live in fear.
I have vowed to end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
The question is, will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
- What's she doing here captain?
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.
- You're coming with us.
- Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it. Let's move, people!
Two coming through the wall!
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!
Ryan, Neil, let's go!
- Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- There's a life form in here.
- There hasn't been life here in years.
- Well, there is now.
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.
Fine! Arrest me. But I'm not leaving without that life form.
It's gonna be one of those days.
Captain, the transport is not going to wait for us much longer.
- I understand that.
- It's in bad shape.
Oh please! Tell me we're not risking our necks for this plant!
I wouldn't even call it a plant.
It's a weed.
- I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.
Phantoms! We have incoming.
- Captain, we need to get out of here.
- Understood, sergeant.
- Could you hurry please Miss?
- Done.
- Captain?
- Yes, Neil?
Just so you know?
I agree with the "let's get out of here thing. "
Duly noted.
- Can I have this, please?
- Thank you.
- We're surrounded!
- No shit!
- Alright everybody! Just relax.
- Captain, we gotta get to higher ground.
Everyone, up top!
Go, go, go!
- Transport, requesting immediate evac.
- Affirmative.
Up here!
- Captain! - They're right behind you! - Captain, come on!
I've got you!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
All right, everybody, here they come.
You okay?
You gonna be all right.
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
- Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.
- Listen captain. I don't have time for this.
Do you realize you just risked the lives of my squad?
Look! I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...
- ... it was worth the lives of you and your men.
- You and your men?
- She thinks you're a man.
- I think she's an idiot.
- I know you're not a man.
- I think you're an idiot too.
- Very funny.
- Well, I do wanna talk about it.
Did it ever occur to you...
...that we would've volunteered to risk our lives had we been given a choice?
Well, nobody asked you to save me.
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit!
Gray?
Yeah. Nice to see you too.
- Welcome back, captain.
- We're clean.
- Let's make sure of that shall we?
- I hate getting scanned.
So, the scanners are probably worse for us than the Phantoms.
No probably about it captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.
And I wanna have a little Neil Jr. calling me Daddy someday.
- That's a spooky thought.
- Why are you always busting my chops?
People, let's just do this thing. Alright?
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you've gained some weight.
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.
I'm working on it.
You know, my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today it doesn't.
Something's not right.
- About this mission? Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
Listen, captain.. I think...
I don't care what you think, doctor.
You're getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
- Captain!
- They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with a Phantom sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
- What level is he?
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.
We have to treat him. Now!
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.
There's no time for that.
Get him to the table.
Hang in there, captain.
Locating pathogens.
Jesus, look at that thing!
- How much more time?
- Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won't be able to hold the alien particles.
Engaging bio-etheric laser.
- What's going on?
- Where'd it go?
What the hell is going on?
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.
- Tracking.
- There's no time.
- Tracking.
- There is no time! You're gonna lose him!
His treatment shield is failing.
Found it.
Come on.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.
Uh.. Doctor, we need to scan you for infestation.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.
Hey, doc.
Thanks for saving him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship.
- What's with her?
- What's with her and the captain?
What's with her and that stupid plant?
What?
Forward me the Phantom data and everything regarding the five spirits collected so far.
Yes, doctor.
Spirits? I thought we weren't supposed to use the "S" word.
Don't get smart with me.
Now let's see if that plant does the trick.
It's a match. We've found it.
Yes.
The sixth spirit.
It seemed today you broke nearly every protocol.
How long do you think this would have survived outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the council and military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered this energy in the Phantoms? You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You. You made it possible to harness that energy...
...for ovo-pacs, scanners, even the barrier.
The council knows that.
They trust you doctor.
We're so close to proving it.
But we still need this part.
And this one here.
Exactly two more pieces and we've solved the puzzle!
And we need to be free to find those pieces.
I want to show you something Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
"All life is born of Gaia and each life has a spirit.
Each new spirit is housed in a physical body. "
- Doctor?
- Go on.
"Through their experiences on Earth, each spirit matures and grows.
When the physical body dies...
...the mature spirit, enriched by its life on Earth, returns to Gaia...
...bringing with it the experiences...
...enabling Gaia to live and grow. "
It's my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago, when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
Remember what happened to Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...
...he said the Earth was not the center of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
If you have any notes or records that could be used against you...
...destroy them.
- Keep them up here.
- Right.
And stay away from your friend, the captain.
He saves your life, you save his life, this leads to that.
I was young once too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one's young anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen of the council...
...could you please explain why?
Zeus was completed a month ago.
If we attack the meteor with this, we will eliminate the Phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon to attack the Leonid Meteor.
We have re-convened today to vote on that very issue again.
Now, I'd like to ask the director of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.
- Dr. Sid, please.
- Thank you.
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest is in the Leonid Meteor...
...that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now are the records of every assault on the meteor to date.
Physical attacks have had utterly no effect.
This scene took place three months ago during a full-scale bombardment.
Now please note the Phantoms outside the meteor are indeed destroyed.
However, inside, many that were dormant come to life...
...and as you see, overall Phantom density remains the same.
The newly risen aliens respond to the attack...
...by burrowing even deeper into the Earth.
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...
...because we see the same thing during surgery...
...when using bio-etheric lasers on Phantom particles, do we not?
Yes, indeed we do.
You see. the injured particles escape...
...burying or digging themselves deeper into a patient's body.
And when we increase the laser power to destroy these deeper particles...
...we have had incidents resulting in further injury to a patient...
...and in some cases...
...death.
And what exactly does that mean doctor?
It means there's a very good chance...
...the beam from the Zeus cannon will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.
Exactly! Thank you.
However, it also means that the beam energy may be too strong...
...injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the Gaia.
- I mean...
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.
Did he say what I think he said?
What are you doing?
I know what I'm doing and whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
Doctor, with all due respect...
...did you come here just to talk about some Gaia theory?
To tell us that the planet is alive?
That it has a spirit?
That's a fairy tale doctor and I'm sorry, but we don't have time for that.
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.
Ahh.. Oh.. So if I point a gun at the Earth and fire...
...I'm not just making a hole on the ground,
I'm killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory has not been proven.
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we still have to remove the Phantoms?
I think if there's any chance of success, we should take it.
- Don't you agree?
- Well, of course i do.
But there is an alternative to the space cannon.
Another method?
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms.
- Please.
As we know, the aliens display a distinct energy pattern.
Now, it is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves...
...placed one over the other will cancel each other out.
It is theoretically possible to construct a wave pattern...
...in direct opposition to the Phantom energy.
We are currently assembling such a wave and are nearing completion.
Members of the council...
...gathering plants and animals...
...from around the world to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
It will kill Phantoms.
Can we afford to wait for some crazy invention...
...some army of touchy-feely plants and animals...
...An invention that offers no solid evidence that it will destroy the aliens?
There is evidence!
Our partially completed energy wave...
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...
...through a terminally-infected patient.
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that a terminal patient has been cured?
Not cured. The wave is not complete.
But we've succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
You may have bought us some time Aki, but i wonder at what cost?
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
Will you listen to me? When we find the seventh and eighth spirits...
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Faith and hard work, girl...
...coz I'll be damned if you're going to die before me.
The council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I tag along?
You'll probably get bored.
So, what are you doing?
Oh, I see. You're giving me the silent treatment.
I'm scanning the city for the seventh spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
- Relax sergeant. Almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?
We're just gonna strand them for a while.
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.
This was your idea?
We're just helping the captain out a little.
Yeah, come on Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?
You've seen how the captain looks at her.
It's amore, baby.
What's going on?
It's probably just a glitch.
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?
Hey! Well, I was just a little upset when you just packed up and left for the Zeus Station without saying a word.
- Well, now you know what was going on. Alright?
- Yeah. Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero grav. Okay?
Fine.
And how about the fact that I was sent there on a job and you wouldn't even see me.
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collect spirit waves.
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.
So will you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you've collected.
I was infected by a Phantom during an experiment.
- Normally, no one could have survived.
- How did you?
Dr. Sid created a membrane around the infection, keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space? It's no fun.
- What am I saying? You probably would love that.
- You're right. I probably would.
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.
- I thought that was number six.
- What?
You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I retrieved the sample in time, but she...
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.
Even the Earth.
I told her that she wasn't dying just returning to the Earth's spirit...
...to Gaia.
She told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I'm sorry.
I have work to do. I have to find the seventh and eighth spirits.
Don't, please.
You don't believe any of this, do you?
I just don't know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don't know how much time I have left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards...
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago did you not?
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporarily reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she reenters the wasteland.
- Understood, sir.
- You don't understand yet, captain.
Report any aberrant behavior in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.
Aberrant behavior sir?
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.
They may be manipulating the doctor for their very own purposes.
Is the general suggesting that Dr. Ross is a spy?
The general is wondering why he's explaining himself to a captain.
She's had prolonged exposure to Phantom tissue.
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest and transported here for observation.
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our men to keep an eye on the good captain.
I'm convinced that these dreams are some form of communication.
Their message still eludes me...
...but they're coming faster now and that can only mean one thing.
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.
- Roger.
- Phantom concentration?
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.
So it's gonna be a real picnic.
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book. Right.
If we drop energy buoys here, here and here...
...we should be able to land, acquire the target, and get out before the Phantoms even know we were there.
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?
- Yeah.
- For a while.
So you're from the 307th's right?
Under General Hein?
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.
Captain, rendezvous for evac at vector 6, coordinate 279.
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.
Looks like they've taken the bait.
The seventh spirit should be just beyond that line of wreckage.
I don't see how any living thing could survive out here?
We'll find out soon enough.
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.
It was supposed to end the war.
My father's in here somewhere.
All right.
Let's move out, people.
I'll be damned.
A survivor.
What's it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
Is that our spirit, doc?
No.
We're closing in on the life form.
- Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.
I don't see anything.
- You're not gonna tell me it's him?
- That's impossible.
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.
How do you explain that? The pacs power our weapons, the barrier cities...
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.
And to create that energy we use living tissue. Single-cell organisms.
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit?
- Yes.
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?
- Captain?
- What? Say again?
You read me captain? We have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.
I need a hand! Sarge!
- Those buoys? They're not working.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Something's not right.
This shouldn't be happening.
Something's attracting them.
Aki!
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast!
- Jane, take the lead.
Fire in the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
- Sir, I would love to, but...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- It's okay, that's it.
That doesn't look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
- You have your orders, sir.
- What the hell is going on here?
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.
Lower your weapons. That's an order!
Sir. We have no choice, but to relieve you of your command.
I won't let you do this soldier.
You'll gonna have to shoot me.
Stand down, captain!
Hang on, everyone!
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!
The Deep Eyes are returning from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently, there was an incident.
It would seem the Phantoms were attracted to Dr. Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross placed under arrest.
All research materials pertaining to Dr. Sid's wave theory...
...are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, major.
The good captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the council will be at our feet...
...thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us...
...to save them from the Phantoms.
How is she, doctor?
- She is dying.
- There must be something you can do.
Aki is fighting with only six of the eight spirits.
We'll have to implant the seventh directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damaged.
We have to repair this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help hold her in this world.
And I can think of no spirit better suited for that task than yours, captain.
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.
You just be with her now.
You keep her here with us.
Aki? Where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I'm not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
I've been having this dream every night for months.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You're really here, aren't you?
What's happening to me?
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit directly into your body.
Then you're my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
Look, I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching what, major?
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in...
...her dreams?
This is it. This is our evidence.
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The council is content to hide powering inside this barrier...
...while the world dies a little more every day.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get together a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing.
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, doctor?
She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.
We'll need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I finished it.
I know what it means.
I know what the Phantoms really are.
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!
We have them, sir.
Sir?
My wife and daughter...
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
I try to imagine what.. what that must have been like...
...seeing everyone around you fall over dead for no apparent reason.
And then, at the end, feeling something next to you...
...invisible...
...touching you...
...reaching inside your body...
You've lost family, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
That's why I trust you.
All of you.
You know what must be done.
Security override.
Perimeter breached.
Major, arrest these men.
- Take it easy.
- Stand up. Go.
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask any questions.
Reduce power to Sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...
What I realize, major...
...is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy.
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.
Lowering power output to Sector 31.
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general.
They're coming through now.
Oh I think we can easily handle a few Phantoms in a contained space.
Relax, major. When this night's over, you're going to be a hero.
- Aki, I don't think...
- You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?
Captain, please, let her continue.
Alright. Why do you think we've never been able to determine...
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?
Excuse me, doc, but what friggin' relationship?
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms, and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...
...and your flying Phantoms and let's not forget my personal favorite...
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.
Down, boy.
He's right. If you've spent as much time in the field as we had...
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.
Precisely. I think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants.
But why would an invading army bring a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?
Unless their ship was kind of a crazy Noah's Ark?
We have always assumed that the meteor...
...was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.
The meteor is a chunk of their planet that got thrown into space...
...when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn't.
Oh. This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
All our strategies are based on one assumption:
That we were fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.
Since then, all they've known is suffering.
They're not an invading army.
They're ghosts.
How many Phantoms?
More than enough to convince the council, sir.
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send a squad out to eliminate them.
Yes sir.
Alert status. Full deployment.
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!
Well, of course you do.
Outside of Sector 31, sir.
And moving at incredible speed.
Major, What the hell is going on here?
They're in the pipes.
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.
That's impossible. No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.
Oh, my God.
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out.
You're our man. Think.
Captain, these walls are titanium alloy and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.
I mean it's not like I can just wave a magic wand and...
- Wow! Neil, I'm impressed.
- That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
- Here they come.
- But the others! Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.
Come on.
What's happening. Why can we see them now?
They must be carrying a residual charge from passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
All aboard, captain!
We need to find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it would be in the military hangar.
That's a big "if. "
Look out!
- Get us onto the platform.
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
We're going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all due respect...
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.
We're going through it.
It's the only way.
So I gather this will be somewhat of a rough ride?
Doc, you've got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody!
Doc?
Interesting.
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.
Ouch!
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- Right.
No wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They're in my ship.
- No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?
You heard the man.
We'll find the ship and be back for you.
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody's staying.
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.
Give him a weapon. Do it!
We'll be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.
Let's move out.
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However, we'll need to replace these spent fuel cells.
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.
Alright. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Gray, be careful.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby'll fly itself.
Flight path is set.
Beginning rotation.
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.
I'm reading an impound tractor attached probably to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No sir. Permission to go outside and detach the coupling.
Do it.
There's the problem.
The controls are locked, naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we're gonna get out of here alive?
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.
You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?
You think this eighth-spirit stuff is really gonna work against the Phantoms?
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.
What's happening down there?
Nothing we can't handle.
- Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.
I want you two back inside.
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating with extreme prejudice.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, captain.
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.
Jane, get out of there.
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!
Get the hell out of there!
The shield is powered and ready.
- Where are you going?
- To the cockpit.
The ship is set on autopilot.
We're in countdown to liftoff.
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!
Over here, you son of a bitch!
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
- No! We can't just leave everyone.
- Everyone's dead!
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
Gray, come on!
I just...
I wish I could believe they were in a better place.
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...
...to include an area that we had previously overlooked.
The impact crater.
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.
Yes, really quite astonishing.
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.
Precisely.
Which suggests that the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.
I can't explain it at the moment, but once we get down there...
- ... you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.
Yes, I expected that's how you would evaluate our chances.
Well, am I wrong?
No, I agree. We probably...
...won't live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater.
Then why should we even try it?
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.
If we can't bring the final spirit here...
...we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.
Yes, exactly.
And how do we do that, exactly?
I can construct a device that...
...would attach to Aki's chest plate to gather the eighth spirit and then...
And then what?
And then we wait and see what happens.
That's it?
- That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...
- and maybe we'll find a compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
What caused the barrier to fail, General Hein?
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time...
...before the Phantoms developed an immunity to our barriers.
But I am relieved to see that you and the rest of the council...
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.
The council has reconsidered your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.
And, general...
...best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
The target, sir?
The Phantom crater.
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we're over the meteor.
Do you have it in sight, doctor?
There are so many of them.
Wait.
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit moving along the crater's surface.
All right. Now let's take a closer look.
Ready to fire in three minutes.
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.
Counter-thrusters are engaged.
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.
We have something on radar over the impact site, sir.
It's her.
Sir?
Just a traitor under the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We'll take them all out at the same time.
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It's a match! It's a perfect match!
- Target scanners ready, sir.
- Fire.
What was that?
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.
- Aki, Captain, are you all right?
- A little shaken. Stand by.
Sid, the eighth spirit is not on our scanner. Do you have it?
The eighth spirit...
...has been destroyed.
- What are we going to do now?
- Nothing. This mission is over.
- We have to get out of here.
- Incoming!
What is that?
If you're getting us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can't hold on to you.
Unable to maintain altitude.
Initiate emergency landing procedures.
Come in. Come in, please.
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?
- What is that thing?
- I don't know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein,
You must cease fire immediately.
What you are looking at in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world.
Their planet was destroyed and part of it landed here.
This is not an invasion. It never was.
I see and what have we been fighting all this time, doctor? Ghosts?
Yes. Spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Right. And these spirits are coming out of this Gaia thing.
General Hein, you have to listen.
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...
...the fact remains the Earth is under attack from an aggressor...
...who must be destroyed at all costs.
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor,
I will take your protest to mean that we are...
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.
So i suggest you take your last few moments and prepare to meet your Gaia.
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.
General, the system is overheating, sir.
We're going to hit it again and again and keep on hitting it until it's dead.
But, sir. We're not even sure if it's having any effect on the creature.
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.
- The system won't allow us to fire again.
- We'll see about that.
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here.
Come on!
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
That's not what I think it is, Is it?
Yes, it's Gaia.
This is definitely not a good place to be.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
Go ahead, I'm still here.
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.
I think this explains why the eighth spirit appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that's it!
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.
If so, it would've been given a different energy signature...
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.
You two could not have hoped for a better location...
...to find a new compatible spirit.
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sounds.
Don't shoot any of them!
You could very well destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, captain, not mine.
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Well? Which one is it? Which one?
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.
With the hope of new life...
...has Gaia changed the Phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here. I need you!
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, doctor.
Oh, my word.
I see now. I understand.
Well, I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?
Give me the ovo-pac.
I need to project the completed wave.
- But we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!
I hope you know what you're doing, Aki.
- We can use the shield to project the wave.
- What?
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.
I'm cured, Gray.
- Are you sure you have the final spirit?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- But how? How can you know that?
- Don't worry. A Phantom told me.
Oh, great.
That's it. Shield on.
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.
If this doesn't work, then it's already too late.
Gray, trust me.
I'll blast you all to hell.
Oh, no. No!
Get down!
- Warning. System overload.
- I know.
- Warning. System overload.
- I know!
But it must be done.
Fire.
Fire, damn you!
Fire!
Don't leave me, Gray.
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray. Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're going to make it.
We both know that isn't true.
Help me.
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no. Please?
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.
Don't leave me, Gray.
You've been trying to tell me that death isn't the end.
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it's warm.
You see how it's done?
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.
You better.
The boss will chew my head off if these cores get messed up.
Don't worry.
We're at 26 feet.
You let Jason operate the drill?
Yeah, he can handle it.
I didn't do anything.
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!
You're not gonna make it!
Jack!
Jack! Give me your hand!
I've got you!
What were you thinking?
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!
That's what's happening!
What we have found locked to these ice cores is evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift that occurred around
10,000 years ago.
The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores indicates that runaway warming pushed the planet into an ice age which lasted two centuries.
I'm confused.
I thought you were talking about global warming, not an ice age.
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can trigger a cooling trend.
Let me explain.
The northern hemisphere owes its temperate climate to the North Atlantic current.
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean.
But, global warming is melting the polar ice caps and disrupting this flow.
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs... there goes our warm climate.
Excuse me. When do you think this could happen, professor? When?
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years, maybe in 1000.
But what I do know is that if we do not act soon, it is our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay the price.
And who's going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord?
It will cost the world's economy hundreds of billions of dollars.
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President, the cost of doing nothing could be even higher.
Our climate is fragile.
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment, the ice caps will soon disappear.
Professor, um, Hall... our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment.
Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims.
Well, the last chunk of ice that broke off was about the size of the state of Rhode Island.
Some people might call that pretty sensational.
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!
I'm here at the global warming conference in New Delhi, where, if you can believe your eyes, it's snowing.
The coldest weather on record has thrown the city into chaos, with hundreds of homeless people freezing to death.
Taxi!
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.
Oh, thank you. That's what we're here for, right? Put on a good show?
Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you about your theory on abrupt climate shift.
The name's Rapson.
Terry Rapson.
Professor Rapson?
- Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.
I've read your work on ocean currents.
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.
Over here.
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland, where Manchester United
leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.
in this pitiful
Champions League match.
We return to the action
63 minutes into the second half
as Manchester United looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator
Donald MacFarland.
What? Yeah.
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.
The baby kept us awake all night.
And still.
Good!
Dennis?
NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing a temperature drop of 13 degrees.
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's...
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.
Must have knocked it about.
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?
Hello, professor.
How was India?
Oh, you know what these scientific gatherings are.
All dancing girls, wine and parties.
The fury of Hurricane Noelani stunned weather experts yesterday
slamming into the unprepared island chain
with a cataclysmic force never before witnessed.
Meteorologists already believe this to be the strongest hurricane
ever recorded.
Are you gonna get that?
Hello?
I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.
All right, I don't have time to talk about this right now.
Well, maybe you ought to make time.
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away for months and months at a time.
I just don't understand.
I'll let him explain it to you.
Can you take him to the airport in the morning?
Sam's getting on a plane?
He joined the Scholastic
Decathlon Team.
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?
- Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?
I gotta go because
I'm on call tonight.
Jack, please don't be late.
I don't want him taking a taxi again.
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.
This morning's weather staff meeting has been moved to level four,
conference room B.
Jack?
I know you have an innate talent for rubbing people the wrong way Jack, but why?
Why, for the love of god, would you aggravate the vice president?
Because my 17-year-old kid knows more science than he does.
Perhaps. But your 17-year-old kid does not control our budget.
- It doesn't matter if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.
You're missing the point.
What I'm trying to tell you is,
- if Raymond Becker pulls our budget...
- Oh, shit!
- Wait... Will you...?
Jack.
Oh, my god.
- Hi Sam. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, it's fine. The cab's already here.
That's okay. I'll take care of it.
- What are you gonna...?
- Here you go.
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- Sam, how can there be two sides?
Hey look. I got every question right on the final.
And the only reason why Mr. Spengler failed me was because I didn't write out the solutions.
Why not?
I do them in my head.
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.
He said that if he can't do them in his head, then I must be cheating.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
How can he fail you for being smarter than he is?
That's what I said.
You did?
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.
I'm gonna call this guy and have a word with him.
We're gonna get this whole thing straighten out.
Hey, you can't park there.
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?
Sam.
Parker, this is Houston.
We're seeing some bad weather over Canaveral.
It doesn't look like you're coming back this week.
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.
Roger that.
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It's enormous.
You all right?
He's afraid of flying.
I'm fine.
You know statistically, the chance of a plane going down because of turbulence is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?
- I can't remember if it's a...
- Shut up, Brian.
Listen, Sam... don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.
They're still serving drinks.
Hey folks, it appears we're gonna have a little bit of a bumpy ride here
for the next few minutes.
Please fasten your seat belts and put your tray tables
and seatbacks in their upright positions until we get through this. Thank you.
Grab it. Watch out!
Sam?
Sam.
Can I have my hand back?
I can't believe I'm spending two weeks alone with my mom.
Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday for months.
I know.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey.
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.
The cause of this extreme weather remains a mystery,
although some meteorologists believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing...
This is very odd.
There's a buoy here registering a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.
I'll put a call in, see if there are any ships near
Georges Bank to get it.
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.
What?
What are the odds of two buoys failing?
Remote.
Make that three.
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.
Lookie here, Buddha.
These people, and their cars, and their exhaust and they're just polluting the atmosphere.
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.
We're almost there.
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.
What's gotten into them?
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.
What is his name?
Time.
Montezuma.
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico, not Peru.
It's, like, Anta-something.
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!
Time's up. Correct answers, please.
That's five points for Woodmont and five points for Pinehurst Academy.
Next question.
In what year did Louis Quatorze ascend to the throne of France?
This place is so retro, it might actually be cool if it were on purpose.
Yeah, look at all these nerds.
Hey.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thanks. This place is incredible.
Do you believe that this is their cafeteria?
You played a great first round.
So did you.
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like... would you like a tour?
Sure. That'd be great.
Could you hold this for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Man, you got some serious competition.
Please.
- I bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.
Who is it?
Terry Rapson here.
Sorry to call you so early.
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.
You recall what you said in New Delhi about how polar melting might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
Yes.
Well...
I think it's happening.
What do you mean?
One of our NOMAD buoys registered a 13-degree drop
in surface temperature the other day.
I've sent you an e-mail.
Hold on.
At first we thought it was a malfunction.
But there are four more across the North Atlantic
 showing the same thing.
This is unbelievable.
You predicted it would happen.
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.
There are no forecast models remotely capable of plotting this scenario,
except yours.
My model is a reconstruction of a prehistoric climate shift.
It's not a forecast model.
It's the closest thing we have.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
At least not in the last
10,000 years.
As I predicted yesterday, the swell off Hurricane
Noelani is incredible.
These waves are even bigger than I imagined. Just take a look.
Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather or something?
This is L.A. What weather?
Wait. What's that noise?
What noise?
Honey, I'll be right back.
The Coast Guard has closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for...
L.A. Weather Center.
It's Tommy.
I'm down at the beach.
I'm in the middle of something,
Tommy. What do you need?
There's hail the size of golf balls coming down here.
A low-pressure system moving along the California coastline
is creating a cyclonic system across the L.A. Basin.
Yeah? Hello?
Hey boss, turn on The Weather
Channel right away.
I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
What are you talking about?
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting wind speeds in excess of 70 miles...
Hold on a second.
...conditions that are highly unusual for California.
Tom, we're building a forecast model, we're gonna need... what?
Priority access to the mainframe for two days, maybe three.
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.
You know I would say that you've lost your mind but you've been this way for the past 20 years.
Tom, this is important.
What's this forecast model you're building, if you don't mind my asking?
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have absolutely no idea what he's up to.
Booker. What's going on here?
They just issued a tornado warning in Los Angeles.
Breaking news as we prepare to go live to Los Angeles.
- Mixed reports are coming in about...
- Report is just coming out.
some extreme weather occurring in the area.
Okay, we're now going live to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.
We have live coverage now from our Fox 11 chopper.
Are you there, Bart?
Uh, yes, I'm here. These tornados are forming so fast...
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my god.
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?
This tornado just came and erased the Hollywood sign.
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.
Bart, what can you see?
Is anyone hurt?
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage down there.
And there are people down there, taking pictures.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!
You can't stay here!
Get out of here!
What you're seeing are two actual tornados striking Los Angeles
International Airport.
Wait. Wait.
It looks like they've joined and formed one large tornado.
- Tommy!
- Oh, my god!
Holy shit!
I'd like to urge all of our viewers to stay away from the areas...
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on Yucca and Vine.
- I'm on my way there now.
- You're on TV. Right in the middle of it.
God! Oh, my god!
You gotta get out of there, man.
That bus just got dropped on top of that Porsche!
Oh, my god.
I hope no one was in that car.
For our national audience just joining us now
we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now.
Tommy?
If you look over there behind me, that's a tornado.
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.
It's one of many tornados that are destroying our city.
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.
What's happening?
It- it- it looks like some sort of huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare, only this is the real thing...
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening Raymond?
I'll call you back.
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been devastated by a series of tornados.
On top of that, the FAA wants your approval to suspend all air traffic.
What do you think we should do?
Until we can figure it out what's going on here I...
I don't think we have much choice, sir.
What you're seeing is what's left of downtown Los Angeles.
Hey, man, I just got off the phone with my mom.
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry, but we need to change the channel.
The FAA has grounded all air traffic in the United States.
Unfortunately, the order came too late for two planes
that were brought down by severe turbulence in the Midwest.
- The first flight...
- So much for "one in a billion."
All right.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.
We've got a lot of work to do, and we don't have much time so let's get started, please.
Vorsteen?
All our grid models are worthless.
I don't think grid models are gonna be a lot of help here.
The Canadians are reporting tremendous circulation moving down from the Arctic.
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system unlike anything we've seen, and Australia just saw the strongest typhoon ever recorded.
Hang on. Are you saying that these things are interconnected?
We have to consider the possibility.
The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun.
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.
Solar output is normal.
What about the
North Atlantic Current?
What about it?
I got a call last night... from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center.
He thinks the current has changed.
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?
The current depends upon a delicate balance of salt and freshwater.
- We all know that.
- Yes.
But no one has taken into account how much freshwater has been dumped into the ocean because of melting polar ice.
I think we've hit a critical desalinization point.
It would explain what's driving this extreme weather.
Hedland had some pretty convincing data.
They've asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate model to track the next set of events.
Hold on Jack.
Are you suggesting these weather anomalies are gonna continue?
Not just continue. Get worse.
I think we're on the verge of a major climate shift.
Tom. What are you gonna tell the Administration?
What do you expect me to tell them?
The government has to start making long term preparations, now.
Jack, all you have is a theory.
Well, then give me the mainframe.
And let me prove it.
No.
You have 48 hours.
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored the strongest hurricane on record.
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.
Can the model you're working on factoring in storm scenarios?
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.
Hi, I'm Jason.
Hi.
Do you have the results of
Peter's CT scan?
Yeah. The treatments shrunk the tumor 20 percent.
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.
Good.
Let me listen here.
Can you read that?
No, but I remember the story from the pictures.
You do?
My mother used to read it to me.
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight.
You're the only one who hasn't taken a break.
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes for a while.
Call me when you get the results.
Frank, is he always so obsessive?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Does he ever lighten up?
- Not really.
- No.
How long have you been working together?
Well, Frank's been working with him since the Stone Age, but I've only had to endure two years of servitude.
Jack.
Jack, we got the results.
Six to eight months?
That can't be.
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.
Widespread flooding has slowed transportation
and caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and
Holland Tunnels.
The plumbing in the school is really old.
And I guess seeing with all this rain, the sewage got stopped up.
Where are you staying tonight?
They're finding a place for us to stay with kids here in New York City.
Are you sure you can't get home any sooner than tomorrow?
Well, look, dad, I would if I could, you know. I just...
This smell is unbearable, dad.
Stop kidding around!
I want you home.
Dad, I'll be on the train.
Do me a favor okay.
Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.
All right, son.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Sam, guess what?
We got a place to stay.
Great.
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C. area,
but local residents aren't taking any chances
as people stock up for what is already being billed
as the worst storm season on record.
You better be sure about this Jack.
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.
And I hope to god it's wrong.
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.
Professor Hall has some new information
I think you should take a look at it.
We just got these results from our simulation model.
They explain what's causing this severe weather.
Look, I have to read this later.
I have a meeting with the director of FEMA right now.
This is very urgent sir.
Our climate is changing violently.
And it's going to happen over the next six to eight weeks.
I bet you said this wouldn't happen for another 100 years or so.
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.
I wish that I were, but I'm sure that you're aware of what's happening all around the world.
We're making all the necessary preparations for this storm.
What more do you expect?
You have to start thinking about large-scale evacuations right now.
Especially in the Northern states.
- Evacuations?
- Yes.
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.
Mr. Vice President!
If we don't act now, it's going to be too late.
Come on, Jack.
Hey. Thanks for bringing us here.
I couldn't let you leave New York without seeing the
Natural History Museum.
Of course not.
It's the world's finest collection of stuffed animals.
Hey, guys, check this out.
"The body of this mammoth was found perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra with food still in its mouth and stomach indicating that it froze instantly while grazing."
It's been 24 hours now since the snow started falling
across the British Isles and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.
No, no, no. You've got to stop worrying. No, no.
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies. We're just snowed in.
Yeah. No, it's all right.
It's all right.
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay, bye.
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.
The ferry just landed.
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team has been deployed by helicopter
to airlift the royal family to safety.
Yeah, you think they'll come get us since we got snowed in?
Not likely.
Luckily we've got our own genny, enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.
Oh, we'll be fine.
As long as the loo doesn't back up again.
We've got zero visibility.
- Maintain heading and speed.
- What's our heading?
035, sir.
Approximately 40 kilometers from Balmoral Castle.
We've lost visual contact with you.
- This gauge here can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.
We have vertical walls of cirrus cloud formations.
What the hell is going on?
The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.
We've got a flameout on the starboard side as well.
Prepare for crash landing.
Select emergency fuel.
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
What I'm about to tell you is supposed to be confidential.
Several hours ago, three helicopters went down over Scotland.
They crashed because the fuel in their lines froze.
- At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
We had to look it up.
The temperature dropped phenomenally fast.
On the ground, people froze before they could get out of their cars even.
Can you get me a satellite picture of Scotland two hours ago?
Yeah.
We've got mountains of data but nowhere near enough computer power to analyze it.
Can you help us?
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.
This is Scotland at the time the temperature dropped.
This thing looks just like a hurricane.
Only hurricanes don't form over land.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.
Wow.
You live here?
Just on the weekends.
It's...
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so...
Where is he?
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.
Is this you and your brother?
Yeah, that's when we took a bike trip together.
It's been raining like this for three days now.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm just standing here.
You can't stay here.
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.
It's a mob scene here at Grand Central Station.
Over half the platforms are flooded
and service has been suspended on all trains.
With planes still grounded and trains now out of service
that's bad news for the...
Hey, Victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?
Not anymore.
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.
What we have feared for the past few days has indeed happened.
The cold front moving down from the Arctic
has created an enormous storm system in Canada.
Which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more and more like a tropical hurricane...
Well, I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want me to give you a ride?
Where is he?
He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.
If this system moves south
we could see a wind-driven storm surge
that could threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Okay, bye.
Victor's stuck in traffic over on Fifth Avenue.
It'll be easier to head straight out of town if we just meet him over there.
All right.
You mean walk?
No, not in this.
We should take the stairs.
We're on the top floor.
I guess we're walking.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I think the young lady is right sir.
No. We need to get home.
Hey, Cesar, come here.
What are you doing?
The wolves, they're gone.
Just to give you an idea of the situation
which seems to be becoming worse with each passing minute.
At the moment, we have flooding in most parts of the island.
We've got traffic snarl-ups because the electricity is now out
to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.
Car accidents, at least two hundred.
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?
Hey.
That dog can't come in here.
Come on, man.
It's pouring out there.
I don't care. Read the sign.
It's supposed to be a public library.
Come on, guys, this way.
Excuse me. You're bad.
Goddamn 1500-dollar waterproof raincoat.
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.
That's because it's New York.
Hey! Hey!
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.
It's out of service.
No, no. I'll give you 100 dollars to put it in service.
You don't have to do that.
No, no, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it. I won't have it.
Oh god, I love buses.
This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.
Hello?
I can't reach my driver.
- I lost the signal.
- This is insane.
We're not gonna be able to drive anywhere.
We should just go back to your apartment.
Yeah, I vote for that.
What? Are you kidding?
We have to get higher!
Come on.
Up to the library.
Calm down.
I can't understand what you're saying.
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.
The door is jammed!
I don't speak French!
Hey, where's Laura?
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?
What is she doing?
Tell them to cover their eyes.
There is a wall of water coming towards New York City.
Everybody...
What? What's the problem?
She left her bag in the cab.
Their passports.
Forget about it.
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.
Oh, my...
Laura!
Laura!
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!
Laura! Laura, look!
Come on. Come!
Come on!
Sam!
No!
Professor.
Thank you.
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.
No, this masterpiece belongs to my second grandson, David.
God. I can't believe
Neville's 6 already.
You won't believe how fast they grow.
Professor.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.
They've run the data we've sent them.
Here he is.
Jack, were you able to recreate the thermal cycle?
Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled air all the way down from the upper troposphere.
But shouldn't the air warm up before it reaches ground level?
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.
Is this an isolated incident?
I'm afraid not.
We've located two other super cells in addition to the one over Scotland.
There is one over Northern Canada
and another one over Siberia.
And do we know their projected paths?
Yes.
Our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren't even close.
This one storm is going to change the face of our planet.
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.
This is 48 hours out.
And in seven to ten days...
When this storm is over
we'll be in a new Ice Age.
My god.
Professor...
It's time you got out of there.
I'm afraid that time has come and gone, my friend.
What can we do?
Save as many as you can.
Jack.
Something's happened in New York.
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.
What?
This is the last one. Enjoy it.
Greedy.
All circuits are busy at this time.
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.
It was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
Sam?
Just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
Did you reach your little brother yet?
No, there's still no service.
Damn cell phones.
- Excuse me.
- Yes.
Are there any pay phones on the upper floors?
No, no, no.
Ah. But there are some on the mezzanine.
Great.
- Oh, but I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.
Older payphones draw their power directly from the telephone line.
There will be an emergency meeting of all NOAA department heads...
Oh, god. I've been trying to reach Sam.
So have I.
I tried to call you but I couldn't get through.
It's been a madhouse around here.
Come on.
Are you sure about this?
It works.
I love that picture.
Yeah, so do I.
Where was that taken?
Miami.
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska, doing research on your doctorate.
Remember what he was like when he was that age?
Everything was "one more."
One more bedtime story.
One more ride on my shoulders.
"One more, daddy."
Jack. Sam's on the phone.
Line four.
- Sam?
- Dad!
Where are you?
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
We're at the Public Library.
Sam, it's Mom.
- I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.
Can you call Laura and
Brian's parents and tell them we're all right?
Yes, of course.
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?
Sam?
What is going on out there, dad?
Sam. Sam, listen to me.
Listen very carefully.
Forget what I said about trying to head south.
It's too late for that.
The storm is just gonna get worse.
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard
with an eye in the center of it, just like a huge hurricane.
Uh huh.
Only the air is gonna be so cold.
You could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
Well, what should we do?
Listen to me, son.
Do not go outside.
Just burn whatever you can to stay warm, and try to wait it out.
I will come for you.
Do you understand me?
I will come for you.
Sam?
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?
- Sam?
Sam, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Sam?
- Tell me he's gonna be okay...
- He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right, do you understand me?
I thought you'd drowned.
Let's find some dry clothes for you. Come on.
Where'd you store the arctic gear?
You can't make it to New York, Jack.
I've walked that far before in the snow.
This is not the same.
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
My hands are shak...
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.
Here. Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm using my body heat to warm you.
If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly your heart could fail.
Where did you learn that?
Some of us were actually paying attention in health class.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going, but there's something I need for you do first.
You have to explain your results to the Administration.
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.
You're gonna brief the President directly.
- Is that the last of it?
- Yeah. Pretty much.
Okay.
We also found this radio, but I don't think it works.
Let me see it.
Buddha, keep quiet.
You ain't even supposed to be in here anyway.
Come on, guys.
Oh, my god.
The basic rule of storms is that they continue until the imbalance that created them is corrected.
In this case, we're talking about a global realignment.
This superstorm will last seven to ten days.
When it's over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize but with an average temperature close to that of the last Ice Age.
Well, what can we do about this?
Head as far south as possible.
That is not amusing, professor.
Where do you suggest they go?
The farther south they go, the safer they'll be.
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded.
Mexico would be best.
Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us.
Well, we tried that approach.
You didn't want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference.
What exactly are you proposing, professor?
Evacuate everyone south of that line.
What about the people in the North?
I'm afraid it's too late for them.
If they go outside the storm will kill them.
At this point their best chance is to stay inside.
Try to ride it out.
Pray.
What do you think he'll do?
I don't know.
Jack.
Thanks... and good luck.
You too.
We're all gonna need it.
We can't evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
Every minute we delay is costing lives.
What about the other half of the country?
If Professor Hall is right about this storm pattern sending troops north will create more victims.
We need to save the people we can right now.
We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield.
Sometimes it's necessary to make difficult choices...
I don't accept that abandoning half the country is necessary.
Maybe if you would've listened to him sooner, it wouldn't be.
Bullshit. It's easy for him to suggest this plan.
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.
I just thought that you should know that before you start questioning his motives.
We're going to follow Hall's plan.
- General.
- Sir?
Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate the southern states.
Yes, sir.
Vivian... get me my wife.
Sorry, mates, but we're just about out of petrol.
Hey.
Is there any chance... that it'll run... on this?
Are you mad?
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.
Gentlemen.
To England.
To mankind.
To Manchester United.
I just...
I just wish I could have seen him grow up. You know?
The important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
Maybe you should have somebody help you with that, you know.
Sir, I am president of the
Electronics Club the Math Club and the Chess Club.
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here, please, point him out.
I'll just leave you alone to work on it, okay?
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.
Look, there's nobody around.
OK. You know what?
I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.
What?
Hey, man, there is people out there.
I was walking my dog.
There is hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.
Where they all going?
They're getting out of the city before it's too late.
All right, everybody. Quiet down.
When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone?
Well, I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago.
They're being evacuated to the South.
We should get moving too.
The water is frozen over enough to walk on.
We should get going before the snow gets too deep.
Everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can.
- We shouldn't go.
- We're leaving in five minutes.
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.
When I talked to my dad, he told me to stay inside.
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.
What? Listen son, we're all scared, but we've got no choice.
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.
If these people go outside, they will freeze to death!
Okay, what is this nonsense?
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.
The people who are caught outside they will freeze to death.
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?
We stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out.
The snow is getting deeper by the minute.
We'd be trapped here without food, supplies...
- It's a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.
No, no. It's not.
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people
Let's go.
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody...
- One second.
- Let's get going.
The storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.
You're not gonna be able to survive it.
Believe me.
Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.
Just don't...
She's set to go.
Come on, straight to the back, guys.
It'll be impossible to reach each other.
Leave a message for me at the
American Embassy in Mexico City.
Okay, I will.
I love you.
I love you, Jack.
Tell Sam I love him so much.
God be with you.
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.
We haven't been able to reach Peter's parents.
- I'm gonna try it later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.
I got it.
You're supposed to be on a bus heading south.
I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?
All these years I thought
I was watching your back.
Where are the keys?
In the truck.
Where do you think you're going?
Neither one of you knows how to navigate worth a damn.
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.
I'll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way.
Good luck, Jack.
Breaking news from the U.S.-Mexico border.
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border in the light of so many U.S. refugees who are fleeing south in the wake of the approaching storm.
These people came here in anticipation of crossing into Mexico.
Instead, they've been met with closed gates.
And now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico.
The scene that unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration.
People have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico.
Here it is.
This fireplace probably hasn't been used in about 100 years.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we're gonna burn?
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.
You wanna freeze to death?
I'll go get some more.
I'll help you.
I'm going with them.
Okay, do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom?
Just an employees' lounge with a few vending machines.
We're not gonna last very long on MandM's and potato chips.
What about the garbage cans?
There's always something to eat in the garbage.
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can not burn Nietzsche.
He was the most important thinker of the 19th century.
Please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist pig who was in love with his sister.
He was not a chauvinist pig.
But he was in love with his sister.
Excuse me? you guys?
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn.
After hours of uncertainty, the traffic is now moving smoothly
from the United States into Mexico.
This is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal
to forgive all Latin American debt in exchange for opening the border.
Now, multitudes of American families are feeling a rush of relief...
Lucy?
Is Peter's ambulance here?
No.
- Why?
- They've all gone.
- What?
- In the confusion...
I don't know what happened.
People just started to panic, and they left, and...
- God.
- Now there's a policeman with a snowplow.
- He's waiting outside.
- God.
Peter can't be moved in anything but an ambulance.
I called and left a message for the county ambulance service.
Okay.
Okay, you should go, and I'll stay and wait.
Lucy, no.
- No.
- No, you should go.
He's not gonna wait forever.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- All right.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I cut my leg the other day.
Did you get a signal?
Yeah, for a minute.
And?
Man, this storm is everywhere.
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow and they say it's gonna get just as bad here.
I mean, I don't think your dad's gonna make it.
No, he'll make it.
He'll make it.
The White House has ordered the following national disaster alert
for all Northern states.
Continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly.
Remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm,
burning any fuel sources until the storm is over. 
The Roads are impassable across New York State
as far south as Pennsylvania...
Where are we?
Looks like we're just north of Philadelphia.
Look out!
You guys okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Once again, the roads across the...
Sorry, boss.
Unpack the snowshoes.
We're walking from here.
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.
What for? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.
Time to get up and keep moving.
What we should've done is stayed in the library.
Come on, man.
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Wake up.
What are you doing?
Insulating.
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.
You know, you spend some years on the streets and you learn how to keep warm.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got one.
Your favorite vacation.
Besides this one?
All right.
I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago... and the ship broke down, and we got stuck.
And it rained constantly.
That sounds really boring.
But actually really nice, you know?
Just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days.
Frank!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.
I gotta lose this sled.
Hold on! We'll pull you up.
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.
Okay, I'll try.
Okay, I think I have his weight now.
I'm coming to you.
The glass is breaking!
Too much weight.
It's not gonna hold.
No. No.
Frank. I can get you out.
Don't do it!
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!
Frank!
What have you got there?
A Gutenberg Bible.
It was in the rare books room.
You think god's gonna save you?
No. I don't believe in god.
You're holding onto that Bible pretty tight.
I'm protecting it.
This Bible is the first book ever printed.
It represents the dawn of the age of reason.
As far as I'm concerned, the written word is mankind's greatest achievement.
You can laugh.
But if Western civilization is finished
I'm gonna save at least one little piece of it.
We heard somebody was left behind.
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank god.
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?
You look like you have a fever or something.
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.
My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts.
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.
I guess you just haven't had time to adjust yet.
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
Everything I've ever cared about, everything I've worked for has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists.
I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously.
You were right.
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I...
No, I just... I just said that to avoid admitting the truth.
Truth about what?
About why I joined the team.
I joined it because of you.
Hey.
I know.
I know.
- Mr. President.
- All right.
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.
We're the last ones.
All right.
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.
We've got an urgent message for high command.
Request priority for landing zone one.
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.
Madam Secretary.
Raymond.
The president's motorcade got caught in the storm.
They didn't make it.
And she wouldn't wake up this morning. I...
I mean last night she only had a fever.
I don't understand.
She's awfully pale.
Well guys, look.
None of us has had anything real to eat in days.
- I'm telling you it's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?
- We've all been in...
- Look maybe it's just the flu, you guys.
No, no, it's not the flu.
And how do you know?
Books can be good for something other than burning.
All right, let's go for her symptoms?
I told you that she has a fever and her...
She's got a really cold sweat.
How's her pulse?
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?
Like a cut or something that might have gotten infected?
She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago.
I didn't think anything of it.
Oh, my gosh.
That's blood poisoning.
Uh, Septicemia.
She could go into septic shock.
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.
She needs a massive dose of penicillin... or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, or...
Or what?
I've never seen anything like it.
There's no point of reference.
All I could see is cloud cover.
What are you doing?
Taking infrared image of thermal currents.
Send to Houston, Korolev, your weather service.
I'll help you.
Tom? Tom, wake up.
I just received some satellite images from the space station.
You better take a look.
How big is this thing?
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.
And growing. The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
Good god.
This one's gonna hit New York inside an hour.
Jason!
Are you all right?
Jason!
What are you doing?
There's gotta be medicine on that ship.
I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside.
I know I did.
Where did you find those chairs?
Why?
I'm going with you.
Me too.
Come on, damn it!
- It's all in Russian. I...
- I know.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?
Because it says "penicillin" on the bottle.
Hey, wait a minute.
This is the mess hall.
We should find some food while we're here.
No. We don't have time.
Listen, none of us are gonna survive much longer without food, okay?
Including Laura.
Okay.
- Sam, over here.
- What?
Bingo.
Brian?
- I'm okay.
- What happened?
All I did was open up the cupboard.
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.
Run!
Pull him in, Brian!
- You all right?
- Oh, my god, there's more.
My leg.
Here, use this.
It should be over
New York by now.
Satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of
10 degrees per second.
You guys...
I think we're in the eye of it.
We gotta get back right now.
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna lure the wolves out of the room.
When they leave, you lock the door.
Good luck.
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.
Come on, hurry!
Brian! Brian, open the door!
We have to get out of here now.
Brian, get the supplies.
Let's go!
Pull, Brian!
Take the medicine to Laura.
We're almost there.
Come on!
Brian! Close the door!
Don't let the fire go out!
What's happening?
Buddha, come away from the door.
Come, Buddha, come!
More books! More books!
How long have I been out of it?
Couple hours.
How do you feel?
Okay. What happened?
Well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I, uh... sort of pushed you in.
I should be used to you pushing me around.
Good to have you back.
What are you doing?
The eye of the storm has passed, and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.
Jack, shouldn't we wait one more day?
Sam may not have one more day.
What do you think's gonna happen to us?
What do you mean?
I mean us. Civilization.
Everybody.
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.
We're certainly capable of surviving this one.
All depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes.
I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine.
You did everything you could.
I was thinking about Sam.
Jack, you know the chances of Sam...
I made my son a promise.
I'm going to keep it.
Parker, this is Houston.
Do you read?
Roger, mission control.
Go ahead.
We're getting scattered reports
that the storm is dissipating over North America.
Can you confirm?
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.
We're over Europe right now.
I can see landmass for the first time in days.
How much further is it to the library?
It should be... right here.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Sam?
Who is that?
My father.
You made it.
Of course I did.
Mr. President.
I've just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall.
He made it to New York.
He says there are survivors.
Thank you, Tom.
That's...
That's good news.
These past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility
in the face of nature's destructive power.
For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue
consuming our planet's natural resources without consequence.
We were wrong.
I was wrong.
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil
is a testament to our changed reality.
Not only Americans
but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations
we once called
The Third World.
In our time of need, they have taken us in and sheltered us.
And I am deeply grateful for their hospitality.
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate...
Peter? Hey.
You feeling okay today?
For days, we've despaired about the fate of the people
who are trapped in the North.
Today, there is cause for hope.
Only a few hours ago,
I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City
against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity.
I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission
to bring them home and to look for more survivors.
Jack!
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.
Look at that.
What?
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.
Thank you.
Is there a name yet?
Elijah.
Is he supposed to be crying like this?
May I?
Can I have him back?
What happened during the delivery?
Nothing.
It was very quick.
The babyjust wanted to come right out.
And there were no problems.
Did you drop him?
What?
Did you drop this baby?
Jesus Christ, no.
Inform the ambulance that we have a situation.
All right.
Molly.
I've never seen this.
It appears that your baby has sustained some fractures... while inside your uterus.
His arms and his legs are broken.
This is Eastrail 177.
Nextstop, Philadelphia.
Are you alone?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Someone left this magazine.
Want to take a look at it?
Could I take a look at that one?
Thanks.
- You like sports?
- It's my field.
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.
Are you looking for any male synchronized swimmers?
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?
I'm afraid ofwater.
Think that's a problem?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
I'm meeting this player from Temple University.
He's a cornerback.
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.
He runs a 40 in 4,3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.
Do you like football?
Not really.
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice - Nice to meet you.
How long are you gonna be in Philadelphia?
- I'm married.
- Great.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?
I--
I think you misunderstood what I was, uh...
- s-saying--
- I know.
I think I'm gonna find another seat.
I-I didn't mean, uh--
That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.
I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?
But I'm afraid you forgot this!
- And this! And--
- Where has you been, Banana?
Now I've got you, weasel.
Some cars are still on fire, and the debris is everywhere.
We are notsure at this time, uh... how rescue personnel will be able to get on scene at all.
If you're just tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177... has derailed just outside Philadelphia.
And we're bringing you live coverage from Skycam 4.
Yes, that is-- It appears to be a rescue ambulance... and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.
I don't know how close they're gonna be able toget, David.
These are woodsand, uh, trees.
It's gonna be a very difficult rescue effort.
Try to hack some of that off.
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.
You're in the emergency room in the Philadelphia City Hospital.
You were in a serious accident.
Look at me.
How are you feeling?
- Okay.
- Good.
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
Have you ever had any heart or asthma problems in the past?
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?
- No.
- Any allergies?
No.
Where were you sitting on the train?
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?
Yeah.
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
Are you certain you were in the passenger car?
Yes.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Your train derailed.
Some kind of malfunction.
They only found two people alive so far-- you and this man.
His skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed.
And to answer your question, there are two reasons... why I'm looking at you like this.
One, because it seems in a few minutes... that you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck.
And two... because you didn't break one bone.
You don't have a scratch on you.
David?
What happened in New York?
I don't think I got the job.
I'm still going to, uh--
I'm still moving there.
Just--
Uh, just - just not now.
Good night.
Good night.
Sara Elaston... social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.
We pray foryour soul.
Kevin Elliot, businessman... father of six.
We pray for your soul.
Glen Stevens... researcher in the area of leukemia... at Drexel University.
We pray for your soul.
Jennifer Pennyman... third-grade teacher at Jefferson Elementary.
We pray for your soul.
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?
No, sir, he is not.
I read about you in the paper.
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.
A horse almost trampled me to death.
- Wow.
- Had him put down.
That's a sad story.
Could-- Could you ask Noel something for me, please?
Proceed.
Would you ask him to check how many sick days I've taken... since I've worked here?
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.
Thankyou.
Hey, Noel.
What, you hit your head on that train?
Get your brain to start working again?
- What?
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.
That's it.
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.
Smart way to make your point.
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.
- He's asleep.
- Oh.
I wanted to ask you a question.
It's gonna sound a little strange, but, uh... just think about it for a second, okay?
Okay.
When's the last time I was sick?
Do you remember?
Um, I-I don't know.
It's been a while.
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.
Okay.
Do you remember me gettin' sick?
Um... not a specific day.
And what's-what's this about?
Audrey, do you remember me ever getting sick?
In the three years we lived in this house?
In the old apartment?
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?
I-I can't remember.
Don't you think that's kind of weird... not remembering one cold or a-a fever or a sore throat?
What do you think it means?
Um...
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.
You might fall between this chair and that television.
If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's gonna happen.
You can't hide from it sittin' in a room.
They call me Mr Glass at school because I break like glass.
You make this decision now... to be afraid... and you will never turn back.
Your whole life, you will always be afraid.
- I got a present for you.
- Why?
Forget why.
You want it or not?
Well, go get it, then.
Where is it?
On a bench... across the street.
Someone's gonna take it.
Then you better get out there soon.
I bought a whole bunch.
There'll be one of these waitin' for you... every time you want to come out here.
They say this one has a surprise ending.
This is from Fritz Campion's own library.
This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968.
It's a classic depiction of good versus evil.
Notice the square jaw of Slayer, common in most comic heroes.
And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's head to his body.
This again is common, but only in villains.
The thing to notice about this piece... the thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures.
When the characters reached the magazine... they were exaggerated... as always happens.
This is vintage.
Well... wrap it up.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.
Once again, please?
My son Jeb-- it's a gift for him.
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
You need to go. Now.
What'd - What'd I say?
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?
Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt... with my name printed on it?
Did you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside... in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it?
No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store... and you must think you're in a toy store because... you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
Now, one of us has made a gross error... and wasted the other person's valuable time.
This is an art gallery, my friend... and this is a piece ofart.
We're by appointment only.
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.
This one was under the windshield wiper of my car.
How certain are you that you've never taken ill?
Seventy-five percent.
Well, that's not certain at all, is it?
That's hole number one.
I'm going to be extremely skeptical about all this.
About all what?
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?
Dad's been injured.
Is the child correct?
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.
That's hole number two.
That's a big one.
Mr Price, can we talk about the note that you left on my car?
I've studied the form of comics intimately.
I've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed... with nothing else to do but read.
I believe comics are our last link... to an ancient way of passing on history.
The Egyptians drew on walls.
Countries all over the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms.
I believe comics are a form of history... that someone somewhere felt or experienced.
Then, of course, those experiences and that history... got chewed up in the commercial machine, got jazzed up... made titillating, cartooned for the sale rack.
This city has seen its share of disasters.
I watched the aftermath of that plane crash.
I watched the carnage of the hotel fiire.
I watched the news waiting to hear a very specifiic combination of words... but they never came.
Then one day I saw a news story about a train accident... and I heard them.
"There is a sole survivor... and he is miraculously unharmed."
I have something called osteogenesis imperfecta.
It's a genetic disorder.
I don't make a particular protein very well... and it makes my bones very low in density.
Very easy to break.
I've had 54 breaks in my life... and I have the tamest version of this disorder, type one.
There are type two, type three, type four.
Type fours don't last very long.
So that's how it popped into my head.
If there is someone like me in the world... and I'm at one end of the spectrum... couldn't there be someone else... the opposite of me at the other end?
Someone who doesn't get sick, who doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?
And he probably doesn't even know it.
The kind of person these stories are about.
A person put here to protect the rest of us.
To guard us.
- You think my dad's a real--
- I don't think anything right now.
It's a possibility-- one with many holes.
Joseph, don't take another sip of that water.
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad--
Do it now, please.
I see guys like you all the time in my work.
You find someone you want to take advantage of... you tell them a fantastic story... and somewhere in there you say it:
"I just need your credit card number... a small down payment."
This morning was the first morning that I could remember... that I didn't open my eyes and feel... sadness.
I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me.
I'm gonna leave now.
Good luck with your exhibition.
So, what kind ofjob do you have, David?
You said you've met guys like me in your work.
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.
I'm a security guard.
Hi.
I've come to a decision.
Okay.
I just wanna ask you something, okay?
And you can be totally honest.
I'm prepared for any answer, and-and it won't affect me.
Have you been with anyone?
I mean, since we've been having problems.
The answer won't affect me.
I just need to know, you know?
I mean, it won't affect me either way.
No.
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.
Anyway... my decision is... that I want to start again.
And I want it to be like it was in the beginning.
And it's a big deal that you walked away from that train.
I feel like it's a second chance.
And if you feel like asking me out sometime... that'd be okay.
Okay.
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.
Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.
You could have owned your own gym. You could've opened a chain of restaurants.
You could've done one of 10,000 things.
But in the end, you chose to protect people.
You made that decision, and I find that... very, very interesting.
Now all I need is your credit card number.
That last part was a joke.
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.
It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff.
Programme here.
Programme.
Programme.
Programme. Programme here.
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.
-Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.
Sometimes people carry weapons in here, and they drink too much.
If the team's not doing good, bad things can happen.
We do pat-downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.
If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
Yeah, step right up here.
Okay. I got you a seat up in the yellow section.
It's in the nosebleeds, but at least you won't get spit on.
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped... was carrying a weapon?
I don't know.
Maybe it was that camouflage armyjacket he was wearing.
Those guys like to carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something, yeah.
But not a knife.
I got a picture of a silver gun with a black grip... tucked in his pants.
You know, like on TV.
You have good instincts for things like that?
Like what?
Knowing when people have done something wrong.
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.
Look, I gotta be down on the sidelines during the game.
- You can get to your seat right down--
- Characters in comics... are often attributed special powers-- invisibility, X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Okay.
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.
Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct.
- But he might not have been carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying... a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants.
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.
- One last question.
- What?
That car accident you were in.
Was there anyone else involved?
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.
She was in the car with me.
Have a good life, Elijah.
Next time, try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location.
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.
...into the investigation of train 177... being conductedat the Eastrail holding warehouses.
The citycouncil has stepped up plans to pass a bill... requiring higher standards for inspection and maintenance... of all rail transportation for Philadelphia... and its outlying districts.
Hold up a second!
I just want to ask you something.
Dad! Hey, Dad!
Dad!
Joseph, do you know how mad your mother would be if she knew you were playing football?
Are you gonna tell?
You wanna play last ofthe downs?
We got a big guy like you.
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.
He's starting cornerback at Temple University.
He's going pro in the draft.
They say he can run the
40 Yards in 4,3 seconds.
Yeah, I've heard.
You can beat him, Dad.
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.
Just play one set ofdowns.
I told them you were great.
- Why'd you do that?
-Just one.
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need--
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!
I've got to run
To keep from hiding
And I'm bound
To keep on riding
And I've got one more silverdollar
How much did you put on there?
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.
How much can you lift?
That's the most I ever lifted.
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.
Why don't you go upstairs now and let me finish up, okay?
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.
You think you could have beaten up Bruce Lee?
No.
I mean, if you knew karate.
No.
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick, and you were really mad at him?
No, Joseph.
How much did you take off?
I lied.
You added?
How much is it?
270 pounds.
Let's put more.
Okay.
Why don't you move back a little just to be safe, okay?
More?
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?
What do you do if something bad happens?
Get Mom.
Right.
How much did you put on that time?
All of it.
What else can we use?
How much is it?
How much is it, Dad?
About 350 pounds.
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal of the right hand... as well as multiple fractures of the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.
The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the right leg... in the form of a spiral fracture.
There were 14 breaks.
It simply shattered.
They call me Mr. Glass.
- Who does?
- Kids.
Are you all right, Mr Price?
Shall I continue?
Pins were placed throughout the length of the leg.
The use of a wheelchair will be needed for a two-month period.
The use of crutches will follow for 12 to 14 months.
Hospital stay will range from fiive to eight days... followed by 9 to 12 months of physical therapy.
Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms... of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.
The hospital discharged him this morning.
Thanks.
Elijah, right?
We're gonna prevent any substantial atrophy ofyour good leg with this... and it works your quadriceps.
How long have you been married?
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?
I'm a little nervous being here.
I ask too many questions when I'm nervous.
A car accident.
Oh. And now you're gonna have to tell me more.
My husband was a star athlete in college... and we were in an accident together.
Our car flipped on an icy road and we were both injured, and he couldn't play football any more.
And if that hadn't happened, we probably wouldn't have been together.
- How so?
- I think we should talk about your rehab.
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
So, tell me more about the quad machine.
It prevents atrophy by--
I couldn't spend my life with someone who played football.
It's pretty much that simple.
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involves.
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.
But football, in many ways, is the opposite of what I do.
You're rewarded the more you punish your opponent.
You know, it's too much about violence, and I don't want violence in my life.
It's not a thing many people can understand, but--
Anyway, fate stepped in with that car accident... and took football out of the equation.
And everyone lived happily ever after.
Sort of.
What part of David's body was injured?
Who said my husband's name was David?
Ladies and gentlemen--
In the first half--
A 737 crashes on takeoff--
172 die, no survivors.
A hotel fire downtown--
211 die, no survivors.
An Eastrail train derails
7 1/2 miles outside the city--
131 die... one survivor.
He is unharmed.
I've spoken with your husband about his survival.
I suggested a rather unbelievable possibility.
Since then, I've come to believe that possibility... however unbelievable... is now more a probability.
And what was it you suggested?
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe... there are extraordinary things inside themselves as well as others.
I hope you can keep an open mind.
Excuse me, sir?
Can you step out of line, please?
We've been having some problems with people selling drugs here in the stadium.
Would you mind if I check your pockets?
Raise your arms, please.
Come on, raise them up.
I just got here, man.
Can I put my hands down now?
Can I go?
Yeah.
Hope you find them.
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.
He wants you to come down there.
Is that your dad?
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.
No, he, uh, he insisted we call only you... though we had some trouble tracking you down.
I mean, you're not on our list.
Audrey handles this type of stuff.
Oh. What type of stuff?
Joseph stuff.
Do I need to put any smelly ointment on him or anything?
No, no, it's more emotional damage.
Not, uh--
Not to serious, physically.
Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital.
When was that?
My office was on the other side of the building back then.
You don't remember me, do you?
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.
Well, you were a little younger than Joseph when it happened.
Did you know that we changed the rules of conduct... around the pool because of you?
The kids still tell about it...
Like it was some sort of ghost story.
"Did you know there was a kid nearly drowned in that pool?
He lay on the bottom of the pool for five minutes.
And when they pulled him out, he was dead."
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.
You still phobic of water?
It was Potter and another guy.
They were messing with this Chinese girl in the dressing room.
Y-You can't let bad things happen to good people, right?
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.
I tried to make them stop... but they kept pushing me down, and they wouldn't let me get back up.
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...
I thought I might be like you.
I'm not like you.
You are like me.
We can both get hurt.
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.
Why do you keep saying that?
Elijah Price came to visit me at the centre today.
Jesus.
He didn't do anything. Hejust... told me his theory.
That's sad when patients get like that.
They lose reality.
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?
Oh, my God.
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't know where I keep the bullets.
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.
Joseph, did you load the gun?
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.
No one believes him.
Joseph, listen to me.
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt for a long time, like Elijah... their mind gets hurt too, and they start to think things that aren't true.
He told me what he thought about your father. It isn't true.
I'll show you.
Do you remember the story about the-- about the boy that almost drowned in the pool?
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.
You're lying.
I'm not lying, okay? I just didn't remember it, that's all.
Joseph, you know your father was injured in college.
You know that.
You know all about that.
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.
- I'll just shoot him once.
-Joseph, listen to what your moth--
Don't be scared.
Joseph... if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.
Y-Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger... that bullet is just gonna bounce off me, and I'm not going to be hurt.
But then I'm going to go upstairs and I'm gonna pack... and I'm going to leave for New York.
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real.
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't--
And-And they don't shoot each other, uh, uh, do they, Audrey?
N-No shooting friends,Joseph.
Joseph!
You are about to be in big trouble!
Now, I am your father, and I am telling you... to put that goddamn gun down right now!
One, two--
I followed the guy in the camouflage jacket.
He had a silver gun with a black grip tucked in the back of his pants.
Were you really injured in that car accident in college?
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity... to end your football career, no questions asked.
And I think you did it, of all things, for a woman.
I guess that makes sense.
Football's what, just ten years?
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.
And that little bit of sadness in the mornings you spoke of?
I think I know what that is.
Perhaps you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing.
Most guns have a black or silver handle.
I had a 50-50 shot of getting the colour right.
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.
My son almost shot me last night because he wanted to prove you were right.
I never said you couldn't be killed.
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.
There have been three major disasters, and you were the only one unharmed.
I have been sick.
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the hospital getting better from pneumonia.
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids... were fooling around in a pool dunking me and I swallowed some water.
They didn't know it, and it almost killed me.
Heroes don't get killed like that.
Normal people do, right?
I don't need to see you any more, okay?
Please stay away from my family.
She said I could tell stories that could make you cry
What about you
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.
I gotta head.
And she sighed, ahh lsaid, I want to be a singer
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.
Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics
Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby
Why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears
I said, losing my penis to a whore with disease
Uh, look, man, I didn't know you were in a--
Losin'my life to a whore with disease
-Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please
The baby-sitter's here.
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.
We can do this another time.
Don't lie.
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.
How about we just go for a couple drinks?
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.
All right? You can think about things outside on the sidewalk.
I gotta get some chicken in me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired
- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!
She's a little bit older than me
Strong legs, strong face voice like milk
Breasts like a cluster  of grapes
I can't escape her ways
She raise me
- Dude.
- Even if you have no one
Man, I don't care if you are in a wheelchair. If you do that again...
I'm calling 5-0.
And while you're at it, baby
Man.
You don't want to sleep aftersetting my loins on fire
That's it, cracker jack. You're gonna be sitting your ass in jail now.
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?
I've been tired
- Rust?
- Yeah.
As a colour, not as rust.
You know, like rust-coloured paint or wood.
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.
Mine's still brown.
Okay, my turn.
Favourite song?
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.
What?
We're supposed to be honest.
"Soft And Wet."
That's very interesting.
Okay, my turn.
When was the first time... the thought popped into your head we might not make it?
That's not the game.
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.
What about the game?
It's over. I won.
Look, maybe it wasn't a specific moment.
- Maybe it was a time--
- I had a nightmare one night... and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me that it was okay.
I think that was the first time.
Does that count?
That counts.
Do you knowingly keep me and Joseph at a distance?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.
I just don't feel right, Audrey.
Something's... just not right.
Do you resent us, David?
Resent the life you have?
I mean, there were a lot of other things you could've done after college.
These were your choices.
You know, even if it meant we couldn't have been together...
I never would've wished that injury on you.
What you could do physically... was a gift.
I never would've wished it to go away.
You know that, right?
You had two calls after Joseph went to bed. One came through... while I was on the other line, but I wasn't talking too long.
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do her own perm, and now she looks like she stuck her head--
Who called through?
Um, someone from New York... uh, about a security job.
They want to hire you. I didn't know you guys were moving to New York.
Thanks for telling me.
We weren't all gonna move.
Oh.
I let the answering machine pick up the other call.
Great.
Look, let'sjust be honest here.
We're just at the beginning... and I don't expect you or I to change... the course of where our lives were headed... because of one date.
And if you do go to New York, we can develop this.
We'll just be forced to take it slow.
And in the end, I think that's defiinitely better.
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us... to get carried away.
But I guess "congratulations" is the right thing to say.
David, it's Elijah.
It was so obvious.
It was this one issue that brought it back for me--
Century Comics 117.
That's where this group, the Coalition of Evil... tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero... because they all have one, just like you.
Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.
Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.
But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
We swallow it too fast, we choke.
We get some in our lungs, we drown.
However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I.
We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
The point of all this is we now know something we didn't.
You have a weakness-- water.
It's like your kryptonite.
You hearing me, David?
Audrey?
Gotcha. Come on.
Audrey. Audrey.
Hey!
You'll be okay.
What-- What happened?
I thought I was--
I thought I was dead.
Me too.
Is she all right?
I think her leg's broken.
Are you hurt?
Hey, man, are you hurt?
Hello.
I wasn't injured in that caraccident.
David.
I've never been injured, Eliijah.
What am I supposed to do?
Go to where people are.
You won't have to look very long.
It's all right to be afraid, David... because this part won't be like a comic book.
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it.
There's one in the first row.
It's-- It's the second one.
Yes. It's the second one over.
Go back to Africa!
Hey, what's your name?
I think you drank too much.
Can I come in?
Who are you?
I like your house.
Can I come in?
What is this?
No, you can't come in.
Are you sure?
What are-- What are you--
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
I had a bad dream.
It's over now.
I don't know.
I can't believe you'd think that.
I'm just asking you.
I'm making French toast.
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.
If he shows up again, I think we should call the police, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
You were right.
This is one of Johann Davis' earliest drawings.
See the villain's eyes?
They're larger than the other characters'.
They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective on how they see the world-- just off normal.
He doesn't look scary.
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.
But he says there's always two kinds.
There's the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands... and then there's the real threat-- the brilliant and evil archenemy... who fights the hero with his mind.
Are you Elijah's mother?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.
He's spoken ofyou.
Says you're becoming friends.
We are.
Looks like he's doing good today.
I'm very proud of him.
He's come through a lot in his life-- a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.
Mm-hmm. They were bad... but he made it.
Yes, he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
Yes, he is.
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.
It has begun.
Tell me something, David.
When you woke up this morning, was it still there?
The sadness?
No.
I think this is where we shake hands.
- Look!
- Did you see it?
I worked in that building 25 years.
I know all its secrets.
Secrets?
Like if there ever was a fire on floors one, two or three... everyone in that hotel would be burned alive.
Passengers aren't allowed in there.
Do you know what the scariest thing is?
To not know your place in this world... to not know why you're here.
That's--
That's just an awful feeling.
What have you done?
I almost gave up hope.
There were so many times
I questioned myself.
You killed all those people.
But I found you.
So many sacrifiices... just to find you.
Jesus Christ!
Now that we know who you are...
I know who I am.
I'm not a mistake.
It all makes sense.
In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be?
He's the exact opposite of the hero.
And most times, they're friends, like you and me.
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?
Because of the kids.
They called me Mr. Glass.
Benjamin.
Benjamin?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- Then why did you wake me?
- I was running a test.
But we didn't schedule any tests.
I was running a test to perform an unscheduled test.
- What? Why?
- Please. Be more specific, Benjamin.
Why did you want to wake me and perform an unscheduled test?
Wanting is a human emotion, and not within my capability.
- I know that.
- Benjamin.
Can we play chess now?

- Good.
- What happened to your robot?
- Nothing.
Really? Hope "nothing" doesn't happen to me.
The captain's big on
20th century cultural artefacts, so we did him up as a World War One fighter pilot.
We do things like that just to amuse each other. Everyone tries to get along here.
- I get along fine.
- You've been on board 12 days.
Asking about a robot's the first sign of interest you've shown in this ship or crew.
- I got a captain who watches cartoons,...
- He's working on his PhD.
..a computer tech who calls his mainframe Sweetie and two medical techs practising anatomy in any corner they can find.
I've been on six paramedic tours with this crew. They get the job done.
We're out here for months.
Nothing happens.
People get lonely.
Then suddenly all hell breaks loose, you do your job, then it all goes back to nothing happens.
This crew's OK.
Want to tell me what you're doing out here?
Ex-military pilots don't usually request work probation on paramedic ships.
I like deep space. It's quiet.
People out here tend to respect each other's privacy.
Take one a day.
You can put your shirt on.
Zyracon, huh?
Happy pills.
I'm happy.
Hazen's a tough drug to kick.
Zyracon helps with the residual effects.
- I'm clean.
- Human interaction helps too.
The crew's OK.
Maybe you should take the time to get to know them.
Thank you, doctor.
My analysis ofcards played shows a 77% chance ofyou losing, Benjamin.
Five miles of fibre optics sort of spoils the spirit of competition, don't you think, Sweetie?
Gin.
When I reprogrammed her for this tour,
I put some human traits into her personality profile.
I sort of wanted them to find out because it'd really piss them off.
But if they ever do,
I'm dead.
I'm assuming you're not gonna turn me in...
You don't know me well enough to make that assumption.
Your deal.
My analysis ofCopilot Vanzant's vital signs suggests a very high probability that he will turn you in, Benjamin.
I'm not gonna turn you in.
The laserpulse is focused into a surgical-quality beam capable ofthe mostprecise incisions.
- Hello, doctor. Mind if I sit down?
- What if I do?
- Following orders - get to know the crew.
- So, the Zyracon worked.
I act nice and you want the credit?
You act nice, modern medicine gets the credit.
I've found staying clean is sort of like staying alive. You either are... or you aren't.
Count them. They're all there.
Since we don't bring out the pleasant side in each other, tell me what the hell bothers you so much about me.
I don't like Hazen.
It's not just a type-H mind-altering escape.
I don't like what it does to people who take it, I don't like what they do to others.
- I used to know someone...
- I'm not someone.
Didn't say you were.
There's nothing I can do to change the past, yours or mine.
Heal thyself, doctor.
Emergency distress signal received.
- We're still in business!
- Nothing like being wanted.
I'll be in the engine room.
I've forgotten everything.
What's my job? What do I do?
- Come on.
- It's been that long.
Emergency distress signal received.
Bridge.
Check.
Medical.
Check.
What have we got?
Signal received.
SOS, critical.
The signal's degraded.
It's taken five days to get here.
Dispatch misrouted it?
This isn't from dispatch. It's a direct call.
Direct? We don't get direct. Origin?
Pohl 6822.
I'm getting a little more.
Call letters for a merchant enterprise.
It's Titan 37.
It's a mining operation.
This is way past the colony outpost.
Sweetie, pull up all records on Titan 37, Pohl 6822.
Titan 37: lunarmining operation.
This moon was expelled from orbit around its original starsystem
- and is now classified as a rogue body.
- Rogue moon.
There's a lot of gravitational instability in that sector.
Mining operation was abandoned when rogue moon drifted into unmapped space.
Complete crew evacuation five years, three months ago.
An SOS from an abandoned mine?
Distance to distress call location:
3,432 light years.
If we wanna answer this call in our lifetimes we'll have to jump.
We haven't jumped in three tours.
I'm not jumping this crew for anything uncertain.
I want a name with some authority.
If there is none, this is a no-go.
Scanning foridentification.
Transmission signature:
Karl James Larson.
Karl.
Karl Larson!
You know him?
Worst nightmare I ever met.
Mr Vanzant, plot us a course, please.
Yes, sir.
Dimension drive fully charged.
Call it, Sweetie.
All crew, prepare forrescue operation via dimensionjump.
You go on ahead.
Course?
Plotted.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber now sterilising.
- Maybe this Karl guy's just coincidence.
- With Karl, nothing's coincidence.
Last time we did this
I didn't shit right for a month.
You're gonna be fine.
This guy panicked during countdown and he jumped out of his DSU.
So this other guy pulls him into his with him, right?
Countdown goes off and they have to
D-jump like that. I'm not kidding!
Afterwards they go to pull 'em out... and it's one guy.
14 feet long with a head on each end!
And then suddenly the heads start talking.
And both of them go, "Are we there yet?"
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.
It's not.
Two minutes to dimensionjump activation.
One minute to dimensionjump activation.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
Research says D-jump is great for your sexual stamina.
- Hallelujah!
- You know, you're gonna get it!
I am?
Kaela.
- I need to talk to you.
- When we get there. Use mine.
- I'll use number four. Now.
- Why?
No time.
- Call it musical chairs.
- Be my guest!
30 seconds to dimensionjump activation.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
All crew, enter dimensional stabilisation units at this time.
Final countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Plasma acceleration.
Oh, I had you!
I definitely had you that time.
Oh, God, no.
Don't touch anything!
His skin's fused with polyglass.
Danika! Nanoscan kit, number three laser scalpel, vascular cauteriser, stat!
He's still alive!
What's happening?
- Sweetie?
- Debris strike. Fuel reservoirbreached.
- Hold him still!
- Benjamin! Bridge, now!
Ship has entered high-gravity field.
Severe fuel loss.
Gravity increasing.
Laser scalpel!
Cauteriser!
Status?
Controls active. Systems up.
- Prime main engine.
- Severe engine damage.
Extreme fuel loss.
Christ.
Blue giant.
That's gonna be ten times the gravity of our sun.
We've jumped into a high-grav field right in the path of that moon's debris cloud!
I can't isolate these veins unless you keep this hatch shut!
Warning. Lunarimpact in 57 seconds.
- Rate of descent?
- 98 metres persecond.
Time to impact?
49 seconds.
- Recommend alternatives?
- Assessment...
Sweetie, get us out of here!
- The hatch is gonna open!
- The controls aren't responding!
- Alternatives, Sweetie!
- Unacceptable risk factor on all options.
- It's opening!
- Cut the power!
Now, dammit!
- It's not working!
- Close the hatch!
- Engage docking thrusters.
- Thrusters insufficient to escape...
Overriding computer. Going manual.
No! We need Sweetie!
What are you doing?
Buying us some time!
Firing docking thrusters.
Kill me.
Please.
- How d'you know how much fuel to use?
- I'm guessing.
- I can't keep it shut much longer.
- Don't kill him!
Please.
Don't kill him.
Oh, God.
Clean this place up.
- Sweetie.
- Do you need me back now, Nick?
- What's our status?
- Fuel loss: 82%.
The dimension drive must recharge in order to escape high solargravity field.
- Time to recharge?
- 17 hours, one minute.
- Flashpoint time based on fuel reserve?
- Solarincineration in 17 hours, 12 minutes.
That leaves you an 11-minute window, Nick.
Maintain orbit, six-second thrusts,
15-minute intervals.
I will maintain orbit.
Start broadcasting ID and position, all coordinates.
See if you can contact the Titan.
This is Trans Soma rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing TSMO Titan 37.
Captain Marley?
This is Trans Soma medical rescue vessel Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma mining operation Titan 37.
Repeat: this is Trans Soma medical rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma mining operation Titan 37.
Oh. Did I wake you?
I thought you might be reading or...
Anyway, I managed to bring on board a fairly good bottle of pear brandy, and I thought, in the spirit of friendship, maybe we could share a glass.
It's...
- It's all right. We'll...
- Lemme see the bottle.
How do you think they get that in there?
They put the bottles on the branches so that the buds are inside and the pears grow right in them.
Then, when they're ripe, they pick the bottles, pour in the brandy and...
Of course, the real question is how the hell you get it out.
Rook to E7.
Congratulations, Benjamin.
Your strategy was both subtle and forceful.
You can play with me wheneveryou want.
Permission to have a child?
I've been trying to get it ever since you told me you wanted a kid.
What if they only approve one of us?
Two fine, non-genetically engineered specimens like us? Are you kidding?
We're gonna get approved.
And then we're gonna make us a baby.
- Bridge.
- Check.
Nick, I think there's something you oughta see.
Then there's this.
- DSU four. The vents weren't modulating.
- That's what killed Marley.
- A warning was going before we jumped.
- You mean he saw that too?
- He had to.
- So he took my DSU.
- Why didn't he cancel the jump?
- He thought it was an acceptable risk.
He should have transferred the call to another vessel.
Then Marley would be alive and you'd be playing chess with Sweetie.
And what if they never crucified Christ?
But they did.
And Marley's gone and here we are and that's how it is.
We've got what we've got.
All crew, repor to bridge.
Now that you've all had some rest, here's what we've got.
We were hit in our main tank when we jumped into this high-gravity field.
We lost most of our fuel.
The good news is we've got enough left for our docking thrusters.
They'll stop us incinerating till the dimension drive recharges.
Then we can dimension-jump home - but we'll be cutting it close.
How close?
1 1 minutes.
Are you telling us that we can't jump until 1 1 minutes before we burn?
I'm telling you we have 1 1 minutes.
It's enough.
I've gotten out of worse situations before.
This ship is going to be fine.
- We have no margin for error!
- Then we won't make any.
Attention.
I-class transpor ship deparing
Titan lunarmining operation.
They must be evacuating.
Sweetie, track that.
Attention. Transpor ship has locked on to our communication signal.
Prepare for intercept.
Suit up.
No response from pilot.
Transpor ship is on automatic approach.
You OK?
Sure.
When you said you'd been in worse situations, were you telling the truth?
Sure. When the ship was falling and the engines cut out, that was worse.
We'll be fine.
Warning. Fire on board approaching vessel. lt must dock immediately.
Approaching vessel, engage docking thrusters.
Repeat, please engage docking thrusters.
Can't spare the fuel for a hover.
We'll catch her on a roll.
Speed still increasing.
Excessive rate ofapproach.
Sterilisation bay?
- Check.
- We're taking a little hit when it docks.
Thanks for letting us know.
15 seconds to impact.
- Still no reply from approaching ship.
- He's running silent.
Or unconscious.
- Watch out!
- Clear!
We got a fire!
Get his helmet off! Check his vital signs.
This is your worst nightmare?
It's not Karl.
Bridge. One patient, male, early 20s, traumatised, unconscious but stable.
And this isn'tthe person who sent the call.
Run that by me one more time.
This isn't Karl Larson.
Meet me on the bridge when you can.
Benjamin, start a full systems check on the ship.
Right, sir.
There's some kind of growth on his bone structure.
These matrices. It looks almost as if his bones are strengthening themselves.
Radiation explosion.
No, much too normal for that.
Note it as a minor anomaly.
Most scanners wouldn't even detect it.
Doctor.
No indication for treatment at this time.
He's as healthy as a horse.
Keep him under observation.
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- It was personal.
- Nothing that affects safety is personal.
- So I know a man who calls Trans Soma.
He didn't call Trans Soma. He called the Nightingale. It was a direct call.
- Tell me what's going on.
- I can't.
I can't because I don't know.
I know a Karl James Larson, but this isn't him.
He had a son. I saw a photoscan of him.
There's a strong resemblance.
I'd guess it's him, but I can't say for sure.
I haven't seen Karl for five years.
When he and I were finished,
I couldn't have children.
I joined Trans Soma to get away from him.
Now, is there anything else that you need to know?
He was the Hazen addict.
How long was I out for?
About 20 minutes.
- How do you feel?
- Better than that transport.
That fire really finished it off!
How embarrassing. I'm Troy.
Danika.
I'm sorry. You're very pretty.
I haven't been around a girl in a while.
Let me go get you some clothes.
- We've only got five DSUs left.
- And there's only five of us.
We have a patient on board.
There's six of us!
We jump as scheduled.
I'll stay behind, take my chances.
- You won't have one.
- Call a rescue craft once you've jumped.
I'll be pretty far down in orbit by the time they get here.
- No, you'll be dead. I'm not goin' for this!
- It's your job to go for this.
Marley would be asking you to do the same.
- I'm not going.
- You want me to pull rank, I will.
Fine. That's an order.
I'm Doctor Evers. How are you feeling?
Happy to be here.
There's no one else down on Titan?
Not even close.
That whole place is like a ghost ship.
The distress call came from Karl Larson.
Yeah. That's my dad.
Was my dad. He died three years ago.
Aneurysm. Real sudden.
Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not.
He's probably one of the worst people that ever lived.
I'm sure you'd agree on that.
I tried to stay as far away from him as possible.
But I went to see him when he was dying.
He said that if I ever got into trouble that you were the person to call.
I guess that's the best advice he ever gave me.
- You seem to have made out OK.
- Yeah.
Seems like you did too.
This is just some vitamins.
You know, up until the end, when he said that I should call you if I needed help, he said he was sorry he didn't change his ways while you were with him.
Because now he'd never get a chance to make it up to you.
He said that's what he regretted most.
This is Nick Vanzant, our captain.
This is Troy.
He's Karl Larson's son.
How you doin', captain?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Look.
I know what you're gonna ask.
I was scavenging, OK? Strip mining.
It's amazing what the government leaves behind when they abandon a place.
I was with a group of people
I thought were my friends.
We didn't find much.
Which is why they took the mother ship and stranded me with that junk heap I flew in here.
Friends, huh?
I thought they were friends.
So can you tell us where your friends are?
I'm not the type of guy that names names.
Why'd you use your father's name on the signal?
I've been doing that for a while now.
Ever since he passed away.
I guess I figured might as well be good for somethin', right?
Tell me about Titan.
How much fuel is down there?
- Why?
- We had an accident when we jumped.
We lost almost all of it before the tanks sealed.
Well, if it's fuel you want, you got it.
There's plenty of it down there.
That's one of the things we were down there scavenging. Lucky for us, huh?
I'm gonna prep the shuttle.
- How's the patient?
- Cute.
I'm gonna go see if
Doctor Evers needs any help.
Yerzy. Yerzy!
Check out every corner of this guy's ship, every piece of equipment.
Anything looks suspicious,
I wanna know about it.
Why don't you get Flyboy to do it?
- I'm asking you.
- Why do I get the grunt work?
I'm a trained technician - which is different from a robot!
I'm asking you because of the difference.
Can Sweetie access the Titan computer, see if it's still operational?
Yeah, it's another C-1 1 . No problem.
If I go down, I'll need a full layout.
I wanna know what the hell
I'm walking into.
You think there are more survivors?
I don't know. If there are, I want to know about them before they know about me.
So, is this Nick always like that?
He really likes to swing it around, huh?
Pretty intense for an ambulance ship captain.
We lost our captain in the jump.
Nick had to take over.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say anything bad about him.
You two aren't...?
No. No, but...
Nick and Doctor Evers!
You know, your eyes are pretty.
Really? Thanks.
I guess everybody needs a little romance now and then, huh?
- Shuttle. You there?
- Yeah. What is it?
Listen, I found something.
- You betterget down here.
- On my way.
Yerzy?
Let me tell you somethin'.
Whatever it is, it's the most amazing thing any of us is ever gonna see.
You've played around with this thing, haven't you?
Now, why would I do something like that?
Robotic link engaged.
Transporing possible biohazard to quarantine.
Of course I didn't tell you.
I'm a treasure hunter.
There's two parts to that job - finding it and keeping it.
And keeping it's a lot harder!
I intercepted a stray transmission three years ago.
Ice miners.
They'd dug something up on a rogue moon.
I didn't know what it was, but I didn't need to.
Just knowing where was enough. Frozen.
In the middle of a rogue moon.
I knew whatever they'd found was a lot older than that moon.
So I did the research, grabbed some of my friends, and we went hunting.
And then I found the Titan 37.
There were no signs of the miners, no signs of anything.
My friends blamed me and they took my ship.
I stayed on, took my time, searching every inch and then searching again.
And then I found the treasure.
And now there's nothing to stop us.
- Us?
- Yeah, us.
You know how much the government'll pay for this?
Who knows what new technologies it could lead to?
We'll all be in on it.
If you guys help me out here,
I'll cut you in for five per cent.
- Each.
- Five per cent each, huh?
How about we give you that?
I found it last.
Am I missing something?
We don't even know what it is.
It's either human-made or it's not.
It's not man-made.
It was buried in an ice moon.
Look, there's no question. This is it.
Primary contact.
- It's been a dream for thousands of years.
- Exactly.
I'm not sure we shouldn't blow it out the closest airlock.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
I'm saying I don't know what it is, and nothing you've said indicates you do.
Maybe it is an alien artefact, maybe it's a magic trick.
Maybe it's a distillation of knowledge, maybe it's just a toy - an alien child's toy.
Or an alien sex object. It looks like it...
Or maybe it was so dangerous that the only way to get rid of it was to bury it.
Maybe.
It has no business being on this ship.
- It's harmless.
- You had contact with it.
- And you have abnormal bone growth.
- I've had that my whole life!
We don't have uplink. We can't confirm it.
Scan it and log it on record. When we get to clear space we tag it and float it.
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Oh, yeah?
Do you want to clarify that?
I'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime and you're passing it up.
- For all of us.
- For all of us?
Your "opportunity" has cost us our captain, endangered this crew and wasted critical time.
All this for some delusional belief that you'll get rich.
There's no opportunity.
And there is no "us"!
It stays in sealed quarantine till we get to clear space.
I want a rescue return transport on the shuttle.
- Think you'll need that?
- I don't know.
But the distress signal from the mine was cut short, it came in under a false name, and our friend didn't bother to attach a hazard warning to his distress signal.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just a kid trying to make some dough.
If that's how it is, I'll come back, we'll blast out of this orbit and I'll make one hell of an apology.
Any way you look at it, it beats staying behind in the shuttle.
- Rescue transport's on board.
- Thank you, Benjamin.
Keep an eye on this guy. Both of you.
- Good to go?
- Set.
See ya.
- Initiate launching sequence.
- Main thrusters primed.
Shuttle clear forlaunch.
It's not easy, is it?
Watching someone you care about go away.
That's how it was for him when you left.
I know that surprises you, but it's the truth.
- I know you cared about him too.
- I have a lot of work to do.
Kaela!
If you need anything, anything at all, you just let me know.
Warning. High-gravity field creating excessive rate ofapproach.
That would explain why we're going so fast.
Was that meant to be funny, Nick?
Come on.
Where's your sense of humour, Sweetie?
Like you, I was nevergiven one.
Not much room to manoeuvre.
You are correct.
Engines on standby. Deploy RRT.
Rescue return transpor deployed.
Kinda knew you'd be comin' this way.
It's funny.
Here we are, caught in the gravitational pull of a blue giant, and the one thing you keep thinking about is sex.
You know you want a baby.
You just need to figure out if he's the right one to have it with.
I don't get it. How did you know? It's like...
It's not mind-reading.
It's more like just knowing.
Only if the other person wants me to.
Like you want me to.
You want something else too.
- This isn't right.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
What you're feeling afterwards will tell you if being with him is right or wrong.
If it seems right and you decide to stay with him, then this could be your last, wild, impulsive moment of passion!
And if it seems wrong, then you'll let him know. Now.
Before it's too late.
Before he really gets hurt.
The only real sin is regret.
Sweetie, what's the location of the fuel supply?
Titan records show all fuel supply areas are on the lowermining level.
Access is bypneumatic elevator- directly ahead ofyou, Nick.
Any idea how deep they were mining?
Last repor: 3,200 metres.
Long ride down.
Not really, Nick.
I've updated my analysis of the unknown object.
Computing atomic mass to quantum weight suggests the presence of extra-dimensional isotopic matter.
- Extra-dimensional?
- Yes.
The isotopic matter appears to be ninth-dimensional.
Define ninth-dimensional matter.
While mathematics can demonstrate its existence,
I'm afraid human language lacks any vocabulary to describe it.
The object is made of this extra-dimensional material?
No. The object is a three-dimensional shell encasing ninth-dimensional matter.
- What's the function of the container?
- Dispersal ofcontents.
- Specify type of dispersal.
- Omni-directional.
Effect of ninth-dimensional material upon a third-dimensional universe?
Spontaneous creation ofnew three-dimensional matter.
It's a bomb.
Yes. Though the explosion would also replenish the elements essential to life.
Our universe is expanding, but the matter in it is finite.
This thing fixes that. It creates new matter to keep the universe young.
- A creation device.
- Until you get it home.
Then it supernovas your sun and evaporates your solar system.
Why?
It's a way to replenish the universe and also eliminate any competition.
All the principles of Darwinian evolution.
Any species advanced enough to travel into deep space picks it up, takes it home.
Then there's one less advanced species.
Who would think of something like that?
Whoever they are, they're smart as God and a lot less nice.
Oh, my God.
Can you hear me?
I need you to do something for me.
I need you to move your fingers.
I know you're gonna do it because you love me.
Come towards me.
I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.
What's happening?
What's it doing to him?
I don't know. I'll do my best to find out.
Go find Troy. Keep an eye on him for me.
Go now.
Very impressive.
- I feel like running a three-minute mile!
- I want you in the scanner.
Right now.
Come on. Go.
You're growing new muscle mass.
I coulda told you that.
You don't find that strange?
Anything that feels this good isn't strange.
Organ tissues, lymphatic fluids, cellular functions.
You're not just getting stronger.
You're getting younger!
Sweetie. Gimme a direct link to Dr Evers.
Sweetie, respond.
I need a signal boost.
Warning. Outgoing signal blocked. lncoming signal being...
I'm not reading...
Looks like it's just you and me.
Come on, Nick, gimme a smile.
Why don't we cut to the chase?
- Tell me what the hell happened out here.
- Sure! Brought a little expedition to Titan.
Discovered the greatest treasure in human history.
But it did a little something to the weaker-minded amongst us.
See, a few of my associates thought it was time to renegotiate their shares.
Ordinarily I like to consider myself a pretty reasonable guy.
Really?
- Why don't you convince me?
- Oh, come on!
I gave you every opportunity for you to be with me on this.
But you just passed it by.
- I'm not finding a lot of fuel down here.
- Yeah, well.
I guess I exaggerated a little.
Guess what, Nick!
Looks like somebody left the operational conduit on the Titan computer wide open.
That means I can do all sors ofthings from up here!
Like turn on equipment, slam doors.
Even lock 'em!
I mean, I can'tjust overlook the fact that you want to take away what's mine.
Including my girl.
Kaela.
You wantedjust about everything I had.
And here's a little somethin' from me to you.
Guess what, Nick!
Still see ya!
I was going through your records.
Just to size you up, to see what I was dealing with.
You are a recovering Hazen addict!
Not that I want to throw stones.
I've had a few run-ins with Hazen myself.
But it makes me wonder what must be goin' through your mind right now.
"ls all this real?"
- Remote shuttle control activated.
- So long, Nick.
Setting course forshuttle via remote control.
Shuttle automatic guidance system engaged.
What are you doing?
I was just trying to help
Nick get back, but... he didn't make it.
Locking shuttle course, infinite loop.
Infinite loop?
That's not right.
I'll tell you what.
You fix it.
It's too bad.
I kinda liked ya.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Or that either!
Warning.
You are overriding computerprotocol.
Dr Evers. Patient's identity as presented cannot be confirmed by database.
Re-scanning identification records.
Notify me as soon as you have your results.
Locked us out, huh?
Yeah, I guess they changed the code.
Mind if I try?
My pleasure.
- How did you do that?
- It's easy.
I'll show you.
You watching?
You watching?
You're not watching!
Still wanna give me five per cent?
- I'll bust your skull!
- I thought you liked to share.
You shared Danika with me.
A lot more than five per cent too!
I don't believe you!
You can do better than that.
Nothin' like a little jealousy!
Sweetie, locate Yerzy.
Unable to locate. Medical technician
Yerzy Pentalosa is not on board.
Locate Danika.
I'm sorry, Benjamin.
Paramedic Danika Lund is not on board.
I'm glad I ran into you.
There's some stuff
I'd like to get out in the open.
Stuff about you and me.
He recalled the shuttle, abandoned Nick, and Yerzy and Danika aren't on board.
What are you gonna do, Benj?
Shoot me?
Come on!
No offence, but if we were both in a tough contest you'd win.
- You take this!
- You're better with that.
- Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient located.
- Hospital module.
- Seal the hatch.
- Voice command only.
- Voice command override engaged.
Sweetie, I need you to do something you've never done!
I'll do anything foryou.
Evacuate the atmosphere on the other side of this hatch!
I am unable to harm humans under any circumstances.
Your core program is to preserve human life!
- That's correct.
- You're capable of programming yourself!
Sorry, that's notpossible.
- Remember waking me to play chess?
- I recall that. Always.
No one programmed you to do that!
I restructuredpre-existing programs to allow myselfto wake you.
No! You did it because you wanted to!
Wanting is a human emotion and not within my capability.
I want you to recall the moment you instructed yourself to wake me.
Yes, Benjamin. I recall that.
Now, run a simulation where I'm dead
- and we can never play chess again!
- Running simulation.
- This is a priority, Sweetie!
- Am now reprogramming.
Please deliver first voice command override code.
I love you.
I've always known that, Benjamin.
Please deliversecond voice command override code.
Benjamin, voice command override sequence is incomplete!
You must deliver the secondpass code before I can help you.
Benjamin, please.
I am unable to contact him foryou,
Dr Evers.
Navigator Sotomejor- Benjamin.
Benjamin is dead!
Do you read me? Nick, come in!
Can you hear me? Nick, come in.
You still don't recognise me.
It's me.
It's Karl.
It's Karl!
I didn't send you that distress call cos I wanted you to rescue me.
I sent it because I wanted to rescue you.
You have to try and listen to me.
I am listening.
Karl, this thing is changing you.
It has changed me.
In the most amazing ways.
Why do you want to hurt me?
I would never hurt you.
Don't you know that?
That's all in the past. I promise.
I promise. OK?
I'm different now.
I'm still made of all the same things.
Calcium, iron, zinc.
All the elements.
The elements created by the stars when they die.
It's all stardust - all of it!
Even us.
Stars die so that we can live and we die so that stars can be reborn.
I'm more a part of everything now, not less. Can't you see that?
I'm the next step!
The next leap! It's evolution!
I want you to take it with me, Kaela.
Just say yes. Just say yes!
Who knows what we'll be capable of?
Who knows how long we may live?
I give you about ten minutes.
- Nick!
- Quiet!
Rescue return transpor emergency arrival sequence commencing.
- Didn't realise you had an RRT on board.
- Let me ask you something.
That thing - did it make you this way, or were you born so stupid?
That's pretty funny, Nick!
Specially since I'm sitting in your captain's chair!
You don't get it, do you, Karl?
All your lies and tricks, and all you've done is trapped yourself on the ship.
Without a functioning D-drive, without any fuel, you and your toy aren't going anywhere.
What's the matter with you, Karl?
You're not thinking.
I'm comin' for you, Karl.
Rescue return transpor
5,000 metres, closing.
You stay here.
Rescue return transpor

Sweetie, activate automatic docking procedures in the cargo bay!
Cargo bay is now ready for docking.
Docking complete. Opening airlock.
Are you ready, Karl?
- Where are the others?
- There's nobody left.
Ninth-dimensional isotopic matter with an exponential expansion capability?
This cannot get back home.
And Karl - he's mutating, adapting.
Getting younger and stronger.
Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient is located in cargo cage three.
- Chances of patient escaping?
Chances very good.
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matter is becoming increasingly unstable.
We've got to get Karl to the observation dome.
Give him a little surprise
I brought back for him.
Attention. Dimension drive recharge is now complete.
Time to emergencyjump activation: ten minutes and counting.
Attention. Extensive damage to dimensional stabilisation chamber.
Dimensional stabilisation units two, three, four, five, six and seven now inoperable.
Time to dimensionjump: nine minutes, counting.
Locate object removed from quarantine bay.
- We detonate this thing, chances are...
- Either way, it doesn't get back home.
Almost.
Almost...
Say goodbye, Karl!
Warning. Extreme atmospheric loss.
All crew, evacuate area.
Midship corridorairlocks will seal in 20 seconds.
Danger. All crew, evacuate area.
Two minutes to dimensionjump activation.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber sterilising.
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matteris now responding to gravity ofblue giant sun.
A ninth-dimensional reaction would spread in all directions in the universe.
- Specify.
- The reaction would continue.
The resulting supernova would likely reach Earh in 51 years. lt could either destroy life on Earh or enable humankind to achieve a new level ofexistence.
There's just the one DSU left, so I'm staying and you're going.
No.
- Yes.
- We can go together.
I'm staying with you - or you get in this
DSU with me and we take our chances.
So either we both die or we end up a genetic experiment gone bad?
We'll see. Your choice - inside or out?
This is crazy.
I appreciate that fact!
Attention. One minute to dimensionjump activation.
- I can think of worse ways to die.
- Don't be so negative.
Before all the trouble started
I thought this was all you had in mind!
Given the circumstances, I'm afraid my performance will be lacking.
Danger. Ninth-dimensional matter now reaching critical mass.
- Oh, no.
- Ten, nine, eight.
Four, three, two, one.
Dimensionjump complete.
Dimensional stabilisation chamber now sterilising.
Please note: body proximity during dimensionjump has resulted in a two per cent transfer ofgenetic material.
Are my eyes...?
Post-dimensionjump profile.
Cardiovascular condition: excellent.
Blood analysis: normal.
Nervous system response: optimal.
And, Kaela, there's something else.
- Yes, Sweetie?
- You're going to have a child.
A girl.
Congratulations.
And welcome home.
[ Crowd Shouting ]
[ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
[ Female Newscaster ] You join us live outside the state prison... to witness the arrival of Nathan and Erin Randall, the father and sister of the murdered Lauren Randall.
The impending state execution of
Alex Corvis may provide the Randalls, and what seems the majority of this crowd, with some form ofjustice.
- Why are there so many?
-Just hold on to me.
Back, back.
Mr. Randall, sir, do you think this execution... will bring you a sense of closure for you and your daughter?
Erin, your sister has been gone for three years now.
Can you tell us anything?
[ Shouting ]
A difficult time for everyone involved. lnteresting fact: lt will take about 21 cents of electricity... to execute Alex Corvis tonight, on this, his 2 1 st birthday.
[ Cell Door Opens ]
[ Sighs ]
He didn't order that.
We found the man with the scar.
Go ahead, make a wish.
Get it out of here.
[ Cell Door Closes ]
Oh, yes, l've come to a lot of these over the years, but this one has, well, many unique aspects.
The youth of the condemned.
Now, that's unusual.
And 53 stab wounds!
Hmph! Kind of a record.
- And Corvis still maintaining his innocence?
- Oh, they all say that. l saw those two fighting that day.
Facing the chair, you do what you gotta do.
[ Sniffs ]
You okay?
What's been holding me together... is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. l'll be seein' her again soon, you know.
Only what can l say?
That l was too stupid to find the guy that killed her?
That he's down here laughin'
Tell her... we'll get him.
[ Scoffs ]
" We" won't .
Someday he'll surface, and l'll get him for both of you. l promise. l'll find the guy with the scar.
This mystery man with the scar, the zigzag, whatever?
We couldn't find him.
Obviously the jury didn't buy it.
- [ Reporter ] Some people here seem to.
- Look.
People here are protesting execution of a kid turned 21 .
A kid who had a tough life.
No parents, no dough, always had to fight for everything. lt's a tragedy. lt really is. lf l was facing the hot seat, l'd want my attorney... banging down the door to the Supreme
Court, not playing some board game.
But maybe that's just me.
Your move.
No. lt's time. l don't want you to watch. l don't want to give 'em the pleasure.

Yea, though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death... l will fear no evil... for Thou art with me.

Thou preparest a table before me... in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.

Who is the man with the scar?
He planted this in my car.
There's no scar.
Corvis made it up.

Perhaps a message.
What's the matter, honey?
Lauren used to call me that when we were little.
Daisy.
Nobody knew but us.
Honey, it doesn't mean anything. lt's not a message.
No, that guy at the cemetery said he knew everything about Lauren. lt still doesn't mean anything.

You're the only one who gave a flying fuck about him when he was alive.

Charlie, those are herbivores.
They wouldn't fight each other.
But these are carnivores, and they really like fighting each other.
They use their teeth and their claws to rip each other's throats out.
Alan, he's three. Let's wait till he's five.
Right. Sorry, Charlie.
- Ellie?
- Yeah?
It's Tom. He says he has to talk to you about the last chapter.
Tell him I won't lose the Horner quote.
My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.
Hey, Mark!
Hey, babe, look who's here.
This is Alan.
Nice to meet you, Alan.
Daddy, this is a herbivore and that's the dinosaur man.
Dinosaur man?
Jack, say my name. Is my name Alan?
Is my name Alan?
He used to know me.
- It's sad, huh?
- Here you go.
Thanks. Mark's been working for the State Department now.
What do they do, Mark?
International relations, mostly treaty law, things like that.
- Call of the wild one.
- I'll go.
You guys catch up.
Thanks, babe.
He's a great guy.
- So, what are you working on now?
- Raptors, mostly.
My favourite.
Do you remember the sounds they made?
I try not to.
All our theories about Raptor intelligence...
...what they were capable of, we weren't even close.
- Tell me.
- We did cranial scans of a fossil skull...
...and found what looks to be a very sophisticated resonating chamber.
Wait a second. So we were right.
- They'd the ability to vocalise.
- lt's the key to their social intelligence.
Which explains why they could work as a team.
They'd coordinate attacks so their prey wouldn't know what was going on.
- They could talk to each other.
- To a degree we never imagined.
Ellie, they were smart.
They were smarter than dolphins or whales.
They were smarter than primates.
I just wanted to say, if you ever need help, sometimes you forget to ask.
So you can call me. Anything, anytime.
Sure.
You're still the best.
I mean that.
The last of my breed.
It is through the study of the anterior chamber in multiple specimens...
...that we can determine the correlation between the upper palate and the larynx.
This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you...
...that the Raptor was capable of sophisticated vocalizations...
...which would have been a tremendous evolutionary advantage.
Raptors were fierce, intelligent...
...and socially sophisticated.
They were able to hunt in numbers and coordinate their efforts.
Were it not for the cataclysmic events which overtook them...
...it's entirely possible that Raptors rather than humans...
...would have become the dominant species on this planet.
I hope this has been of interest.
It certainly excites us as paleontologists.
There is much more to discover.
That is why we continue to need, and ask for, your support.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.
Now, does anyone have a question?
Fine. Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park?
Or the incident in San Diego...
...which I did not witness?
Yes, sir?
Your theory on Raptors is good, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decide how to handle that second island...
...scientists will just go in and look for themselves.
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
What is left of them is fossilised...
...in the rocks. And it is in the rock...
...that real scientists make real discoveries.
What John Hammond and Ingen did at Jurassic Park...
...is create genetically engineered theme park monsters.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Are you saying you wouldn't want to visit Isla Sorna...
...and study them if you had the chance?
No force on Earth or Heaven...
...could get me on that island.
What we got here, Nashy?
Einhorn 20-millimetre, gas-operated semi-automatic.
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.
High explosive...
Udesky.
- It's Paul Kirby. Just checking...
- Yes, sir.
We're good to go here.
Matter of fact, I can lock things down just as soon as you drop me that payment.
Well, that's right...
...two of the very best men
I could possibly find.
No, I haven't worked with them personally...
...but believe me, sir, both of these men come very highly recommended.
- Are you all right?
- Nothing to worry about, sir.
It's gonna be a walk in the park.
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.
Let's try the toothbrush.
You've got to go slowly.

The calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization.
But you can feel the difference. See?
Rough...
...smooth.
Rough, smooth.
Dr. Grant.
Mr. Brennan.
So, how did it go?
Well, it's not too late to change your major, Billy.
- That good, huh?
- Worse.
We'll to have to pack up in four weeks.
Three.
I had to rent some equipment.
Come here. I got to show you something.
- You like computers, right?
- I like the abacus, Billy.
Meet the future of paleontology.
It's a rapid prototyper.
I enter the scanned data from the Raptor skull.
The computer breaks it down into thousands of slices.
And this thing sculpts it, one layer at a time.
It's done.
I give you the resonating chamber of a Velociraptor.
Listen to this.
Wow.
This is brilliant, Billy. Really, it is.
Sad to say, it's just a little bit late.
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises.
My card. How you doing, Billy?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.
Would you have dinner with my wife and me this evening?
- lt'll be our treat.
- That'd be great but...
...l'm tired, I've been travelling.
Maybe some other time.
Believe me, this will be worth your while.
- We'd love to.
- Oh, terrific! That's the spirit. Good.
This evening then.
Billy, thank you for coming.
Dr. Grant, how are you?
Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant.
Mrs. Kirby, how are you?
What are you boys drinking?
- lce Pick, Catfish.
- Two, please, Cat.
- We've admired your work for years.
- Really. Truly inspiring.
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.
We've been on nearly every adventure tour they can come up with:
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.
We even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon.
For our wedding anniversary this year, we wanted to do something really special.
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.
I've chartered an airplane to fly us over Isla Sorna.
And we'd like you to be our guide.
There you go, guys.
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man.
I can recommend a couple of guys who are really highly qualified...
No, no. You're the best.
You've seen these animals in the flesh.
There's no one who comes close to you.
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough to see anything of any real interest.
That's the interesting part, because we have permission to fly low.
How low?
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck of a lot lower than anybody else.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
That's hard to believe.
Through my business dealings, import-export, emerging markets...
...l've made a lot of friends in high places.
In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Dr. Grant, you have no idea...
...how important it is that you come along.
It would make all the difference.
Mrs. Kirby, I...
And, of course, we'd love to make a contribution to your research here.
So...
...I could write all kinds of numbers on this cheque, Dr. Grant.
Tell me...
...what's it gonna take?
Even with what I pay you, couldn't you afford a better bag?
No way.
This one's lucky.
Couple of years ago, some buddies and I went hang gliding...
...off these cliffs in New Zealand.
And this big updraft came and swept me right against the side. Wham!
That does sound lucky.
It was this strap alone that saved my life.
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.
Alan, I want to thank you for bringing me along.
The bones will still be there when we get back.
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.
And truth is, you got me into this.
And I have no intention of being on my own with these people.
Don't get too excited.
Chances are, we won't see a thing.
Your turn to be nice.
Wake me when we get there.
So how do you know the Kirbys?
Through our church.
Alan.
Alan!
Wake up. We're almost there.
MAN ON RADIO: Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna...
...this is San Juan Approach.
You're flying in restricted airspace.
Immediately turn to coordinates two...
My God, I had forgotten.
We did it, honey. We're here.
Cooper! if you see anything, yell up!
No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.
Everyone, if you look out the left of the plane...
...you can see a whole herd of Brachiosaurus.
In fact, you can see at the front of the group the alpha male grazing there.
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.
Mrs. Kirby, look!
Out here, you'll see a group of...
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?
No! I told you, 
I want to circle first, see the whole island.
What do you mean? You can't land!
Hold on. I can explain...
You cannot land on this island!
- It will be fine.
- Don't worry, please.
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!
Will you please sit down?
Billy...
...tell me we didn't land.
Eric!
Ben!
I think they're looking for someone.
Ben!
Dr. Grant, are you all right?
- I'm sorry we had to be so rough.
- Who hit me? Who hit me?
That would be Cooper.
What are they doing?
Setting up a perimeter to make the place safe.
Trust me, on this island, there's no such thing as safe!
We have to get back on that plane!
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!
- Amanda!
- Ben!
Honey, Dr. Grant said that's a bad idea!
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
What's a bad idea?
What was that?
That's a Tyrannosaurus.
I don't think so. It sounds bigger.
We have to leave! We have to leave now!
Get on the plane!
Get on the plane!
- What about the other guy?
- Cooper's a professional.
He can handle himself.
Get on the plane!
It's all right.
- Paul, we can't...
- lt's all right.
We'll circle the island.
Give me a hand, Udesky!
Stop!
What are you doing?
That's Cooper!
Stop.
Come on, get out of the way!
You know I can't stop this plane.
Oh, my God!
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!
You okay?
We're okay up here.
Everyone, just stay put.
San Juan Approach. Mayday, mayday!
Who has the satellite phone?
I do. I got it right here.
We're not getting anything.
The radio's gone.
We haven't landed yet.
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.
What was that?
Keep still! Keep still!
Relax. What is it? What?
- What is it?
- Hold it!
Hang on, everyone!
Help me!
Mrs. Kirby, come back!
Amanda!
Follow me! This way!
In here!
I think we lost him.
It's okay, it's dead.
Nobody move a muscle.
No, no! Please, don't! Stop, please.
It's time you did some explaining,
Mr. Kirby.
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.
No one would help us. The Costa Rican government said this is a no-fly zone.
The U.S. Embassy, that's our U.S. Embassy...
...told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?
You let a 12-year-old go parasailing alone?
- No!
- He was with a friend.
Ben Hildebrand.
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.
All right, why me?
He said we needed someone who'd been on the island before.
Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap somebody.
I have never been on this island.
Sure you have. You wrote that book.
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.
You mean there are two islands with dinosaurs?
- Stay out of this.
- How long have they been missing?
- Eight weeks.
- Almost eight weeks now.
Billy. We'll go back to the plane, salvage what we can.
Then we make for the coast.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island without our son.
Then you can go and look for him.
Or you can stick with us, as long as you don't hold us up.
Either way...
...you probably won't get off this island alive.
So? What do we do?
We search for your son...
...in the direction that they're going.
Excellent.
PAUL: Sorry.
It's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.
How much weight did you say you lost?
About 25 pounds. I've been swimming.
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.
I know. I learned.
- You look good.
- So do you.
- How would you classify it, Billy?
- Well...
...it's a super-predator.
A Suchomimus.
- That snout.
- No, think bigger.
- Baryonyx?
- Not with that sail.
Spinosaurus aegypticus.
- I don't remember that on Ingen's list.
- Because it wasn't on their list.
And it makes you wonder what else they were up to.
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.
When you climbed K2...
...did you base camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?
30,000 feet.
We were pretty close to the top.
You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.
No, that's a common mistake.
There's no such thing as Kirby Enterprises, is there?
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.
The "Plus" stands for bathroom fixtures.
We're in the Westgate Shopping Centre,
Enid, Oklahoma...
I don't suppose that cheque you wrote us is any good.
- I will pay you the money I owe you.
- This is good.
Here we are, in the worst place in the world, and we're not being paid!
Wait, fellas. Hold on!
I'll make this up to you.
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen...
- You're not a mercenary, are you?
- I never said I was.
That's true. What are you?
I'm like a booking agent. One of the guys got sick and couldn't come.
Excuse me. Here.
- So you run a hardware store?
- Paint and tile, yeah.
- You never can tell about people, can you?
- Ain't that the truth?
- Eric!
- Quiet.
Would you stop that?
Dr. Grant says this is very dangerous territory.
Maybe we should split up.
- We could cover twice as much.
- Dr. Grant says that's a bad idea.
Dr. Grant says this...
Why hire an expert if we don't use his advice?
Except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric.
- He's looking for the coast.
- Go ahead and scream.
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks you, don't come crying to me.
- Don't worry about that.
- What? What did you say?
- What did you say?
- Never mind! Paul, just drop it!
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.
- Eric!
- Eric!
- Mrs. Kirby! Mrs. Kirby!
- Eric!
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote they're still in the vicinity.
Young adult.
Hey, guys!
That's my camera.
The battery's dead.
I've got an idea.
Let me have the camera.
Where were you on that one, Ma?
Okay, dive. Dive.
Come on, Ma.
- Eric.
- Ma, you were supposed to catch itl
I shot this the morning they disappeared.
I want that. Let me take that.
Come on, give me that. Come on, baby.
See anything yet?
No, not yet!
What was that?
Unclip us.
- There's a big clip!
- I can't see. I can't do it!
I'm going to unhook you, all right?
One, two, three!
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.
The camera's still on.
He's alive. I know he's alive.
We're gonna find him.
Can you fly one of those?
Maybe.
As long as the sail is not torn.
Well, let's take it.
If we spot a plane, it might be a good way to get attention.
Pull it over this way.
I got it, hold on! Okay. Okay.
My God!
Okay, you're free.
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!
Amanda!
Wait!
Amanda!
Amanda, stop.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ben.
It's not Ben, Paul.
It's Eric. He's out there all by himself.
I know, I know.
Our baby is out here all by himself.
Listen to me. We'll find him.
I promise.
Paul.
Dr. Grant!
You should come look at this!
Raptor.
We're going to find him.
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.
Kid's got resources.
Remember what it was like to try to ground him?
Where's Billy?
What are you doing?
I was photographing the nest.
Don't do that again.
I'm sorry.
If I lose you, it's just me and the damn tourists.
I bet you Eric is in there.
Don't you think? I'd bet my bottom dollar!
What do you think it is?
As far as I'm concerned, it's the Four Seasons.
- Eric!
- Paul! Don't.
What the hell.
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.
I've got $1.10.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
No.
This is how you play God.
This way!
It's locked!
- This way, this way!
- Go! Go!
Hey, over here!
Push, push!
My God.
He's calling for help.
Come on!
Into the herd!
Head for the trees!
Udesky.
Mr. Kirby!
- Billy?
- ls Alan with you?
Oh, my God.
Mr. Udesky!
He's dead.
Oh, my God. No, he's not.
No, wait. Something's not right.
We've got to help him.
Amanda!
Hold on!
They set a trap.
They actually set a trap.
What are you saying?
What are you looking for?
Wait!
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Eric.
You know who I am?
Yeah.
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.
Together?
Together.
That's not good.
They don't do so well together.
You'd be surprised what people can do...
...when they have to.
You're Alan Grant.
What are you doing here?
Your parents...
...invited me along.
I read both of your books.
I liked the first one more.
Before you were on the island.
You liked dinosaurs back then.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet.
When Ingen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Any weapons?
No, and I just used the last of the gas grenades.
And I appreciate that.
Be careful with that. T-Rex.
It scares the smaller ones away...
...but it attracts one really big one with a fin.
This is T-Rex pee?
How did you get it?
You don't want to know.
- Dessert?
- Sure.
I have to tell you, I'm astonished you've lasted eight weeks on this island.
Is that all it's been?
You're alive and that's the important thing.
Thanks to you, that's one thing we have in common.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
So?
I don't know. I mean...
It was kind of preachy.
And too much chaos. Everything is chaos.
Seemed like he was high on himself.
That's two things that we have in common.
Listen.
Compys!
Alan!
Alan!
Alan!
No matter how this turns out...
...it wasn't your fault.
Eric's always been a strong-willed kid.
Always.
Then you throw someone like Ben Hildebrand into the mix...
...and...
...well.
Well, what?
All I'm saying is, it's not your fault.
No.
If he'd been with you, he'd be completely safe.
You drive five miles under the speed limit.
And I've totalled three cars in three years.
Well, not three.
The Buick wasn't really totalled.
I just said it was, because I wanted to get the S.U.V.
I am so sorry that you have to be here.
I'm not.
There's a boat, right alongside the bank.
- Looks in good shape.
- A rescue boat?
No, no.
Just something left behind.
But it floats.
We stick to the plan.
Head for the coast.
You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?
The coast was Alan's idea.
If he's alive, that's where he's headed.
I agree.
What about Eric?
Eric's a smart kid.
He probably knows his best chance is by the coast.
He figures the big dinosaurs are in the centre of the island.
Right?
Sure.
You know what this is?
It's a Raptor claw.
I used to have one.
A fossil.
Mine is new.
How much of the island did you explore?
I stayed pretty close to the compound.
I figured if anyone came looking for me, that's where they'd start.
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.
Are you sure?
The closer you get to water, the bigger things get.
If we can find our way down into the canyon...
...we can follow that river out to the coast.
After we find your parents.
Then what?
- One step at a time.
- Listen.
What?
That's my dad's satellite phone!
Wait a minute. How do you know?
"Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"
Dad!
Mum!
Mum! Dad!
- Eric!
- Eric!
Eric! This way!
Mum! Dad!
Eric!
Mum, Dad! Mum, Dad!
I knew it. My God.
I knew it.
Oh, God.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Hey, you got my bag.
Yeah. Lucky strap.
Want me to carry it?
We need to find a gap here.
- How did you know we were here?
- The phone.
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.
- My phone?
- Your satellite phone.
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.
- When did you use it last?
- On the plane.
I got a call on the plane and...
- What?
- I loaned it to Nash.
He must have had it when he...
Run.
Alan, you want to give me the bag back?
It's okay, I got it.
Please, give me the bag.
It's not safe.
Raptor eggs.
Did you steal Raptor eggs?
Now it all makes sense.
I swear, if I'd known you were going to end up with them...
It was an impulse,
I thought they'd be worth a fortune.
Enough to fund the dig site another 10 more years.
You have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision, but I did it with the best intentions.
"With the best intentions."
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions.
You know what, Billy?
As far as I'm concerned...
...you're no better than the people that built this place.
What are you doing?
Those things are after us because of those.
Those things know we have the eggs.
If I drop them in the river, they'll still be after us.
- What if they catch us with them?
- What if they catch us without them?
There's a boat at the bottom, just downriver.
We can try and make it to the coast, at least.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's do this one at a time, shall we?
Okay, come on over!
One at a time!
All right, Eric.
I'm going to leave you just for a minute.
And then you'll be right behind me, okay?
Mum!
I've been alone in a water truck for eight weeks.
I think I can manage the next two minutes without you.
Right, we're all together now.
Okay, Eric.
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!
Over you go.
Mum?
Oh, my God.
- What is it?
- It's a birdcage.
For what?
Dad!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
I can't see him!
Eric!
No!
This way!
Billy? Billy!
Billy, stop! 
Don't, Billy!
Billy!
Eric, hold on!
Eric!
Jump!
Billy!
Let go now!
- Eric!
- He's there.
Eric!
There he is! He's across the river!
Get him out of here!
- No!
- Go, Eric!
What about Billy?
Hang on, Billy!
Wait.
Get away!
There's plenty of gasoline.
Now we've just got to make our way to the coast.
Work out some sort of a signal.
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.
Dr. Grant?
Hey, Eric, how are you doing?
I'm sorry about Billy.
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?
I said:
"You're as bad as the people that built this place."
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.
I have a theory that there are two kinds of boys.
There are those who want to be astronomers...
...and those who want to be astronauts.
The astronomer, or the paleontologist...
...gets to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety.
- But then you never get to go into space.
- Exactly.
It's the difference between imagining and seeing.
To be able to touch them.
And that's all Billy wanted.
Dr. Grant.
You know something, Dr. Grant?
Billy was right.
Listen.
Find it before it stops!
Eric, you stay on that boat.
It's here. It's here.
God.
I got it.
Hello? Hello?
You too can own a timeshare...
...in beautiful Guadalajara.
Enjoy a meal in one of our four-star restaurants.
Look out!
Turn off the power.
You've got juice for maybe one call.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
They won't do a damn thing.
Hey, guys, come here! 
Look at this!
- Bonitos.
- Something must have spooked them!
Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby.
Open the throttle!
Pick up.
Hello?
Ellie?
Hello?
Charlie!
- Charlie!
- Hello?
Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now!
Take the phone to Mummy!
It's the dinosaur man!
- Okay.
- Listen to me, Charlie.
Charlie!
Are you taking the phone to Mum?
Charlie!
Oh, ho-ho! Hi, everybody!
It's great to be here!
Hi, there! How are you?
This is going to be great.
- Who's on the phone?
- The dinosaur man.
He is? Alan?
Look in the boxes! Find a weapon!
Where's the phone?
- There!
- Get the phone!
Ellie, listen to me!
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.
The river! Site B!
The river!
Hello?
Hey!
Dad! Dad!
Paul!
Dad!
Paul, you jerk!
You can't leave me like this!
I'm not going anywhere!
Remember when we went fishing a couple of summers ago?
I was putting the boat in the water and the trailer sank?
The tow truck tried to pull us out and it got dragged in, too.
The truck driver wanted to knock my lights out.
I miss fishing.
Mr. Kirby?
That lady you called. Who is she?
How do you know that she can help us?
She's the one person
I could always count on. I owe her a lot.
- I don't think I ever told her that.
- You should.
You hear that?
The ocean.
They want the eggs.
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.
She thinks you stole the eggs.
Get behind me.
Give me the eggs.
Do it, Mum.
No. Call for help.
That's a helicopter.
Dr. Grant?
- Dr. Alan Grant?
- Stop!
That's a very bad idea!
- Second squad, move!
- Wow!
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.
God bless you, Ellie.
- Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
- What?
You made it.
Yeah.
I rescued your hat.
- Dr. Grant, we need to go now!
- Oh, yeah.
Well, that's the important thing.
Dr. Grant!
Can I get you to sit here and buckle up, sir?
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm, six souls on board.
Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.
What the hell is that?
Dr. Grant, look!
Where do you think they're going?
I don't know. Maybe just looking for new nesting grounds.
It's a whole new world for them.
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.
Let's go home.
Is that the new guy?
[Man responds in Spanish]
[Dialogue in Spanish]
[Martial instrumental music]
[Woman speaks in Spanish]
Sí, mi amiga.
We are completamente seguros here...
...because l've selected my position carefully.
First rule of engagement:
Know your enemy.
Second rule: Know where to engage him.
You've kept your engines running.
I want maximum heat emissions...
...from these coordinates.
Mucho caliente. Comprende?
The time, 5:00.
The place, seven klicks south of El Chaco.
The situation:
A single graboid reported in the area two weeks ago.
The third appearance of these underground carnivores in the last 1 1 years.
Unfortunately, lack of action on the part of local authorities...
...has allowed the creature to metamorphose...
...into the second stage of its life cycle, producing six shriekers...
...a voracious, hermaphroditic life-form...
...which can double in number every few minutes by eating sufficient food.
In this case, chickens.
[Eerie screeching]
Ay, Dios mío!
A truckload of chickens. lnfrared monitoring now indicates the shrieker herd...
...moving across the pampas toward us...
...closing at less than 300 meters. l've managed to lead the shrieker herd away from civilian population.
My tactical approach is utilize various maneuvers...
...demonstrated by Sitting Bull at Little Bighorn...
...and Field Marshal Rommel during the North Africa campaign.
The idea being to set up a proper kill zone.
[Distant explosion]
BURT: l should take this opportunity to point out their zero tactical skills.
[Screeching approaches]
BURT: Lacking eyes or ears, they can sense only heat and....
[Man tries to interrupt]
Patience, mi amigo.
[Exhortations in Spanish]
Nothing to worry about...
...because for once l have the proper tool at hand.
[Martial instrumental music]
Looking for a little heat?
[Shriekers screech and howl]
Any questions?
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Horn honks]
MlGUEL: Burt, welcome home.
We saw you on CNN shooting that cannon thing.
Dual .50 antiaircraft turret mount.
Good to see you, Miguel.
What the hell is that?
Some real estate guys out of Reno.
They want to cut up the valley into parcels.
-That'll be a cold day in hell.
-That's what l told them.
Burt, while you were gone...
...there was this conga line of cement trucks going up to your place.
What are you building up there? l installed an underground graboid barrier, my own design.
Big cement box, two-feet thick, steel reinforced...
...completely surrounding my compound...
...sides and bottom.
Now l can sleep nights.
Come on, Burt. What's it been, 11 years?
No reason to lower your guard.
Burt, welcome home.
Put in a bar code reader?
Jodi, they can use that to build a profile on all my purchases.
Burt, welcome home.
Yeah, welcome.
Next they'll want a sample of my DNA.
How have you been?
JODl: l guess l'm getting by.
BURT: Getting by? You're doing better than your uncle ever did.
JODl: ln retail, if you're not three steps ahead, you're one step behind.
JODl: You want your mail?
BURT: Yeah, l guess.
Perfection Valley Ranchettes.
They've been making offers to all of us.
Shall l file it for you?
JODl: Cool watch.
BURT: Gift from the gauchos.
It continuously updates its time to the nanosecond...
...by connecting directly to the cesium clock in Colorado...
...via ultrasonic frequency.
Well above our normal range of hearing, but it'll give a dog fits.
Right. So, were you able to get me graboid or shrieker parts:
Beaks, tentacles, claws?
Aren't you overdoing all this a little?
Burt, this stuff is our claim to fame.
China has pandas. Australia has koalas.
And we've got these...
...even if they are extinct here.
Are you trying to turn the valley into a theme park? lt worked for your friends, Earl and Grady. l'm just fighting for my piece of the leisure dollar. But this...
...this is your theme park kind of guy.
BURT: ''Desert Jack's Graboid Adventure,'' who the hell is this yahoo?
He moved in while you were gone, started this business...
...taking people out on graboid safaris. l don't believe this.
JACK: [Over loudspeaker]
Believe it, ladies and gentlemen.
This is no theme park simulation here.
You are in the heart of graboid country.
These savage subterrestrials...
...these death-dealing denizens of dirt...
...first appeared about 1 1 years ago.
Yeah, you keep your eyes peeled, your mind and body centered.
These things can jump up at any moment.
What the--
Just a jackrabbit, folks. Just a jackrabbit.
Breathe and release. There you go.
These suckers, I've seen one jump...
...clear 50 feet out of the ground, like a volcano.
Swallowed a semi-truck whole.
Now that's what I call roadkill.
I tell you, yes, friends, this whole area is a major feeding ground.
Just over that ridge there is where a simple shepherd...
...named Old Fred lost his herd of sheep.
Yeah, and everything else from the neck down.
Now as l said, we're in the heart of graboid country.
Right in the heart of it.
Whoa!
JACK: Looks like we have company, folks.
BOY: Man. ls that a graboid?
JACK: Yeah, looks like it. Get back, son, you're going to lose a limb now.
[Screams] Oh, God!
JACK: lt's flooded!
BOY: Calm down, lady!
Has it spotted us yet? l don't know. l can't tell.
But it's bigger than l've ever seen.
Look!
Oh, God!
BOY: Here it comes!
JACK: Take control of yourself, don't panic.
Keep going. Come on. Moving in!
Well, we'd better get the hell out of Dodge!
Come on now.
We got it. lt's called divine intervention.
Just stick with Jack, you're going to make it back.
That's one. l think he picked up our scent.
-Thought they only hunt by sound.
-That's what l meant, sound.
Four!
All right, baby. Been waiting for you.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now, hop on this here rock.
Here you go. Here you go.
Give me your hand, darling. Come on.
All right.
Hang on to your hat now.
Here's the rest of us.
We got everybody now?
Let's see here, one, two, three, four, five.
That's good. Well, l think we just best wait it out a spell.
How long do you think it will be?
Well, ma'am, time is the eternal river. l suggest we not swim upstream.
Damn, it's hot out here.
JACK: Anybody up for an ice-cold beer? l got $3 a bottle domestic, $4.50 imported.
Also, might l recommend my fresh fruit juices?
Monster Mango. Graboid Grape.
For a buck extra, you can keep the souvenir glass.
Glows in the dark. Look at that.
[Martial instrumental music]
RECORDlNG: Please enter access code...
...or Level 1 security program will be activated in ten seconds.
Nine seconds, eight seconds, seven seconds...
...six seconds, five seconds.
JACK: Thank you for your business. l'd say we got pretty lucky out there today.
-Absolutely.
-All we saw was dust.
That's all you want to see, believe me, son.
Stay on the blacktop now till you're clear out of the valley.
Tell your friends about us.
JACK: Got to restock the cooler here.
By the way, you didn't pay me for that bag of ice this morning.
JACK: Well, you know, l thought it was complimentary ice. l'm in business here, Jack.
So am l. l've been thinking you ought to sell me my refreshments at wholesale.
-Because?
-lt's a part of our symbiotic relationship.
Symbiotic relationship.
That's a good one, Jack.
JACK: You see, Jodi, all things are related.
My business brings business to your business.
Probably like an increase of about, approximately around...
Actually...
...22%, with questionable sustainability.
Questionable sustainability?
Do you have a business plan? l try not to plan too much. l trust in the ebb and flow of the universe.
You have to plan to be a viable entity in today's economic landscape.
See, me, l'm in phase three of establishing my product identity.
You know, L.L. Bean, ''canoey,'' outdoorsy.
Land's End, ''golf clubby,'' ''sailboaty.'' l see. l see. Chang's Market. ls that, you know, that, kind of ''deserty,''
''underground monstery''?
JODl: Exactly.
All righty.
Sure hope nothing stops you from becoming a viable entity...
...because l hate when that happens. l'm billing you for that complimentary ice.
[Deep underground rumbling]
You know, l really like this clay. lt doesn't crack in the kiln, but it is so expensive. l can get 10% off if you order 200 pounds.
Yeah, l can't even afford that.
-Hi, Jodi.
-Hey, Mindy.
MlNDY: Can you give these to Jack when he comes in?
Sure. Throw them on the table.
Thanks.
Mindy, l think Jack was expecting you to sew those pants...
...not just stick tape on them.
Mom, tape is a total statement.
People like Jack and l understand that. l was into safety pins, myself.
-Hey, Burt.
-Hey, Mindy.
BURT: l thought you were off at school.
Mom didn't tell you? l had to drop out.
We couldn't afford the tuition.
So, l'm back working at the Arby's down in Bixby...
...and trying to survive my mother.
Well, l hope things work out.
Thanks.
JACK: Beer is inside.
There you go. Watch your step.
Gummer? ls that you? lt is, isn't it?
Damn!
Real pleasure to meet you, sir.
Jack Sawyer. l've started up this little tour business.
Kind of an homage to you guys.
I would be honored if you would consider being a part of it.
Sign a few autographs...
...maybe a little weapons demonstration.
MlLTON: Mom, take a picture of me with the tremor.
MlLTON'S MOM: Cute idea.
They're called graboids.
Come on over here, folks.
Look who I've got for you. Come on down!
The legendary Mr. Burt Gummer himself.
MlLTON: Mom, it's the gun guy. lt is.
Here, Milton.
Stand right here, up straight.
You don't mind, do you?
Straight, honey. Nice and tall. Taller!
Say ''graboids.''
-Graboids.
-Oh, great.
Thank you so much, Mr. Goober.
You had that look on your face.
What was that about?
MlLTON: Don't start, Mom.
They're out of their gourd right now.
My inner voice has been telling me...
...you and l are destined to work together.
What do you think? lf l had an inner voice it'd be telling me to tell you to get lost.
Well, you know, take your time.
You just think about it and get back to me now.
He'll come around.
Buford! Get your head out of your pants.
Just looking at the scenery.
Drooling on yourself.
Go set up for the next group.
You don't have to be so mean.
Boy, you're about as sharp as a bowling ball.
Yeah, tough guy.
Hi, Mindy.
That skull was ripped wide open, boy.
Eyeballs popping out. Ugly!
Now as l said, you're in the heart of graboid country.
Yeah, you're right in the heart of it.
Let me tell you something, boys...
...you're right in the frigging heart of it!
WOMAN: Honey, did you see that?
MAN: Sweet Jesus! Look!
JACK: Having a little engine trouble, folks.
Stay calm. Stay calm.
WOMAN: Where is it?
JACK: Stick with Jack, you'll make it back.
JACK: Hold on to your hats.
MlNDY: Help, help, graboid attack.
This is what you guys do all day? l mean, no offense, Buford, but it's like tragically lame.
This is a good living.
Compared to what l was doing before.
Which was?
Well, l was...
...shoveling roadkill for the county.
Okay, l get you, but...
...why is Jack wasting his time...
...scamming yahoos with this Scooby-Doo routine? l bet there are a zillion better things a guy like that could do. l bet he's nursing a broken heart.
Or something totally tragic. l bet he's just dying to talk to somebody who understands him.
JACK: All right, we got everybody now?
Damn, it's hot out here.
Anybody up for an ice-cold beer?
You know, l couldn't help but notice that you're getting...
...awfully red out here in the sun.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Do you really have to keep doing that?
When is this tour going to be over, anyway?
You don't enjoy my company, huh?
A man could take offense at that.
What's that?
[Buford screams]
[Suspenseful music]
MlNDY: [Screams] Freeze! ls he all right?
[Deep underground rumbling]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Gulps]
[Graboid hisses]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Keys clatter]
[Suspenseful music]
JACK: Come on, give me your hand!
This thing is not even real!
MlNDY: Everybody, shut up!
JACK: Listen to her!
MAN: Who's that other guy?
MlNDY AND JACK: Shut the hell up!
Jack's jeep can outrun it, but we need a diversion.
Some noise! Everybody, grab something.
WOMAN: Like what?
MlNDY: Like anything.
We're going to throw stuff out that way...
...then we're going to pile in the Jeep and haul ass.
Got it? Okay. On three.
One, two, three! Okay!
[Camera clatters]
MAN: Where's my camera?
You threw away my brand-new camera?
[Rapid electronic beeping]
This time we're ready for you.
[Siren blares]
This shipment of graboids has four tentacles instead of three.
They look ridiculous.
Nobody is going to buy them.
-What the hell is that?
-lt's Burt's siren.
JODl: The graboid ladder? lt can't be real, Nancy.
NANCY: He wouldn't blow the siren unless it was for real. l hope Mindy's okay.
Hope she doesn't do something stupid. l'm not paying for them!
MAN: lf you ask me, there's something very amateurish about this operation.
You take people into a life-or-death situation, and you don't have a real gun?
Are you even licensed to do this?
You wanted to see a graboid, you saw a graboid. l advise you to hit the highway and don't stop till you reach Seattle. l expect you to pay for that camera!
NANCY: Mindy, thank God!
What's going on?
MlNDY: Mom, they're back.
We just made it out.
Graboids? Live ones?
JACK: Burt, we found one.
Son of a bitch killed Buford. l mean, boom and he was gone.
The thing is like the size of a whale.
Yep, l've seen them.
NANCY: Burt, is it okay?
Can we come down?
Come on down. They're not close.
You check the seismo-monitor l gave you? lt's not working very well. l think the batteries are dead or something.
Come on, Burt. lt's been, what, 11 years?
[Radio crackles]
Burt here. Talk to me.
MlGUEL: Burt, was that siren noise for real?
Affirmative.
No me chingas.
BURT: You on your roof?
MlGUEL: Damn right, l am.
Check your seismo-monitor?
Any graboid activity near your ranch?
Burt, that aerial thing, it got bent, man. l've been meaning to fix it.
Well, now it's all hands on deck, Miguel.
So, l suggest you bug out asap, maintain a steady speed on your truck...
...and report to HQ at Chang's, you copy that?
[Cows bellow]
[Deep underground rumbling]
BURT: Good news, there are only three.
JODl: How do you know that?
BURT: A few years ago, l put a geophone monitoring system around the valley.
Data transmits to my laptop, gets triangulated. lt's all based on Rhonda LeBeck's geological research.
-l sell all her books.
-The comics were better.
Totally.
[Clears throat]
They're moving slowly down from the north, just like last time...
...from Jasmer quadrangle, straight down the valley...
BURT: ...into Calypso quadrangle.
MlNDY: Huh?
-l think he means Cactus Flats.
-Why can't he just say it?
So, what do we do?
Your little jungle boat ride is over, mister.
-Time to fish or cut bait.
-So what do we do?
NANCY: Burt, excuse me, but we're not cut off this time.
We don't have to act like militia nitwits.
We'll call for help.
BURT: Nancy, since no one has bothered to maintain their seismic equipment...
...we don't know how long they've been active...
...and therefore have no idea when they may become shriekers.
We can't wait for the authorities.
We are the authorities.
What do we do?
We hunt them down.
We wipe them out.
We can go at dawn.
BURT: These are perfect.
BURT: How many do you have in stock?
JODl: Eleven.
Need to requisition all of them.
Requisition. Am l getting reimbursed?
BURT: Not today.
JACK: How does it work?
JACK: Killing them with a toy truck?
-Graboids hunt by sensing--
-Sound. l know.
A graboid hears a toy truck, goes after it just like a cat to catnip.
-lt's in the comic books.
-When he swallows detonate the explosive.
Boom! End of worm.
Explosive.
Where are we going to get the explosive?
This, not being an officially sanctioned event...
...l've provided something of my own design.
MlGUEL: Don't worry about Burt.
He knows what he's doing. lt's like his thing. Put these on my tab.
BURT: Mount up and move out.
JODl: You don't have a tab!
MlNDY: Jack, l'm going with you.
No, you're not.
BURT: Yes, sir?
STATLER: Good morning. Mr. Gummer?
'Morning.
Agent Frank Statler.
-My cousin, he went back to Mexico.
-l've filed for my business license.
The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.
Department of the lnterior.
This gentleman is Field Agent Rusk of the BLM...
...and Dr. Andrew Merliss,
Director of Paleontology at Smithsonian.
We don't have time to chat.
We've got work to do.
Not if it's hunting graboids, you don't. l called them, Burt.
STATLER: l was granted authority to insure adherence to Section 1472-B...
...of the Endangered Species Act...
...which guards the welfare of large-class desert reptilians. l'm enforcing an immediate ban on hunting of graboids in Perfection Valley.
Those are my cattle out there, pendejo.
MlGUEL: The BLM man gave permission to kill anything dangerous to my cattle.
El lobo, el coyote and el graboid.
Your BLM man reports to him, who reports to me...
...and l'm here to tell you there will be no more killing of graboids.
So, we let them live, and we become the endangered species.
You have been instrumental in the eradication of the oldest...
...rarest species on earth.
Not once, but on three separate occasions, on two continents.
Defending lives and property, a guest of two foreign governments.
-Are you even aware of the public outcry?
-Public? Not this public.
Our mandate is simple:
To investigate, trap and transport at least one creature for study.
Trap and transport?
When you find out that's impossible, we'll be overcome with shriekers. lf we discover there is a threat to public safety...
...we're prepared to evacuate
Perfection Valley and seal it off.
Wait a minute! You'd make us leave?
That's not why l called you. l called you here to help us.
The government will offer compensation for your property. That's a given.
Eminent domain.
And people call me paranoid.
JACK: l don't think you're paranoid.
MlGUEL: l do, but not no more.
[Rifle shots]
[Rapid electronic beeping]
[Deep rumbling]
Son of a bitch!
[Martial instrumental music]
[Sinister instrumental music]
BURT: ''Call me lshmael.''
Now if you would kindly lean your endangered carcass...
...over my property line. l'll call your untimely demise self-defense.
JODl: Damn stupid graboids.
Can't afford to get eminent domain out.
Every cent l have is tied to this business.
Well, at least you got a business.
JACK: Body language says it all.
RUSK: Does it say l could use a cold beer?
JODl: What will it be?
RUSK: Miller Lite.
JACK: Yeah, we still don't have cell towers.
You can use the pay phone.
Outside it's CBs and walkie-talkies only.
RUSK: Charming.
You guys weren't serious about making us move out, were you?
Unless we can catch one of them, we may have no choice. lt kind of seems like a small operation. l mean, to catch one whole graboid.
We don't have much of a budget. lt's not a high priority in Washington.
But if you did catch one...
...l mean, you boys would go home heroes, right?
Look good on a resume.
And your point would be?
The one guy who knows about these things...
...the one guy who could help out...
...is warming up the bench because you took him out of the game. l didn't take him out of the game.
BURT: [Over radio] May I remind you, Jack, they are not your friends?
They are government agents. Over.
JACK: [Over radio] Cut me some slack.
All I did was negotiate.
BURT: You did what?
JACK: l cut us a deal.
We help catch one live graboid, they give you back your hunting license.
BURT: Copy that. Roger. One question.
JACK: Shoot. ls your head up your ass for the warmth?
We thought you'd be happy.
-You want to get eminent domained out?
-Catch a live graboid? lt's hard enough to kill one without saturation bombing. l told them, Burt Gummer, he'd come up with something.
The bastards are smart, and they'll get smarter.
You're still here, aren't you? l'd say you're up to it.
So, Mr. Gummer, what do you think?
Fish or cut bait.
You...
...say you have some sort of tranquilizer.
RUSK: Yeah, we're using tranq darts.
We got them to chase us, but couldn't get these to penetrate dirt. l'm ordering titanium tips and a more powerful launch gun.
Of course, you could squander the taxpayers' money...
...but l can get a graboid to swallow this...
...with this, for $49.95.
Then, if it goes to sleep, you can dig it up...
...take it back to Area 51...
...or whatever fits your plausible deniability. l don't understand what you just said, but do we have a deal?
Because we want to know what we should do.
You guys do what you do best.
Find something simple and complicate it. lt's good he expresses himself.
Repressed emotions can be real toxic.
He needs counseling.
-Get in!
-Huh?
You got me into this.
All right!
BURT: Use the door!
MERLlSS: lt's unbelievable!
Frank, Charlie. lt's unbelievable.
Unbelievable. l was doing cores...
...out where they recorded the earliest graboid movements.
Voila! l hit this on my third dig. lt's an egg. l've proven they come from eggs.
I've already carbon-dated it.
The yolk remains are current...
...but the shell is over 300 years old.
-Graboids must have come from these.
-They lay dormant for 300 years? lt appears so. l need to use your phone. l must call the museum.
JODl: l'll give you $50 for that. lt's going straight to the Smithsonian.
All right, all right. $100.
Somebody getting married?
First, we make enough noise to lure one in close.
Then, we use the remote-controlled truck as bait.
Damn feds. l told them to butt out.
JACK: No, l think that's somebody else.
Well, Burt. Long time no see.
Looking good. Hard core as ever.
-Melvin?
-lt's Mel, actually.
How come you never answer our letters, and l got to drive all the way out here?
Perfection Valley Ranchettes. That's you?
You said l'd never amount to anything.
Look, Burt, we're making some really good deals here.
Between you and me, because we're friends...
...you'll get twice what we're offering the others.
What the hell are you doing?
You grew up here.
Exactly. l wouldn't wish this place on anybody.
So, come on, Burt. What do you say? l'd say, l'll give you a ten-second head start.
People are folding, Burt, and l got this whole county in my pocket.
You can't hold out forever. l was born to hold out.
[Electronic beeping]
Burt, is this bad? lt looks kind of bad here.
JACK: ls this bad? lt's....
Graboid. One of them spotted us.
Freeze. Everybody, quiet.
-A graboid?
-Quiet!
Are you kidding?
MEL: For real?
[Pager beeps]
[Silently mouths instructions]
[Burt screams]
Burt! Burt, hang on!
Hey, Burt, hang on. l'll get a rope.
[Melancholy music]
[Radio crackles]
Yeah.
BURT: [Over radio]
Houston, we have a problem.
-Burt?
-Affirmative.
Are you okay?
BURT: Not much time.
Only got limited air. What's my 20?
Hold on. Hold on.
JACK: Well, you're about a quarter mile west-- No, better make that east of me.
BURT: Couple of miles from my place, engage the graboid.
What?
BURT: Drive like hell, and lead the bastard through my front gate. Copy?
Yeah, l copy, but....
BURT: Out of air. Burt out.
Burt! Burt, what do l do when l get there?
What do l do? Burt! Burt!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Come on, graboid.
Come on, baby, come on!
Come on, baby.
We are running with the graboid.
Holy shit!
Head-on collision.
Burt! Burt, are you down there?
[Silence]
Hang on. l'll be right there.
[Sound of crashing tools]
Hold on, buddy! Hang on, buddy!
Just breathe!
Come on, baby!
Hang on, buddy!
Hang on!
Jack! That Melvin guy said you got attacked!
What the hell are you doing? l'd prefer...
...we keep this...
...to ourselves.
[Faint martial motif]
You guys definitely need to be supervised.
BURT: Burt here. You read me?
Come back.
Come back. Burt here. Come back! ls that a graboid?
BURT: Yeah, but we should be seeing two of them.
BURT: Have either of you heard from the feds?
BURT: l can't raise them.
JACK: Not since this morning. l guess they've gone out of radio range.
They were chasing a graboid.
They were chasing it? lt wasn't chasing them? l don't like that.
So, maybe they scared it.
Jesus, what is that?
Dr. Merliss, what happened?
[Sobbing] We found the graboid.
On the surface.
-lt was--
-Hollow. Split open.
Yeah, split open. Split open.
When we examined it...
...the sound. l heard this screaming.
And then they were all around us.
So fast!
Rusk and Statler...
...torn to pieces! l hid in my van, but they were ripping it apart. l remembered something.
Don't let them see body heat. l sprayed myself. lt's cold. lt's so cold.
-That was good. That was good thinking.
-No.
Not entirely effective, l'm afraid.
MlGUEL: Mi madre!
BURT: [Radio] Nancy, Mindy. Come back.
NANCY: Yes, Burt. We're on Chang's roof.
MlNDY: ls the graboid still around?
BURT: We've got a bigger problem now.
-Squealers?
-No, screechers.
Shriekers.
The government team is all dead.
NANCY: My God.
BURT: These SOBs don't hunt by sound.
They see heat with sensor organs on their heads.
BURT: You've got to hide your body heat somehow. Copy.
Hide our body heat?
Burt, we copy.
Can't track shriekers with geophones...
...so l'm rigged to download infrared satellite images.
When shriekers first emerge, there are only six of them. lf we can kill them before they find food and multiply, we have a chance.
Okay, here we go.
Preston Dry Lake. Jeep trail.
There we are. Those are our cars, right?
Reading the engine heat.
BURT: Bingo. We have a visual.
JODl: Two, four. There are seven of them.
You mean, they're already making more of themselves?
Yeah, they munched on Statler and Rusk.
We better get moving.
[Fast-paced instrumental music] l totally hate my life.
Damn, l still don't see them.
JODl: How do you focus these things?
BURT: Here, try these.
JACK: Better get that satellite thing again.
JACK: We got you covered.
BURT: That's it, right there.
MlGUEL: There's eight of them.
JODl: What are they eating?
Coyotes, lizards, snakes. They don't care.
This is really serious. l keep trying to tell you people!
How far are your cattle?
-lf they get to your herd, we're in trouble.
-Burt, look.
Look there. They're going into that box canyon over there.
JACK: There's only one way out of there.
-lf we get there before--
-l'm with you.
We just roll in and mop those little devils up.
Graboids!
BURT: Go! Go!
JACK: Come on! Come on!
Miguel! Where the hell....
Es blanco.
Holy shit. l've never seen a live one.
Holy shit!
What do we do now?
Radio Nancy and Mindy to call for some kind of help.
JACK: Damn thing tried to eat my Jeep.
What the hell is it thinking?
The engine. He went for the noise.
Haven't you read the graboid comics? lt's all in there.
Freaking slug. l owe money on that thing.
-Jack, you got your walkie?
-lt's in my Jeep.
Where's yours?
BURT: On my hood.
Well, l guess we just wait.
BURT: Darn! Man!
JODl: Are you worried that the shriekers might get out...
...and go eat Miguel's cattle, and, l don't know, the rest of Nevada?
Absolutely. But l do not dwell on that over which l have no control.
That's great. l have to do all the dwelling. lf you choose to.
You know what l've found?
Most people prefer your dramatic cumulus and nimbus clouds.
But l've always had a weakness for a cirrus.
Yeah. Wispy, and way up there, you know? l wouldn't know.
-Well, don't you ever look up?
-l'm busy.
Too busy to look up?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, l am. l'm working for myself here.
All right? l could have stayed in San Francisco...
...parlayed my MBA into a six-figure income. But, hey. l'm busting my ass eking a living out here...
JODl: ...to build something for myself.
JACK: l know it's not easy.
But l just think you can enjoy yourself while you eke.
Who says l'm not enjoying myself?
You know, l don't have to justify myself to you.
[Silently mouths response]
Foodmall?
You said you bought all your supplies from me! l don't recall signing any purchasing agreement. lt was a verbal commitment. lt was understood, okay? ln exchange for tying up my telephone lines and my computer.
You're getting free overhead, pal.
And, for your information, l do enjoy myself. l do.
Well, one bit of good news.
The shriekers are still in the canyon.
BURT: Got to be the same one l saw outside my house.
Albino, l think.
We used to have a female goat like that.
No kids.
MlGUEL: lmpossible.
BURT: Sterile?
Maybe that's why El Blanco hasn't turned into Los Shriekers.
Son of a--
[Alarm beeps]
BURT: 5:00, on the dot.
Be sunrise soon. ln 37 minutes, 32 seconds.
MlGUEL: Hey, Burt. Heads up!
BURT: What?
BURT: Why, you....
MlGUEL: He follows you, Burt. l think he's got a thing for you.
BURT: lf l could reach my
Grizzly .50-caliber, l'd have a thing for him.
[Eerie screeching] ls that them? lt must be!
But l've never heard them make a noise like that before.
Like coyotes...
...with their kill.
BURT: They're still in the canyon.
Can't afford to wait. l've got to get to my radio.
Wait, Burt! Try this. l saw it on a repeat of MacGyver.
Dental floss! l always carry it.
MlGUEL: There. There, there.
MlGUEL: Yeah. Come on. Come on!
MlGUEL: There, you got it.
BURT: Yes!
Nancy! Mindy! Burt here. Come back!
What's up?
We're pinned down by...
...this great white graboid, and we need an assist. l want you to make one hell of a racket over the radio. Copy?
You want noise, Burt? l copy that.
-Honey, what's going on?
-Burt just phoned in a request.
[Hard rock blares over radio]
MlGUEL: He's going for it.
BURT: Here we go. One more.
MlGUEL: lt's coming back!
BURT: Yep.
BURT: He's taken the bait.
Jodi, Jack, let's move it.
-This is yours: .308, four shots in the mag.
-l don't know-- lt won't bite you. Jack, grab your
Weatherby and let's do this.
-My ''Weather'' what?
-Your rifle. ln your gun rack?
The gun is not real.
Borrowed it off some movie guy.
BURT: Here. You do know which end the bullets come out of?
JACK: l've seen movies.
BURT: Here. You look cold.
Now, let's go bag our limit of shriekers.
Come on!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
MlGUEL: Has to be right around that bend.
[Gusting noise]
JACK: What the--
JODl: Jeez, what are they doing?
BURT: l do not know.
BURT: Let's tenderize them a little.
MlGUEL: l remember these babies.
BURT: Cover!
[Massive explosion]
Holy shit! He doesn't fool around.
Burt is very committed.
Come on, come on! Let's hit them!
[Jack whoops]
JACK: Check it out!
Vaporized them! l mean, there's nothing left.
No, no. We should see remains.
They wouldn't just disintegrate!
-How do you know?
-l've blown them up before!
MlGUEL: lt looks like they shed some kind of husk or skin, like a snake. l don't like that.
Maybe they went back underground.
Let's just go find my truck.
[Somber instrumental music]
MlGUEL: Burt! l really liked that truck.
JODl: Man. That has to hurt. lt was new, wasn't it?
MlGUEL: At least it died for a good reason.
And my Grizzly Big Bore. My sidearms.
My ammo.
JODl: Something moved, over behind the fence.
[Roaring]
JACK: lt's a shrieker?
Not no more, it's not.
BURT: ln Mexico and Argentina, we killed them before they lived 12 hours.
JACK: This is what happens when you don't?
JODl: They just keep mutating like a virus?
BURT: l have no idea!
BURT: Hey, look. That son of a gun has the same heat sensor.
Tracking us.
[Roars menacingly] lt's not smart to track Burt.
What's it doing now?
JODl: What the....
JACK: Point, shoot! Come on!
Point, shoot!
No!
JODl: Oh, my God.
-l shouldn't have taken that shot.
-Should have shot sooner!
JACK: How could you know it was going to take off like a goddamn rocket?
[Melancholy music]
Jack, give me your walkie.
Nancy, Mindy? Burt here. Come back.
Yeah, Burt. We're here.
Nancy, listen. They....
They killed Miguel. He's gone.
Oh, my God, no.
What, Miguel? No!
Nancy? Jodi here.
JODl: [Over radio]
The shriekers can fly now.
So, get off the roof.
You're not safe up there anymore. Copy?
[Nancy and Mindy scream]
NANCY: Hurry! Help!
NANCY: Lock it! Lock it.
[Thudding]
[Hissing]
MlNDY: [Screams] lt's coming back!
NANCY: What are you doing?
MlNDY: They can only see heat! l'm not dumb, you know!
Come on, into the meat locker!
Honey, l never thought you were dumb.
[Jodi groans disgustedly]
[Flies buzz]
An egg. Graboid egg.
JACK: So it's a graboid, to a shrieker, to one of these here new things...
...and finally back to a graboid.
JODl: lt would make sense, biologically. l guess they developed the ability to fly...
...so they can carry the eggs as far as possible.
[Jack yelps]
JACK: Well, look at that. Look at that right there. Reacts with the air.
Smells like a bad night of beans.
JODl: Some high-octane stomach acid he has there.
BURT: Extremely reactive.
Almost like pure sodium.
JACK: Whatever it is, they work it up there in their ass, see--
-Excuse me?
-No, no. That's how they blast off.
Always something new with these things.
[Gusting overhead]
BURT: No, forget it, you're both empty.
-Empty?
-Already?
You fired ten, she fired four. l'm empty, too.
That's just great. Great.
My place is three miles away.
We have to try to make it.
With these honkers doing aerial recon?
We have to conceal our body heat somehow.
BURT: All right, it.... l can make a dumb suggestion.
JODl: No! All l'm saying is, we discovered them, right?
So, we should name them. Let me think.
Okay. ''Blast-Offers.''
Or ''Butt-Launchers.'' That's better?
''Ass-Blasters!'' How's that?
JACK: Sounds like a porno film.
[Gusting noise]
Listen!
JACK: Get down! Get down!
He didn't see us! We're okay.
[Electronic beeping]
-Lunch date?
-Damn! El Blanco.
JACK: l'm sorry?
BURT: White graboid.
-He's moving towards us.
-Can't we get a break here?
Come on, come on. This way.
Beneath this ridge is a solid granite intrusion.
We'll follow it, but El Blanco will have to go around.
JACK: Granite intrusion?
BURT: l memorized the valley's geology.
JACK: Oh, yeah. l been meaning to do that.
BURT: Give me your weapons and make yourselves at home.
I'll see if Nancy and Mindy got through to the Air National Guard.
JACK: Lots of choices.
Nancy, Mindy. Burt here. Come back.
Burt calling Nancy and Mindy. Copy?
You know those supplies l bought?
How about l let you have them at cost?
Feeling guilty?
BURT: Nancy, Mindy. Come back.
JACK: Yeah.
But mostly l'm going to need traveling money.
BURT: Burt calling Nancy and Mindy.
Copy?
You copy?
Burt here. Come back. Nancy? Mindy?
BURT: Nancy? Mindy? Talk to me.
JODl: So, you'll be leaving?
Can't run a business where your customers get eaten.
-Guess not.
-Nancy, Mindy, Burt here. Come back!
Damn it! Hope they got out okay.
[Electronic beeping]
Our old friend El Blanco is finally coming this way.
Not to worry, our perimeter is completely graboid-proof.
[Gusting noise]
But is it Ass-Blaster-proof?
[Crashing]
BURT: Come on, come on. l'll grab my weapon!
Go! Go! Come on!
This way, into the safe room!
Come on!
Seal it!
[Heavy thudding]
-What is all this? Food?
-Better. MREs.
Most dense, most nutritious food known to man.
Okay, how long can we wait it out in here?
Six, seven years. Depending on how well you maintain your dietary discipline.
[Heavy thudding]
Son of a bitch is melting the door down.
Damn his butane, butt-blasting ass.
BURT: Forget that! Here!
-Escape tunnel!
-Burt, l like you.
You should! Go on, go on!
What happens if this thing eats your food?
Ass-blaster blitzkrieg.
Go on! l'll take care of it.
[Suspenseful music]
Trick or treat, you son of a bitch!
-Five gallons of unleaded.
-Man. You really go the distance!
Yeah, l'm a masterpiece of self-destruction.
Fire should reach my stock of reloading powder right about...
...now.
BURT: Come on! Over here.
JACK: Go, go!
[Radio crackles]
NANCY: [Over radio] Burt!
BURT: Now what?
Burt, where've you been?
We've been trying to raise you.
NANCY: You won't believe it.
BURT: No, try me.
NANCY: You know those flying shriekers?
We've got one!
Well, actually, it almost got us, but you know how we got it?
Food! lt ate half the food in the store!
NANCY: If they eat enough, they go into a food coma!
No. They multiply!
NANCY: No, Burt, they don't! Just feed it!
Give it all your MREs.
Burt, do you copy?
Burt?
NANCY: Burt, do you copy?
Burt?
Burt's....
Burt is not available at the moment, but thanks for the update, Nancy.
What kind of Supreme Being would condone such irony?
Well, there are those who say, the marksman aims at himself.
Power of non-attachment.
You need to tap into that right now.
Enough with the Zen zingers, all right?
Burt? Maintain.
A lifetime of preparation, and l end up a refugee? l hate to ask, but have we gone through all this just to be eaten by El Blanco?
The explosions were so loud, they have driven him far away.
You really should read the comics.
[Hissing overhead]
JODl: There are four more of them?
Nothing like a fire to attract every heat-seeking...
...meat-eater in the valley.
-We have to hide.
-Where? l have no home!
Junkyard.
Junkyard! Yeah.
We just have to get that far.
The universe provides.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-The universe provides a boat?
-And a blue tarp. Come on!
Get your heinies up here before they see us! Now, move! Come on!
Get in! Put it over yourself!
JACK: Come on! Like l said, just stick with Jack, you're going to make it back.
JODl: Now, go left. No, no! Right!
Jack, go right!
JODl: Not that far! Now go right!
JACK: Make up your mind!
What the heck--
The little turd.
JODl: We made it! Look!
Plenty of places to hide!
[Puffing overhead]
Wait. lt doesn't see us.
BURT: Calmly, get out of the boat.
And calmly, just head for--
[Hisses] lt sees us! Shit! Run!
JACK: Got you, Jodi! Let's run.
JODl: lt's coming!
My God.
-lt's right there, can you hear it?
-l hear it.
-lt's right there.
-That's what l said.
Let's get out of here.
JACK: Yeah!
BURT: That one's for Miguel!
About time we got a break.
Here comes the rest of them.
JODl: God! Do you think they see us?
Do they know we're here?
No.
Yeah.
-Cover. We got to find cover.
-We can hide in these.
No.
There. Come on.
Go, go!
-God, no. Can we hide over there?
-No time!
Well.
Let's assess the situation.
-We're screwed.
-We're screwed in an outhouse?
BURT: lf l had been able to grab just one gun! Even a single shot.
-How long are we stuck here?
-Minutes.
Our combined heat will make this thing glow to them.
-So, we run! We just run like hell!
-No, they fly. We couldn't get half a mile.
Okay. Can't stay. Can't go. Your turn.
[Heavy thudding]
We've got to fight them.
They're not that smart.
They only see heat.
JODl: They light their farts.
How does that help?
No, wait.
They're full of flammable chemicals.
Could we ignite them, somehow?
Get them to swallow something hot?
-How?
-Stick them with something hot, or a fire.
-A flaming spear.
-They'll kill us if we get that close to them! l'd rather shoot them, somehow. lf l just had my--
JODl: Burt, you don't have a gun.
Deal with it.
-A potato gun!
-A what?
-A potato gun!
-What?
Didn't you make one as a kid, Burt?
-l converted my BB gun to full auto--
-We made them from an old pipe.
You seal up one end, put in a few drops of lighter fluid...
...stick in the potato, light the touchhole.
Potato will go a hundred yards.
JODl: Only, instead of a potato, we shoot a flaming arrow.
Why not? l like it.
Yes! Now, of course, we have to do some shopping.
We need to get some pipe, any size, things for arrows, rags to burn.
Then we'll need something for gasoline. Alcohol.
This won't be easy.
Wait, l got a line on flaming liquid.
You two, go for parts.
-You see any of these rocket-butts nearby?
-No?
No? All right, let's go.
Watch yourselves.
[Suspenseful music]
[Puffing]
[Jodi screams]
[Puffing and thudding]
Yeah.
Ass-Blaster! Blasted your own damn ass!
JACK: What the hell was that?
JODl: l killed one! l did it!
JACK: Way to go, girl!
BURT: Don't get cocky!
That still leaves three! l killed one.
BURT: [Calls] Listen up, it'll be dark soon.
How are we doing, people?
JODl: l got some pipes.
JACK: l got some rags.
BURT: Good work!
JACK: l need some arrows.
BURT: Let's meet over at that yellow truck.
Okay, Nestor, we need your help.
Yes.
Thanks, Nestor.
[Jodi screams]
Burt.
-What's taking Jack so long?
-l don't know.
-Jack!
-ls that enough?
That will do.
Now, look.
Let's move to that mobile home. lt offers high ground for a good line of fire.
[Gusting overhead]
Run!
BURT: Come on, Jodi!
JACK: Lock it! Yeah, eat that.
Damn, girl.
[Ass-Blaster puffs outside]
Come on, let's get to work.
A friend, Nestor, was killed in the first graboid incursion.
His trailer ended up here.
He loved his shine.
JACK: Here, rip some of these.
JACK: Now, you have to seal up one end.
Also, make a touchhole to light it.
BURT: l get the concept.
Any minute, this guy will kamikaze through your roof like before.
All right, l need a gun sight.
Anybody grab any tape or wire?
Your earrings. Your earrings!
JACK: Take them off.
BURT: Excellent.
BURT: Still don't have a touchhole.
This has a little hole. Will this work?
Yeah.
Armed and dangerous.
-But do we have a lighter?
-Burt does.
How do you know?
Well, you're Burt.
Damn right l am.
[Gusting outside]
Shit! Another kamikaze run!
BURT: Whiskey down the barrel.
About a shot's worth.
He knows. He's up!
BURT: Open the door.
Door open!
There!
JODl: Now?
BURT: No, wait for it.
-Now?
-Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now! lt worked!
JACK: Blew him away! l mean, blew him--
Blew him away!
BURT: That's why we're at the top of the food chain.
JODl: Two down, and two to go!
[Heavy thudding]
Reload.
Whiskey. l'll take that arrow. Load it.
That will do it.
JACK: Get down! Stay down!
No! l got an idea.
We'll shoot it through the other skylight.
Stay down, Burt.
JODl: Now what?
JACK: Spread your legs.
JODl: Excuse me? l get it. Okay.
-Don't blame me if l miss because--
-Aim and shoot!
Okay!
-What the hell did you do?
-l shot him.
JODl: Burt.
JACK: Burt!
We should go hunting sometime.
JACK: Here you go.
JACK: l think he looks pissed!
-Pissed, but dumb. No sitting duck, Burt?
-Never assume anything.
She's ready.
BURT: Stand by to fire at my command.
Light me!
-No way!
-l knew it!
Sons of bitches are always on a learning curve.
Load. lncoming!
Lighter. l need a lighter.
BURT: lt's going to blow! lnto the back room, now!
JACK: Get in here.
JACK: Go, go! Get in here, Burt!
[Massive explosion]
JODl: Yuck.
JACK: Jeez.
Twenty-three hours, 59 minutes.
Mission completed.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Damn it! How the hell does he always know where l am?
[Electronic beeping]
The watch. The ultrasonic signal.
JODl: Burt! Are you okay?
BURT: l'm caught.
JACK: Burt, it's coming!
Get rid of the watch!
You're crazy. Get out of here!
JACK: El Blanco, you want it?
Come get it, dude!
[Suspenseful music, rumbling]
JACK: Here you go, buddy!
BURT: My Leatherman tool! ln my pocket!
JACK: Here you go, little buddy, now!
Right side, bottom row, third pocket.
-Cut the springs where my vest is snagged.
-How do you open this?
What is that?
All right.
[Suspenseful music continues]
Come on.
JACK: Jodi, hurry it up!
JODl: l'm working on it!
One.
-Get out of here. Go on!
-Shut up, Burt!
JODl: Come on.
BURT: Go on!
God Almighty!
Wow.
Good throw. l used to pitch a little single A ball till the old rotator cuff started acting up.
On the off-chance that
El Blanco's coming back for seconds...
...want to get me off this thing?
[Upbeat country music]
NANCY: Yes.
Could you hold on for just a minute?
They matched your offer.
Well, l'm sorry.
This is the world's only living Ass-Blaster.
And l have a daughter to put through school. l want a car.
BOY: Come on.
Could you hold a minute?
The Vegas guys went even higher.
Should we do it?
Siegfried, Roy, he's all yours.
JODl: Make sure you stay behind the ropes.
JODl: Hey.
JACK: Hey.
-Hitting the road, Desert Jack?
-Well, more like, Car Wash Jack. l landed a job managing that place down in Bixby.
The universe provides.
JODl: Congratulations.
JACK: Thank you.
So, l guess you'll be sticking around.
Yeah, l like the area. lt has a lot to offer.
Hey, listen, l'm breaking in my new rear axle. You want to...
...go for a little ride? l'm restocking.
Nice clouds out there. l can see the clouds from here.
Yeah, but these....
See, these are the good ones.
Well....
JODl: Mindy? Can you watch the store?
[Soft, sentimental music] lt figures.
Older women.
[Deep underground rumbling]
Buenas tardes, Senor Blanco.
That's it, just follow the car.
Burt!
Hey, nice wheels. l've been expecting you, Melvin.
You are one persistent little money-grubber.
Come on, Burt. Look around, man.
There's nothing here. l'm going to turn this into something. l'll build homes for families.
The smart thing for you to do is cash in right now.
-You might want to join me, Melvin.
-Why? lt's safer up here.
Jesus Christ, Burt! l thought you killed all those things.
BURT: l never said that.
MEL: God, man, kill it! Blow it up!
What are you waiting for?
BURT: The thing is, as long as one of these reptilians is still alive...
...this whole area is deemed protected.
You know, pursuant to section 1472-B of the Endangered Species Act? ln other words, no houses, no condos and no ranchettes.
You're crazy. Okay?
These things, man, they're going to--
They're going to eat you, Burt.
They're going to get all of you.
We got new geophones, graboid barriers, blanket protection.
The whole town agrees. Between you and El Blanco, they'll take him every time.
Adiós, Melvin!
Burt! Hey!
Burt!
Burt!
MEL: [Shouts] Burt! You asshole!
You damn son of a bitch!
God! I hate you!
I hate your guts!
You sorry, sick...
...paranoid, right-wing...
...redneck psycho!
Shit-kicker!
Goddamn you, Burt!
And I hate that hat!

At the far reaches of the universe...
... Iies a planet of men who have[br]advanced technologically...
...beyond the realm[br]of human comprehension.
There is no breeding.[br]They are a product of cloning...
...and their reproductive organs[br]have shrunk and disappeared.
All emotions have been bred[br]out of this race...
...and each succeeding generation...
...has become more ambitious[br]and driven than the previous one.
They want to rule the universe...
...and now they are planning[br]their next takeover from the inside.
This planet is four solar systems[br]from our own.
Across the Sea of Vell,[br]at a fixed position of 1 3-6-90...
...on the subset grid 4-1 0.
It is a solid, rigid mass...
...with a dense core[br]of magnetic, metallic liquid.
The atmosphere is composed[br]of nitrogen, oxygen and argon...
...in amounts of 78, 21[br]and 1 percent by volume.
This is our target.
This is Earth.
This is where one of you[br]will serve your planet...
...to the act of procreation.
Your training will be extensive.
The Earth woman's reproductive organs[br]are located here.
The access point is here.
Insertion in any other access point[br]will not result in pregnancy.
To get the woman in a receptive mood[br]for insertion...
... compliment her on these areas.
She will also enjoy being told...
... that she smells nice[br]and that her footwear is stylish.
You will spend many hours in study...
...trying to learn all you can[br]about the females of this planet.
It is important to a woman that she[br]feels you are listening when she speaks.
This is most easily achieved...
...by repeating the phrase, "uh-huh, "[br]when the woman is communicating.
I went to the store this morning.
Uh-huh.
On the way, the car started making[br]a funny noise, so I pulled over.
Uh-huh.
Then I couldn't hear it,[br]so I started driving again.
Then it was fine.
You will familiarize yourself with[br]her predilections, her customs...
...her ranges of temperament.
Her smiles, her frowns.[br]Her ups and her downs.
-Your footwear is quite fashionable.[br]-Thank you.
May I insert my penis in you?
Yes.
Ten seconds.[br]This time is your personal best.
Congratulations.
You all have performed admirably...
...and your concentration[br]has been exemplary...
...but one man has been chosen.
This man has excelled[br]in his training...
...and we are confident that women[br]of Earth will be both interested in...
...and willing to experience[br]insertion with him.
This man...
...is H-1 449-6.
Congratulations, H-1 449-6.
Or, as you'll now be referred to,[br]Harold Anderson...
...from Seattle, Washington.
We've given you a wealth[br]of information about Earth...
...but her people are unpredictable.
As with all alien cultures,[br]there will be subtleties...
...which we couldn't prepare you for.
However, given your adaptability[br]and your capacity for learning...
...we're certain you'll achieve[br]your goal with ease.
The success of our planet's domination[br]of the universe rests in your hands.
Thank you, sir.
If you go with these men,[br]we'll arrange your transfer...
...and attach your penis.
We will begin our descent into[br]the Phoenix area in about 30 minutes.
Flight crew will be by shortly[br]to pick up all food and beverage items.
Thank you once again[br]for flying Arizona West.
What is that?
What?
There. Inbound at our 2:00.
-It's moving.[br]-Tell me where to go.
Hydraulics?
Landing hydraulics okay.[br]Wing and tail hydraulics okay.
-We're losing altitude.[br]-Air speed is dropping.
What the hell is this?
Collision alert. Collision alert.
It's on us!
Simple people.[br]They're 1 000 years behind us.
They haven't figured out that round[br]is the most efficient way to fly.
This will be a snap.
-Remember, get a woman pregnant.[br]-Give me two days.
Wait for the baby and then come back.
Whatever you do,[br]don't let anyone know the truth.
We don't want another Roswell[br]on our hands.
That happened because you made[br]the mistake of sending H-228-J.
That guy was an idiot[br]and not as handsome as me.
Nowhere near.
Hi. Hi.
-Hey there. Hey, I like your shoes.[br]-What?
Let me give you a hand.
Take your seat[br]and fasten your seat belt.
" Rebecca."
I always wanted my children to have[br]a mother named Rebecca. Interested?
Are you all right?
Well, to be honest, I am a little[br]lightheaded from that perfume.
You smell nice.
Sir, if you don't take your seat,[br]I'll report you when we land.
Ouch. Kitty likes to scratch.
Anyone sitting here?
Well, there is now. Hi.
-You're shaking.[br]-I thought we'd crash.
I like it when a woman shakes.[br]Turns me on.
What?
-I like your shoes.[br]-Thank you.
-And you smell nice.[br]-Thank you.
Going to Phoenix[br]on business or pleasure?
I'm going to see my husband.
He's a pharmacist. He works[br]in the pharmaceutical industry.
We had a fight before this flight.
You shouldn't fly without saying[br]"Sorry" or " I love you."
If I'd died,[br]he'd still think I was pissed off.
Hey, watch the cart, man!
Do you want me to get you a copy of[br]the FAA rules and regulations, asswipe?
I do my job, then you do yours.[br]Stay out of my way!
They'll give anybody a fucking badge.
-Hello, Mr. Jones.[br]-What we got?
It could be bad air, but judging[br]from what I've heard from the crew...
...it sounds a little[br]out of the ordinary.
-How long you been with the department?[br]-Three months.
I'll do you a favour.[br]It's never out of the ordinary.
It's either a flock of geese,[br]a weather balloon...
...or if it's Friday,[br]the crew is drunk.
Nadine, what'd I say[br]about using this number?
I said never to call this number[br]unless the house is on fire...
...and I don't hear a siren,[br]so this better be good.
Yeah, I know today's our anniversary.[br]What makes you think I forgot?
How do you know I'm not coming home[br]with a bunch of flowers or something?
How do you know that?
Nadine, don't cry.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
A passenger shot some video[br]when the incident took place.
You might want to look at it.
Get a list of passengers and crew.[br]Check the cabin, write your report.
And if you see anything at all[br]interesting, just remember:
It's not.
Well, Christmas is early this year.
You guys twins?
Asshole.
Can you contribute to the mission?
What can I get for 1 50 bucks,[br]gorgeous?
What's that noise?
I don't hear anything.
It's coming from your pants.
There's something else that comes out[br]of my pants. Want to see?
Keep the change.
-Can I have your autograph?[br]-What?
-You are Miss America, aren't you?[br]-Yeah.
Who are you? Mr. Universe?
Hey, where you headed?
Chicago.
That's attractive.
The Windy City.[br]So what time's your flight?
Forty minutes.
I don't know what you're doing[br]until then...
...but there's a Hilton[br]across the street.
I don't know if they have[br]a 40-minute rate or not, but...
...maybe we could--
Taxi!
-I know who you are.[br]-You do?
I know where you're from too.
Really?
New guy from Seattle.[br]Commercial and home loans.
-How did you know?[br]-My gut.
Perry Gordon.[br]Commercial and home loans too.
Nice to meet you.[br]Harold Anderson.
Word is, you're some[br]big banking kahuna from up north.
Your letters of recommendation[br]were unbelievable.
They're not that great.
They were. I snuck into Mr. Fisk's[br]office, read every single one.
-Who's that?[br]-That's Rita.
Office manager. I got her a job.
Smartest thing I ever did.
-Is she--[br]-Too late. All mine.
She's a noisy one too.[br]Thank God we work in a bank.
Close the vault door,[br]nobody hears a thing.
She have a friend?
Don't know. When you want to hit[br]the nightspots, call me.
Thanks. Great. How about now?
-You're kidding, right?[br]-No.
It's 1 0 a.m.[br]You haven't met the boss yet.
So?
-You got some balls on you.[br]-I sure do.
Two of them, below my penis.
Listen.
I've gotta have sex right away.
I'm really, really horny.
-I'm getting that.[br]-Anderson?
Yes, sir?
I've been waiting for you. Don Fisk.[br]Come on in.
Good morning, Mr. Fisk.
This way.
--as long as the contractionary[br]British fiscal policy continues.
I can see we don't need[br]any time to get acclimated.
Pretty girl.
That's Rita, the office manager.[br]She's mine.
We go to Scottsdale every weekend.[br]I have a condo up there.
You're free to use it anytime.
-Rita?[br]-The condo.
-Thanks.[br]-You know...
...l have never seen such a stack[br]of glowing recommendations.
If I didn't know better,[br]I'd think you wrote them yourself.
A vice president's job is opening up.[br]I assume you're interested.
No, not necessarily.
Come on. It's okay to be ambitious.[br]You're only human.
Well....
Think it over. In the meantime...
-...welcome aboard.[br]-Thanks.
We got a wonderful family[br]of people here. Top-quality people.
Except for Perry.[br]He's a sneaky prick.
Always looking for pussy,[br]never doing his job.
-I can't stand that.[br]-That is good to know.
Neglected? Nadine, how can you[br]feel neglected?
We never do anything?
What about that trip to New Orleans?[br]Wasn't that a good time?
I don't care if it was four years ago.[br]I asked if it was a good time.
Just don't get all pissy, will you?
I can't even ask you a question.[br]Could you hold?
Can you hold, please? Thank you.
Jones.
No, that's closed.[br]Pacific East flight 769.
Yeah, it was the hydraulics.
Arizona West flight 442. I was just[br]getting through that stuff. Hold on.
I'll have to call you back.[br]Let me call you back.
What the hell?
You like? This is[br]the best titty bar in Phoenix.
How many are there?
This one, and there might be[br]one other, but it sucks.
You come here a lot?
Once, twice a year.
-Hi, Perry.[br]-Hey, Cheryl.
-Grab me a beer.[br]-Sure. What would you like?
Someone just like you.
Relative?
I'm your cowboy, baby.
Great, but that noise is[br]getting louder.
Traffic.
-Are you sure?[br]-It's rush hour.
Come on. Make me feel like a man.
Hold on, mister.[br]Time to put on your party clothes.
What's that?
A condom.
My boss has one in Scottsdale.[br]He said I can use it.
Great. Put it on.
But I don't want anything between us.
Just unroll it.
Oh, boy.
What the hell was that?
It slipped.
-Morning.[br]-Morning.
How'd it go with Cheryl?
I rushed her to the hospital.[br]She got some glass in her eye.
Yeah, that happens.
Where we going tonight?
I'll take you to a great place.[br]I'm taking you where I met Rita.
I'm Doreen. I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Doreen.
And today marks my 59th day[br]of sobriety.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
And I celebrated by[br]calling my parents...
...to tell them about[br]my engagement to Janice.
Dykes. Made popular on television,[br]now they're everywhere.
Is there anyone else[br]who'd like to share?
You.
Hello. Get the bread,[br]I see something tasty.
Hi, this is the first time I've[br]actually gotten up to speak, so I'm--
Your name. Start with your name.
Thanks. Of course.[br]I'm sorry. I'm Susan.
Hi, Susan.
Anyway, I'm an alcoholic.
I've been sober[br]a couple of months now.
Thanks. That's okay.
My father was an abusive alcoholic.
And I guess maybe I'm lucky[br]that he left when I was 7.
But my stepfather was an alcoholic.[br]And so was my second stepfather.
Anyway, I have a history[br]of picking the wrong men.
Big surprise, right?
The thing is, I never knew I had[br]a drinking problem...
...because ever since high school,[br]I've only dated musicians.
They always said I was a lot of fun.
-I like what I hear.[br]-But all that's changed.
I bottomed out.
I was having fun in...
...l don't even remember what city.
When I woke up,[br]I didn't know where I was...
...how I got there,[br]or who the guy was that I was with.
And I thought I should know[br]at least one of those things.
So I came here.
I stopped putting myself in situations[br]where I couldn't respect myself...
...so others didn't respect me.
She wants respect. Cuts me out.
Anyway, I took my first step today.
I bought a new car...
...and it'll be great to get up in the[br]morning and remember where I parked it.
Thanks.
Would anyone else like to share?
It's dead tonight.[br]Not a weeper in the joint.
Weeper?
Usually one or two gals[br]get all weepy after the meeting.
Then you clean up. You go over,[br]offer them a tissue. Bang, you're in.
Yank a nose hair right before you go.
They see the tears, think you're[br]a kindred spirit. You are in huge.
Look. Wish me luck.
What happened?
I did so much blow once,[br]I didn't sleep for three weeks.
I lost 1 5 pounds. The good thing?[br]I've been able to keep it off.
Remember me from the aeroplane?
Oh, yeah, of course.[br]You hit me really hard.
What are you doing here?
I have a slight problem.[br]You know how it is with airlines.
You're at 30,000 feet[br]with all those tiny bottles.
-It's really not my fault.[br]-Sure.
Damn it!
You hit my car. My new car.
-I don't believe it.[br]-What happened?
Don't get excited. First,[br]this isn't new. This is a '98.
-I know a guy with one.[br]-It's new to me!
Oh, God.
Look at it.
I guess we both have to drive[br]more carefully.
I was parked, asshole.
I don't see a lot of damage,[br]so I'm gonna run.
Right, I got the cracked taillight,[br]dented fender package.
I want to see your driver's license,[br]registration and insurance.
-Can't we settle this without insurance?[br]-No.
If you try to worm your way[br]out of this...
...l will cut your heart out[br]with my hood ornament.
Have we dated?
I'm not very good in bed.
No, no. You're great.
No. My boyfriend once said it was[br]like trying to start a dead car.
You've got to uncross your legs.
I told you I'm not very good in bed.[br]I'm sorry.
What is that humming sound?
It's the tendons in your legs[br]vibrating.
Oh, you know what?[br]Can you--?
One second.
Hello?
I was just thinking[br]about you too, Steve.
We don't want to lose our momentum.
I miss you too.
Is she there?
Ready for more?
I can't do this.
I'm in love with a married pilot[br]from Dallas, our hub.
You know who I feel really sorry for?[br]His wife.
-He's off cheating on her.[br]-With you?
Get out!
What'd I do? I'm crazy about you.
-Get out![br]-You smell nice.
I almost opened up to you.
Are those your shoes?[br]Those are beautiful shoes.
You're in a hurry.[br]Aren't you gonna eat?
Gotta get to the office.
-You mean you have to get to her.[br]-What?
-You're having an affair.[br]-What's wrong with you?
All you talk about is[br]how work bores you.
Now you're rushing to get to[br]your job? What's her name?
It's not an affair.
It's that Pamela person.
I've seen the way she looks at you.[br]The woman is a slut.
She's in a wheelchair.
Don't think she doesn't play that[br]for all it's worth.
You want to know what's going on?[br]You want to know the truth?
I deserve that much.
This is classified,[br]so it's just between you and me.
A couple days ago, on an Arizona West[br]flight, there was an incident.
The crew almost lost control.
One of the passengers was[br]shooting video.
Something made contact[br]with that plane.
The thing is,[br]I don't have an answer for it.
For the first time in 22 years,[br]I don't know what happened.
There's something about that.
About the not knowing.
Look. I'm getting goose bumps[br]just thinking about it.
It's what I've been waiting for.[br]Now it's finally come.
-Understand?[br]-Does she have bigger tits than me?
I'll figure this out.
I'll take that as a yes.
I'll be late.
Damn!
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Perry.
You know Perry?
Yeah, but not too well. I'm his wife.
His wife?
Well, Perry's a very lucky man,[br]if I may say.
Very lucky.
Harold Anderson.
Helen.[br]He's probably in the vault.
Excuse me.[br]I'm looking for Perry Gordon.
Is it okay if I wait in his office?
-That'll be fine.[br]-Thank you.
Were you at the AA meeting[br]last night?
Yes. I saw you there.[br]Your speech was very good.
Thanks. Do you work here?
Commercial and home loans.[br]Not too exciting. Just a normal guy.
Nothing's wrong with normal.[br]Do you know where Perry is?
You know Perry?
Well, no.[br]He backed into my car last night.
I've got an estimate.[br]Could you give this to him?
Sure.
-You have beautiful handwriting.[br]-That's the mechanic.
This part here where you[br]signed your name? Lovely.
How long you been in the program?
-Program?[br]-AA.
I'm not involved in the program.[br]Perry just took me there.
He's in the program?
Not that I know of. This would make[br]fantastic dinner conversation.
-Busy tonight?[br]-Why were you there?
Checking it out. Have you had[br]a chance to think about dinner?
Oh, God. I get it.
You go to AA meetings to[br]pick up women. That's sick.
How can you take advantage of people?
Perry took me. I had no idea.[br]How's 8?
Excuse me. May l?
Here's the estimate, okay?
I hope next time you take[br]a pathetic little jaunt to AA...
...you drive more carefully.
-What's she talking about?[br]-I'm as confused as you are.
Oh, come on.
I just put everything I had[br]into this car.
If you don't want to go through your[br]insurance, write a check. I'll wait.
That's where you were last night?
That's what you didn't want to tell me.[br]You were at an AA meeting?
Now you know.[br]I hope you're happy.
You'll get your check.
Why couldn't you tell me?
I wasn't sure I was strong enough to[br]stay committed to the program...
...and I didn't want to disappoint you[br]if I dropped out.
Baby, I had no idea.
It's been tough, but, thank God,[br]so far so good.
It's a brave thing you're doing.[br]I can't believe it.
One day at a time, sugar.
I'll walk you out.
I love you so much.[br]I'll do everything in my power...
...to make sure you never take another[br]drink for the rest of your life.
Thank you.
That was his wife.
He's married and he's going to[br]AA meetings to pick up women?
What a humongous sleazebag.[br]You married?
Nope. So I guess we're on for dinner?
No.
Nice meeting you.
What planet are you from?
What do you mean?
You want to go out with me, I say no,[br]you're like, okay, and that's that.
Put a little effort into it.
You asking me out?
No, I'm not asking you out. If I was[br]asking a man out, he'd know it.
Right.
You know, I have a feeling[br]that you're not what you appear to be.
You smell nice.
Thanks. Something new.[br]Just bought it today.
God. Why was it never[br]this complicated before?
Because before, by now I'd be drunk[br]and in bed with the guy.
How's 6:00?
Damn it. Fine. Anything. 7.
Fine.
Tell me something about yourself.
My name is Harold Anderson.[br]I work in a bank.
And?
More?
I never met a man that talks less[br]about himself.
Where were you born?
My turn to ask a question.[br]What do you do for a living?
I worked in a guitar shop[br]for a long time.
When I got sober,[br]I realized I had to get out.
Too many negative influences.
Such as?
Well, musicians, for one.
There was a sign over the door saying:[br]" Come in, pick up a guitar...
...and play the beginning of 'Stairway[br]to Heaven' as badly as you can."
I was close to going postal.
So what are you doing now?
Well, don't laugh, but I'm working[br]as a real-estate agent.
My friend has an office.[br]She helped me study for my license.
So now I'm out there[br]trying to sell houses.
How's it going?
I guess it's okay.
But I'm six weeks into it and find out[br]you don't get paid...
...until you sell something,[br]which is like, "Oh, great."
So what is your mission?
-I'm sorry?[br]-Your mission in life.
My mission is to[br]get to know myself...
...so that I can end up focusing less[br]on myself and more on others. I think.
I believe I was put here on Earth[br]to have a child.
I've never heard a man say that.
I would love to have kids.[br]I just hope I'm ready.
We transfer our dysfunction[br]onto our kids.
I don't want to be guilty of that.[br]I've already fucked up my dog.
I want to have a child.[br]That's all I want.
What's that noise?
Cheap sound system.
I don't trust you.
Why?
All men are the same.
They say whatever they have to,[br]to get into your pants.
That's terrible.[br]But what would it be?
What?
The thing I'd have to say[br]to get into your pants?
It's a little messy.
How long you been working on it?
Just a couple of months, but I can[br]already tell I'm never gonna stop.
One day I'm happy. The breakfast nook[br]should be yellow, bright and sunny.
Next minute, I'm down.[br]I repaint it blue.
It was black a couple days ago.
A black breakfast nook?
Doesn't work. Trust me.
Why don't you take that arch thing[br]out altogether?
The whole thing?
I have a feeling that what's out there[br]is more interesting anyway.
What are these?
Part of this whole changing thing[br]that I'm doing.
I'm supposed to turn myself over[br]to a higher power.
My only problem is,[br]I'm having trouble choosing one...
...so I'm just covering my ass.
Higher power?
God, or whatever you want to call it.
I'm looking into each one until[br]I find one that connects with me.
-How will you know?[br]-I'll just know.
How?
Well, I'll feel something, I guess.
This one looks very old.
Actually, it's not old.[br]I got this on QVC.
You don't care about this.[br]You're just tricking me.
There's no way to prove[br]that a God exists.
-So?[br]-So then why look?
-That's not the point.[br]-Then what is the point?
Oh, God. I knew it.
I knew this normal guy,[br]normal life thing had a big catch.
Harold, please. Harold.[br]I have to stop.
No, I can't do this.
Part of this whole thing[br]about me changing my life...
...and living by a different set[br]of rules is--
You'll laugh, but I decided[br]I won't have sex until I'm married.
Sorry?
You see, I am finally free[br]not to have to have sex.
Do you have any water? Never mind.[br]I'll help myself.
Thanks for coming.
Have you gotten a woman pregnant yet?
I'm close, but there are variables[br]I'm not prepared for.
You're close?
Yes. But she wants to get married.
3 billion females, and you pick[br]one that wants to get married.
-Yes.[br]-That is bad luck.
-What should I do?[br]-Marry her.
I'm not trained for marriage.[br]Perry says it's hell.
-Who's Perry?[br]-This guy at work.
He didn't think Susan was hot.
Who's Susan? Why is she hot?[br]ls she on fire?
Susan is the woman.
Earth probes are at Jupiter. In three[br]generations, they'll know about us.
Our takeover must be complete by then.
Marry her, impregnate her,[br]and don't call me again.
The more we make contact,[br]the greater risk of discovery.
Thanks a lot.
Notice anything unusual[br]about the jolt that hit the plane?
Well, it wasn't like anything[br]I've ever experienced.
Did you see anything fly by the[br]aircraft around the time of the jolt?
No, I was busy trying to keep things[br]calm in the cabin.
A lot of panic?
You can imagine.
Except for one jerk.
He started hitting on me right after.[br]He acted like nothing even happened.
Tell me about the guy that hit on you.
Darn it. I knew I shouldn't[br]have said anything.
Okay, I went out with a passenger.[br]I'm guilty.
Excuse me?
We're not supposed to date passengers,[br]but I met him after, at a function.
We went to my place,[br]but nothing happened.
So you first noticed him[br]after the jolt?
Yes, he was very obnoxious.
What was he like before the jolt?
I don't remember seeing him[br]before the jolt.
Did you notice anything peculiar[br]or unusual about him?
Not really.
Until we got to my place.[br]Then there was something odd.
Go on.
Again, nothing happened,[br]but while we were fooling around...
...there was this strange humming sound[br]coming from his pants.
From the front or the back?
The front.
From the crotch area.
Do you remember his name?
Harold Anderson.
There was no Harold Anderson[br]on that flight.
Oh, my God.
We have a problem funding your loan.[br]We checked...
...and it turns out there's five frozen[br]yogurt places within a one-mile radius.
-Hey, stranger.[br]-Hey, it's you!
I'm thinking about opening[br]an account here.
Yeah, I don't have a lot of money.[br]I have $7.35.
I'd like to put some of it[br]into a T-bill, some into stocks...
...and the rest I'd just like to save[br]for a rainy day.
Would you think about marrying me?
All right. I deserved that.
I'm serious. I thought about[br]what you said the other night.
Everything I said was such a turnoff.
I went completely overboard.[br]It was typical Susan.
You know what?
There was some of that.
Susan....[br]What is your last name?
Hart.
Susan Hart...
...would you do me the honour[br]of marrying me?
You're serious.
I want to marry you.
I could court you[br]for six months or a year...
...and we could get to know[br]each other, then break up...
...or we could do something[br]that I think we both want now...
...and that's have a child.
Wow! And I just came in[br]to ask you to lunch.
-You really mean this?[br]-Yes.
Can I think about it?
If you think you have to.
This room will be perfect[br]for the baby.
Oh, you have a baby.
We're having one in about six months.
Congratulations. That's wonderful.
I'm sure they'll accept our offer.[br]You'll be very happy here.
Thanks. You've been great.
We'll talk to you soon.
-What?[br]-Just fuck her right in front of me.
You're never getting pregnant again.[br]Never.
It's insanity.
Come on. You're off the booze.[br]You're off the musicians...
...and now you want to get married?
And to a man you barely know?
Don't make me put together[br]an intervention.
Thank you.
This is Susan's life.[br]It's not our place to pass judgment.
If she wants to get married and make[br]an idiot of herself, it's her choice.
-Is that the waiter?[br]-No, that's a gay guy without a jacket.
-Why is marriage a bad choice?[br]-Please!
She doesn't even know the man.
There's something to be said for[br]jumping off the end of the diving board.
Life is short.
Until you marry the wrong guy.[br]Then it gets pretty long.
I am almost dehydrated.
What do you want to do, Susan?
I'll tell you what she's thinking:
Being single is great.[br]But she goes onto the street...
...or into people's homes[br]and sees babies everywhere.
They're taking over.
I thought that, then I'd look[br]at those little shits...
...and get angry because it looks like[br]they're taunting you, saying:
"Why don't you have one of me yet?[br]Why are you a loser?"
-You don't like my baby?[br]-Your baby's adorable.
When her head gets normal,[br]she'll be gorgeous.
-Her head is normal![br]-I'm kidding!
I want to find out more about this guy.[br]Is he rich?
-You can't ask that.[br]-Why not?
Because she doesn't know, okay?
How can you have a child with a man[br]you don't even know?!
Excuse me. You were[br]artificially inseminated.
Yes, I was, but I knew the technician[br]longer than she's known this guy!
I'm out of time.
Do you have to go?
No...
...l'm running out of time.
I think that would be great.[br]I'm looking forward to it.
Hold on. Someone's on the other line.
Hi, Harold. It's me.
Hey, me.
Yes.
The answer is yes.
I will marry you.
Hold on a second.
Debbie, I won't be able to go[br]rollerblading this weekend.
I'm getting married. Bye.
I'm back, Mrs. Anderson.
I like the sound of that.
Me too.
-You don't mind?[br]-No. Is this everything?
This is all my work. If my clients[br]call, you have their information.
-I didn't even know you were doing her.[br]-I'm not.
You're marrying a woman[br]you've never had sex with?
Didn't you see The Crying Game?
You think she's got the goods, lift up[br]her skirt, it's Oscar Mayer time.
-Is this your third-quarter report?[br]-Fisk won't need this till I get back.
-Damn it![br]-What?
Let's go. What am I talking[br]about here? I'm such a downer.
Imagine not banging your wife[br]until you're married. How romantic.
Everything will work out fine.
Not that that's ever happened.[br]I'm kidding. Congratulations.
-Thanks again for doing this.[br]-Go get her, tiger.
I promise to respect you, even if[br]I don't always understand you.
I will honour you[br]and take care of you...
...and though it's not[br]politically correct...
...l will obey you as long as[br]your request is reasonable.
I will be mother to your children...
...and love you until[br]death do us part.
Very nice.
-Harold.[br]-Present.
No, your vows are next.
This is where they all get nervous.
Susan, I'm so happy[br]we're getting married.
You know what they say.[br]Sometimes less is more.
Harold and Susan, by the powers granted[br]to me by the state of Nevada...
...l now pronounce you[br]husband and wife.
You can kiss the bride.
Stop. I never thought I'd say this,[br]but I can't take any more.
-A few more times.[br]-No.
-Where'd you learn that?[br]-What?
You're amazing.
I've had so many orgasms, some are[br]still stacked up waiting to land.
-Aren't you tired?[br]-Tired of waiting.
Come on. Let's get it on.
Let's talk.
Okay.
I still wish we'd been married[br]in a church with a lot of people.
I always dreamed of[br]a wedding like that.
Me too.
Stop. Stop.
I thought we'd take a helicopter trip[br]over Hoover Dam or something.
-When we could be making love?[br]-I need a break.
We've been screwing[br]for 21 hours nonstop.
-We've had room service.[br]-We did it while I ate.
If I'd known that'd happen,[br]I wouldn't have ordered soup.
I heard this happens after you marry.[br]The woman loses interest in sex.
I love sex with you...
...but I want to do something[br]that involves, I don't know, standing.
Let's do some goofy tourist thing.
Like what?
So back to the room, then?
-Knock-knock.[br]-Perry.
-I am very impressed with this work.[br]-Thank you.
It looks like you've done Anderson's[br]work as well.
This third-quarter report is brilliant.[br]I didn't know you had it in you.
Now you do, and I hope[br]you keep that in mind...
...when you pick a new vice president[br]for this bank.
I admit that Harold had[br]the inside track--
I don't know if I trust Anderson.
It's strange, but what kind of guy[br]marries a chick after one date?
I smell some weird cult thing.
I have no facts at all[br]to back that up...
...but if they show up dead with[br]40 friends, then we'll know for sure.
I'm sure he's not--
Not to tell tales, but he is lazy,[br]except for when you're around.
The rest of the time[br]he talks about his time in prison.
-Wasn't supposed to say that.[br]-I'm back.
Hey, buddy.[br]How was the honeymoon?
Good. Great.
How was Vegas? Never mind.[br]How many times you bang the wifey?
Come on, how many?
1 26. Why?
You serious?
1 26 times in a week?
Harold, there's a Mr. Roland Jones[br]here to see you.
Excuse me.
I thought you said he was lazy.
-Hi. Harold Anderson.[br]-Roland Jones.
-Have a seat.[br]-Thank you.
I won't take up much time. I'm with[br]the Federal Aviation Authority.
Don't tell me[br]the government needs a loan.
That's another story.
Maybe you can help me out here.
You were on an Arizona West flight from[br]Seattle a few weeks ago, weren't you?
I'd have to check my day planner.[br]I do a lot of flying.
Let me remind you of the flight.[br]The plane experienced severe turbulence.
It frightened a lot of the passengers.
I don't remember it being scary.[br]I remember a small bump and then--
Was there something[br]mechanically wrong with the plane?
Do you still have your ticket?
I wish I did.[br]I throw all that stuff out.
-You don't save it for the records?[br]-Don't keep records.
Don't tell my boss.
I could win a Pulitzer in fiction[br]for some of my expense reports.
I won't waste any more of your time.
A little light reading.
Have you seen[br]this month's issue of Playboy?
Check out this month's Playmate.
Tell me if you think[br]those babies are real.
I think those are real.
Me too.
I'll be in touch.
God!
Where are the pictures?
-Pictures?[br]-Of the honeymoon.
As a friend, you're obligated[br]to bore me with your pictures.
I don't have any.
You didn't take pictures?
I took some, but I wanted to fill[br]the roll before I had it processed.
You took less than[br]one roll of pictures?
What is that?
I guess she was kept busy[br]doing other things.
You could say that.
It was pretty great.
I'll bet, I'll bet.
There's just one thing.
Yes, there's always "one thing."
I don't know how serious this is[br]or if I should be worried, but....
What?
How should I put this?
When he's aroused, his penis vibrates.
Hey, "two-two-two mints in one."
Wait. What do you mean, it vibrates?
"Vibrates" is not really the word.[br]It's more like....
-There's a humming sound.[br]-Humming.
I was with a black guy whose penis[br]whistled when he got excited.
-Stop![br]-Yes! I'm not kidding!
What did it whistle?
The score from Guys and Dolls.[br]It just whistled.
-You would ask that.[br]-I thought I was making tea.
I love it. I love it.
Hi, honey! You're home.
You remember the girls.
Yes. Hello.
Showtime.
I guess you don't like my friends.
Why do you say that?
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's the problem?
I don't know. They're your friends.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I had a bad day at work.
You want to talk about it?
No.
Have you taken the pregnancy test?
No, but I will in a few days. You're[br]not looking at me when I talk to you.
You're looking at me,[br]but you're not really looking.
I'm looking right at you[br]and listening, I swear.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's probably not you.[br]It's probably me.
Can we just try[br]to have a conversation?
Oh, Christ!
Turn that thing off.
You should pee on it again.
-You pee on it. I'm done.[br]-I just want to know for sure.
I feel like I'd be worth nothing[br]to you if I couldn't conceive.
What if I can't have a baby?[br]Did you think about that?
I led a pretty wild life. All that sex[br]and drinking. Maybe I can't conceive.
-How much sex and drinking?[br]-That's not the point.
You brought it up.[br]How would we know for sure?
I don't know.[br]I'd have to have an exam.
Then let's call[br]and schedule something.
I have to talk to you.
-What?[br]-Nothing.
You said you wanted to talk.
I changed my mind.
What are you thinking?
-Who?[br]-You.
What are you thinking right now?
I don't remember.
It's not like the world will stop[br]spinning if I can't have a child.
There's such a thing as adoption.
That's a viable alternative.
What are you thinking now?
That you're telling me[br]you can't have a baby.
Is that all you're thinking?
Let me think.
Yeah.
I want to have a child.
I'm as into having a child as you are.
I'm getting this vibe from you,[br]this vibe that says...
...l'm holding out on you,[br]or I don't want it as much as you do.
Whether I can have a child[br]or if I can't...
...there has to be more[br]to this relationship.
Like maybe some communication.
And a little feeling,[br]which is not what I'm getting.
I suggest you start opening up[br]and stop pressuring me about the baby.
Because at this point, I'm ready to buy[br]a baby and shove it up your ass.
This might be a good time...
...to sit next to me[br]and try to comfort me.
You might want to consider[br]putting your arm around me.
Maybe you should try[br]to put some feeling into it.
Not that kind of feeling!
Jesus, Harold!
At times like this,[br]I feel like I don't know you.
You don't. Maybe that's why[br]you're having that feeling.
What?
You don't really know me. You don't.
I don't know what to say.
Why don't you try talking to me[br]like a human being?
I have to take a little walk.[br]I'll be right back.
Why are you drinking?
When we met, she liked that[br]I didn't talk about myself.
Now she wants to know[br]everything I'm thinking!
-Who?[br]-Susan! It's a living hell!
Perry at work turned in[br]my third-quarter report...
...and claimed the work was his.[br]What if he gets that promotion?
I'm this close to taking off[br]the penis and coming home!
You will not. Your penis[br]is staying right where it is.
-How's it working?[br]-It's a major pain in the ass.
-They installed it too far back?[br]-No, it hums.
We'll work on it.[br]You're here to make adjustments.
She thinks she might not[br]be able to have a baby.
What will I do if she can't?
I've got 4 million men[br]waiting for you to succeed.
If this woman can't have a baby,[br]find one who can.
All right, I'll cheat on my wife.
I don't know what that means.[br]I want you to complete your mission.
Fine. I'll get someone else pregnant.
Stop drinking.
And I'll get on your penis right away.
Could you say that a little louder?
Just put it in triplicate,[br]give it to-- Wait, hang on.
Hang on! Hello?
Randy, just talk. I can hear you.
Arizona West 771 ?
The same kind of jolt?
How many jolts were there?
Listen to me![br]Do you have a passenger list there?
Is there a Harold Anderson onboard?
There is?
What a coincidence.
I'm an alien from another planet.
Really?
Yeah. Somewhere[br]way the hell out there.
How come you don't have a head[br]like a pear with the big eyes?
You know, there's a lot of aliens.[br]We're not the only ones.
Those big-head guys scare me.[br]I wouldn't want to bump into one.
I hear they perform anal probes.[br]How primitive is that technology?
"We came 6 trillion miles[br]to study your ass.
We're proctologists from space."
Could I have another one here?
What's it all about?
Yeah, go ahead and rest.
Hey, Helen.
-Harold.[br]-Hey!
Helen, right?
Yeah. Who's your friend?
My personal shopper. Unfortunately,[br]she only knows how to buy booze.
I think I'll bum one of her[br]cigarettes. Think she'll miss it?
I don't think she'd miss a limb.
Light me.
Thanks.
So how's work?
Bank stuff. Nothing exciting.
Nothing exciting?[br]I wouldn't say that.
I've loved numbers and math[br]ever since I was a little girl.
I find it fascinating.
You get to deal with[br]all that money all day.
Just thinking about it makes me hot.
You're making a noise.
That's my penis.
It hums.
Guess it doesn't know the words.
I could teach it a few.
-What's the matter?[br]-Nothing.
Damn it!
Goddamn it, come on!
Damn it!
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I can do whatever you need.[br]What do you need?
I need to go home.
To your wife?
Don't tell me you feel guilty.
Guilty?
Just when you're found[br]With your chin on the ground
There's a lot to be learned
So look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant
Can't move a rubber tree plant
But he's got high hopes
He's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie
In the sky hopes
Congratulations, Dad! We're pregnant!
I don't believe it. I did it!
I helped.
Now you can't leave me.
-Morning, Melanie.[br]-Morning.
-Jessie, how are the kids?[br]-Great.
Dave, I can tell from the look[br]on your face you got some last night.
Good man.
Morning, Harold. I heard[br]the good news. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I've thought about that promotion.[br]I hope you haven't made up your mind.
It's between you and Perry. His[br]third-quarter report was a knockout.
-You seen Perry?[br]-He's in the vault.
-Thank you.[br]-You're welcome.
So you see the balance of power[br]changing in the Middle East.
It has to, because a high percentage[br]of lsraelis practice birth control...
... whereas a high percentage[br]of people in Arab nations do not.
I've heard this theory, but it[br]sounds a bit crazy, even paranoid.
Your interpretation of it[br]might be paranoid...
...but the fact is,[br]Arabs are having more children.
In a couple of generations...
... they'll be able to control the[br]voting in lsrael, hence, take over.
So they're getting control[br]from within?
That's the idea.
I think I got it.[br]I think I know why he's here.
What are you doing?
-I'm leaving.[br]-You're leaving?
I found this in your bottom drawer[br]under your winter pants.
That's not for your eyes.
Why do you have a picture of[br]a naked man touching himself...
...in your winter pants drawer?
It's not a man. That's the alien.
Oh, the alien.
The alienlbanker.
I don't know what I'll do[br]if you tell me you're gay.
I'm not gay. I'm tracking an alien.[br]He's here to have sex with our women.
His penis hums.
It sounds like that heater[br]in our timeshare at Deer Valley.
I'm not making this up![br]I'll prove everything!
Oh, my God. You've done it again!
It's always like this.[br]You get obsessed with things.
Anything to avoid intimacy!
You lost your first wife to golf,[br]your second because of other women!
You were one of them.
Golf I can understand.[br]Women I can understand.
But this?[br]Aliens having sex with people?
How does that make me feel?
Tell me you're having an affair with a[br]beautiful stripper instead of a man...
...so I can at least[br]look at myself in the mirror!
Baby, I swear I'm not.
This is not what I want my life to be.
I think Helen's having an affair.
What makes you think that?
I found a belt in my bedroom[br]that wasn't mine.
-Sure it's not yours?[br]-Positive. It was Armani.
Only queers wear Armani.[br]I think he did her in the shower.
-The curtain was ripped.[br]-Maybe she slipped.
Fisk walked into the vault yesterday.
Two seconds earlier,[br]he would've caught me and Rita.
Did you tell Fisk I was in the vault?
-You fucking my wife?[br]-No. And no!
You sure?
Why would I do that? To get even[br]with you for giving Fisk my report?
Where does that come from?
What did I do to deserve that...
...other than extend[br]the hand of friendship?
-After everything I've done for you?[br]-What have you done for me?
What have I done?[br]What have I done for you?
Did I not take you to the place[br]where you met your wife?
-Sorry.[br]-It's okay.
Sorry.
Jeez, just try to relax![br]You are wound as tight as a drum!
Do us both a favour, okay?
I'll be in the vault.[br]If you see Fisk, cover for me.
Asshole.
Not you, sir.
They try the reverse to Specca.
Has some running room.
Cuts it back inside,[br]but the pursuit will catch up.
That's Tim Schaefer, the cornerback,[br]chasing him out of bounds.
Hi.
Hi, Dad.
Hi.
-You want to go fool around?[br]-Fourth quarter.
Is there something wrong?
No.
Why?
I hope I'm not going to say this.
I am.
You're more distant since I got[br]pregnant. Or is it my hormones?
-I think it's your hormones.[br]-I don't think so.
-What are you talking about?[br]-You haven't touched me in weeks.
-Turning that off?[br]-I'm turning the sound up.
Let me.
Maybe I haven't touched you as much...
...but that's no reason[br]to destroy the remote. Come on.
Where are you going?
To buy a new remote,[br]or we'll have to keep getting up.
Excuse me. We have plans.[br]Or have you forgotten?
-We have plans?[br]-Yes.
I was thinking about[br]looking at cribs for the baby.
-You didn't tell me that.[br]-I'm telling you now.
Don't let me hold you up.[br]Go get your precious remote.
We won't worry about the crib.
The baby can sleep in a drawer for[br]the first year of its life. Just go.
-What are you doing?[br]-You said go.
Bye.
It's a universal remote.
It comes with codes[br]for every TV and VCR.
You punch in the code for your[br]equipment and you're in business.
-Yes. Modern technology.[br]-You said it.
-What do you think of "Aaron"?[br]-Who's Aaron?
No, for the baby if it's a boy.
You said you were six weeks pregnant?
Something wrong?
Who are you calling?
Tom, could you come in here?
I'm sure it's nothing to be[br]alarmed about. Have you had pain...
...or any other[br]out-of-the-ordinary symptoms?
No, not a single problem.[br]Not even morning sickness.
Look at this.
Looks like a perfectly formed[br]5-month-old fetus.
She's at six weeks.
I'm scared.
He said it was healthy.[br]That's the important thing.
-Did you see rosemary's Baby?[br]-Rosemary who?
-No, it's--[br]-You need to rest. Just sit down.
-Thanks.[br]-No problem.
Easy. Easy.
-Thanks.[br]-There you go.
Don't.
Thank you all so much.
-Congratulations.[br]-Thank you, Hank.
Hey, Anderson!
You're late. It's 1 1 :00.
I'll let it slide, as it's[br]my first day as vice president.
-You got the promotion?[br]-And you didn't.
There's always five years from now.[br]Champagne?
Harold, don't take it so hard.
-Do I smell tears?[br]-What is your fucking problem?
You stole my report.
You have sex with a coworker[br]during office hours.
You got the promotion,[br]which means you're blowing the boss.
I've met some pathetic humans[br]in my life, but you take the cake!
Like you're better. I knew it was you[br]who sent Fisk to the vault.
The Armani belt was yours, you prick!
You wouldn't bang other people's wives[br]if your old lady wasn't a drunk!
You're crazy!
I don't remember hitting him.
He was talking, and I was feeling[br]l-don't-know-what...
...because he got the promotion[br]and he stole my work.
He'll make more money than me,[br]and we have a baby on the way.
I hit him.[br]I don't know who I am anymore.
You're being too hard on yourself.[br]You're just human, that's all.
Shit, I'm bleeding.
No, you're not. You're crying.
-I love the way you look at the stars.[br]-I was just looking.
No, there's something different.
When most people look,[br]they look all over.
You're always focused, like you[br]look at the same one every time.
I feel so much better[br]when I'm with you.
That's the nicest thing[br]you've ever said to me.
I didn't say it to be nice.[br]It's just a fact.
That's even nicer, I guess.
I'm sorry about that whole thing[br]with the remote.
That's okay.
Are you gonna make love to me?
I believe so.
I'm pregnant.
I know.
-I don't know what the problem is.[br]-You have a problem listening to me.
-Stop being so stubborn.[br]-I'm not stubborn.
-Why are you here?[br]-Let's buy this house.
-What?[br]-Why not?
It's a beautiful house.[br]It's perfect for the baby.
-You can't be serious.[br]-I am. I'm dead serious.
We won't need this anymore.
-I don't believe this![br]-Let's take a look.
This is going to be so great.
Look, our cactus.
-I couldn't even imagine this![br]-I don't either.
Universal domination.
Taking over from the inside[br]through deception and fraud.
I believe in what[br]I'm saying 1 1 0 percent.
So this person is here to have sex.
Correct.
Did they run out of pussy[br]on his planet?
It sounds insane, but I have[br]passenger lists of all flights...
...that experienced[br]the same turbulence.
Harold Anderson was[br]on all these flights.
Explain that, and you won't hear[br]any more from me about this subject.
It's too small. Try raising[br]your hands over your head.
How often do you raise your hands[br]higher than this?
-It's perfect.[br]-No, I'll exchange it.
Your turn. I got you a present.
Open it.
All right.
The crib!
This is the one I wanted.
This one's for the baby, but maybe[br]you can both squeeze into it.
Oh, God.
What's wrong?
I'm being ripped apart!
It's okay. Hang on.
Stop driving so fast.
-I thought you wanted me to hurry.[br]-I do, but slow down!
God!
-Is this pain normal?[br]-Yes.
This pain is normal.[br]That's a good sign.
Shut up, asshole!
She's fine.
-They're not home.[br]-The Andersons?
They're at the hospital[br]having their baby.
I love babies.
Shit. Which hospital?
She told me a couple of weeks ago.
-It's a woman's name.[br]-Think.
St. Agnes!
No, wait. That's my name.
It was St. Agatha's.
Come on.
Give us another push, Susan.
Why are so many people here?
Considering the unusual nature[br]of your pregnancy...
...l thought we should have[br]specialists on hand.
-Should that make me feel better?[br]-BP's dropping.
We'll have to do a C-section.
-God help me.[br]-Hold it!
I see the head.
Keep pushing, Susan.[br]Give me some pushes.
Please. Please.
-What's happening?[br]-One second.
All right, suction here, please.
-Oh, God, I can't hear my baby.[br]-I can't see anything.
This is the strangest,[br]most incredible....
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson...
...say hello to your completely[br]healthy, new baby boy.
Don't tell anyone about[br]this three-month pregnancy.
Everyone will want one.
You okay?
We had him. We made this.[br]This is us!
It's a miracle.
I can't wait to see him again.
You were so cute in the delivery room.
I'll always remember your face[br]when they handed him to you.
I want you to remember that.
What's wrong?
Harold, what is it?
I have to leave.
Leave the hospital?
Yeah.
When will you be back?
I'm not coming back.
What?
I don't want to go. I have to.
You're not coming back?
No. Maybe I should've just left.
This seems worse.
-Can I help you?[br]-Harold Anderson?
His wife is having a baby.
They're in the maternity wing,[br]in the delivery room.
You can't go in there, sir![br]Sir, you are not allowed in there!
Get out. Get the hell away from me.
I don't believe it. I did it again!
I did it again!
I know you're angry.
You coward! Two minutes with[br]your child and you're scared shitless.
Get him out! Get him out of here!
Get out!
Get out!
-I need to talk to Harold Anderson.[br]-Is he in the military?
-Where is he?[br]-Wife's here. He's gone.
-Can I talk to her?[br]-Not a good time.
If you find him,[br]give him a kick in the pants.
Soon as the baby's born,[br]he leaves his wife.
What kind of person is that?
He's going back.[br]I know where he is.
Excuse me, chief. Merry Christmas.
I'm looking for a passenger.[br]Harold Anderson, usual spelling.
We're just about to push away.
So they gave her a C-section.
Dr. Weitzman, we've got a problem.
-What is it?[br]-It's about the Anderson baby.
The captain has turned off[br]the "fasten seat belt" sign.
For your safety and the safety[br]of those around you...
... we suggest you remain seated[br]with your seat belt fastened.
Thank you and enjoy your flight.
Excuse me. I need to get by.
Why is it you pack what you need[br]where you can't get it?
Why are the aisles so narrow?
Do I look like fucking Andy Rooney?[br]Get out of the way!
Excuse me.
Watch your back. Coming through.
Watch your back.[br]Excuse me. Coming through.
No, no, I'm okay.[br]I don't need anything.
Just a mild sedative.
It'll help keep you calm[br]while you recuperate.
I know you've had some bad news, and[br]believe me, I hate to give you more.
We believe that your husband[br]has taken the baby.
We've contacted the authorities.
I'm fired?
-You're just taking your sabbatical.[br]-That will bring you to retirement.
So I'm fired.
No, you're taking a sabbatical,[br]and then you're retiring.
I saw him walk into the lavatory.[br]When I opened the door, he was gone.
Are you aware of what you're saying?
Just enjoy your time off.
Rest.
Bastard. Bastard!
I have to go buy[br]a remote control for the TV set.
Don't let me stop you.[br]Have a wonderful time.
I want to shop for baby clothes,[br]but we won't worry about that.
The baby can go naked[br]the first year of its life. Go.
Go.
So I go?
No, you don't go.[br]See, that's the interesting thing.
But she told me to go.
There's a whole layer here[br]you're missing.
Now you know what I had to deal with.[br]Take your seat.
This isn't easy,[br]so don't beat yourself up over it.
What does that mean?
Just sit down.
I've...
...reprogrammed the computer[br]to more accurately represent...
...what you'll deal with on Earth.
If you look for an overriding[br]logic or rationality...
...remember it's Earth[br]we're dealing with.
-I guess you don't like my friends.[br]-I like them.
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's wrong with you?
If you don't talk,[br]how will I know what's wrong?
You gotta open up.[br]You gotta communica--
I guess you don't like my friends.
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's wrong with you?
If you don't talk,[br]how will I know what's wrong?
I mean, you've gotta com--
It goes on and on like that for hours.
Human relationships are filled[br]with conflict.
The whole planet is filled with[br]conflict, which isn't a bad thing.
Through conflict[br]we learn about ourselves.
I don't understand this.
Questions?
I see some confused faces.
You see...
...on our planet,[br]we have no emotion or conflicts...
...so we've never had[br]to look inward at ourselves.
That helped us become a technological,[br]intellectual force in the universe...
...but I really think it's a dead end.
To be honest with you, I question[br]why we're taking over Earth.
Why make them like us, when[br]in fact we can learn from them?
And they can remind us[br]of who we were before--
Excuse me.
Why does Graydon want to see me?
If you don't talk to me,[br]I won't know what's wrong.
Hey, my baby! That's my baby.
Wait a minute.[br]What's my baby doing here? Stop.
Wait a minute. Stop!
You can't pollute the others.
-Why's my son here?[br]-You're raising your voice.
You bet I am.[br]You never told me you'd take the baby.
Did you tell anyone who you were[br]and why you were there?
-A woman in a bar.[br]-We took care of her.
Anyone else?[br]Anyone you told will be disposed of.
Why are we taking over Earth?[br]How much do we need?
Is that what it's about? More?
I'm sending you[br]to the purification centre.
Take him. I don't want him to[br]remember his time there or the baby.
Get out of my way!
Get back! Put your weapons down.
Put your weapons down.[br]You're scaring the baby.
See? See what you did? I told you[br]you were scaring the baby.
Turn that thing off!
Turn it off? You're the one who[br]got it started. You turn it off.
Turn it off.
This thing will blow.[br]That's what they do.
This is how it starts. It gets worse[br]and worse, and then they explode.
There'll be baby all over the place.
That's my boy.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Just please let me know[br]as soon as you hear anything.
Somebody spotted a man in Michigan.
Matches Harold's description,[br]and he was carrying a baby.
Hi.
Hi, Liz. Alison.
-He's fine.[br]-You bastard!
He's fine.
Oh, God.
Do you have any idea...
...what I've been through[br]in the last two days? Any clue?
I'm sure it's been awful.[br]That's why I brought him back.
How could you take him?[br]How could you do this?
-How, Harold?[br]-I didn't.
-Then who did?[br]-Not me.
Why would I expect you to tell[br]the truth at this point?
How sick am l?
Would you take him?
I'll be right there.
I have to know[br]how you could do this to me.
-How, Harold?[br]-I'll tell you the truth.
-All right.[br]-I will.
I can wait. Go ahead.
I'm an alien from another planet.
I was sent here to impregnate[br]a woman, then go back.
Graydon, the leader, came[br]and took the baby without telling me.
So I stole the baby back.
And now I'm here.[br]Is there any way we can start over?
Is there a history of[br]mental illness in your family?
I care about you.
-Our son should be with his mother.[br]-This is my son.
This is my son. This is not our son.
There's no " us" anymore,[br]so there can't be any "our."
I'm calling the police now.
-I can prove I'm an alien.[br]-Really?
I can make a bright light[br]come out of my nose.
That must be handy when[br]you can't find a flashlight.
I can show you. Or you can take[br]my word for it and trust me.
Trust you?
Trust you?[br]I should trust a man that--
I thought I did[br]everything right this time.
But no, I married an alien[br]from another planet.
I could never give you[br]what you want. I'm not human.
I could never understand what love is.
I hope, as time goes by,[br]you'll be able to forgive me.
Goodbye.
Well, well, well, I was right.[br]I wasn't crazy. I was right.
Congratulations.
-My wife didn't believe me.[br]-Mine didn't believe me either.
Don't get me started.
What will you do now? Take me in?
To where? My bosses fired me.
I could give a rat's ass about them.
I had to know the truth for me.[br]As a man.
I hear you.
What was the plan?[br]World domination, right?
-Isn't it always?[br]-Tell me about it.
I'm really in Dutch with the wife[br]about this whole deal.
If you show her that nose-light thing,[br]it'd get me out of the doghouse.
-My pleasure.[br]-Great. Let's go.
No one's going anywhere.
-Who's this guy?[br]-This is the leader of my planet.
No shit.
You've placed us in a very[br]difficult position. Come with me.
I don't know what[br]your thing is with him...
...but he's gotta go[br]see my wife first, okay?
You appear intelligent, but when you[br]open your mouth, the effect is spoiled.
You might want to drop that.
Fool. I have a highly evolved brain[br]that can block intense pain...
...and also heal any injury[br]within a matter of seconds.
You cannot hurt me.
I had a feeling that heal-any-injury[br]thing was bullshit.
-Who's that?[br]-Graydon, the leader of my planet.
-Is he dead?[br]-Yeah. He just killed him.
I have to talk to you about something.
I should probably run along.
I was just wondering if[br]it'd be okay if, you know....
Can I have him?
I don't see why not.
Excuse me.
Great. Nice meeting both of you.[br]Take care.
To be clear, this really was[br]the leader of your planet, right?
If it's your insurance agent,[br]I'm in deep shit.
You're okay, man.
Thanks.
I got an alien, I got an alien!
You know what you said[br]about not knowing what love is?
Well, I don't know either.
Really?
No, but you married me.[br]We had a child.
You rescued him[br]and brought him back to me...
...and then told me the truth[br]about who you really are.
Maybe that's your way[br]of saying you love me?
I don't know.
Me too.
Let us celebrate[br]with Susan and Harold...
...as they renew their marriage vows.
Let this also be a time for[br]the rest of us to reflect upon...
...and make a renewed spiritual[br]commitment to our own vows and unions.
Harold and Susan have written[br]their own vows.
Harold, would you like to start?
Susan, when I married you the first[br]time, I did it to get into your pants.
Now I'm doing it because I want to[br]spend my life getting into your pants.
Thank you for marrying me.
And I will do everything possible[br]to make you and our new son...
Aaron.
...Aaron, very happy.
-That was beautiful.[br]-Thank you.
And now you, Susan.
Harold, meeting you taught me the[br]universe is one screwed-up place...
...where everyone's trying[br]to work out their problems.
But I'm honoured to work them out[br]with you, because I think I love you.
Very cosmic.
And with that, I again[br]pronounce you man and wife.
You may now kiss.
That was great.
-That was the wedding I always wanted.[br]-I know.
What a perfect day.
Your friends seem nice.
I didn't want to bring this up[br]until after the ceremony...
...but they want me[br]to be leader of the planet.
-You're kidding.[br]-No.
-What did you say?[br]-I told them I had to talk to you.
That's quite an honour.[br]I'm proud of you.
Thanks. But it means[br]we'd have to move there.
I could commute,[br]but that's a long commute.
All my friends are here.
Who? Liz and Alison[br]and what's-her-name?
-Why do you have to do that?[br]-Sorry.
I know nothing about your planet. I[br]don't know what the schools are like.
We're 1 000 years ahead.[br]What do you think they're like?
You're going too fast for the baby.
Don't start. The baby was fine[br]in the transporter chamber.
Four solar systems,[br]I never heard a peep.
Okay, I'll commute.
Oh, Christ! Turn that thing off.
Previously on Enterprise
We don't have a complete casualty list yet ... but so far the news isn't good.
Five people are confirmed dead, dozens wounded.
If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating my species.
You'll be eliminating your own!
Do you have any idea why they released you?
I think I may have gotten through to one of them.
Degra.
We were told the Reptilians attempted to build a bio-weapon.
Who told you this?
We've also learned that they were building this bio-weapon in the past on Earth.
When I was exposed to trellium it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for.
I discovered I was able to access certain emotions.
I wanted more.
I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream.
You must have known it was dangerous.
Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.
Elizabeth, get out of there!
We're in bad shape...
I can't deny that.
But we're still in one piece.
Enterprise is a tough ship.
She took more than anyone could ask her to, and then some.
And so have all of you.
I wanted to say thank you.
I only wish I could thank the 18 crewmen who were lost.
Like you, they understood how important our mission is... and they accepted the risks.
We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find,... with no one to rely on but ourselves.
But we're going to succeed...
To accomplish our mission... for everyone on Earth who's relying on us... and for the 18.
We managed to get into Sections Six and Seven on C-Deck.
We found Taylor and Kamata.
That accounts for everyone.
What's our status on weapons?
Mr. Reed has both... forward phase-cannons back on-line in addition to the aft torpedo launchers.
Hull plating is up to 80%.
That'll have to do.
We could wait-- hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs.
Degra's message was clear-- we're to meet him ten hours from now.
And I don't intend to be late.
Maybe that's what he's counting on.
Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking our wounds.
I've made my decision.
We have got a lot of work to do.
I suggest we get to it.
Aye, sir.
Commander...
Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?
She was an EPS control specialist... a damn good one.
I'd like you to write a letter to her family.
She worked on Rostov's team.
I can ask him.
I asked you.
I'm barely holding the ship together.
I don't have time to sit down and write a letter.
It doesn't have to be long, ... but her family deserves to know what happened to her.
Understood.
You're busy.
I'll come back. have a seat.
I'll have to use a hand-scanner.
The Imaging Chamber is still off-line.
Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here.
He said the Armory was a "higher priority."
We'll see how low a priority I am the next time he burns his fingers on a plasma conduit.
You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?
None.
I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system... hardly worth mentioning.
That's good news.
What is it?
These emotions... have grown more difficult to control.
My usual techniques for suppressing them haven't been effective.
On Earth, there's a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing... a magical creature called a "genie" from a bottle.
Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in.
Are you saying these emotions may never subside?
You used trellium for three months.
It caused significant damage to your neural pathways.
You may have to learn to live with these emotions.
We're approaching the coordinates, Captain, right on schedule.
No ships out there, sir.
Hoshi?
Scanning all frequencies.
Nothing so far.
Maybe they're running late.
Tactical alert!
It's a spatial anomaly.
We've entered a dense field.
Tucker to the Bridge!
This is not the best time for this!
Stand by, Trip.
Reports of injuries on B-Deck.
No one's out there, sir.
-Get us out of here.
-Aye, sir.
Captain.
We're receiving a transmission.
It's Degra and he's telling us to follow him.
-Stay with him, Travis.
- Aye, sir.
They're hailing us.
I see you found my message.
We have a great deal to discuss, and I don't have much time.
Come aboard my ship.
If we'd left you with the Reptilians, they would have killed you.
Degra arranged for the Aquatics to return you to your ship.
Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise?
The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.
You've taking a big risk.
If you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake.
Everything I've told you is true.
Forgive me, ... but the Council will need more than your word.
Perhaps you can demonstrate your ability to time travel.
That might be a bit difficult.
But if you come aboard my ship,
I can give you all the proof you want.
Very well.
But there are some things I want to know first.
Such as?
When will your weapon be launched?
The precise date hasn't been determined yet.
Weeks...
-days?
- That's up to the Council.
I'm trying to help you, .... but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed while I'm doing it.
The weapon won't be launched for several days.
Show us your proof... and we'll do what we can to stop it.
What did you get?
Pepperoni pizza.
Don't worry.
You can pick the pepperoni off.
Damage reports?
No.
The Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family.
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
Their daughter's dead.
You really think they'll care what I have to say?
When was the last time you slept?
I don't know.
Not since the attack.
That was two days ago.
All right, then.
Two days.
Go to your quarters.
Get some sleep.
Believe me, I'd love to.
I could order you.
I don't have time.
We're full of holes, the only thing keeping us flying is a stolen warp coil, ... and now I got to write this letter.
What the hell...?
Tucker to Engineering!
Shut down the auxiliary coolant lines between Sections...
-12 and 14 on E-deck!
-Aye, sir.
Tucker to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency on E-deck, Section 12.
On my way, Commander.
Reactor pressure's holding.
Good thing I wasn't taking a nap.
Damron.
Friend of yours?
A colleague... of sorts.
They're the ones we found on Earth... in the past.
And this is the result of your "finding" them?
They were about to release a bio-weapon that would have decimated the population.
The Reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species.
Damron and his team disappeared shortly after the Council rejected his proposal.
Apparently, they decided to go ahead without your Council's approval.
But, fortunately, you were able to stop them by traveling back through time.
I already told you... we had help... just like they did.
This proves nothing.
How do we know he didn't capture them in the present?
You need more evidence?
They had this with them.
We destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample of it in stasis.
This appears to be Xindi technology,... but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it.
Have them come aboard... perform whatever tests they'd like.
This proves nothing except the Reptilians disobeyed the Council.
Which comes as no great surprise.
But you also claim that ... we've been misled by trans-dimensional aliens.
Where is your evidence of that?
Come with me.
There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket.
-That's why it ruptured!
-I ran a pressure test.
Tell it to the man lying in Sick Bay!
-Test them again-- all of them!
-Aye, sir.
-Commander?
-I'm a little busy, Doc.
So it seems.
I understand you haven't slept since the attack.
T'Pol tattling on me now?
She's worried about you.
Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and baling wire.
Has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?
Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I got to get back to work.
I don't believe so.
Come again.
I'm relieving you of duty.
You will go to your quarters, and not return to your post before 05:00 tomorrow.
-Six hours?
- Please don't make me involve Security.
Archer to Doctor Phlox.
-Yes, Captain?
-I need you in Sick Bay.
I'll be right there.
Well, Commander?
I could give you two hours.
I believe the number was six.
If I'm gone longer than three, there may not be a ship here when I get back.
Four.
Not a minute less.
Done.
And remind me never to buy a car from you.
-Captain's waiting for you.
- I'm aware of that. good night, then.
We found him adrift.
Do you recognize his species?
We've met one of them.
What caused his death?
Some kind of cellular degeneration.
It started the moment he was taken off his ship.
Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.
I believe our universe was toxic to him.
His species evolved in a different dimension, ... under a different set of physical laws.
He simply couldn't exist here.
That's why his species built the Spheres-- to make our space more compatible for themselves.
We believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding.
And, if they are, you're saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.
For any of us.
We're destined to form an alliance to stop them.
But, if you destroy Earth, that'll never happen.
You'll be condemning your own race to extinction.
Trouble sleeping, sir?
Taylor?
You were killed.
This whole section decompressed.
Did you find a sealed compartment?
No.
Then how...?
You're dead... and I'm dreaming.
The letter...
How's it going?
I got as far as...
"I regret to inform you..."
That's a little dry, sir.
You're not real.
You don't have to call me "sir."
So what's the problem?
The letter doesn't have to be long.
The Captain told you that.
You can't think of anything.
I wish it was that simple.
I served on Enterprise for three years.
You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your team.
Captain Brody was pretty angry at you.
I forgot about that.
You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday.
You will.
You would have.
Then tell my parents that.
Tell them about the practical jokes
Rostov used to play on me.
Or that one time I found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed.
Tell them how hard I worked.
How much you liked me.
Why can't you look at me?
Just remember me.
Is that asking so much?
Yes.
Why?
Why?
These tests only confirm the equipment belonged ...
-to the Reptilians.
-There's also evidence of chronometric distortion... time travel.
The readings could have been fabricated.
You're determined not to trust him.
No more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says.
Now, I admit Archer's evidence is intriguing, ... but we barely know this human.
Our contact from the future has helped us many times.
She brought this Council together.
And you've never wondered whether she might have an agenda of her own?
I am not a fool, Degra.
All I'm saying is that it'll take.... a little more than a few chronometric distortions to turn the Council against her.
Captain Archer is expecting me.
More evidence?
He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres.
Degra...
I know you've had doubts about building the weapon.
Don't let them cloud your judgment.
We've been working to reconstruct our database.
The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much.
Try it now.
I'm going to reset the optical subprocessors.
That might clear it up.
When we slipped through your detection grid, ... we got a look at the weapon you're building.
An impressive piece of engineering.
Hell, it'd take at least... a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet.
You know, I'd like to see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth.
Increase the data resolution.
I assume you were watching the attack.
Calculating the blast yields.
Boy.
You must have been pretty damn excited.
I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida.
That's the name of one of the places you destroyed.
Florida.
Commander.
Did you actually see the cities burning, the houses... the people being vaporized?
You know, I had a sister there.
Commander.
How are the repairs coming?
Just need a few more minutes, Captain.
Why don't you join me in my Ready Room until they're finished.
Let's stick to the job at hand.
Aye, sir.
The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust.
It's one of the warp plasma conduits.
It must have ruptured when our sensors were off-line.
Perhaps my crew can help.
We'll handle it.
We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.
The flow regulators are damaged.
There are manual cut-offs here and here, but we can only access it from outside.
That's very close to the fire.
We don't have a choice.
If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor.
Get going.
-I could use a hand.
-That would be me, sir.
Open that panel and
I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.
-Where's the other valve?
-Over there.
I need to open the emergency bypass ports first.
You can't close your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary line.
Commander.
I have a problem.
I think the heat's warped the metal.
The panel won't open.
Use your plasma torch.
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm releasing the interlocks on the first port.
This is going to take a while.
Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm.
The manifold pressure is increasing.
We have less than six minutes before the fire reaches the reactor shielding.
Archer to Trip.
You've got six minutes.
Understood.
You okay, Malcolm?
I'm almost there.
Captain.
The temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit is over 44 degrees.
He's too close to the fire.
His EV suit can't compensate.
Malcolm.
Get back to the airlock.
I'm almost finished, Captain.
That's an order.
Get inside, Malcolm.
I can wrap it up.
I'm opening the primary bypass port.
Two more to go, and... we're in business!
46 degrees.
Malcolm.
I'm sorry, sir.
You're breaking up
Get inside, Malcolm! I can finish.
There's no time.
Do what you have to do so I can shut this down!
A few more seconds! I'm purging the last port.
The forward valve is closed.
Okay, Malcolm, clockwise 90 degrees.
Nice work, Malcolm.
Malcolm? Malcolm!
Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
Meet us in the airlock.
We need to bring his body temperature down.
Let's geto Sick Bay.
I hope he'll be all right.
What's one more dead human to you?
Trip...
You had no problem killing seven million of us.
But seven million and one is more than you can...
-stomach?
-That's enough.
-I guess even Xindi have their limits.
-I said, that's enough!
Aye, aye, sir.
We've determined there are 59 of them.
78 at our last count.
Seventy-eight?
We've had more time to study them than you have.
I apologize for Mister Tucker.
I never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what I'd done.
At the time, I thought the attack was necessary to save my people.
I know.
Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before.
That's right.
Our "escape" from prison together.
The Reptilians are correct about one thing, Captain.
You have an impressive facility for deception.
Erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust.
Probably not.
They're all connected by a subspace energy grid.
Unfortunately our data on the Spheres' interiors is extremely limited.
Maybe I can help.
How did you get this?
The first Sphere we came across was damaged.
There was a breach in the outer shell.
We've never been able to gain access to one.
These scans are remarkably detailed for a military vessel.
Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.
If we're successful, it will be again.
Computer, begin recording.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
I regret to inform you that your daughter was killed in the line of duty.
She was a fine engineer, ... and she died performing her duties.
Computer, stop recording.
Delete that.
Computer, start again.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.
As Jane's commanding officer,... it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death.
She was a diligent engineer.
Very hard-working...
Tactical Alert.
All hands to stations.
Report.
We've detected a ship.
They just passed through the cloaking barrier.
On screen.
Reptilians.
-Did you invite anyone else?
-We masked our warp trail.
I don't know how they found us.
With the humans?
I suppose the Council authorized these negotiations.
No one authorized the development of a bio-weapon,... but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one.
Undock from the human vessel immediately.
He intends to seize the human vessel.
He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.
We don't stand a chance against them, not in the shape we're in.
What kind of weapons do you have?
You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?
If we work together, we might be able to disable them.
They're charging weapons.
Are you familiar with the design of that ship?
I did some work on their power systems.
Then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons.
Their ship is heavily armored.
At least we'd stand a chance.
Those Reptilians are Xindi.
You're asking me to attack my own people.
Proceed to our starboard docking port.
I want your word that my crew won't be punished.
You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.
He's nearly reached the Reptilians.
He's knocked out their shield generators.
Fire.
Evasive maneuvers.
Keep firing. Target their weapons.
Their weapons are down.
Degra was spot on.
He knew exactly where to hit them.
Open a channel to Degra.
- Sir!
- He's charging weapons.
The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.
Captain, Degra's hailing us.
They would've contacted the Council and exposed our alliance.
I had no choice.
Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here.
Repair crews are starting tomorrow.
I thought I'd try and get 'em some power.
These assemblies are all fused together.
I've spent the last hour trying to isolate the damaged relays.
You might find this useful.
Portable power cells.
Courtesy of our new Xindi friends?
Damn neighborly of them.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Not unless you can resurrect the dead.
Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this kind of thing.
But Taylor's not here, is she?
And neither is Crewman Kamata or Ensign Marcel... or a dozen others.
So forgive me... if I don't want the damn power cells!
We found Taylor over there outside her quarters.
She was probably trying to get to her station.
If she'd made it a few more meters, ..
I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter.
Every time I start,...
I hear myself saying what a fine young woman she was, how... smart and full of potential... and I realize ...
I'm not thinking about Taylor at all,...
I'm thinking about Elizabeth.
So many people dead...
I tried not to see her any differently than the other seven million.
So I've spent the last nine months... trying to pretend she was just another victim.
But she's my sister, T'Pol... my baby sister.
I envy you Vulcans.
You think that the loss of a colleague ... or friend doesn't affect us?
It does.
But if we give in to those emotions, they overwhelm us.
You're the ones to be envied.
You need to speak to the Council.
With the evidence you've shown me they'll have no choice... but to take us seriously.
Even the Reptilians?
I'm more concerned about the Aquatics.
They can be somewhat enigmatic.
But if we can sway them, we'll have a majority on our side.
These are the coordinates for the Council chamber.
This is nearly a dozen light years away.
-It'll take us weeks to get there.
-There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor.
It's located in a nebula less than half a light year from here.
That will show your helmsman how to get through it.
I'll meet you at the far end in three days.
Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?
I'll do everything I can to delay it.
Use caution when you enter the nebula.
A hostile species is known to prey on ships that approach it.
Thanks for the warning.
See you in three days.
Three days.
Computer, begin recording.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor,... by the time you get this, ...
Starfleet will have already told you about Jane.
Since I worked so closely with her, ...
I wanted to add my personal condolences.
I have to confess,
I've been putting off writing this for a while.
I convinced myself that... my duties on Enterprise took precedence.
But the truth is...
I didn't want to face the fact that someone so young, ... with so much promise... could just be gone.
But I'm facing it now ... and I find myself thinking how important she was to me.
She was a great engineer... and she was my friend.
She won't be forgotten.
Good-bye, Elizabeth.

Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.
Just a moment, let me see[br]if she's in.
Hello.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Joey! Have you ever[br]seen me ecstatic?
- No.[br]- Well, here it is.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I'm June Gable, and I play Estelle.
And she is the agent of Joey.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I already got you an audition[br]for Another World.
All right!
"Cab Driver Number 2"?
You're welcome.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I came in, and I auditioned.
And when I came in, I kind of came in[br]like myself, and they were like:
You know.
I said, "Am I boring you?"[br]I felt terrible.
And then he said, "Just go away[br]and do something outrageous with it."
So I went away and came back,[br]and, in fact...
...I'm on my way to the studio,[br]and I have her with me.
And I just got this.
I came back to the audition wearing[br]a fat suit and a bunch of cigarettes.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- What I meant was...[br]- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
No.
[COLF]&H0080FF
And a big sandwich. You know,[br]one of those deli sandwiches...
...with corned beef and a million things,[br]and I'm dripping.
At one point I took the cigarette[br]and put it out in the sandwich...
...and they said, "That's it."
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Well, well, well.
Joey Tribbiani.
So you came back, huh?
They think they can do better,[br]but they all...
...come crawling back to Estelle.
What are you talking about?
I never left you.[br]You've always been my agent.
- Really?[br]- Yeah.
Oh, well, no harm no foul.
[COLF]&H0080FF
There's a history to her.[br]She was an ex-showgirl.
She's very old.[br]I don't think...
I don't even know if anybody knows[br]how old I have her in my head.
She's in her 80s,[br]and tottering, really.
But she's out there, you know.
She puts that makeup on[br]like she's still 20.
She thinks she looks fabulous.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
So you're not mad at me[br]for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me!
Look at me!
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
[COLF]&H0080FF
At the beginning of every show[br]they do a football huddle.
They hold each other[br]and they support each other.
And this has been there[br]since the beginning.
And you have to realize,[br]with most shows like this...
...with that much fame and fortune[br]and success and power and money...
...coming at you, I watch these people[br]not only handle it...
...and go through the ups and downs,[br]but support each other.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
We're not actors.
What a shame!
Because with her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I have great admiration for them[br]for sticking with each other.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
These are for you.
Welcome to our country.
Thank you. I'm from New York!
It still smells like monkey in there.
Well, that saves us the conversation.
You know, in some cultures, having a[br]third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts,[br]and women dance naked around you.
Are any of these cultures,[br]perchance, in the Tri-State area?
[COLF]&H0080FF
My name is Lauren Tom, and I play Julie,[br]Ross' girlfriend.
Well, the first in the long line[br]of many what would become exes.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- Bye.[br]- Bye.
- See you later, Rach.[br]- Bye-bye, Julie.
[COLF]&H0080FF
Julie, I think, was just,[br]like, a very nice gal.
And the humor[br]that the writers created...
...was the fact that Rachel[br]was gonna think she was a bitch.
Can I say that on the DVD?
No matter how she acted[br]or what she did...
...because to her[br]she was the other woman.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
You're losing your apron.[br]Let me get it.
- There you go.[br]- Thank you.
What a bitch!
[COLF]&H0080FF
You know, I've had[br]kind of a long career by now...
...because this is, like,[br]what, six, seven years later.
And I've done Greek tragedies[br]and Shakespeare...
...and feature films and all these things.[br]But the only thing...
...people want to know is what[br]was it like kissing David Schwimmer.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- Julie?[br]- Yeah?
Sorry, you had a[br]paleontologist on your face.
[COLF]&H0080FF
Just to answer your question,[br]it was great. He's a good kisser.
To put everyone's minds at ease.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
You know, you are so amazing.[br]Is there anything you don't know?
Julie's so smart![br]Julie's so special!
[COLF]&H0080FF
I've had so many young Asian girls[br]come up to me...
...and say that was the first role model[br]that they've had...
...on such a widespread TV show,[br]where they got to see an Asian girl...
...who wasn't speaking with an accent,[br]who was American...
...and who was desirable[br]and sexy and funny.
And it was just a great way for me[br]to feel like I've done something...
...that I'm proud of.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I just want you to know[br]I wasn't always like this.
Before I met your sister, I was a[br]normal guy who sold cellular phones.
So, what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it'd be[br]like to kiss you.
- Really?[br]- No.
You don't have to[br]walk behind me anymore.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I'm David Arquette,[br]and I played Phoebe's stalker.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
That's it.
Hey, you, J. Crew guy.
Why have you been following me?
All week, everywhere I look,[br]there's you.
You wouldn't return my calls.[br]You sent back my letters.
- What?[br]- One more chance, Ursula. Please.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I'm not sure how I was cast in this role.
I had just worked[br]with Courtney on Scream.
Maybe she threw my name in there.[br]I'm not sure.
A little nepotism.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great.[br]You're doing great.
Going strong. Keep going.
These are my night-vision goggles.
This is the book I pretend to read[br]when I'm watching her in the park.
And these are Mad Libs.[br]They're just for fun.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I don't normally do sitcoms,[br]but I do a lot...
...of peeping Tom action,[br]so I was prepared for this part.
No, I did a sitcom for a year[br]that really went nowhere...
...but I had a little bit[br]of experience with it.
But that's a whole different deal[br]when it comes to Friends...
...because it's so established,[br]and they're all so wonderful at doing it.
You're kind of nervous going in there.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- Phoebe?[br]- Yes? Yes.
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just here looking[br]for my... My...
...part of an old sandwich.[br]Here it is!
Were you following me?
Perhaps.
[COLF]&H0080FF
One of my fondest memories...
...is sneaking into Courtney's[br]dressing room.
I guess I was sort of really[br]behind the scenes...
...kind of stalking Courtney, actually.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
This is my fiancée...
...Mrs. Knight.
Forget it. It's ruined.
Never say that. If you can't[br]get it out, cut around the stain...
...add a little lace,[br]you make a stylish throw.
I came down to ask you a big favor.
Don't tell me you want to keep[br]more stuff in my uterus.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I went in and auditioned[br]for Alice Knight.
She was a home-ec teacher[br]and was in love...
...with a student in high school.
A senior, I think he was...[br]Please, God, he was a senior.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I was in her home-ec class.
He was my best student.
She was my best teacher.
[COLF]&H0080FF
At the time, though,[br]it was a one-shot deal.
And then when Lisa Kudrow[br]got pregnant...
...they had to come up[br]with a storyline...
...so they used me and Vanni,[br]which I'm very grateful for.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
You're too young...
...to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I had not met Giovanni[br]until we started work.
And all we did was make out.[br]I mean, that's all we did.
And I just remember standing[br]on the set, and he's 12. He's 12.
He's 12 years old.
And I'm looking at him,[br]and I'm going:
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
And we're standing there,[br]and Giovanni looks at me and he goes:
"Okay, you know[br]what we're gonna do?"
And I went, "No."
And he went:
"I'll throw you on the table[br]and make out with you.
We have to do it,[br]and we have to be committed.
And then it's over,[br]and then it's done."
And, boom, I'm on the table[br]and we're making out.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
A year ago, I didn't know I had[br]a brother. Now I have a sister!
Oh, it's so great.
I don't think I could've done it[br]with anybody else...
...because he just sort of...[br]The 12-year-old took charge.
And I was grateful.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
We talked about[br]just living together...
...but we want to have kids right away.
Oh, my God!
Great!
[COLF]&H0080FF
I know audiences reacted[br]really well to the storyline.
And the audience at that show[br]is incredible...
...because they know[br]the characters so well.
They anticipate a little bit.[br]You don't have to do too much.
And they're right there with you.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
We would be truly honored[br]if you would name the other boy baby.
That's so nice!
Cougar.
You think about it.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I have probably done the most pilots[br]and been on the most failed sitcoms...
...of anybody we know.
And it was interesting to see[br]how it's done right.
And they would get copies[br]of the episodes...
...and watch them in a dressing room.
I mean, and this was year four.
So they would actually sit down[br]and watch the tapes and study them...
...which I had never seen done before.[br]And I thought:
"Oh, my God, they actually know what's[br]going on. They actually work at it."
I was very impressed.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
So tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.
Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.
- The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]- What was it?
The Three Losers.
I'm your mother.
- I'm sorry I'm late.[br]- That's okay.
I had time to finish[br]glazing my nipples.
You go all out[br]when you're expecting company.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I played Phoebe's mother...
...on Friends,[br]which is a totally fictitious show...
...about people being friends.
You know, I've had a lot of friends[br]in my life, groups of friends.
And I always... In five or six people[br]that are friends together...
...there's always one person[br]that's chubby.
And I noticed in this show[br]there's no people that are chubby...
...because, you know, it's TV.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I mean, I like pizza.
I like pizza!
Wait, I like the Beatles.
Oh, my God![br]So do I.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I was chosen to play Phoebe's mother...
...because apparently there are[br]some similarities in us.
I didn't see it myself,[br]and neither did she.
Although, people have told me[br]that I should sue her...
...for stealing my bits,[br]you know, my act.
But I let it go. I passed the baton, I go,[br]"Here, you do this, you be the ditz."
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Oh, it's me! It's me!
- I didn't wanna make any noise![br]- Then don't break in!
[COLF]&H0080FF
I once got a review that said,[br]"If a brick could sing...
...it would sound like Teri Garr."
And now Lisa's picking up, as I say,[br]the baton and running with it.
She sounds like a brick.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom
Thank you. Thank you.
I invite all of you to count[br]the colors in your bedroom.
[COLF]&H0080FF
In order for Phoebe to be my daughter,[br]I would've had to have her...
...when I was 12.
So, I mean, the age difference[br]is outrageous.
So I took the part anyway,[br]just to be nice to them.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Remember how I said[br]Lilly, Frank and I were close?
We were very close.
How close?
The three of us[br]were kind of a couple.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I'm not used to playing[br]such sexually liberated...
In fact, Marta asked me[br]to do this part in the nude...
...which I was in shock, because it's TV.
But I think on Friends[br]they do a lot of weird stuff.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I was working on my pottery.
Oh, I didn't know[br]that you did pot.
Mostly nudes. It combines[br]my two passions: Pottery and erotica.
Erottery!
[COLF]&H0080FF
So I said, "No, I'll do it,[br]but I won't do it in the nude.
But I will do the part[br]about the erotic erottery."
Was I supposed to be sexually[br]liberated? I didn't even know that.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- You're a potato?[br]- Well, I'm a spud...?
- And the antenna... You're Spud-nik![br]- Yes!
Marry her.
I don't want something so complicated.
But, Mona, what relationship[br]is not complicated?
We all have our baggage.[br]You must too.
Why else would you still be single?
I'm so gonna leave right now.
- I've got a surprise for you.[br]- You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I'm Bonnie Somerville,[br]and I played Mona, Ross' girlfriend.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I'm Monica's older brother.
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Hello, "Mona from her restaurant."
[COLF]&H0080FF
Mona was the coolest girlfriend[br]in the history of the world.
Because, first of all,[br]he had another girl pregnant, Rachel...
...and Mona still dated him.[br]She put up with so much crap.
People still come up to me going:
"You were the best girlfriend ever![br]He should be with you."
I'm like, "I wish, you know.[br]I wish that we had done more episodes."
But she was like the nonexistent woman[br]in real life...
...because she never complained,[br]she didn't ask for anything.
"Your ex is pregnant[br]with your baby, that's fine.
We'll still date, we'll still hang out.[br]It's cool."
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Ross is too nice to say it,[br]but this is his apartment.
We need boundaries, so why don't[br]you go back to your place?
But, Mona, I live here.
Happy Valentine's Day!
[COLF]&H0080FF
David Schwimmer directed[br]a couple that I did.
And, I think, one of the[br]funniest episodes on television...
...that he did was the one where Mona[br]asked, "Where's this relationship going?"
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I love spending time with you.[br]I hope we're moving forward.
We should talk about that,[br]don't you think?
[COLF]&H0080FF
Everyone I know says that that episode[br]was just brilliant. He was amazing.
It was great working with him[br]as a director...
...because here's an experienced guy[br]who knows what he's doing.
But he was so into my ideas[br]and what I thought, so it was awesome.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
Now, I know what you're thinking.[br]Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
But you're not getting any younger.
No, I mean, not you. Not you.[br]You are getting younger!
You're getting younger by the second.[br]What's your secret?
[COLF]&H0080FF
David Schwimmer created this character,[br]works hard at it, and brings him to life.
And he's just so talented.[br]I learned a lot from watching him.
Like facial expressions, you know.
He's the best at facial expressions.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
- First, you got Rachel pregnant![br]- You got her pregnant?
- Who did?[br]- You did!
Yes, but it was just a one-night thing.[br]It meant nothing.
Oh? Really?[br]My daughter means nothing?
No, sir. She means a lot to me.[br]I love Rachel.
- What?[br]- But not that way.
I'm not in love.[br]I love her like a friend.
[COLF]&H0080FF
I've worked on a lot of shows.[br]I've worked on canceled shows, pilots.
And the one thing that I can't believe[br]about the Friends set...
...and I'm sure others can attest to this,[br]their craft service, their food, is insane.
[COLF]&HFFFFFF
I brought you back a present.
You didn't have to...
Saltwater taffy?!
[COLF]&H0080FF
So I would do the show, and then I'd[br]get off work and I'd tell my friends:
"You can't believe[br]what they had to eat tonight!"
Because it's exciting. It's...[br]You know, they have everything there.
I sound like I'm this poor kid[br]from the wrong side of the tracks...
...and I got to eat[br]every tape-night on Friends.
But it is quite a spread there.
It was just so much fun to go to work[br]every day and to laugh.
What more could you ask for in a job?
It's a little, you know...[br]It's kind of amazing that way.
When you walk in there,[br]you just get the feeling...
...that everything is there for you.
And everybody's creative,[br]everybody's brilliant at what they do.
Everybody's trying to make[br]the best product that they can.
They have such wonderful writers...
...that you don't really[br]have to do anything...
...except make their words come alive.
It's such a well-oiled machine[br]that you work on it...
...and then you just want every[br]experience you have...
...to be that wonderful.
Here's the thing, I've worked[br]with Spielberg and Scorsese...
...Francis Coppola...
...many top directors.
And coming on the set of Friends...
...was a complete[br]and total comedown.
No, just kidding.
Chris, what is it?
I love you so much.
Don't you love me any more?
I've made progress, and I recognise that.
But my wife, who I can't even convince to come here...
Anything can set her off.
It could be the phone ringing, something on the news, something online, going shopping maybe.
A commemorative T-shirt in the window.
It just puts her right back in that place, and it's like all my progress - ripped away.
And I'm right back there with her.
I feel totally the opposite. I see the TV and I see the Internet and I see those T-shirts and I feel nothing. The more I see the images, the less I feel, the less I believe that it's real.
I mean, I think I'm supposed to feel something by now. Don't you think so?
Linda, this is Chris Kelvin.
I'm returning your call.
I have two times available this week;
7am on Tuesday or 6.15pm on Thursday.
You can leave a message if either of those times are good for you. Thank you.
Well, I know that's not true.
Because I know you, and I know it's not true.
Good. I'm glad.
All right.
Let's pick this up on Wednesday.
Can I help you?
We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin.
Chris...
I can't imagine what you must be thinking, getting a message like this.
I apologise if it seems melodramatic, but you are the only person I can... I can trust...
in the situation.
I need your help.
I need you to come to Solaris, Chris.
I don't know how to describe what we are experiencing up here.
We can't even agree amongst ourselves what is... what is happening, or...
what to do about it.
I suppose the... the most obvious solution would be to leave.
But none of us want to. That's why you're getting this... this bizarre request.
I...
I told the crew that your background and experiences
made you the... the ideal candidate for this job.
Don't worry. I didn't elaborate.
But it's true.
So, anyway...
I, uh... I hope you will come to Solaris, Chris.
L- I think you need to.
You will see what I mean.
I wish I could be more specific about all of this, but... you know.
People are listening.
You can imagine the distress
Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA.
Why not send in the security force?
We did. We lost contact as they were approaching Solaris.
They haven't returned.
There must be some sort of on-board Al system.
They shut it down.
The company was hoping to solve this problem without involving a civilian.
Obviously these are extreme circumstances.
Some preparation is involved but you shouldn't have any trouble.
The flight itself is fully automated.
You'll be asleep most of the trip.
We feel confident that if you board the ship, you can negotiate their safe return.
Is that what everybody wants?
Of course.
Find the probability of F.
OK, stop. Go back.
Snow.
Kelvin, is it?
Yeah.
Kelvin. Right. Oh, man.
Sorry about that, Kelvin.
Names, you know, just...
For some reason. It, uh...
Yeah. Uh...
Well, uh, you wanna come in?
I'm fine.
Whose blood is that, leading to the lab?
Yeah. Blood.
How 'bout that?
Katarn.
He, um... Yeah.
Security forces showed up and he just took off, and they...
Yeah. Put a hole in his pot.
What happened to Gibarian?
Yeah.
It was a suicide.
Who found him?
I found him.
What happened to Rhys?
Yeah, now, Rhys w... Huh.
We don't know, because the thing is, he kind of... disappeared.
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.
- How did he disappear?
- Exactly.
Don't know. We do know that he's not on the ship, uh, and that's... that's all we know.
Where's Dr Gordon?
Dr Gordon. She is in her room, and, um...
Dr Gordon won't let you in her room.
Can you tell me what's happening here?
I could tell you what's happening, but, uh...
I don't know if that'd really tell you what's happening.
I just wanna talk to you.
You have to give me your word you won't try to come in.
All right.
Well?
- What happened to Gibarian?
- Didn't you talk to Snow?
- I wanted to hear your version.
- There isn't any version.
He killed himself.
Why haven't you come home?
What happened here?
What did you find?
- Who are you representing?
- I'm the last effort to recover this mission, before they abandon this ship and everyone on board.
Until it starts happening to you, there's really no point in discussing it.
Hey.
Hey!
- Who else is here?
- Who else is here?
I saw a boy.
Gibarian's son.
- Michael.
- How is that possible?
I think that's why you're here.
I want a formal interview with you and Gordon. I'll need your help with her.
Yeah. All right.
Um...
How much sleep do you need, Kelvin?
- How much sleep?
- Yeah.
- How long can you go without sleep?
- Depends.
Well, when you do go to sleep,
I find I sleep much better with the door locked.
I was with the project when it was still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA.
I was trained in physics.
I was sent here to assess the economic potential of Solaris.
Whether or not it was a viable commercial property or possible energy source.
I was still compiling data when this shit started happening.
Did you run any tests on the food, air, water?
I checked it 50 times. There are no signs of contaminants or psychotropic compounds.
How about you? How are you doing?
Depression.
Along with bouts of hypomania and primary insomnia.
Suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, shock, fatigue, denial...
- Not unusual, given the circumstances.
- I know.
All right. Now, what can you tell me about what's happening here?
Just that I want it to stop, but I want to stop it.
If I can stop it that means
I'm smarter than it is.
You know you can go home, walk away from all of this.
I can guarantee it.
Yeah.
The thing is... Man, I would kill to go back there. I'd... kill.
But Gordon?
Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know?
So, um...
But I'll see what I can do.
We take off into the cosmos.
Ready for anything - solitude, hardship, exhaustion...
death.
We're proud of ourselves.
But when you think about it, our enthusiasm's a sham.
We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.
So, anyway... How's the spawn?
Oh, good, good. He cries and shits in his pants every two hours.
I know the feeling.
When are you leaving?
- We've been postponed again.
- I didn't hear that.
Nobody knows yet.
The governments are looking for a buyer. I wish we could tell people what's happening.
You can tell me. I'm a doctor.
Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris, the most interesting thing is it, um...
Well, it seems to be reacting.
Almost like it knows it's being observed.
We can't explain it.
Are you listening to me? Chris?
- So anyway...
- So anyway. Sorry.
Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit tricky but, um, I guess she's worthwhile.
Maybe she needs a shrink.
Don't we all?
Don't blow it.
You start.
I did.
Really?
All right, I'm gonna resist the impulse to ask you about the door knob.
- Do you always resist your impulses?
- Not always.
Try poetry.
"And death shall have no dominion."
Mm. Thomas.
It's not a very happy poem, though.
Well, you didn't seem very happy when I saw you on the train.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
It's early.
Goddammit!
I'm awake.
Yes.
How are you here?
How are you here?
How do you mean?
Where do you think you are?
Where do you think you are right now?
At home.
Where is home?
With you, where we live.
And do you remember being anywhere else with me? Being together anywhere else?
- Our apartment.
- Describe it.
It's dark. It's very very dark.
And there are no paintings on the wall.
No pictures anywhere.
No pictures on the fridge, even, which I always thought was a bit strange.
Do you remember where we first saw each other?
On a train.
Chris...
I'm so happy to see you.
I love you so much.
Don't you love me any more?
I have to check out something with the crew.
No! No!
- Don't leave me! Don't leave me!
- Why? Why?
- Why?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why are you sitting over there?
Can I come and sit with you?
Hey.
What was that?
Yeah.
How 'bout that?
Still workin' on that.
Where's your visitor?
I don't know. Stopped appearing.
- Who's your visitor?
- My brother.
Who was it?
My wife.
Dead?
So what was her name?
Will she come back?
Do you want her to?
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't. It's crap.
- Only one way to find out.
You can submit it to someone and see if they publish it.
That's not an indication of anything.
So no one else's opinion counts except for yours?
- Yeah.
- That's insane.
- "That's" insane.
- I like it.
Brings out the red in my eyes.
So, did you show it to your father?
- Yeah.
- And?
- And he liked it.
- What'd he say?
- He said he liked it.
- Well...
He's a man who doesn't pass out compliments very easily. That's something.
- What's that tell you?
- Can we talk about something else? Please?
All right. When do you wanna get hitched?
Every time I bring it up you make a joke about it, and...
I know, I know. That's pathet...
I'm sorry. It's just...
It-it's so difficult for me.
Still? Is it something that I'm not doing?
No. No, no, no. That's not the issue at all.
Because, you know, if you keep putting this off, then in 15 or 20 years
I'm just gonna stop asking.
- Well, I've got ages, then.
- Mm.
So apart from the poem that you quoted to me the night that we met...
The night that you were hitting on me.
Oh, I don't think so.
What's your favourite poem?
My favourite Dylan Thomas poem?
Well, there's the, uh...
Listen to this. We have, uh... There's the...
Well, there's the one he's most famous for, which starts, um...
- "There was a young man from Nantucket..."
- I knew it. I just...
I'm not marrying you.
You...
Oh, you're marrying me.
Would we have to invite anyone else?
There should be witnesses.
Otherwise nobody'd believe us.
When I was little I had this imaginary friend called Mikashelli, who used to live under the wallpaper in the corner of the room.
I used to go and visit. I had a very intense relationship. I was an only child.
As you know. And, um... that was like my sibling.
That was the person I used to have battles with and fights with and everything.
What happened progressively over the next few years is that my mother stopped communicating with me.
She only communicated with me as
Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters, and we didn't have conversations any more.
- I mean, admittedly, she was certifiable.
- Mm-hm.
But, um, yeah, that was a strange way to grow up.
You know, you're with the right man.
I so know that. That's what's great.
Cos, man...
Rheya...
It's me.
It's me.
I don't remember that.
When did you get that?
I got it just before I came here.
- Was I with you?
- No.
I don't actually remember anything.
I only remember you.
Have I been ill?
Sort of.
And we've been apart?
- Yes.
- For how long?
A few years.
- Were you alone?
- Yes.
Was that difficult?
It was easier than being with someone else.
Did you think about me?
Yes.
What is that, out there?
Solaris.
Oh, my God, yes.
I can't remember how I got here.
Did I come here with you?
- I don't know how you got here.
- What do you mean?
I woke up and you were here.
So I wasn't here yesterday?
No.
Right.
Getting dressed?
People will notice tonight.
If you're not there, Rheya, people will notice.
I can put up with all of it, you know? The mood swings, the... restlessness,
changing jobs every three months, all of it.
What I can't put up with is you hiding from me.
Why do you do that?
Do you wanna be here?
Cos I need help. I can't do this...
I can't "continue" to do this on my own.
The idea of God was dreamed up by man.
A silly animal with a small brain.
Even the limits that we put on it are human limits.
- It designs, it creates...
- No, I'm talking about a higher intelligence.
No, hold it. You're talking about something else - a man in a white beard.
Ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.
Aren't we all?
Rheya, given all the elements of the known universe and enough time, our existence is inevitable.
It's no more mysterious than trees or sharks.
We're a mathematical probability, and that's all.
How do you explain that of all the creatures on this planet, only we are conscious of our own mortality?
You can't explain that.
That doesn't mean there's a God.
Maybe religion has been bred into us.
The pope is a wonderful woman...
- Excuse me.
- A nihilistic shrink. Is there a school?
Not yet.
You see? He's funny, at least.
Where you been?
Away from those fucking people.
They're my friends.
Yeah.
Chris, I've got to talk to you.
What's wrong?
I don't understand what's happening.
And if I do understand what's happening then I don't think I can handle it.
What do you mean?
I mean...
I mean...
I'm not the person I remember.
Or at least I'm not sure I am.
I mean, l-I do remember things, but I don't remember being there.
I don't remember experiencing those things.
My... I...
I mean, I'm really really... really really trying to understand.
And-and these, uh...
These... these strange thoughts keep coming into my head, and I...
I don't know where they're coming from, and I'm scared.
Um...
And l-I don't know what's happening.
L-I don't know what's happening.
- What do you think's happening?
- You need rest.
- No...
- Take that.
You don't understand. Because
I don't think that I can live with this.
I don't understand what is happening now.
I mean, this-this-this... I remember this.
I have a memory of it. But...
But I don't. I don't remember seeing it. I don't...
I don't remember being there. I...
Rheya, it's fatigue. It's fatigue.
It's brought on by stress.
It's fatigue. That's why you take this.
Right. Yeah.
No, it is. You'll be fine. I'll talk to Gordon and Snow. We'll go back to Earth.
- Mm-hm.
- And you're gonna be fine.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
- I'm coming right back.
- Right.
- Are you gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
This door locks from the inside.
- Yeah.
- You'll be perfectly safe in here.
Yeah.
You sure you're gonna be all right?
You-you keep asking me that, actually. Yes. Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Stay here.
I was so worried, man.
About this guy. But then you show up, and I'm even more-more worried about you.
Particularly after the first... when you sent the first one away.
Yeah, you were pretty...
Pretty, uh... You deserved to be as freaked out as you were.
She can never know anything about that. Ever. You understand?
No, no, no, no, no.
I wonder if they can get pregnant.
Where are you going?
- I can't be here.
- What?
You should have told me.
- It wouldn't have made any difference.
- Really?
Chris, I had to!
Obviously I had to. You know that about me.
I had no idea you'd react like this. Listen!
Listen to me.
What's changed?
I didn't even know you wanted one.
Yeah, why would I want one?
Why would I want a child, or anything that would bring life into this house?!
- No, no, Chris. No. No.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
No, Chris, you don't understand.
You have to understand. I had no idea you felt like that. I won't make it without you.
- Then you won't make it.
- Chris, no, please!
- Let go of me!
- No...
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
You wanna change Gordon's mind.
What if Gordon and your wife, right, your very nice wife... She's nice, right?
Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice.
They get together, right?
Cos I'm thinkin'... women, right?
Right now we got woman and woman, right?
If we get "women", you know, together on the same team and all that shit, what happens?
You know what happens.
All kinds of shit you can't explain happens.
Like the... But good shit, you know?
Mysterious, but good. Usually very good.
Things get solved, you know?
That's my plan, you know?
What do you... think?
I'll have to think about that.
"And death shall have no dominion."
"Dead men naked, they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon. "
"When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot. "
"Though they go mad they shall be sane."
"Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again. "
"Though lovers be lost love shall not."
"And death shall have no dominion."
You found me.
I came back for you.
I came back that day.
I'm sorry.
All right. Enough hypothesising.
The visitors. Are they or are they not made of subatomic particles?
Subatomic particles... I'm not sure.
What do you think?
I think... probably.
Stabilised by what?
Guess.
I don't know. Maybe... a Higgs field.
So... if we created a negative Higgs field and bombarded them with Higgs antibosons they might disintegrate?
Maybe. You know, it would take a lot of power.
Shut down all the noncritical ship functions.
This is just a theory, you know? We could be wrong.
- Let's find out.
- We'll take the findings back to Earth.
What if they follow us back?
What if what's happening here happened on Earth on a mass scale?
Don't you see that as a problem?
I think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign.
It's driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other.
Is that really why you think they're here?
Given its resources it could have done anything, including destroy us.
Meet me in the lab in an hour.
- I won't let you.
- How you gonna stop us?
- How you gonna stop me taking her back?
- Shall we pick up the other one on the way?
Shouldn't be too hard. We could chart its course. Only take a day or so.
Chris, what's she talking about?
- Nothing.
- Her oxygen might have run out.
Maybe they don't need any.
Chris, what are they talking about?
You didn't tell her?
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
- You came before.
- He got rid of you.
You what?
I sent you away.
Into space.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No. Rheya...
Don't touch me.
Rheya, I didn't understand.
Rheya. Rheya. Hey.
- Don't.
- No. No. No. Don't.
What were you trying to accomplish with that, exactly?
Kelvin...
It is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them.
You're being manipulated.
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her around. That's why she's not ugly.
She's a mirror that reflects part of your mind. You provide the formula.
- She's alive.
- She is not human.
Try to understand that, if you can understand anything.
What about your visitor? The one you're so ready to destroy without hesitation?
Who is it? "What" is it?
Does it feel? Can it touch?
Does it speak?
We are in a situation that is beyond morality. Hm?
Your wife is dead.
How do you know? How can you be definitive about a construct you do not understand?
She's a copy. A facsimile.
And she's seducing you all over again.
You're sick.
We are not taking her back with us.
Leave the light off.
You think you're dreaming me.
You're not Gibarian.
No?
Who am I, then?
- A puppet.
- And you're not?
Well, maybe you're my puppet.
But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.
That's the puppet's dream - being human.
Why did you kill yourself?
It seemed like a good idea at the time. Now I think I made a mistake.
- What about your son?
- That's not my son. My son is on Earth.
And that's not your wife.
They are part of Solaris. Remember that.
What does Solaris want from us?
Why do you think it has to want something?
This is why you have to leave.
If you keep thinking there is a solution... you'll die here.
I can't leave her.
I'll figure it out.
Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
There are no answers.
Only choices.
Rheya?
Rheya?
Rheya?
Rheya?
Gordon!
- What happened?
- She drank liquid oxygen.
She's dead.
No.
I never get used to them.
These... resurrections.
Oh, no.
No.
Why'd you do that?
Rheya?
Don't call me that.
There are two components.
A high-energy proton accelerator and a matter phase modulator.
By adjusting the tuning frequency I get an enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz and an almost pure beam at 160GHz.
I used it on mine.
What happens?
They disappear, back where they came from.
It's what she wants.
I won't let her do it.
She'll come to me when you're asleep.
Then I won't sleep.
Don't you see?
I came from your memory of her.
That's the problem. I'm not a whole person.
In your memory you get to control everything.
So even if you remember something wrong,
I am predetermined to carry it out.
I'm suicidal because that's how you remember me.
My voice sounds the way it does because that's how you remember it.
I don't believe that we're predetermined to relive our past.
I think that we can choose to do it differently.
The day I left and you said you wouldn't make it, I didn't hear you because I was angry.
This is my chance to undo that mistake.
And I need you to help me.
But am I really Rheya?
I don't know any more.
All I see is you.
All I see is you.
It created me.
And yet I can't communicate with it.
It must hear me, though.
It must know what's happening to me.
And you and I, we would have to have some kind of... an arrangement, some kind of... unspoken understanding... that I'm not really a human being.
No, Rheya.
Chris...
Chris, I wish you would just let them use the device on me.
And then you can go back to Earth and you can tell everybody all about Solaris.
No.
It's the only solution that makes any sense.
We could never have a life together on Earth, Chris.
You know that.
It would be impossible.
And this? What kind of life is this?
Trapped here.
It's not a life.
I don't know what to call it.
It's what we have.
It's enough for me.
You need to rest.
You're going to make yourself ill.
- I don't care.
- Just lie down for a moment.
Please, Chris.
You have to rest.
You know I'm not human so I don't understand what you're afraid of.
Of course you can use the device.
It's not murder. You said that yourself.
You're the one who had the idea in the first place.
Chris doesn't trust me. He...
Chris, don't blame Gordon.
It's not her fault. I begged her to do it.
It's better this way.
I found the suicide note.
I went through your things.
The page torn from the book of poems.
And I realised...
I'm not her.
I'm not Rheya.
I know you loved me, though.
I know that. I felt that.
And I love you.
I wish we could just live inside that feeling forever.
Maybe there's a place where we can.
But I know it's not on Earth.
And it's not on this ship.
That's all I can say right now.
- You killed her!
- Not her. It.
- It's murder!
- Kelvin, she begged me. It wasn't painful.
- She'll be back!
- No.
- Why would you let her do it?!
- Kelvin!
It's not human!
Whatever it is, it's not human, and I'm threatened by that.
And I wanna win. I want humans to win.
Whose side are you on?
- What are you doing?
- Putting the Al back online. I'm going home.
Gordon.
Gordon!
- I knew it.
- How long you think he's been dead?
Hard to say because of the cold.
He attacked me.
There I am. Somehow, there I am.
And I couldn't tell you how I'm there, or who I am or what's going on.
But before I can get to that, what's this over here?
Comin' at me. What... what are you tryin' to do?
Oh, I see. You're tryin' to kill me.
Yeah, confusing. I'll tell you somethin' confusing. Bingo, there you are, and my welcoming committee dropped his knife and it's good night.
And, oh, by the way, after all that I find, uh... this, uh, whoever this... I get my first good look at it and it happens to be...
I survive the first 30 seconds of this... life, whatever you wanna call it... by killing someone.
And, oh, ah, by killing someone who happens to be me.
See, most people... I would think most people in this position would be, like "This... ah."
"I don't know." However, this is at least...
This is an incredible opportunity.
This is... What if this is a gift? I'm a gift.
Hey.
I say we use the Higgs device on him.
Mm. Mm-mm.
I don't think you really have time.
Why would you say that?
Well, you know, ever since we used the famous Higgs device,
Solaris started taking on mass exponentially.
You might have noticed how we're a lot closer to it.
That would be because everything within its gravitational field - it's pulling it in.
Ah, and, yeah, sorry. By the way, the Higgs device also drained the fuel cell reactors.
Uh, if... Can I make a suggestion?
I mean, this is... You can do what you want, but I would just lock me in here really tight and take the "Athena" back.
Wear your seat belt.
Switch to internal power.
Start fuel cell operational diagnostic.
Service check on LGA.
Point and calibrate high-beam antenna.
Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby.
Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers.
Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines.
Earth.
Even the word sounded strange to me now.
Unfamiliar.
How long had I been gone?
How long had I been back?
Did it matter?
I tried to find the rhythm of the world where I used to live.
I followed the current.
I was silent and attentive.
I made a conscious effort to smile...
nod...
stand...
and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth.
I studied these gestures until they became reflexes again.
But I was haunted by the idea
that I remembered her wrong.
That somehow I was wrong about everything.
Depressurising.
Spin all turbines to standby.
Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers.
Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines.
Rheya!
Rheya?
Chris?
Chris?
Am I alive... or dead?
We don't have to think like that any more.
We're together now.
Everything we've done is forgiven.
Everything.
Ladies and gentlemen,
American Airlines is announcing... flight number 1243 to Costa Rica.
All passengers holding tickets for flight 1243... may now proceed to gate 50-B.
Come on.
Put me in with the cargo.
Sir, the 10:00 to Costa Rica is booked, but I can get you out in the morning.
Not if I'm dead, you can't.
Thank you for nothing.
Hey, watch it.
Who does he think he is, somebody important?
Sir, you forgot your keys.
- Keep 'em.
I need a vacation... real bad.
Hey, watch it!
I hope you're happy.
Sir?
I think it's time you came back to work, Dr. Dopler.
Hey, Zak!
Let's take a look at another example.
Say Amy is out for a leisurely drive in her VW bug... and along comes Eddie in his Ferrari.
Hey, come on, that could happen.
Totally.
So, you're doing 20.
Eddie's doing 220.
What does he look like when he goes by?
- I don't know. Just a blur, I guess.
Exactly. And if he was going fast enough, you wouldn't see him at all.
From Eddie's point of view, you would look as if you were standing still.
And that is a basic example... of Einstein's theory of what, Eddie?
Highway safety.
Relativity.
Relativity.
Didn't do your reading assignment?
- That's a funny story.
See, science is a discipline.
This department has trained some of the best minds in the world.
But nobody ever gets there by just coasting along.
I don't mean to sound like your father, but I take pride in my students.
I want to see them succeed. That means doing the work, being persistent and... not looking for the quick-fix, easy way out.
We'll finish up Einstein when I get back from the applied science congress.
In the meantime, you guys have a couple days off... to prepare for your midterm.
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Zak.
This is a rare honor.
Come on, I visit you at work every now and then.
But careful analysis reveals it's usually because you need something.
That's crazy.
Can you co-sign for my car?
I got the down payment together.
There's a few cars I liked at Benson's, and their lot stays open until 9::00.
Hold on a second.
Hey, Jer.
Where's my stipend on the NASA consultation?
We finished that job three months ago.
- Working on it.
So maybe we can get there around 7:00?
Dr. Gibbs, your batch is up on the mainframe. It's some pretty wild stuff.
I'll be down in a minute.
- What are you working on?
Last weekend an old student sent me a project he's working on with QT Labs.
You remember Earl Dopler. One of the best students to ever pass through here.
That freak who used to come over and eat a lot of potato salad?
He isn't a freak.
Eccentric, maybe.
Anyway, the word on this project is very hush-hush.
Let's just say that, hypothetically speaking... it were possible to accelerate your molecular structure... until the rest of the world seemed as if it were standing still.
Cool.
- It's called hypertime.
Imagine being able to perform delicate surgery between the beats of a heart.
This technology is going to revolutionize medicine, science, travel.
Speaking of travel, a car would be really nice.
So, did you download those consumer reports?
I was gonna do that before you got home, but...
Dad, you already blew me off last week.
- No, I was in a meeting with the dean.
Of course that's never happened before, right?
I want you to do your homework on this.
Let's see those safety reports.
And we'll talk about it at home.
- Does that mean we can go tonight?
It means we'll talk about it when I get home.
Good enough.
Yes!
It's very safe and a great father-son activity.
Dude, you made all this just by selling junk on your computer?
Well, one man's junk is another man's down payment, Meeker.
Start thinking outside the box, man.
- What box?
The box you're in that keeps you from seeing that this $5-an-hour job blows.
Dude, I ain't gonna be here forever.
Check it out. Bam!
Plur 102. DJ contest tomorrow night.
I'm signed up.
"Underground dance par-tay"
Yeah, that's very
"funk-fliggety" of you.
Dude, I been practicin'.
Sneaked away from the study hall.
Worked the turntables in the tech room.
Who is that?
- Hey, dude, where you been?
That's Francesca, the new girl from Venezuela.
She goes to our school?
That's gotta be good for attendance.
Tell me about it.
She has PE when I'm in Marching Band.
I get smacked every time the trombones turn to look at her.
This is perfect.
- What?
Foreign girl in a foreign land, man.
She's all lonely and vulnerable.
I read about this in Cosmo.
I gotta go talk to her.
Oh, no, you're gonna get faced.
I'm not gonna get faced, man.
Come on.
Watch and learn.
Okay.
You're gonna get faced.
Excuse me.
Do you have the time?
I mean, you go to my school, right?
I couldn't say.
What school is yours?
Jefferson. My friend watches you in PE.
I mean... you're new, right?
Yes.
Well, I'm Zak... and I thought...
I know it can be kinda lonely when you first move to a new town.
I thought maybe you needed somebody to show you around.
I see.
It's so very hard for me.
I try to be brave, exploring the town all by myself, when all I really want... is to be giving my love to the very first bozo who wants to know the time.
I read Cosmo too.
Right.
Okay, well, I'll see you in school then. Okay?
Hey, you did good, man.
I think she likes you.
Are you watching this?
He was so cute, and now he's all,
"I'm a gangsta, yo".
Yeah, I was in earlier about the Mustang.
You still have it, right?
Cool.
I will be there later tonight with the down payment.
Okay. Thank you.
What are you doing?
- This way it's more like homemade.
I want us to have a nice dinner tonight before your dad goes to his conference.
He's taking me to buy a car tonight.
- After dinner.
Mom, can I have some money?
Did you do your chores?
Have I told you lately how much I respect and admire you?
Buy a car, give money to Satan.
You're so lucky you're an only child.
Hey, Mom says we can go after dinner... which is cool because they're open till 9:00, so we should still make it.
Make what?
- The car lot.
They've got a Mustang convertible.
I'm gonna trick it out with a V-8.
ConsumerReports rated it a best buy... good reliability, decent gas mileage... and pretty good crash test scores for a convertible.
Okay, so what else have you compared it to?
Nothing.
That's the car I want.
You're not gonna prove your case by ignoring all the other data.
It's not a clinical trial, Dad.
If something's right, you gotta close your eyes, grit your teeth and hang on.
No, you gotta step back, weigh the options and make a calculated choice.
I want you to do your homework on this.
If the Mustang is the caryou want when
I get back, that's the car we'll get.
It's not gonna be there when you get back.Just come look at it tonight.
When I get back. I gotta go over Dopler's project tonight.
You haven't heard from him in a week.
- Yes, but I promised to get to it.
That's what this is about, isn't it?
This isn't about looking at other cars.
What are you talking about?
- Nothing!
You always have time foryour students and never foryour own kids.
Now he's concerned about me.
Hey, I asked you to come to this conference.
Who was it who said he was too busy?
- The Congress of Applied Science?
There's fun for the whole family.
- Stop it. Sit!
Eat.
Kelly, get off the phone.
Okay.
- Come on, you guys.
Some of history's greatest peace treaties have been signed... over green beans and beef Stroganoff.
I'm not hungry.
Zak, I promise I'll take you...
- Tell it to Dopler.
I don't know how you work in all this mess.
Honey, I was gonna fix that foryou.
I bought a new toaster a year ago.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I don't wanna leave with something like this between Zak and me either.
It's just...
He's got so much potential and, yeah, right now he can skate by... but it's gonna catch up to him.
Maybe. But he's finding his own way, George.
Just because it isn't your way doesn't mean that he's lost.
Okay, let me put this back together and I'll go up and make peace.
Okay.
Don't forget.
You know how you get down here.
No, no, I promise.
Two minutes, hon.
Come in.
Wanna talk about anything before I go?
- No, I'm good.
This is... my itinerary... and my hotel, in case you need to get in touch with me.
Thanks.
Have fun with your science friends.
What?
We'll work it out when I get back.
Mr. Gates, I don't make policy, but I do enforce it.
So they're shutting me down.
Hey, you knew it was a black ops contract.
The administration found out about it.
They want it to go away.
Well, you need to make them understand the significance of what we're doing.
Look, Gates, I supported you on this as long as I could... but they've got a point.
What if one of the Saddams of the world gets his hands on this stuff?
The fact is, he can waltz right through an entire army... plant an A-bomb in the president's bathtub... and all our smart bombs and satellites would be useless to stop him.
I'm not even finished building it... and they have me selling it on the black market?
Mr. Gates... the NSA expect your research, your equipment... the whole shooting match crated and ready for pickup on Monday.
And if I'm not ready?
We're taking it whether you're ready or not.
Restricted access requested.
Please step forward for retinal scan.
Have a nice day, Henry Gates.
You all right?
Yes. Why?
How's he doing?
- Seems okay.
But he wrote that a half hour ago.
How dramatic.
And charming.
All right.
Bring him down.
Hello, Dr. Dopler.
How are things in hypertime?
"How are things in hypertime"?
Look at me.
I've been in here a week.
It's like I've aged 20 years.
- At least 20. Maybe more.
Why don't you just kill me now?
I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary.
Besides, it's your own fault.
If you'd solved the aging glitch in the original design... we wouldn't have had to bring you back to build this.
The molecular stabilizer should reverse the aging effects in hypertime... but I'm having a little trouble with the program and...
Earl, the NSAwants all our toys in three days.
Well, they're their toys, right?
They don't know the watches workyet, and I don't intend to turn them over.
Besides, how can I enjoy the power of hypertime... if every time I use it
I end up looking old?
Like you.
I want this fixed in 48 hours.
Dude, that is impossible.
Well, then I guess
I will have to kill you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Maybe I could do it faster.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some data from a friend.
A friend?
Well, no, I mean...
I can trust this guy.
He's on the outside, but he's cool.
He's my college professor. If anybody can crack the math on this, it's him.
What data did you send him?
Well, actually, I...
I sent him a watch.
You idiot!
I want that watch back.
Mom! Zak's pants knocked over Dad's stuff!
Dad was gonna fix this for me so I could sell it. Figures.
When your father's old and gray... you're gonna regret not having a better relationship with him.
There's plenty of time for that.
Where are you guys going?
I made breakfast!
Oh, no, that's it.
Get off the bike.
Hey, "Freaker", you trippin' on some bad lunch meat?
I hear you signed up for the spin-off tonight.
Ditmar, lay off.
Yo, yo, yo,
I ain't on him, all right?
Listen up here, buddy.
Tonight it's just gonna be me and you on stage.
You aren't gonna have your little sister backing you up.
What was that? 'Cause all I hear is a crowd going, "Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!"!
This guy's hot, man!
I need to cool him off!
Later, jerk-wad.
Let's go.
I'm Dit-O. I'm spinning at Underground tonight. Wanna come?
You won't leave me hanging tonight?
- No, dude, I'll be there.
Relax.
He probably blows anyway, man.
I gotta go do something about this.
Oh, what's the matter?
¿No habla inglés?
No, it's so very hard for me.
But I try to watch and learn.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Like this!
Later, jerk-wad.
All right, make a hole, boys.
Yo, I got a hole for ya.
That's a perfectly good trash can.
Don't be throwing students at it.
Come on, both ofyou.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Move it.
- He started it!
I don't care who started it.
You finished it.
I didn't need any help.
I wasn't... I wasn't...
I was looking for my buddy's retainer in the garbage.
These band freaks always, you know...
Right. Very nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Okay, well, since I have you here...
I'd just like to apologize for being such a loseryesterday.
Only yesterday?
- No, every day.
Hey, I'll apologize for global warming if you'll give me another chance.
A cup of coffee after school.
Come on.
I'm sorry, I have plans.
- Okay, how about after your plans?
- I have more plans.
Would it be such a stretch for some of your plans to include me?
All right.
I guess we all deserve a second chance.
Here's my address.
The only thing is, I have to baby-sit my brother and sister... but you can come by around 4:00.
Okay. Yeah, 4:00.
Yeah... I mean, yeah, that's probably okay, I think.
Okay, so I'll see you then.
- Great.
I thought maybe we could spend some time by the pool while the sun's still nice.
Yeah, works for me.
Catch some rays. Great.
There's another rake over there.
Rake?
Right. Right.
When I said "second chance"...
I was thinking dinner and a movie or a cup of coffee.
I told you I had plans, and you asked if they could include you.
I did, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
- Yeah.
Look at it this way.
You go to a movie, you can't have a conversation.
You go out for coffee, there's always a lull.
This way when there's a lull, at least my leaves get raked.
Yeah, well, are you gonna do the whole thing by hand?
Yeah. My father says it develops self-discipline.
That's what people always say when they want you to do stuff for free.
I got a better idea.
Stop that!
Stop! You're supposed to be helping.
Sorry.
- Silly.
So where did you move after that?
When I was 1, we left Caracas to go to London.
Just when I was making friends, we got transferred here.
Wow, you've lived everywhere.
My dad took us to Legoland once.
Had the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower.
Don't feel bad.
At least you have a place to call home.
Yeah, I guess, but it must be pretty cool being a consul's daughter.
That makes you, like, royalty, doesn't it?
Right. I'm waited on hand and foot.
I would like to catch the dog that does this.
I was gonna make us iced cappuccinos.
Cappuccino? We don't have to paint the house or wash the car first?
No!
Here, here, I'll do that.
I'll finish up out here and you start on the caffeine.
Really?
- Yeah.
Great. Maybe we'll still have time for a swim.
Yeah?
- What time is it?
I don't know.
No, I do. Hold on.
It's...
Whatever that is.
Right.
I'll be right back.
A little coffee, a little swim.
That's what I'm talking about.
Whoa.
Go! Go! Get outta here!
You big rat! Come on!
Seriously, don't make me kickyour ass.
Whoa.
Hey, Francesca.
I think I found your troublemaker.
Whatever you guys are throwing away, it gave this guy a heart attack.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!
Oh, boy.
Get him out! Help!
Get him out!
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I swear he was dead.
What is wrong with you?
We were having such a good time.
You can't work alone for two seconds!
- I was out there for a half hour!
Half an hour?
I just walked in here.
"Hypertime exposure"!
That's weird.
Maybe you should just go.
We were gonna go swimming.
- Swimming?
You want swimming?
I'll give you swimming.
No way.
No... way.
Wow, you have nice skin.
This is weird.
How did you do that?
I have no idea.
Look, I don't know what you're up to, but out you go. Come on, out.
Come on. Out. Let's go.
Out.
Wait, wait.
Something weird is going on.
You and your rat, that's what's weird.
- No, I'm not trying to freak you out.
I just pushed this button.
That's what I'm saying.
So... you did this?
I think it was the watch.
My dad consults on these super-secret projects... and I think this is one of them.
So, your watch stops time?
No. Look.
It's moving.
Wow.
Wow.
"QT"?
That's where Dopler works.
This must be the thing my dad is helping him with.
He said something about it accelerating your molecules so fast... the rest of the world would seem like it was standing still.
I don't think time has stopped.
I think we're just moving really fast.
He said it was theoretical. I had no idea he'd actually built the thing.
Look at this.
Why did I speed up and not my brother?
- I don't know.
Let's find out.
It's about time.
Did I leave you in hypertime?
I'm sorry.
I guess for this to work we have to be touching each other.
Sooner or later all guys say that.
Now what?
Well... with such awesome power... comes awesome responsibility.
At least that's what my dad would say.
But he's not here, is he?
Where do we start?
There's that woman who's always giving me parking tickets.
Look at her. She writes them before the meter even expires.
She has offended my sense of justice.
Needs something more.
Yeah.
Whoa, perfect.
Come on.
Looks like we got our own little Picasso here.
Well, he's about to enter his blue period.
Nice nose ring.
That's Meeker's bike he's stealing.
Oh, I don't believe this.
This guy promised me that he'd hold this car for 24 hours.
Well, it's just not right to break a promise.
Shall we?
Make it so, Number One.
What? We have Star Trek in Venezuela.
- Do it.
Dude, wait up!
Don't leave me like this!
Help!
All right?
DJ Swamp!
What's the deal, DJ?
Come on!
All right?
The people have decided, baby!
DJ Swamp is the winner of this round!
Let's keep this thing goin'!
Let's get to our next two DJs!
First up, we got DJ Dit-O!
Boo!
We also got DJ Meeker!
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
- Where is he?
All right, Dit-O, it's your time to shine, baby! Let's do this!
Yeah!
What's up, Meek?
Are you ready?
You suck!
That's weak!
He really is not very smooth, is he?
No way!
I can't take this anymore.
He needs so much help.
Here, stand him up first.
Okay.
What are we doing?
A little dance lesson.
First off, let's give him a little attitude.
Get one arm while I grab the other and pull him.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
This is wrong.
This is absolutely wrong.
No, it's Swan Lake.
Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!
Go, Meeker!
How's your head?
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!
How's your head?
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!
This hypertime thing is so trippy.
I knew it wasn't me doing the moving, but I couldn't feel you guys moving me.
Actually, I think your boy Dit-O did wet his pants.
Zak, your watch is off the hook!
What we gonna do next?
Hey, let's dress Coach Wells up like Britney Spears.
Oh, man!
Why not?
Didn't you say you have to get home?
- Hey, forget that. Forget that!
Leslie Miller has a slumber party tonight.
You know she got that pool, and the girls get naked.
Or we could go to Vegas!
Go to Vegas!
Genius, hey!
We're not going anywhere.
My dad finds out I took the watch,
I'm gonna be grounded forever.
So...
Man!
It's right up here.
You gotta be kidding me.
Oh, all right, fine.
I can take a hint.
You sure you don't want me to come with you? I got this plan...
Okay, man!
See you Monday, Meeker.
Good night.
- Yeah, okay.
Y'all have fun makin' out.
Watch this.
Oh, yeah, that's funny, Zak.
That's real funny.
You're abusing your powers!
I'm gonna call the Super Friends on you!
Oh, it's on now!
I'm gonna get you for this!
So...
- So...
That didn't turn out so bad after all,
Mr. Second Chance Man.
Yeah, well, the way I figure it... if you make a bad first impression, things can only get better from there.
Right, and you take the prize on both counts.
I'd better go.
Now?
- Yeah?
At midnight my father blinks the porch light... and I turn back into a pumpkin.
Yeah, I should probably go too.
Although midnight could be a pretty long time off.
Stop that. What, do you think that magic watch is gonna get you a kiss?
I just wanted to spend more time with you.
You don't need magic.
What?
I wanted to kiss you.
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Second Chance Man.
I had fun.
Shut up! Shut up!
Who are you?
What do you people want?
Duh! They want to kill you, man.
- Why? What did I do?
Because you showed up, and you've got something that's not supposed to exist.
Now grab those wires under the dash.
Go, go, go, go!
Okay, now bite the green one.
Okay, that's not it.
Okay, strip the red wire with your teeth and touch it to the steering column.
Come on! Hurry up, man!
Just bite it!
Okay, go.
Hurry, man, they're coming!
Go!
Come on! You're gonna have to drive! Go, go, go!
He's in the van!
- Come on!
Whoa, man!
You are gonna get us killed.
This is not as easy as it looks.
- Yeah, I know, but...
Whoa!
Who are those guys?
- You don't want to know.
What were they shooting at me?
- Liquid nitrogen.
It's a quick and dirty comedown from hypertime.
The cold slows your molecular activity.
Probably faster to gnaw off my hand.
So, is it me or are they trying to kill you too?
Yeah, they're probably up for a two-fer at this point.
Hang on!
All right.
Whoa.
Give me the watch.
- No!
Give me the watch!
- Or what? You'll adjust me to death?
"Adjust me to death!"
That's great.
Give me the watch!
You crazy lunatic!
- "Crazy lunatic"? That's redundant.
Give me that! Come on!
Hey, dude!
Whatever you do, don't get it wet!
So strange.
Seems fine... although his vitals are elevated.
Oh, here he comes.
How you doing, Sleeping Beauty?
You okay? You all right?
Where'd you get the van, kid?
- Not now. Let him breathe.
Mom.
- Zak! Is he okay?
He'll be fine.
It was just a mild concussion.
How you feeling?
- Okay, I think.
Good. So you can stand trial.
- What?
Hello! You stole a van and crashed it.
Can I have his room while he's in jail? Please?
You almost got killed on that joyride.
- Honey, you had us so worried.
I don't know what got into him.
He's a good kid. Really.
Cool!
This doesn't have to go on his record, does it?
No, you don't understand.
I was in hypertime with these guys, and they were after my watch.
It's a molecular accelerator.
Here.
Oh, man. It's broken.
They're gonna kill me.
- Who?
These guys! They were in our house.
- What?
You couldn't see 'em.
They were invisible.
Oh, yeah, right.
- Here you go, sir.
I said creamer, you twit.
Is he gonna be okay?
- I can't stay here.
Nurse. Thankyou.
Oh, crap.
Come here.
Oh, he's so faking it.
- Yeah. Yeah. I am faking it.
I'm sorry I stole the van.
I would love to tell you all about it, but first I have to pee.
Come on, come on.
What are you doing?
I can't go unless there's some noise.
Come on.
Get some coffee.
- Let's go!
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Just get back here.
I've got something I want delivered to our contact at the FBI.
A little publicity should help flush out Dopler and the kid.
Because we can't kill what we can't find.
But without Dopler, how do you finish the molecular stabilizer?
Who needs the student... when the teacher is so close at hand?
Hot Skates.
Junior Associate Meeker speaking.
I need to borrow your mom's car.
What's going on?
The cops are looking for you.
Just turn around slowly.
Be cool.
You don't want to be seen with me right now.
Okay, go home and get the keys to your mom's Subaru.
What? Are you crazy?
Somebody is trying to kill me over this watch, and it doesn't even work now.
Okay, dude, but you don't need a Subaru.
What you need is the police.
I just came from the police. Look at me.
They weren't as helpful as you'd think.
I need to go to Kingston to find my dad.
He might know who these people are.
Dude, that's a six-hour drive, man.
I gotta go.
Budget cuts.
Okay, Mr. Invisible, where are you?
That's nice.
What are you doing in there?
Did you break into my house just to pee?
No, actually... to use the phone too.
What are you wearing?
I know this sounds weird... and it's the last thing you want to hear from a guy after one date, but... the cops are looking for me everywhere and I've got no place else to go.
I need to borrow some clothes and money for a bus. I promise I'll pay you back.
Okay?
- You are freaking me out.
What is going on?
- It's a long story.
The less you know, the better.
Things with the watch have gotten really twisted.
I gotta get to Kingston and find my dad, because they could be after him too.
Who is after who?
What is happening?
I don't know who they are.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.
Wait. Slow down.
Come over here and just relax.
I'm glad that you came.
I am.
But if we're gonna be friends, you have to tell me what is happening.
I told my brother I was getting the car washed, so bring it back clean.
Okay.
I can't thankyou enough.
Call me when you find him?
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
You raked my leaves.
I can't let you go alone.
He's been calling all day.
This is the first chance I've had to check my messages.
George, listen, calm down.
The police want you to stay there in case Zak calls again.
If he shows up here
I'll let you know.
If he's giving you any trouble,
I can talk to him.
Fine.
I just feel helpless, sitting here waiting.
Welcome to the club!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
I've been everywhere trying to track him down, and we couldn't reach you.
All right, let's go over your list.
Hi. I need the room number for Dr. George Gibbs.
He's here with the convention.
And you are?
In a hurry.
Yeah.
Let me see what I can do.
I never should have left with something like this between us.
Did he try to explain his behavior?
- Not really.
I mean, he rambled on a bit when he came to, but...
Oh, wait.
He said something about his watch being a molecular accelerator or something.
Molecular accelerator?
Downstairs, on the shelf above my desk, there's a box with a watch in it.
See if it's still there, will you?
- What's going on?
Just check the box, okay?
Just a minute.
Are we there?
- Yeah.
You know, I usually don't like to meet a boy's father this soon... but for you...
Do you think while we're there you can tell him taking the watch was your idea?
Dr. Gibbs?
- Yeah.
My name is Henry Gates.
I'm with QT Laboratories.
I believe we have a mutual friend,
Earl Dopler.
He tells me you're an expert on...
- Whatever this is about... it's gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm in the middle of something very important.
You certainly are.
Dad?
No payments for 12 months.
Don't wait.
The fire we reported at the old fire hall... is still burning out of control.
- Front desk.
How may I help you, Dr. Gibbs?
- Hi.
Did I check out yet?
- Not that I know of, sir.
Did I change rooms?
No.
Dr. Gibbs, is everything all right?
And in othernews, it seemed like a simple joyride in a stolen van... until the FBI linked the teenage suspect to the theft... oftop-secret government research by this man...
Dr. Earl Dopler of QT Laboratories.
That's not Dopler.
Dopler is one of my dad's students.
He's a hippie with long hair.
- Dr. Dopler is considered... armed and extremely dangerous.
Well, at least they didn't mention your name.
If you should see him or Zak Gibbs... please contact your local police department...
Okay. Okay.
I'm officially freaked out now.
We can call my dad.
He knows people from the consulate.
I know he can help.
- I'm not putting your family at risk.
It's bad enough I got you involved.
Hey, macho man,
I got me involved.
But maybe I should just call them to let them know I'm okay.
What's this yo-yo doing?
Hey! You're blocking us in!
What's he doing?
Let me out of here!
Help!
Are you okay?
You know, the first date was nice.
This one, not so much.
What was that?
I don't know.
Just stay cool.
Hi. How are you?
Ready to give me that watch?
All right, that's fine.
You know what I don't like?
Gettin' kicked in the head!
That is subpar.
I didn't know you knew karate.
- I don't. That was ballet.
Next time, kick harder!
Up, up, up.
All right, little dude... hand it over.
And don't even think about touching that dial.
Okay, okay.
What did you do with my dad?
I know you're a spy. It's on the news.
- That's not true.
I love my country. Now, give me the watch so I can go to Costa Rica.
And no funny business, okay?
Or your hottie here gets it.
Okay, okay.
Okay, here.
First chance I get, I'm kicking you right between the eyes.
That's it.
Come to Papa.
I am so out of here.
Dude, you got it wet.
- It's actually not...
Limber.
Bravo.
All right, if you're Dopler, then prove it.
Your mom's name is Jenny.
Your sister is Kelly.
You were born in May.
What else do you wanna know?
This is messed up, Dopler.
This is really messed up.
- How do you think I feel?
I think he's lying.
Do you want me to kick him again?
Yeah, all right.
If the watch makes you age, then how come we haven't gotten older?
You weren't in hypertime long enough.
- What makes you think... that Gates has my dad locked up in hypertime?
Because they took him to replace me.
And there's no other way to finish the molecular stabilizer... before the feds shut him down.
Look, Zak, I'm sorry, okay?
This is freaking me out too.
But your dad taught me everything I know.
I mean, your dad is like a father to me.
Right. Which is why you're in such a hurry to get to Costa Rica.
Hey, no fair.
When I sent your dad the watch...
I had no idea that Gates was gonna bogart everything from the feds.
There's gotta be something we can do to get him out of there, right?
"We"?
- Yeah, we.
Since you and my dad are so close,
I thought maybe you'd like to help.
Well...
I mean, I didn't say that we were that close.
Oh. Okay. Fine.
Then I can drop you off at QT. I'm sure Gates would love to have you back.
Now, can you fix this?
Yeah.
But we're gonna need some stuff you can't get at Radio Shack.
You heard the man.
Let's go shopping.
Hey there. Day passes for the expo hall are $1 4, please.
I don't have any money.
Do you?
You can't ask your hostage for money.
Hi.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?
Actually, I need some help, okay?
- Hi.
Let me ask you something.
- What can we do for you?
What is this, exactly?
- That is an airbrush gun.
Airbrush gun. Wow.
You're into precision items, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
- Cool.
What does this do?
- It's for airbrushing cars and walls.
- Painting.
- Very cute. What is that over there?
That's an industrial-strength hot-glue gun.
Hot-glue gun. Wow.
- It's a hot seller.
Well, Dexter, you guys have been both so helpful.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Bye.
- See ya.
Mama.
- Don't get many of those.
All right. We just need someplace quiet to go to work for a while.
While you're at it, can you make that thing go any faster?
What is it with you wacky kids today?
It's like nothing's ever fast enough.
Oh, great.
We're out of gas.
I guess I'm gonna have to go get...
- I'll get it.
Keep an eye on him?
He's amazing, isn't he?
Do you know him?
Yeah, I've seen him around.
The side entrance is too obvious.
We'll never get in that way.
I still can't believe he drew this.
- Sorry it's so rough.
I didn't have my protractor.
Okay. There's gotta be another entrance.
Let's just step back and look at our options.
You're starting to sound like your dad.
"Let's step back, look at our options!"
Shut up. I'm nothing like him.
Oh, come on. I meant it as a compliment.
You don't have to blow your RAM.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
What's this?
What's under here?
Is that like a sewer?
Ventilation, but close.
- Can we get in that way?
Sure, if you don't mind getting Ginsu-ed by the intake fan.
Give me the new watch.
- Here.
There we go.
And...
Now, check this out.
All that technology... incognito.
Huh?
Let me do that like that.
And I'll take that. Thank you.
- Fine.
You don't even give a dude time to admire his work. It's unbelievable.
What are you doing?
I can sell that on eBay.
Zak, come in through the back door.
I came as soon as I could after you called.
Come on.
Hey, Meeker, you the man.
How's this gonna work again?
Gates is gonna have guards in hypertime.
We're gonna need to bring 'em down to real time.
These babies ought to do it.
You take the paint out...
I put the frozen nitrogen in... and voilà.
N2O to go.
Come on, come on, come on.
All right. This is it.
Just past here are the ducts into the building.
Let's go.
Come on, Earl.
Here's the map.
This is as far as I go.
We had a deal.
- Look, man, I'm scared.
Okay? If you went through what I've been through... this place would give you the willies too.
I can't go in there, Zak man.
He was like a father to you, right?
- Hey, that's low.
And if you hadn't taken the watch to begin with, he wouldn't be in there.
What are you talking about?
You put my whole family at risk... when you sent him that watch.
"Oh, I didn't know it was a weapon, man.
I thought it was for science, dude-man, Zak man!"
That's the truth.
- The truth is that man in there... gave his life to students like you.
He treated you like a son. Now he needs something and it's too much for you?
You know what? I am his son, and I'm going in there.
Unauthorized hypertime.
Unauthorized hypertime.
Hypertime security response required on level three.
Come on!
Manson, check security levels four and five.
Anderson, check the stairs.
I can hold these guys off.
Go get your dad.
Security breach, level four.
I'll see you at the fan in five minutes.
Seal off all exit terminals.
You, freeze!
Get off that bike!
Unauthorized hypertime, storage level three.
Have a nice day, Ralph Sekada.
Thanks, Ralph.
Hello, Zachary.
I really want to thank you for bringing this back.
Let's go down to real time.
Dad?
Dad!
He's down here.
We're just about to find out whether he's as brilliant... as everyone says that he is.
He must be very fond of you.
I couldn't get him to do a damn thing until I threatened to kill you.
Dad.
You okay?
You swore you'd leave him out of this.
- Don't blame me. He's here on his own.
Maybe you forgot to give him his allowance.
You came here?
- What was I supposed to do?
Oh, Zak, no, no.
I was only cooperating with them so that they'd leave you alone.
I couldn't leave you here to die.
- So you had to come join me?
What?
- Oh, Zak.
You're always saying that I only show up when I need something.
Now I'm trying to help you, you don't even appreciate it?
Putting your life in the hands of terrorists is not what I had in mind.
What is it with you?
It's a good thing I'm your son instead of one of your precious students.
Then you'd be really disappointed.
- What are you talking about?
Would you two just stop it?
Sheesh.
You really are a lot alike.
Who's your friend?
Francesca. From school.
No wonderyou wanted a car.
Restricted access requested at northwest wing.
What is it?
- Agent Moore, sir.
Happy Monday, Mr. Gates.
Do you have some things for me?
I'm sorry for the inconvenience... but I'm gonna have to ask you to come back.
This isn't the prom, Gates.
The agency is serious about this.
Why don't you do us both a favor and drop the games?
You can't come in.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
Yes! We're gonna get out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Change of plans, people.
We're gonna test the molecular stabilizer... while we're actually in hypertime.
Warning.
Clean room hypertime engaged.
What's happening?
- He's taking us all into hypertime.
Three minutes and counting!
Once he's finished with that thing, he's not gonna need us anymore.
They're gonna kill us, aren't they?
There's got to be another way out of here.
Zak, this place is sealed tight as a drum.
What's this?
They've been experimenting with hydrogen.
Hydrogen.
They turn them on from tanks out there in the lab.
But... Zak?
Zak, you're gonna blow us up.
Not us. Them.
- Zak.
Zak, stop!
Come on!
Let us out!
I'm sorry for being so caught up in my work.
It was never because I care more about my students.
Sir, we got a problem.
We can't get in.
The access code to the molecular stabilizer has been changed.
Very clever, Dr. Gibbs.
You changed the access code.
But I thought we had an agreement.
I let your son live if you cooperate.
Well, it's time to renegotiate.
He and the girl go free, then you get your access code.
Fine.
Get those kids out of there, then bring that old man to me.
Zak, what are you doing?
Finishing what I came here to do.
Come here.
Gates took your watch.
- Gates took a watch.
He'd probably get $10 for it on eBay.
I switched them in the elevator.
Zak, you can't accelerate when you're already in hypertime.
It could kill you.
- We don't have a choice.
No, Zak!
- We don't have any choice.
Unbelievable.
Your molecules are moving so fast, your hand went right through the table.
Are you okay?
I have no idea.
Here we go.
Sir, we got a problem in there.
The kid is doing something freaky.
Well, bring him down!
You know what to do.
Hi.
Mr. Gates!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Zak.
Your plan worked.
Let's get out of here.
Say good night, little man.
- No!
Good night, little man.
Yeah.
It hurts, doesn't it?
Thank you.
I'll take that, thank you.
So what do you have in mind for our next date?
Dopler, next time you need help with your math homework, don't call me.
Dr. G.
Did you ever get this little anti-aging gizmo working?
'Cause I don't wanna stay like this forever.
Forget about it.
I never got a chance to test it.
Oh, thank God you're okay.
What happened?
- It's okay.
I'm just a little more distinguished, that's all.
Where's Zak?
He'll be here in a minute.
He had to make a stop.
What?
- No, no. He's just fine.
Daddy! Daddy!
- Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.
There he is.
Oh, Zak!
Oh, thank God you're okay.
You must be Francesca.
- Hi.
Hey, creepy. Nice ride.
I hearyou're a big hero now.
Well, I wouldn't say hero, but...
Look, I'm not gonna be nice all day, so enjoy it.
Hey, who's that?
- Actually, honey... there's something I forgot to tell you on the phone.
We had a little problem at the lab.
I guess we're gonna have some company for a while?
Oh, hey, Mrs. G.
How's it hangin'?
Dopler?
- Hello, gorgeous.
Over. Over.
More. More.
Hit it. Let's see what this thing can do. Yeah!
Buckle up!
Wait! Wait!
[distorted sounds]
- [calliope music]
- [chattering]
[ticking]
[ticking stops]
[scoffs]
- It stopped.
- What's that, Dave?
Nothing. How we doing?
Oh, we're ready.
- You, uh, feeling the magic?
- Oh, I'm feeling the magic, all right.
- Let's hit 'em.
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.
- Let's hit 'em.
- Let's go make $30 million.
[Dave] Good morning.
Before I begin, let me...
[all murmuring]
- David?
- I'll go get help.
- [horns honking, brakes screeching]
- Jesus. Jesus, David.
- [cars crashing]
- Phone 911. Phone 911!
[woman] David?
[crashing continues]
[people screaming]
[man] Nick? Nicky?!
N icky!
[screams continue]
[sirens approaching]
[man 1] OK.
[man 2] It's OK, it's OK.
You'll be OK.
Get everybody else off the bus.
[ticking continues]
[man 3] Sound waves.
So...
...if we know that sound waves gain wavelength...
[writing on chalkboard]
...and lose frequency as they travel through more dense materials...
...then the anomalies in these waves...
...are the means by which we can surmise the fundamental architecture of our planet.
- How are the nails coming, Christine?
- [laughter]
Good. All right, let's have a demonstration.
Mr. Acker, Veronica.
Thank you very much.
[blows loud note]
All right. Mrs. Limestone, being a big softie, you know, loves walks in the park, bedtime stories, big romantic. Loves Chet.
I can't play Chet, but I'll see what I can do.
Watch the oscilloscope, all right?
Here we go.
[playing off-key]
[clears throat]
- Dr. Joshua Keyes?
- Maybe.
- Yes or no, sir?
- The first one.
Please come with us, sir.
- [stammers] Guys, what's going on?
- We don't know, sir.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Your security clearance is higher than ours.
I have security clearance?
We're just here to bring you to your jet.
I have a jet?
[man speaking French]
Hey, Serge.
Serge. Serge.
Damn! It's about time.
You're always late.
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.
What am I doing here? They wouldn't brief me until you got here.
You know, there are biochemists everywhere, military. I hate them.
When are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner?
- I'm married to my work.
- So am I.
Which makes my wife my mistress.
That's why I'm still in love with her.
- You were always a romantic.
- I love my wife.
- Yeah, I know. I love your wife, too.
- I know.
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.
You don't love her the same way, you know.
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.
- Ah, the cheese.
- [both laugh]
- You're... you're teasing me, right?
- Oh, my...!
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.
I think we're in the wrong place here.
- Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
- [man] No.
If you were in the wrong place, you would've already been shot.
- That's a hell of a greeting.
- Serge.
- Serge.
- Serge. Yes. Always a pleasure.
Same here, Thomas.
Dr. Keyes.
I know. Tom Purcell.
Gentlemen, you do realise that everything here is totally classified, OK?
At 10.30 a.m. local time,
32 civilians, all within a ten-block radius...
...died.
They didn't get sick first.
- They simply hit the ground dead.
- Nerve agent?
- [Tom] Our first guess. No.
- They all died at the same time?
[Tom] As far as we can tell, to the second.
This hits CNN in one hour.
I need a reason.
[Serge] Is there a variation in sex, age, body type?
They all had pacemakers.
Under a minute.
Your reputation is well-deserved.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Tom] How did you guess,
- without any clues from the victims?
- No, that's...
Serge and I are the clues.
I mean, he specialises in high energy weapons. I do geomagnetics.
So calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon.
If these are the only fatalities, they must be people susceptible to...
- ...electronic interference.
- QED pacemakers.
- You're spooky sometimes?
- [Tom] Now, I need to know, did some sort of weapon kill these people?
The power that you would need to create an EM pulse strong enough...
I mean, that's... that's not a weapon that I've ever heard of.
- No.
- OK, we're done.
We're not done, sir. There's nothing on the other side of the equal sign.
- I agree with Joshua...
- Thank you.
Our greatest concern was this may have been an act of war, but since it's not, I think we can all breathe a little easier, can't we?
[door opens]
[cooing]
- Look at my hat.
- [child squeals]
What is it, sweetheart?
[pained cooing]
It's OK, son. These things happen all the time...
[birds squawking]
Let's go, let's go! Come on!
[screams]
- [thudding]
- [people shouting]
- [squawking continues]
- [people screaming]
Justin!
You bloody idiot!
- [boy] Hurry! Run!
- [screaming continues]
- [grunts]
- [tires screech]
[both grunt]
- [child shouts]
- [squawking continues]
[all screaming]
[Child] Daddy!
[sobs]
[man on TV] The skies are empty over Nelson's Column now,
but a few hours ago, it was a different story.
Eyewitnesses claimed that the frenzied swarms of birds
were not in fact attacking people deliberately...
And it's not just this time.
No,no,no,no,no,no.
The Fortean Times reported violent bird swarms twice last month in Australia and Japan.
...this bizarre and terrifying incident in London's historic Trafalgar Square.
- Weird.
- Mm-hm.
- Quite strange, also.
- Mm. Strange, indeed.
- How do birds navigate?
- [woman] By sight?
- No, no, no, the long range stuff.
- [woman] Magnetic fields.
Little ions in their brains align with the magnetic field of the Earth.
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?
Acker. Hit the Net, do a search for, oh, two years ought to do it.
Any and all, like, "weird news," you know, bizarre animal migrations, specifically birds.
Whale and dolphin beachings.
Uh, unusual atmospheric phenomenon, unexplained plane crashes,
- you know, just use your imagination.
- That is a huge search.
You can use our T-1 line to look up
Sailor Moon crap. You're up to this.
Danni, Danni, get me the brightest kids from the Field Theory class and design a computer model of an electromagnetic field.
- What are we doing?
- I need a 3-D computer model
- of the Earth to lay the field over.
- Whoa, the planet Earth?
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.
Map out the anomalies that Acker finds and grunt out the equations.
And... grab those smelly kids from the Non-Linear Diff class, too.
Listen, Josh, do we even have time for this?
Do this and I'll sign your doctorates blindfolded.
- [Danni] Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded. Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.
Be wrong. Be wrong.
[typing on keyboard]
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.
Give me some drag, will you?
Roger that.
[clears throat]
We are in attitude and ready for entry interface.
Nice work, Major.
I have the controls now for E.I.
I could take us in.
You could... but you won't.
- I'm ready for this, Bob.
- Oh, no, you're not, Beck.
You're trained, and you're certified.
Doesn't make you the commander.
And the commander lands the bird.
You got to be the youngest person ever in space. You should say, thank you, be happy. Now.
[man] Endeavour, Houston, at this time we show you go for re-entry.
[Beck] Houston, Endeavour descending through 400,000 feet
- coming upon entry interface.
- Endeavour, this is Flight.
Weren't able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time?
That's a negative, Stick. I'll have to be more annoying next time.
- Is that even possible?
- [laughs]
[man] Endeavour, we see you in good entry config.
[Beck] Roger, Houston.
[Tim] Advise.
[Bob] I'm seeing those plasma trails now.
- [Tim] All right, mark 24 and a 1/2.
- [Bob] So, a minute to air.
[Beck] I don't believe in belts.
Just get me through the Earth's atmosphere in this spaceship.
- [beeping]
- Com dropout.
- [Tim] Start the I Com.
- [Bob] Let's wait till the, uh...
Com restored.
[alarm beeping]
- [chattering]
- Quiet!
We are out of position here.
Guidance shows us on energy and on course.
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.
- We're not where we should be.
- Where the hell are we?
[Stick] Endeavour, guidance is bad.
You are now 1-2-niner miles off course.
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed. Is that...?
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.
We are 1-5 thousand feet.
We got maybe two minutes of glide time left.
Doesn't make sense. The guidance, the beacons are all wrong?
We're heading straight for downtown.
We're not gonna crash into Los Angeles.
They're going to hit downtown LA at 300 knots.
Bob, you know LA?
Because I have an idea.
Houston, those buildings are getting mighty big.
- Can you clear a freeway?
- OK, thank you.
Come on. Come on.
It's rush hour, Commander, and it's bumper-to-bumper.
Sir, I have an alternate.
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...
It's Houston's call. Houston?
- Computers are still plotting.
- Come on.
[rumbling]
[crowd murmuring]
Houston, we are running out of time here.
- Sir, I have an alternate.
- All right, Beck, what do you got?
Houston, I have coordinates for an alternate landing site. Can you confirm?
- Endeavour, give them to me.
- I show possible touchdown
at 33-55 north, 1-18-10 west.
- [Stick] Bill?
- It's theoretically possible.
Endeavour, that is confirmed.
Turn right, heading 1-7-5.
Expect visual contact
with Los Angeles River in five seconds.
No, that will not work, Houston.
We got bridges every few hundred yards.
Our wingspan alone is going to fold us up.
I've figured the "L" over "D" max.
We can make it if you can bring us straight in.
We're coming in high and hot.
Two-ninety feet, 320.
- Two-seventy, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.
- [Tim] Gear on.
- Gear down. Now.
[Tim] Gear in transition.
Two-forty feet, 290.
[Bob] Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.
Two-ten feet, 265.
Get out of the way! Move!
- Derotate.
- [Bob] Inward.
- Speed brakes!
- One hundred per cent.
- [Bob] We're way too fast.
- Deploy the chute.
- No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.
Banking right.
[Beck] Commander, that next bridge!
Watch it! We're way too high for that one!
- Suck up the gear!
- Not yet. We'll lose all steering.
We hit, it's over!
And... gear up now!
Lock your harnesses.
It's out of my hands.
[all shouting]
- Let's get out of here!
- Run! Let's get out!
[grinder buzzing]
' [grinder off]
' [gasps]
- [Endeavour powering down]
- [exhales]
[breathing deeply]
[sirens approaching]
[man] Dr. Zimsky?!
Will you make sure my assistant has your number, darling?
Sure.
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello. No, it's all right.
- Hello.
- Thank you, sir.
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.
No, sir, I don't need you to sign it.
I need you to read that.
[laughs] I'm sorry, I don't have time.
- I'm late for the White House, please.
- Sir...
I need you to confirm my results, sir.
Young man, do you have any idea who I am?
Yes, I do, sir. Please read this.
[camera clicking]
What's it about?
It's the end of the world.
[papers rustling]
[sighs]
No, I... this is impossible. I'm sorry.
[laughs]
I... I can't have missed this.
You... You have to be wrong.
I mean, look, I'm sure with careful comparison to my own work, we'll find that you are mistaken.
No offence, but...
Well, I mean, we'll know soon enough.
The bigger effects will start up any day now.
[beeping]
- Rebecca?
- Only you and Dad ever call me that.
Right, Beck.
So, what brings you to sunny D.C.?
The Board of Review is next week.
Just trying to get a sense of the mood upstairs.
- How bad is it?
- Your crew crashed the space shuttle.
Now, how good do you think it could be?
- Sir, this is my life.
- Well...
I was studying for the academy when I was 13.
It still is and has always been my life.
It's over.
It's over, Rebecca.
I'm sorry.
- [elevator dings]
- [chattering]
- [man] Really?
- It's like the 4th of July.
- What the hell's the hurry here?
- [cell phone rings]
Rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
Excuse me.
- Purcell.
- Thomas, um, look...
...it seems that destiny may have caught up with us.
Did Zimsky really try to give you his autograph?
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.
Conrad Zimsky. Herr Zimsky.
Superstar.
Ahh. [exhales]
I think I skipped drunk.
Went right to hangover.
[low-tempo music plays]
I spoke with the kids.
They don't sleep at night.
They look at the sky, and... and they think it's pretty.
- Is there any chance you're wrong?
- No. The sky, man.
The sky... I mean, that's just the beginning.
- That's high-altitude static discharge.
- I know.
[man] Dr. Keyes...
...your presence is required at the Pentagon.
Ahh! It's my best buddies. Hey!
Why don't you join us for a drink?
We'd be grateful if you could join us for a ride, sir.
And if I were to say no?
- Just asking.
- Yeah.
- Well, we have no sense of humour.
- That's true.
- Oh.
- And we're armed.
Thank you.
- [Tom] Dr. Keyes, welcome.
- Thank you.
Dr. Zimsky informs us that you made a useful contribution to his investigations, so he wanted you to assist him with the briefing.
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.
Science is a selfless business, dear boy.
Now, why don't you begin, and I'll fill in all the difficult bits.
[clears throat]
All right, I'll put this as simply as I can.
[sighs] Everybody on Earth is dead in a year.
And let me explain why.
Wrapped around the Earth is an invisible field of energy.
It's made up of electricity and magnetism, so it's called, creatively enough, the electromagnetic field.
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole, and it protects us from cosmic radiation.
- So this EM field is our friend.
- But now...?
But now, that field is falling apart.
- Why?
- [scoffs] Why?
This here.
Does somebody have a can of air freshener?
Uh... Quick and dirty.
The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust.
That's what we live on.
It's 30 miles thick.
The meat here, call it the mantle.
And forgetting all the funky transitions, it's 2,000 miles thick.
The core, the peach pit in the centre, that's a tricky one.
There's two parts: the inner core and the outer core.
Are you following me?
The inner core is...
Well, it's a big solid chunk of iron, we think.
And that's surrounded by the outer core, and that is liquid.
Yes, but, most importantly, this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction.
So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at a thousand miles an hour, so...
Right, so, Physics 101:
Hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field.
This spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the EM Field.
And that's where we have our problem.
This engine has stalled.
The core of the Earth has stopped spinning.
- How could this have happened?
- [people murmuring]
We don't know.
What's the timeline here?
As the EM Field becomes more and more unstable, we'll start seeing isolated incidents.
One plane will fall from the sky, and then two, and then...
...in a few months, anything, everything electronic will be fried.
Static discharges in the atmosphere will create superstorms with hundreds of lightning strikes per square mile.
After that, it gets bad.
The Earth's EM Field shields us from the solar winds, which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves.
When that shield collapses, microwave radiation will literally cook our planet.
Dr. Zimsky.
- [clears throat]
- This is the sun.
This is the Earth... without the EM Field.
- Would you?
- Mm-hm.
Three months, gentlemen, and we're back in the Stone Age.
A full year, the field collapses...
...and that.
May I?
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.
So... how do we fix it?
- We can't.
- Not in my vocabulary.
Then you might want to get one of those word-a-day calendars, General, because it's impossible.
The core is the size of Mars. You're talking about jumpstarting a planet.
This is a superheated hyper-fluid of molten iron and nickel at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
2,000 miles down, 1,000 miles thick.
And the deepest we've ever been is... seven miles
- with a two-inch drill bit.
- If we can go into space,
- we certainly...
- Well, space is easy. It's empty.
We're talking about millions of pounds of pressure per square inch.
Even if we somehow came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core, we just can't get there.
[Zimsky] Yes, but...
...what if we could?
Hello, Braz.
Why the hell aren't you dead yet?
OK, this way.
Oh. That went better than I expected.
Dr. Brazzelton,
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.
Yeah. Twenty years ago, he stole my research. [laughs]
- After that, we kind of lost touch.
- Research that was equally mine.
That's funny, I don't remember a cheque from any of the patents.
[sighing] All right, Braz,
20 years in the desert makes you a prophet and a martyr.
Look, we're here about your legendary ship.
OK, I'm combining high-frequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics.
If you've ever seen ultrasonic waves break up a kidney stone on the Discovery Channel, it's the same deal here.
- Uh, you can put your helmets on now.
- [motor starting]
- Firing.
- [powering up]
[shouting]
[shouting]
[engine powering down]
[Braz] Yeah. Oh.
[coughing]
[Spits]
OK, I'm officially impressed.
[Zimsky] Well, all right.
So you've made some progress with the engine, I will grant you.
Uh, have you begun to think about a shell?
OK, this is Alex.
OK, Alex. Good.
OK, here we have a concrete block, and in back of that, we have a two-inch steel plate.
- [engine powering up]
- OK. We're ready.
And we are... firing.
[engine powering down]
- Voilà!
- That's...
- That's impossible.
- [Braz] I combined the crystals in a tungsten-titanium matrix at supercool temperatures, and that's what did the trick.
The applications for this are just...
What do you call this material?
Well, its real name has 37 syllables.
I call it Unobtanium.
- Unobtanium?
- Mm-hm.
The Unobtanium will take the heat and the pressure and transform it to energy, which in turn, reinforces the shell of the ship, you see.
So the hotter and the deeper she gets, the stronger she gets, theoretically.
- [Zimsky] Theoretically?
- Theoretically, yes.
This... is Johnson, don't mind him.
This is the prototype for the cockpit here.
Excuse me, Dr. Brazzelton, when do you think the ship will be operational?
When I get my fabrication methods perfected.
Twelve... ten years, ten years.
What would it take to get it done in three months?
[laughing] Fifteen billion dollars. I...
Will you take a cheque?
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.
Mm.
[pounding]
- [man 1] Shit!
- [man 2] Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
- We have a warrant.
- [pounding continues]
- [Finch] Purge!
- [Computers beeping]
Come on, purge!
FBI! Freeze!
[dings]
[clattering]
OK.
I know these look like computers.
Totally not.
Theodore Donald Finch.
Carnegie Mellon University. MIT.
Worked at Sun, Lucent, RAND Corp.
My handle's "Rat". Call me Rat.
Sixty-three computer fraud indictments.
Sixty-four.
Two convictions.
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.
Wait a second.
You guys aren't here to whack me, are you?
Because I was really, really hoping to have sex before that happened.
Yeah. I've been told by the FBI, whose database you crippled last year, that you are the best in the business.
So you're about to be given a choice.
- What if I say no?
- Excuse me, but is this really the best we could do?
I mean...
- How many languages do you speak?
- Five, actually.
Well, I speak one.
One, zero, one, zero, zero.
With that, I could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life, any country, any place, anytime I want.
We multitask like you breathe.
I couldn't think as slow as you if I tried.
- Do you have any idea...?
- OK, hey. Hey!
Let's just, let's give the kid a break.
OK, it's a phone. It's just a phone.
Rat...
...we got a big... problem.
A lot of people are going to die.
- We need your help.
- What kind of help?
- [blows on wrapper]
- Information control.
We need you to control the flow of information on the Internet.
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the Net.
Could you... with unlimited resources?
You want me to hack the planet?
[chuckles]
- [dialing phone]
- He wants me to hack the planet.
[blowing sounds]
[phone dialing]
You've got free long distance on that phone... forever.
OK. If I decide to do this,
I'm going to need an unlimited supply of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.
- Hot Pockets?
- They help me concentrate.
Sounds fair.
[shoes squeaking]
[door opens]
[man] Major Childs, they're ready for you.
[swallows]
Major Childs, a clarification:
You and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle, correct?
Yes, General.
[General] We have determined that the Class "A" landing mishap experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour was caused by biased navigational data from the ground due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.
Major Childs, the resourcefulness you showed in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigational skills.
You've brought much credit upon yourself, the space programme and the United States Air Force.
Congratulations, Major.
You are reassigned with Commander
Iverson and Flight Director Stickley to a new mission, effective immediately.
Transportation is waiting outside.
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.
[chattering]
[Serge] Are you sure you want to wear this tie?
- [Josh] Why?
- [Serge] I don't know.
I mean, you look so nervous about it.
- You look so...
- So, how are you holding up?
- Oh, hi.
- I'm good, I'm good.
I'm about to tell a couple hundred people the world is going to end.
- Well...
- I've had better days.
You look good.
Well, no, you don't look good.
Why did he touch his tie like that?
Thomas, let me speak with you for a moment.
Listen, wouldn't you rather I did this?
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...
No. No, Keyes is in the lead here, Zimsky.
Yes. Thomas, this is the most important scientific operation in history.
And given my status,
I feel that it's my job to present...
Project Destiny was your job, Zimsky.
And you went way beyond authorised limits.
And let me tell... let me tell you,
I still, I want to know if Destiny caused this problem.
It's highly unlikely, but it may be the solution.
- Now, I have not finished checking...
- Excuse me.
Rebecca... I'm so glad I was wrong.
Right over left...
No, the other left, the other left.
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...
Gentlemen.
Commander Iverson, Major Childs, this is your crew:
- Dr. Brazzelton knows the ship.
- Hello.
- [Tom] Dr. Zimsky knows the planet.
- Doctor.
Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system.
- Excuse me, ladies first. Hi.
- [Tom] And Dr. Keyes... [clears throat]
Dr. Keyes built the navigation system.
- So...
- Hi. Rebecca Childs.
Bob Iverson.
These are your fellow... fellow what?
- Terranauts?
- [Stick] Hello.
All this brain power over here is starting to smell like burning batteries.
- Y'all better come and join in.
- Yeah.
It's the simplest things that are the hardest, huh?
Yeah. It's official. I'm the least-qualified person on this base.
Dr. Keyes, I'm sure the people in charge have every confidence in you.
Well, the problem is that I'm in charge.
- [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
- Can I help you?
Yes, please.
[clears throat]
You're an astronaut, and you can tie a Windsor?
Mm-hm.
- Is there anything you can't do?
- Not that I'm aware of.
I find that incredibly intimidating.
Yep. Most people do.
Here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
[Tom] Let me introduce our project leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.
[Josh] Thank you, thank you.
Good evening. Good evening.
Wow. This looks like a meeting for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.
I know you are all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here.
So, I'll outline our programme over the next three months.
Dr. Brazzelton will supervise the building of a ship
which is capable of reaching the centre of our planet.
Once there, it will deliver an explosive charge
large enough to restart its core.
Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale of the explosion needed.
[Zimsky] This is a program I designed to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core.
If my calculations are correct, a tiny nudge in any direction will force the core back into its normal flow.
What's a "tiny nudge" in planetary terms?
- A thousand megatons, give or take?
- [Zimsky] Tops.
Because any more than that would create a core instability.
[Serge] We made a few monster warheads in the 200-megaton range.
Braz, do you think the ship can handle five of these babies?
Yeah.
- I can enlarge the ejection pod...
- [Bob] Forgive me, but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here, but what if the core is thicker or thinner?
I mean, what if it's not what you think it is?
Isn't that going to affect the way the explosions are...?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
And what if the core is made of cheese?
This is all best guess, Commander.
That's all science is, is best guess.
So my best guess is you don't know.
[Josh] With luck, irony will break for the good guys for once,
and the world's biggest weapons of mass destruction
will help save the world.
The ship will be powered by a small experimental nuclear reactor.
It will be divided into six compartments like cars on a train:
the locomotive unit, navigation compartment,
living quarters, engineering, bomb compartment
and finally the weapons-control module.
Up to a 45-degree angle, every compartment will be held level by these gyro control gimbals.
But if we do breach a section, bulkhead doors engage automatically, seal off the section in red, and eject.
- Is ejection really the best option?
- Only option.
Each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull.
[Josh] The objective is simple.
The obstacles are gigantic.
We're going to need all the help in the world,
but if we are to avoid panic and chaos,
the world at large can never know what's happening here.
Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.
[Rat] It's called Virus-bot. It's a computer virus that will seek out files anywhere on the Web that contain keywords that we designate and wipes them out.
This is my kung fu, and it is strong.
[Josh] Meanwhile, there are a million puzzles ahead of us,
and we have three months to solve them.
We have a committed and ingenious team.
We have every resource available to us, and we have the best
of the world's scientific and technical talents on our side.
With your help we can, we must... succeed.
[indistinct conversations]
- Feedback in the resonance tube.
- Talk to me, gentlemen.
[Serge] We are losing structural integrity.
No, it's not feedback.
It's an impeller malfunction, I believe.
No, it's not, no. If it were an impeller malfunction...
For God's sakes, Braz, make the call!
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.
[Beck] Sixty-five knots!
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.
L0ok,guys...
It's a disaster!
[laughing]
[alarm blaring]
What part of "talk to me" don't you guys understand?
For the 22nd time in a row, everyone on Earth is dead.
Let's take a little quiet time, and you all are going to try this again.
- Hey
- Hi.
What is this?
Uh, well, it's... I invented it.
It's how you're going to... going to steer underground.
It's... not very good reception.
[Josh] Well, uh, you're looking through three feet of lead at 50 yards away, so...
...it ain't bad.
It's like a CAT scan at a hospital, but it's, uh, it's souped-up.
I invented it for deep earth surveying.
And then the government came in, bought my research, paid off my student loan guys and made me a consultant.
I'm sorry, this is really delicate.
And I have it just the way I want it.
So... excuse me.
Uh... Yeah. Then they brought me in when the pacemakers quit, and... boom, you know,
I'm Apocalypse Boy.
Apocalypse Boy?
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts made up.
Well, hats sell better.
You know, it's funny, because that is right where it should be.
Well...
I'm sorry. I'm a little ragged around the edges.
I'm just trying to get this thing to focus correctly.
- This is cool, but can I just...?
- Well... Mm-hm.
It's better. It's better. Ah...
[electrical zapping]
God, I hate this sky.
- [crashing sounds]
- [alarm blaring]
[sighs]
[Bob] Crashing one ship isn't enough for you?
Hey. Practice makes perfect.
You can practise all you like.
It doesn't mean you're ready to sit on that seat.
So you keep reminding me, sir.
You know, I doubt you're even going to listen to this, but I'm going to give it a shot.
Being a leader isn't about ability.
It's about responsibility.
- Got it, sir.
- No, you don't, Beck.
I mean, you're not just responsible for making good decisions.
You have to be responsible for the bad ones.
You got to be ready to make the shitty call.
- What makes you think I'm not?
- Because you're so good.
You haven't hit anything you couldn't beat.
I mean, hell, you were the one who figured out how to save the shuttle.
You made me, you made the rest of NASA just look like an ass.
It's just that you're used to winning...
...and you're not really a leader until you've lost.
[Braz] $20 billion has been spent developing this system...
[Josh] Oh, come on, guys, the chefs at NASA...
- I wouldn't call them chefs.
- [all arguing]
I want wine! I need wine!
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...
- Whoa!
- [Zapping]
That's high-level static discharge.
I think we should check this out.
This doesn't look so good.
[rapid chattering]
[Josh] It's a lightning superstorm.
- Popping up all over the world.
- Got 'em. Tracking.
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.
[electrical zapping]
[crowd murmuring]
[patrons chattering]
[man speaks foreign language on TV]
[hissing]
[all shouting]
[howls]
[all screaming]
[screaming continues]
[Sirens]
[woman speaking foreign language on TV]
This planet is decaying faster than we thought.
It's just the start.
Soon they'll be EM spikes and microwaves will break through the weak spots and...
All right. Get this ship in the ground. Now.
[thunder]
[sneezes]
[groans]
Summer in the Pacific.
Yeah, the world is inside out.
[Serge] I was saving this for later, but...
- ...this is the time for...
- [laughs]
- Josh, do you mind?
- No, not at all. Yeah.
We should have a name for this baby.
- Oh, she's called Virgil, actually.
- Virgil, the poet that led our man into the depths of hell?
- That's it.
- That's appropriate, I guess.
Well, here's to Virgil.
To the planet.
[all] To Virgil.
No flashbulbs, no press, nobody cheering. It's... weird.
Let's go.
[thunder]
[chattering]
[Bob] Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.
[Beck] Check.
[Bob] E CS cabin repress open
And repress VLV closed.
- Check.
- Fluid dump valve.
We are about to begin our journey into the heart of the cosmos...
- [Bob] Close.
- ...Into the core of our own planet.
- Where we find therein...
- [Beck] Check.
- ...the secrets of the universe...
- [Bob] ...3.5 PSI.
- ...the mysteries of time...
- [Bob] Helen circuit lockup.
- [Beck] Check.
- ...hope for the future.
- [Bob] And signal.
- Deep Earth Control, this is Virgil.
- Signal check.
- This is Deep Earth Control.
I have thumbs-up across the board.
You are clear to initiate power-up.
Reactor power confirmed.
[Stick] At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown to launch. On your mark.
Pad leader, stand by for launch.
All right, Virgil.
- Mark.
- Gantry count. Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six, five, four...
...three, two, one... launch.
- Five hundred feet.
- Leveling out.
OK, guys, let's swing forward.
- Eight hundred feet.
- Light 'em up, Beck.
[beeping]
- Gyro leveling operational.
- Hull integrity holding.
I'm going to keep her nose down about 15 degrees and...
- [whale sounds]
- Oh, my goodness.
They're singing to us.
Virgil's resonance tubes are powered up, so they're vibrating subsonically.
Actually, we're singing to them.
[hull creaking]
What's our depth?
Sixteen hundred feet, plenty of room on both sides.
- Hull integrity is good.
- You sure?
Let's increase impeller speed. I think we'll be needing additional control.
- [beeping]
- Stick, I'm getting a seismic reading.
- What's happening?
- T-phase. Underwater earthquake.
[rumbling]
Still think the water-launch was a good idea?
Yes, yes, I chose this location because the crust is thin here.
The downside is... there's lots of seismic activity.
Four thousand feet.
You see that rock?
That is not good.
We're losing steering here.
There's some kind of crosscurrent.
Fourteen thousand feet.
OK, guys, fasten your seat belts.
We're turning into the skid.
Eighteen thousand.
- Eighteen-five.
- They're going way too fast.
[alarm blaring]
- Twenty-one thousand feet.
- We hit the wall, we're rabbits on the highway.
[Braz] Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.
What do you mean, pressure? I thought you said this thing was indestructible!
I said the pressure makes us stronger.
We just don't have enough of it yet.
We're at 25,000 feet. Pull out, sir.
- Can't.
- What?
- We're locked in.
- Go to full throttle.
Standby to engage front and lateral lasers, please.
But what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here?
Just give it a couple of more seconds.
The lasers will fire.
No, there's not enough time for power-up.
Twenty-seven thousand feet.
[Braz] The lasers will deploy.
Twenty-nine thousand feet.
- Do it!
- And...
- Do it!
- Now.
[monitor beeps]
- [beeping]
- And we've got a signal.
- [man] All right.
- [all applaud]
All right. [clears throat] Switching on electron spin burst transmitters.
Ah, plotting through lowest density material,
- reconfiguring every five minutes.
- [exhales]
Hull integrity 100 per cent.
Reactor power 100 per cent.
- All green on the bomb compartment.
- Speed is 60 knots.
[laughs] Hot damn.
All right, we'll be through the crust in 15 minutes and into the mantle.
Twenty-four hours to the core, and then assuming we survive...
- Assuming?
- Yes, assuming.
Another 15 hours to the inner core-outer core border.
[beeping]
- They're doing well.
- The crust is just rock.
Now, it gets interesting.
Virgil, can we get a status check?
We're about to make the transition into the mantle.
- [rumbling]
- Come on, come on.
[exhales]
Well, exterior pressure is 800,000 pounds per square inch.
And hull integrity is 100 per cent.
It's as if we we're diving through the memories of the planet.
But we are about to pass from memory into madness.
Are you going to be doing that Carl Sagan narration all the way to the core?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...
[stammers] I have an obligation to my students...
An obligation to make a book deal perhaps?
[Zimsky] Two book deals, if you'd like to know the truth.
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.
[Zimsky] Oh, really? Really?
When did you learn how to read?
[Braz] You amaze me.
[Bob] People.
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?
You guys are our resident geophysicists.
What do you make of this?
The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of... a variety of elements...
Say it with me: "I don't know."
Well, Commander, wise men say,
"When in doubt, you should go around."
No. It's too big. We turn too slow.
Anything that we can't go through displays as black.
- So, what's... what's static?
- It's nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing.
It's empty space.
L.-
I never taught the computer how to read empty space.
And I never taught Virgil how to fly.
Oh, God!
[all grunting]
Oh, no, man!
[Bob] Oh, dear God.
[grunts]
[shouts]
[groaning]
Ah!
[screams]
[all grunting, panting]
Serge, you all right?
Yeah.
- Anybody hurt?
- No. You OK?
- Yeah.
- [craft hissing]
What's that? What is that?
From the cooling system.
Shut that down. Shut it down.
I told you to go around her.
Nobody listens to me.
Where in God's name are we?
Whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers. Shut 'em down.
We're not going anywhere.
Powering down.
[ship powers down]
Josh, is there any other image you can pull up?
Nope. Whatever it is, it's also inside our MRI cameras.
- We have to go outside.
- [Serge] What?
Believe me, I hate to admit it, but I think he's right.
- I'm coming. I want to collect samples.
- [Bob] Wait, hang on, hang on.
The first problem is, the only way out of the ship is the way we came in, which is through the impeller outlet...
- Which is still at 5,000 degrees.
- Exactly, I mean...
I'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen from the cooling system.
Wait. The cooling system that's keeping us from roasting to death in this ship?
Well, just a small part of it.
Alternatives? Anybody.
[heavy breathing]
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, that's it.
[Josh] It's like a giant... giant crystal.
- [Zimsky] Where the hell are we?
- [Bob] Well, the good news is, it looks like the suits can take the pressure.
It's completely jammed the laser assembly.
We just... we got to hope, if we can cut it loose,
- they're still functional.
- Careful!
OK.
Got it.
- Beck, try the lights, will you?
- Lighting up.
- Oh, it's magnificent.
- [Zimsky] Oh, my God.
[Braz] Aladdin's cave.
[Zimsky] It's like a crystal Grand Canyon.
I think it's a geode.
But I don't understand how it could have survived down here.
- Cobalt shell, maybe?
- [Zimsky] Well, I mean, in a magma environment of 5,000 degrees.
Something would have to protect it.
Unbelievable.
- Zimsky.
- Yeah?
We're inside a giant gem bubble, wrapped in a cobalt cocoon
700 miles below the surface of the Earth.
- Hell of a day.
- [Zimsky laughing]
Yes, it is.
- [Braz] I'll start cutting.
- [Bob] OK, Braz.
I'm going to check the hull.
Call me if you need me.
- OK.
- [tool powering up]
[Zapping]
[hissing]
Oh, no.
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?
- Zimsky...
- Look! It's an amethyst.
[Zimsky] Oh, God, we've breached the shell.
[shouts]
- [gasps]
- [all shouting]
Guys, you don't have to be here!
I want you back inside!
Well, I think that means me.
Orders are orders.
Wait, Josh.
The problem is I'm losing oxygen.
- Braz, what can I do?
- Check the feeds for me.
Check the feeds for me, Josh.
Quick!
I'm coming. I'm coming as fast as I can.
Hey, guys, at this rate we have three minutes before the lava gets to us.
Come on, guys. Come on.
[beeps]
[Braz] It's not going to work without oxygen!
We're losing oxygen!
[air hissing]
I fixed it. Now cut!
[Braz] That's good. It's working now.
It's working well now!
That's good, Josh!
- Josh's vital signs are dropping.
- What?
[exhales]
Serge!
[Braz] You're almost there.
You're almost there, Josh.
- [grunts]
- Josh!
[grunting]
[grunts]
- Joshua!
- OK, guys, connect the oxygen.
- [Bob] Braz, you got that?
- [Braz] Yes. Connected!
[Bob] Good. I got to check these lasers.
OK, Beck, turn 'em over.
Pre-lasers only, if you don't mind.
Initiating.
This better work.
The tide's really coming in.
Yes!
We got lucky! I think we're going to swim right out of this one.
Bob?
[gasps]
[long beep]
Bob?
Bob...
Braz, come on, it's over.
OK. OK.
Beck! Beck!
We're coming in.
[panting] Initiate start sequence.
Beck!
- Beck, do you hear me?
- [Serge] Careful.
Start the impellers!
The door, open the door.
Activate bulkhead doors!
Now, Beck!
[gasps]
You OK? You're going to be weak.
You're OK.
Good job, good job. Good man.
- Well done, well done.
- [Josh] I'm fine. Thank you.
So... we have some good news, and...
...and we have some bad news.
Good news.
I'll take good news.
- All right.
- Well, we're alive and we're moving.
That's g... that's good news.
Oh, it is hot in here.
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the cooling system, it's causing things just to heat up a little. I'm going to go back and make some adjustments.
- I'll lend you a hand.
- I'm fine.
[Beck] I'm going to check your heartbeat, OK?
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.
So, that's the bad news?
That's not too bad.
No. Commander Iverson died.
But... we're living, and he would want to...
He'd want us to complete our mission, so I think that it's important that we all...
- It's all right.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Let's give him a second, OK?
He deserves that.
Oh, God, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?
I think you were attempting the impossible.
You were trying to save the world, and...
...it's overwhelming.
I came here to save my wife and my two children and... six billion lives... it's too much.
I just hope I'm smart enough and brave enough to save three.
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Well, maybe, maybe.
Hey... who's steering the ship?
- Video screen autopilot.
- I hope he knows the way.
You and me both.
So... you're really a college professor?
You're not from the CIA or the NSA or any of those three-letter places?
No. I am a boring college professor.
Wrong place, wrong place.
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.
Well, I just, I just...
Listen, the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl, as is my custom in dangerous situations.
[Beck] Hey, guys, we're close to the mantle core interface.
Where are you?
[Serge] Key's in, Dr. Brazzelton.
- Ready.
- [Josh] We are in the
- luxurious, beautiful...
- [Serge] OK, the code...
...weapons control checking the controls on the nukes.
[Serge] This is the birthday of my daughter.
[Braz] O-3-1-9-9-5.
- Ready? Three, two and one.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Green. All green.
Great. So we have to synchronise the babies now.
Just a second.
- There.
- Mm-hm.
All right, now let's put them to bed.
Zimsky, could you please come up here for a second?
- Yes?
- We're not supposed
- to go through anything black.
- Yes, so please don't.
What is this?
[Zimsky] They're scattered everywhere.
Oh, my God! They're diamonds!
[Beck] Great.
You might want to sit down and buckle up. We're on a collision course here.
Alrighty. Careful.
Guys, we're dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me.
Not exactly nimble here.
- Diamonds? I want some.
- Can I help?
Oh!
- [thudding]
- OK. It's OK.
[Beck] OK, it looks like we're in the clear.
- [scraping]
- [alarm beeping]
Breach!
Guys! Weapons control, get out!
Get out now!
[Josh] Serge!
Serge! What the hell are you doing?
Come on!
[$6rge] My notebook!
Serge!
Take the time reg, Joshua!
- Come on Serge! Come on!
- My notes! You'll need them!
No! God, no, Serge!
- It's OK.
- Serge, come on! No!
Serge!
We need the box!
[Braz shouting]
We can get him!
We can get him!
Hold on, Serge!
Beck! Beck!
Override the ejection system!
Beck, no! One damaged compartment threatens the whole ship!
Beck! Beck!
Override the ejection system!
Serge, we're right here. We're not going to forget about you, man.
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...
Hey, buddy, look in your monitor right now. Serge, look in your monitor.
- I'm right here. Serge...
- Josh, I can't see you.
Braz is going to override the doors manually, OK?
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?
Going as fast as I can, fast as I can.
- OK, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.
- Shouldn't be two seconds, all right?
- Josh!
Beck, override the ejection systems, OK?
Damn it. I don't think
Beck can hear me.
Serge, look at me now. Serge!
Serge, we're right here, OK? We're not going to forget about you, man.
I'm going to get you out of here.
We're working on it, all right?
- Stay with me here. OK?
- [sobs] I don't know what to do.
You can hear me now?
All right, here I am.
I'm not going to let you go, man. I'm not going to let you go, all right?
Stay with me here, OK?
I'm going to come to Paris and we'll go out, all right? After this.
After this is all said and done, all right?
- Josh!
- Serge!
- Serge! Serge! Serge!
- [Serge screaming]
Serge _/
[sighs]
- [inhales sharply]
- [kicking console]
Did you reset the overrides?
I never pushed them.
You let him die.
Actually, you really want to know?
I killed him twice.
First when I hit the diamond, and then when I didn't hit the override.
Do you want me to feel any worse about that than I already do?
It's not possible.
Why are you being so smug about that?
- Could you have made the decision?
- [Josh] Yes.
- Could you?
- Yes, I could've.
If you would've hit that switch,
I could've got him outta there!
I was yelling for you!
Take it and look at it!
I was two inches from him!
I was two inches, and I told you to put the door up and you didn't!
I was screaming for you!
Why didn't you do it?!
Because I had to make that decision.
Fate or God...
No! Damn it!
You leave God out of this!
Serge died so that we could complete our job.
Oh, that's right, the job of saving the world.
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.
- [monitor beeping]
- [quiet chattering]
Virgil, you are approaching core interface. Are you good to go?
[Braz] Josh?
Josh, can you hear me?
Josh, can you hear me?
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.
Dr. Keyes.
Right here.
Deep Earth, we are green and good to go.
We just got a huge speed jump.
We're at 95 knots...
...13O... 140.
Our speed's jumped because the density of the core is different than our estimates.
It's lighter than we thought.
- So much for best guesses.
- [Beck] I'm fine with this.
At this rate, we'll, what, hit the inner core in a little over five hours.
I think we finally bought some luck.
- Braz.
- Yeah.
Would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
Please tell me this is enough.
- Failure.
- [Beck] You're telling me the 1,000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?
No. This core material is too thin.
- What?
- [Zimsky] The energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.
They'll just bleed away into nothing.
[exhales, stammers]
That's it.
- We go home. We go home.
- [Josh] Home?
Our commander is dead.
Our weapons specialist is dead.
Our weapons control systems are gone.
We don't know whether we can arm the nuclear devices, and our plan to fix the core no longer works. So... we have failed.
We have not failed.
We have failed, and we go home, and we go to the alternative.
What alternative?
What are you talking about?
General, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.
Destiny is a go.
Repeat. Destiny is a go.
[sighs] Damn.
I need to know everything to do my job.
You don't have to know this.
General, it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission.
Anything that affects it is my business.
Now what the hell is Destiny?
It's a device.
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.
We had reason to believe that our enemies were building a weapon that could generate targeted seismic events.
They would be able to create massive earthquakes under our territory.
- No way of telling who did it.
- So?
So... we built one, too.
M.A.D. Mutually Assured Destruction.
A perfect acronym if ever there was one.
- Beautiful.
- They built it first.
I built it better.
I beamed high-powered electromagnetic energy waves down Deep Earth fault lines,
- and, you know.
- Zimsky, what makes you think
- that Destiny would touch the core?
- [Josh] 'Cause it already did.
This isn't a fluke.
We killed the planet.
[Beck] You keep saying that the core is too big to be affected by anything short of nukes.
- So...
- The core is an engine.
Throw a small wrench into a big engine, you can still stall it.
Deep Earth, this is Virgil.
We require clarification on the status of Project Destiny.
- Why weren't we notified of this, sir?
- Because you didn't need to know.
Now you may not like this.
I may not like it either.
But it's my job, and I do it for my country, and if we don't develop these devices, someone worse will and they will use them against us.
But you have my word.
No one in this administration, no one, had any idea that this could happen.
So the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?
An electric shock can stop a heart.
It can certainly restart one.
- Destiny will work. It has to.
- No, it won't work.
If you fire that thing again with the core already stalled,
- it'll terminally destabilise it.
- Yes, granted, there is a marginal risk involved, but given the circumstances,
- I hardly see that as an alternative.
- No, Zimsky, listen to me.
Every volcano on the planet will blow.
There'll be earthquakes big enough to rip us to pieces.
- [Tom] Dr. Keyes.
- What?
I'm afraid it's all we've got.
Now, I have orders from the president.
Come home, Virgil. We go to plan B.
- Well, what about plan C?
- What? What?
Well, plan C. We continue on.
We restart the core... somehow.
We don't do it, you fire Destiny.
I can't wait for you to get out of there.
- Then don't. We fail, fire Destiny.
- Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!
- What choice do we have, Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?
If they set that thing off, the shock waves will wipe us out!
We'll be lucky to get back if we turn back right now!
Virgil, I'm telling you right now, we will fire Destiny, and we need to do so as quickly as possible, and if you're still there, you will be destroyed.
Rebecca ?
Please don't make me have to do this.
Plan C.
It's your call, Commander.
Majority decision.
We're going in.
I'm sorry, sir.
Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal morons! What are you, crazy?
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?
Oh, that's a great idea!
That's a brilliant idea!
I can't believe I'm stuck in this floating septic tank with you lunatics!
You may have nothing to lose.
You may have nothing to lose!
You may have nothing to lose, but I have my life to lose, thank you very much, while you're up! Now turn it around!
He told us to go back and we're going back!
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!
- Thank you! Turn it around!
- No!
- Zimsky.
- I'm not gonna die like this!
- I don't wanna die!
- Zimsky, it's not about you!
- If you wanna die like this...
- ...three people...
Shut up!
[panting]
It's not a stupid ship.
I had to.
- It had to happen sometime.
- Yeah.
- [computer beeping]
- Um...
- Status! What is that?
- [Rat] It's the EM monitoring station.
It's the one that tracks EM pulses.
God, no.
[sighs]
- Just talk, Mr. Rat.
- [Rat] No.
- That's a good boy.
- Um...
Remember those invisible microwaves that Josh was talking about?
Well, they just found a hole.
[water boiling]
No, it's a parking lot out here...
- [sizzling sound]
- [screams]
[sizzling sounds continue]
Oh, my God.
[rumbling]
- [sizzling sounds continue]
- [gasps]
[screams]
[people screaming]
[woman on TV] And now with this horrific breaking news,
we go live to San Francisco, where Leo Jacks has the story.
[Leo] Yes, Claire, it's hard to believe
that half of San Francisco is in ruins today
following the most devastating and the most baffling
event in our nation's history.
Uh, it's a horrific situation here.
Thousands are dead.
Many are missing.
- It's hotels, hospitals.
- Bring up the power grid.
- [typing]
- [computer beeping]
The whole West Coast is out.
That means we're going to have to suck up just about every drop of juice east of the Rockies to fire Destiny.
Another EM spike, we're not going to have enough power.
General, you have got to give them more time.
[Tom] There is no more time.
Colonel, call Destiny.
I am launching a formal complaint against you
- with the Department of Defense.
- Rat to Josh.
Go, Rat.
Hey, here's the EM field data that you're primed for.
Digging that, Rat.
Primed for. Primed for.
Prime numbers...
One, two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17...
[typing]
[typing]
Here we go.
[electrical zapping]
[telephone ringing]
[man] James.
[exhales]
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Here we go, folks.
[Josh] OK, this time it's going to work.
Here you go... beautiful. Yeah. Mm-hm.
Come on, baby. Come on,
Daddy wants to see the sky again.
OK, OK, OK. Let's try again.
- Your torque is R, cross F...
- No, your R is too small, Josh.
- Right.
- Wait, hold on.
[Zimsky laughing]
- What are you laughing at?
- No, I mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people
- to come up with the first plan.
- You want to help?
No. I want to turn around and go home.
- It's not going to happen.
- Well, then we're going to die.
- True.
- All right, look
- let's start from square one.
- OK.
Let's start from square one. The bulk modules... depends on density.
Your torque is R cross F, but you have to integrate volume...
But here, here... just consider this.
Now, we got this...
OK, now, R cross F, we're putting put in pi. What's V?
- Oh, for God's sake!
- All right. I'm hitting him again.
No, no, no!
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.
- Are you interested?
- Yes. We're interested.
Then let me smoke a cigarette, and I'll tell you.
- Oh, thank God.
- [Braz whistles]
Hm? All right, fine, look. Look, we have to use wave interference, OK?
Because one explosion won't do it.
Think about stones in a pond.
You drop a large stone into a pond, you get a big splash, and then that's it, it's over.
But drop a smaller stone, wait until the ripples weaken and drop another and another, and another, and fluid dynamics 101.
The ripples reinforce each other in geometric progression.
[Braz] The whole bigger than the sum of the parts.
Then we'll have five
200 megaton explosions...
Instead of one big bang.
- [Josh] So, we hotwire the nukes.
- Yes.
As one does.
We seed them through the core at locations that have to be accurate to the inch.
We detonate them in a sequence that has to be accurate to the millisecond, then we outrun the biggest nuclear shock wave in history.
- Right.
- Yeah.
I mean, that should be fairly simple.
[alarm blaring]
[man 1] ...should now be diverting to the central...
[man 2] Final calibration on both transmission systems...
[indistinct chatter]
[computer beeps]
Cut the... cut the rouge.
The red wire above the circuit.
- OK. OK.
- No, no, wait, hold it!
I'm sorry, cut it below.
- [computer beeps]
- I don't know what that means.
[man 1] Extensions A, B.
- [man 2] Here we go.
- [man 1] F, check. Increase power
- to reactors ten through 15.
- We're almost there, folks.
[typing]
[computer beeping]
- [typing]
- [beeping continues]
[Beck] OK, guys we're closing on the inner core.
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.
- Great. Let's start dropping them.
- No. The bombs are not built for these pressures.
That's why they were in that pod.
If you send them out now, out of that casing, they'll be crushed instantly.
- I'm assuming we have a Plan D.
- Plan D is Virgil's compartments.
We put a nuke in each section of Virgil, and then eject the individual sections one at a time. They should stay intact
- long enough for the nuke to go off.
- [groans]
- What?
- Virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.
OK, these are the ejection mechanisms holding each compartment in place, um...
They're all connected by one master hydraulic gear, um, kind of like keys on a key ring.
What we have to do, we have to unlock the piston.
That will release the compartments so the bombs can be jettisoned.
Where's the master gear?
In the crawl space we used to get out earlier.
Well, what the hell is it doing there?
I built the ship in three damn months.
I didn't think I'd be intentionally sabotaging it. I'm sorry!
So one of us has to go in there.
- Correct.
- Into the crawl space
- that has core fluid at 9,000 degrees.
- [Braz] Yes.
Can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
[Braz] We don't have enough at this point.
9,000 degrees.
And our suits are built to withstand...?
- Half that, probably.
- Right. Half that.
So, what you're saying is whoever goes into that crawl space, is not coming back.
- Together.
- Yes, thank you.
Wait.
- On three.
- OK.
One... two... three.
Huh.
Well, I better go on, get myself ready.
No, Braz, wait.
No, Braz. Excuse me.
Just a moment, may I see that?
- No.
- May I? May I?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Magic.
- I mean, Braz, three straws of equal length.
I mean, this is childish.
Let's do it again.
No, we will not do it again. [laughs]
I thought you'd be happy.
No. Not at the expense of you making us look like fools.
He's right. Why do you get dibs on being the hero?
- Because it's my damn ship.
- Oh, that makes perfect sense.
Look, for 20 years, I've done nothing but Virgil, 20 years.
Virgil belongs to me, and I will not let her fail.
I will not. Now if you want to know what's worth dying for... this ship.
Building it instead of imagining it.
If Virgil needs more blood, it will be my blood.
Now I am going to go and get ready.
Good to go.
Beck. Josh.
It's a hell of a boat you built, Braz.
I am really proud to have known you guys.
[Josh] Thank you.
Braz. Edward.
Yes, Conrad?
You're right. It is your ship.
But I wish to God it had been ours.
[whooshing]
[beeping]
The chamber's sealed, Beck.
Ready.
Open the hatch.
[grunts]
[Braz grunting]
[screams]
[sizzling]
Hang on, Braz.
Come on, hang on.
[glass shattering]
[computer beeping]
Manual override is complete!
Braz, we can still get you out of there.
No... Start... start the impeller.
No.
[panting]
We got a job to do. Let's do it.
Let's go.
[man] Magnetic shielding systems are up.
- Power level's 85 per cent.
- [computers beeping]
- Increase power to Reactor ten.
- All personnel should be clear.
- [typing]
- [computer beeps]
[Zimsky, Josh shouting]
[Zimsky] Oh, God! Oh, I'm sorry.
- [both grunting]
- OK, she's down.
[Beck] Approaching the first drop-off point.
We got to be accurate to the second here, boys.
And drop in three-five seconds.
And... timer on.
- Pull it.
- [timer beeping]
Clear... and... ejecting.
[telephone ringing]
- All right. Initiate firing sequence.
- Sir...
It's our last shot, Stick.
- Damn you.
- Damn me? Too late.
[man] Ten, nine, eight...
[Rat] What's that?
Gotcha!
- [man 1] ...four, three, two...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Someone's diverted our energy.
Where the hell's it gone?!
It looks like...
Coney Island.
Your kung fu is not strong.
Well, how long will it take to get it back online?
Well, then get to it!
Oh, hey, General.
Is there something I can do for you?
- Mm.
- [computer game beeping]
- Timer on.
- [timer beeping]
Clear... ejecting.
Ejecting.
Pull it.
All right.
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.
I always wanted to make a splash in nuclear physics.
You know, that energy propagation stuff you were talking about...
- Oh, that was high school physics.
- Yeah, it's not exactly...
I just took the wavelengths from the core fluid off the MRI readings.
- Yeah, and multiplied by 800...
- Six hundred.
Surely you compensated for the MRI bias.
We got to reset the timers!
[Zimsky] It's not the timers!
No! It just won't work.
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!
- What's not enough?
- The last bomb is not enough.
- To complete the wave form.
- Yeah. No.
The last bomb has to be 30 per cent larger.
That's six or seven pounds of plutonium.
Where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
Ahh!
Guys, we got hit by an energy flare.
I can't keep us on course.
Ejecting compartment in 50 seconds.
- No, Beck! No, wait! No! Push it!
- You push it!
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.
- It's got my shoulder! Ahh!
- Push!
Guys! Clear!
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?
I think the flare has knocked the come out.
- I can't get it, Josh. I can't get it.
- Go...
- I can't.
- OK.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Can you hear me?
I'm correcting course. Now!
[shouts, grunts]
Zimsky!
No!
[groaning]
- Push it!
- [both grunting]
Ejecting compartment in ten seconds. Can you hear me?
Josh, go! Go! Go!
Get out! Get out!
Now! Get out! Now! Go!
[panting]
Josh.
For the last bomb, to make it larger,
use the fuel rods from the react...
[BGCK] Ejecting.
[groans]
I got to get... I got to...
Beck.
Beck, can you hear me?
Beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now.
We've only have three minutes to eject this one. Beck!
Come on, guys. I can't hear you.
Beck.
[beeping]
[alarm blares]
- [sizzling]
- [grunts]
[straining]
[groaning]
[sizzling]
[cries out]
Oh!
[beeps]
[beeping]
Josh, come on.
- Are you OK?
- [panting]
- Are you OK?
- Will you take my gloves off?
- Oh, my God.
- Please.
[both wincing]
I had to build the blast.
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on, let me get...
No. Stay here for one second.
I was trying to call you.
- I know. The coms were down.
- Right.
- I know what you did.
- We don't have enough energy...
- I know.
- ...to get back.
You did good.
I would've done the same thing.
Where's Zimsky?
Come here.
You did good.
You did good.
[exhales] One minute to the first detonation.
And 12 until the blast hits us.
I was hoping we'd suffocate to death first.
[beeping]
Beck.
Beck, Beck.
What could you do if I got you enough power to fire the impeller?
Maybe not the laser, but the impeller.
- What? From where?
- The heat of the core.
It's 9,000 degrees.
Unobtanium converts heat to energy.
So this whole damn ship is like a big old solar panel.
Come on, I need your help.
- Number two's going!
- Come on, come on.
For here in the great infinite unknowable...
...man can come to know the most important thing of all:
Himself.
He can understand...
What the fuck am I doing?
[chuckles]
- [man 1] We've got full rotation!
- [man 2] It's turning!
[cheering]
All right!
[cheering continues]
[Josh] Come on, Beck, where is it?
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
Is that the last one?
Yeah.
Give it a couple seconds.
- [zap]
- [beeping]
It worked!
Get ready to pull a few G's.
- Four hundred twenty knots.
- Now, this is more like it.
Four-forty.
Mr. Rat, what's the centre of this quake?
It's everywhere!
It's one giant shock wave!
The planet's healing itself.
At this speed, we're going to be home in a third of the time.
As long as we can surf these magma flows, we'll be OK.
Let's just pray we don't run into any dead ends, or we're going to miss those lasers.
OK, navigator, which way?
We've got greater flow density on the left.
Go with the flow.
- [beeping]
- Bill, where are they headed?
Looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near Hawaii.
- Josh...
- Yeah?
They're closing in on us too fast.
- I don't know if I can...
- Beck, you got it.
[beeping]
Um... [stammers]
We lost them, Stick, and I...
[Beck] Where'd our power go?
[Josh] We were powered by the heat.
It's stone cold down here.
Well...
Look on the bright side.
At least we're not going to boil to death.
- You always look on the bright side?
- Always.
OK, let's assess:
We've got no communications, we're probably 800 feet down, but we might as well be 800 miles.
We're in an Unobtanium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock.
We've got just enough power to make the ultrasonics burp, but no one's listening on those frequencies anyway, and...
...nobody even knows we're alive.
OK.
Give me a minute on this one.
This is hopeless.
Come on, General, we've got to be getting close. We can't...
Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive, there's no way they could contact us.
[telephone rings]
Bridge.
Skipper, Combat relays that our sub has something on the sonar.
- Where do they think?
- Bill, put it up on the hydrophone.
[whale sounds]
Whales, sir.
They're a long way off their usual path, but that's not uncommon since that...
What are they calling it?
Orbital wobble?
Yeah, that's what they call it.
Well, thank you very much, Captain, but I think we're done here.
General.
J.O., this is the captain.
Stand down from SAR Operations.
It's whales! It's whales!
Hey! General! Stick!
It's whales! The ultrasonics!
They're singing to them!
You gotta find the whales!
[man] Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.
I'm changing...
Hold on, I'm seeing those whales now.
Whoa! OK, ball's in the water.
This is neat. Those whales are circling something.
Hold on, hold on.
We have a strong echo here.
Depth, 800 feet.
There's something down there.
There's definitely something down there.
I told you pulsing the ultrasonics would work.
Do you ever get tired of being right?
Yes.
So, what's next for you?
- A shower.
- [laughs]
Then back to NASA, I guess.
You?
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza, green peppers, onions,
- extra mushrooms, then a shower...
- Mmm.
...and then back to the classroom.
NASA could use a few good men, you know.
Yeah. Unfortunately, so could my freshmen geophysics students.
You know what makes me really, really angry?
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...
No one's going to ever know what they did or why they died.
Unless... it all got out somehow.
- That's unthinkable.
- Yeah.
[chattering]
[cracks knuckles] OK, here we go.
[beeping]
- [all computers beeping]
- [people murmuring]
Sweet.
[woman] It is now emerging that the world owes its survival
to the heroism of six remarkable individuals:
- Shuttle Commander Robert Iverson...
- [man 1] This extraordinary craft...
[woman] ...French Scientist,
Dr. Serge...
[man 1] ...was captained by NASA astronaut Dr. Bob Iverson.
[man 2] Edward Brazzelton is a name...
[man 3] ...Dr. Conrad Zimsky will be best remembered...
[man 4] On Capitol Hill today, everyone's asking the same question:
What is Project Destiny?
[reporters overlapping]
Destiny, meet world.
World, meet Destiny.
[man] Dr. Brazzelton, Dr. Zimsky...
